        "wiki": "Dougga or Thugga or TBGG was a Berber, Punic and Roman settlement near present-day T\u00e9boursouk in northern Tunisia. The current archaeological site covers 65 hectares (160 acres). UNESCO qualified Dougga as a World Heritage Site in 1997, believing that it represents \"the best-preserved Roman small town in North Africa\". The site, which lies in the middle of the countryside, has been protected from the encroachment of modern urbanization, in contrast, for example, to Carthage, which has been pillaged and rebuilt on numerous occasions. Dougga's size, its well-preserved monuments and its rich Numidian-Berber, Punic, ancient Roman and Byzantine history make it exceptional. Amongst the most famous monuments at the site are a Libyco-Punic Mausoleum, the Capitol, the Roman theatre, and the temples of Saturn and of Juno Caelestis.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe Punic name of the settlement is recorded as tbgg (\ud802\udd15\ud802\udd01\u202c\ud802\udd02\u202c\ud802\udd02\u202c) and tbg\u02bfg (\ud802\udd15\ud802\udd01\u202c\ud802\udd02\ud802\udd0f\u202c\ud802\udd02).The Root B GG in Phoenician means (\"in the roof terrace\").  Camps states that this may represent a borrowing of a Berber word derived from the root tbg (\"to protect\"). This evidently derives from the site's position atop an easily defensible plateau. The name was borrowed into Latin as Thugga. Once it was granted \"free status\", it was formally refounded and known as Municipium Septimium Aurelium Liberum Thugga; \"Septimium\" and \"Aurelium\" are references to the \"new\" town's \"founders\" (conditores), Septimius Severus and M. Aurelius Antoninus (i.e., Caracalla). For treatment of liberum, see below. Once Dougga received the status of a Roman colony, it was formally known as Colonia Licinia Septimia Aurelia Alexandriana Thuggensis.\nIn present-day Berber, it is known as either Dugga or Tugga. That was borrowed into Arabic as Dogg\u0101 (Arabic: \u062f\u06a8\u0629\u200e or \u062f\u0642\u0629) and Dougga is a French transcription of this Arabic name.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe archaeological site is located 4.6 km (2.9 mi) SSW of the modern town of T\u00e9boursouk on a plateau with an uninhibited view of the surrounding plains in the Oued Khalled. The site offers a high degree of natural protection, which helps to explain its early occupation. The slope on which Dougga is built rises to the north and is bordered in the east by the cliff known as Kef Dougga. Further to the east, the ridge of the Fossa Regia, a ditch and boundary made by the Romans after the destruction of Carthage, indicates Dougga's position as a point of contact between the Punic and Berber worlds.\n\n\n== History ==\nDougga's history is best known from the time of the Roman conquest, even though numerous pre-Roman monuments, including a necropolis, a mausoleum, and several temples have been discovered during archaeological digs. These monuments are an indication of the site's importance before the arrival of the Romans.\n\n\n=== Berber Kingdom ===\n\nThe city appears to have been founded in the 6th century BC. Some historians believe that Dougga is the city of Tocae (Greek: \u03a4\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03af, Toka\u00ed), which was captured by a lieutenant of Agathocles of Syracuse at the end of the 4th century BC; Diodorus of Sicily described Tocae as \"a city of beautiful grandeur\".Dougga was in any case an early and important human settlement. Its urban character is evidenced by the presence of a necropolis with dolmens, the most ancient archaeological find at Dougga, a sanctuary dedicated to Ba'al Hammon, neo-Punic steles, a mausoleum, architectural fragments, and a temple dedicated to Masinissa, the remains of which were found during archaeological excavations. Even though our knowledge of the city before the Roman conquest remains very limited, recent archaeological finds have revolutionized the image that we had of this period.\nThe identification of the temple dedicated to Masinissa beneath the forum disproved Louis Poinssot's theory that the Numidian city stood on the plateau but that it was separate from the newer Roman settlement. The temple, which was erected in the tenth year of Micipsa's reign (139 BC), is 14 m \u00d7 6.3 m (46 ft \u00d7 21 ft) wide. It proves that the area around the forum was already built upon before the arrival of the Roman colonists. A building dating to the 2nd century BC has also been discovered nearby. Similarly, Dougga's mausoleum is not isolated but stands within an urban necropolis.\nRecent finds have disproved earlier theories about the so-called \"Numidian walls\". The walls around Dougga are in fact not Numidian; they are part of the city's fortifications erected in late antiquity. Targeted digs have also proven that what had been interpreted as two Numidian towers in the walls are in fact two funeral monuments from the Numidian era reused much later as foundations and a section of defences.The discovery of Libyan and Punic inscriptions at the site provoked a debate on the administration of the city at the time of the Kingdom of Numidia. The debate\u2014about the interpretation of epigraphic sources\u2014focussed on the question of whether the city was still under Punic influence or whether it was increasingly Berber. Local Berber institutions distinct from any form of Punic authority arose from the Numidian period onwards, but Camps notes that Punic shofets were still in place in several cities, including Dougga, during the Roman era, which is a sign of continuing Punic influence and the preservation of certain elements of Punic civilization well after the fall of Carthage.\n\n\n=== Roman Empire ===\n\nThe Romans granted Dougga the status of an indigenous city (Latin: civitas) following their conquest of the region.The creation of the colony of Carthage during the reign of Augustus complicated Dougga's institutional status. The city was included in the territory (pertica) of the Roman colony, but around this time, a community (pagus) of Roman colonists also arose alongside the existing settlement. For two centuries, the site was thus governed by two civic and institutional bodies: the city with its peregrini and the pagus with its Roman citizens. Both had Roman civic institutions: magistrates and a council (ordo) of decurions for the city, a local council from the end of the 1st century AD, and local administrators for the pagus, who were legally subordinated to the distant but powerful colony of Carthage. In addition, epigraphic evidence indicates that a Punic-style dual magistracy, the sufetes, achieved some civic stature here well into the imperial period. In fact, the city once had three magistrates serve at once, a relative rarity in the Mediterranean.Over time, the romanization of the city brought the two communities closer together. Notable members of the peregrini increasingly adopted Roman culture and behavior, became Roman citizens, and the councils of the two communities began to take decisions in unison. The increasing closeness of the communities was facilitated at first by their geographic proximity\u2014there was no physical distinction between their two settlements\u2014and then later by institutional arrangements. During the reign of Marcus Aurelius, the city was granted Roman law; from this moment onward, the magistrates automatically received Roman citizenship and the rights of the city's inhabitants became similar to those of the Roman citizens. During the same era, the pagus won a certain degree of autonomy from Carthage; it was able to receive bequests and administer public funds.\nNonetheless, it was not until AD 205, during the reign of Septimius Severus, that the two communities came together as one municipality (municipium), made \"free\" (see below) while Carthage's pertica was reduced. The city was supported by the euergetism of its great families of wealthy individuals, which sometimes reached exorbitant levels, while its interests were successfully represented by appeals to the emperors. Dougga's development culminated during the reign of Gallienus, when it obtained the status of a separate Roman colony.\nDougga's monuments attest to its prosperity in the period from the reign of Diocletian to that of Theodosius I, but it fell into a sort of stupor from the 4th century. The city appears to have experienced an early decline, as evidenced by the relatively poor remains of Christianity. The period of Byzantine rule saw the area around the forum transformed into a fort; several important buildings were destroyed in order to provide the necessary materials for its construction.\n\n\n=== Caliphate ===\nDougga was never completely abandoned following the Muslim invasions of the area. For a long time, Dougga remained the site of a small village populated by the descendants of the city's former inhabitants, as evidenced by the small mosque situated in the Temple of August Piety and the small bath dating to the Aghlabid period on the southern flank of the forum.\n\n\n=== Archaeological work ===\nThe first Western visitors to have left eyewitness accounts of the ruins reached the site in the 17th century. This trend continued in the 18th century and at the start of the 19th century. The best-preserved monuments, including the mausoleum, were described and, at the end of this period, were the object of architectural studies.\nThe establishment of France's Tunisian protectorate in 1881 led to the creation of a national antiquities institute (French: Institut national du patrimoine), for which the excavation of the site at Dougga was a priority from 1901, parallel to the works carried out at Carthage. The works at Dougga concentrated at first on the area around the forum; other discoveries ensured that there was an almost constant series of digs at the site until 1939. Alongside these excavations, work was conducted to restore the capitol, of which only the front and the base of the wall of the cella were still standing, and to restore the mausoleum, particularly between 1908 and 1910 .After Tunisia's independence, other buildings were excavated, including the Temple of Caracalla's Victory in Germany. During the same period, the last inhabitants of the site were evicted and relocated to a village located on the plain several kilometers from the antique site, which is named New Dougga. In 1991, the decision was taken to make the site into a national archaeological park. A cooperative scientific programme aims in particular to promote the study of the inscriptions at the site and the pagan temples. In 1997, Dougga was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.\nDespite its importance and its exceptional state, Dougga remains off the beaten track for many tourists and receives only about 50,000 visitors per year. In order to make it more attractive, the construction of an on-site museum is being considered, while the national antiquities institute has established a website presenting the site and the surrounding region. For the time being, visitors with sufficient time can appreciate Dougga, not only because of its many ruins but also for its olive groves, which give the site a unique ambiance.\n\n\n== Dougga's \"Liberty\" ==\n\nFrom AD 205, when the city (civitas) and community (pagus) fused into one municipality (municipium), Dougga bore the title liberum, whose significance is not immediately clear. The term appears in the titles of a certain number of other municipia also founded at the same time: Thibursicum Bure, Aulodes, and Thysdrus. Several interpretations of its meaning have been suggested. According to Merlin and Poinssot, the term derives from the name of the god Liber, in whose honor a temple was erected at Dougga. The epithet Liberum would thus follow the same pattern as Frugifer and Concordia, which appear in the title of Thibursicum Bure. Thibursicum Bure is however an exception to the rule; the titles of the other municipia including the term liberum do not include the names of any divinities, and this hypothesis has therefore been abandoned. Alternatively, liberum is taken as a reference to free status (libertas, \"liberty\"). This interpretation is confirmed by an inscription found at Dougga that honors Alexander Severus as the \"preserver of liberty\" (conservator libertatis).It is, however, unclear exactly what form this liberty took. Toutain is of the opinion that this is a designation for a particular type of municipium\u2014free cities where the Roman governor did not have the right to control the municipal magistrates. There is however no evidence that Dougga enjoyed exceptional legal privileges of the type associated with certain free cities such as Aphrodisias in Asia Minor. Veyne has thus suggested that Dougga's \"freedom\" is nothing but an expression of the concept of liberty without any legal meaning; obtaining the status of a municipium had freed the city of its subjugation and enabled it to adorn itself with the \"ornaments of liberty\" (ornamenta libertatis). The city's liberty was celebrated just as its dignity was extolled; the emperor Probus is a \"preserver of liberty and dignity\" (conservator libertatis et dignitatis). Gascou, in line with Veyne's interpretation, describes the situation thus: \"Liberum, in Thugga's title, is a term [\u2026] with which the city, which had waited a long time for the status of a municipium, is happy to flatter itself\".\n\nDespite Gascou's conclusion, efforts have been made more recently to identify concrete aspects of Dougga's liberty. Lepelley believes on the one hand that this must be a reference to the relations between the city and Rome and on the other hand that the term can cover a range of diverse privileges of differing degrees. It is known that the territory of Carthage, to which the Dougga pagus belonged until AD 205, enjoyed such privileges: the inhabitants of the pagus even sent an appeal during Trajan\u2019s reign to defend the fiscal immunity of the territory of Carthage (immunitas perticae Carthaginiensium). The Dougga civitas had not been granted this concession, so the fusion of pagus with the civitas meant that the citizens of the pagus risked losing their enviable privilege. The liberty of the municipia founded during the reign of Septimius Severus could thus be a reference to the fiscal immunity made possible by the region\u2019s great wealth and by the emperor\u2019s generosity to each municipium at the time of its fusion. During the reign of Gallienus, a certain Aulus Vitellius Felix Honoratus, a well-known individual in Dougga, made an appeal to the emperor \"in order to assure the public liberty\". Lepelley believes that this is an indication that the city's privilege had been called into question, although Dougga appears to have been at least partially able to preserve its concessions, as evidenced by an inscription to the honor of \"Probus, defender of its liberty\".According to Christol though, this interpretation overly restricts the meaning of the word libertas. In Christol's view, it is important not to forget that the emperor's decision in 205 must have been taken in response to a request made by the civitas and must have taken account of the relations that already existed between it and the pagus. It was the autonomy that the civitas had achieved during the reign of Marcus Aurelius and the granting of Roman law that raised the specter of a fusion of the two communities, which would without a doubt have provoked a certain unease in the pagus. The inhabitants of the pagus would have expressed \"concern or even refusal when faced with the pretensions of their closest neighbors\". This would explain the honor that the pagus attributed to Commodus (conservator pagi, \"protector of the community\").For Christol, the term liberum must be understood in this context and in an abstract sense. This liberty derives from belonging to a city and expresses the end of the civitas's dependence, \"the elevation of a community of peregrini to the liberty of Roman citizenship\", which also served to placate the fears of the inhabitants of the pagus and to open the door to a later promotion, to the status of a colony. This promotion took place in AD 261, during the reign of Gallienus, following an appeal from Aulus Vitellius Felix Honoratus in Christol's version of events. Thereafter, the defence of the libertas publica was not a question of defending a privilege at risk, but of requesting the \"ultimate liberty\" (summa libertas)\u2014the promotion to the status of a colony. Christol also points out that, despite the abstract character of terms such as libertas or dignitas, their formal appearance should be references to concrete and unique events.\n\n\n== General layout ==\n\nThe city as it exists today consists essentially of remains from the Roman era dating for the most part to the 2nd and 3rd century. The Roman builders had to take account both of the site's particularly craggy terrain and of earlier constructions, which led them to abandon the normal layout of Roman settlements, as is also particularly evident in places such as Timgad.\nRecent archaeological digs have confirmed the continuity in the city's urban development. The heart of the city has always been at the top of the hill, where the forum replaced the Numidian agora. As Dougga developed, urban construction occupied the side of the hill, so that the city must have resembled \"a compact mass\", according to H\u00e9di SlimEarly archaeological digs concentrated on public buildings, which meant that private buildings tended at first to be uncovered at the ends of the trenches dug for this purpose. Later, trenches were cut with the purpose of exposing particularly characteristic private buildings.\n\n\n=== Numidian residence ===\nTraces of a residence dating to the Numidian era have been identified in the foundations of the temple dedicated to Liber. Although these traces are very faint, they served to disprove the theories of the first archaeologists, including Louis Poinssot, that the Roman and pre-Roman settlements were located on separate sites. The two settlements evidently overlapped.\n\n\n=== The trifolium villa ===\n\nThis residence, which dates to the 2nd or 3rd century, stands downhill from the quarters that surround the forum and the principal public monuments in the city, in an area where the streets are winding.The trifolium villa, named after a clover-shaped room that was without a doubt used as a triclinium, is the largest private house excavated so far at Dougga. The house had two storeys, but there is almost nothing left of the upper storey. It stands in the south of the city, halfway up the hill. The house is particularly interesting because of the way in which it is built to align with the lay of the land; the entrance hall slopes down to a courtyard around which the various rooms were arranged.\n\n\n=== The market ===\n\nThe market dates from the middle of the 1st century. It took the form of a square 35.5 m \u00d7 28 m (116 ft \u00d7 92 ft) in size, surrounded by a portico and shops on two sides. The northern side had a portico, while an exedra occupied the southern side. The exedra probably housed a statue of Mercury.In order to compensate for the natural incline of the ground on which the market stands, its builders undertook significant earthworks. These earthworks have been dated as being amongst the oldest Roman constructions, and their orientation vis-\u00e0-vis the forum seems to suggest that they were not built on any earlier foundations. The modern-day location of the remains from the market near the forum should however not be misunderstood as indicating a link between the two. The market was almost completely destroyed during the construction of the Byzantine fort. It was excavated in 1918-1919.\n\n\n=== Licinian Baths ===\nThe Licinian Baths are interesting for having much of its original walls intact, as well as a long tunnel used by the slaves working at the baths. The baths were donated to the city by the Licinii family in the 3rd century. They were primarily used as winter baths. The frigidarium  has triple arcades at both ends and large windows with views over the valley beyond.\n\n\n== Funerary structures ==\n\n\n=== Dolmens ===\n\nThe presence of dolmens in North Africa has served to stoke historiographic debates that have been said to have ideological agendas. The dolmens at Dougga have been the subject of archaeological digs, which have also uncovered skeletons and ceramic models.\nAlthough it is difficult to put a date on the erection of the dolmens, as they were in use until the dawn of the Christian era, it seems likely that they date from at least 2000 years BC. Gabriel Camps has suggested that a link to Sicily. He has made the same suggestion for the \"haouanet\" tombs found in Algeria and Tunisia.\n\n\n=== Numidian bazina tombs ===\n\nA type of tomb unique to the Numidian world has been discovered at Dougga. They are referred to as bazina tombs or circular monument tombs.\n\n\n=== Punic-Libyan Mausoleum ===\n\nThe Mausoleum of Ateban is one of the very rare examples of royal Numidian architecture. There is another in Sabratha in Libya. Some authors believe that there is a link with the funeral architecture in Anatolia and the necropoleis in Alexandria from the 3rd and 2nd century BC.This tomb is 21 m (69 ft) tall and was built in the 2nd century BC. A bilingual inscription installed in the mausoleum mentioned that the tomb was dedicated to Ateban, the son of Iepmatath and Palu. In 1842, Sir Thomas Reade, the British consul in Tunis seriously damaged the monument while removing this inscription. This bilingual Punic-Libyan Inscription, now held at the British Museum, made it possible to decode the Libyan characters. It has only recently been established that the inscription was originally located on one side of a fake window on the podium. According to the most recent research, the names cited in the inscription are only those of its architect and of representatives of the different professions involved in its construction. The monument was built by the inhabitants of the city for a Numidian prince; some authors believe that it was intended for Massinissa The monument owes its current appearance to the work of French archaeologist Louis Poinssot, who essentially reconstructed it from pieces that were left lying on the ground. The tomb is accessed via a pedestal with five steps. On the northern side of the podium (the lowest of three levels in the monument), there is an opening to the funeral chamber that is closed with a stone slab. The other sides are decorated with fake windows and four Aeolic pilasters. The second level is made up of a temple-like colonnade (naiskos); the columns on each side are Ionic. The third level is the most richly decorated of all: in addition to pilasters similar to those on the lowest level, it is capped with a pyramid. Some elements of carved stone have also survived.\n\n\n=== Roman sepulchres ===\n\nAlthough work has in the past been undertaken to uncover the Roman sepulchres, today they have been reclaimed in part by olive trees.\n\nThe different necropoleis mark the zones of settlement at Dougga. There are five areas that have been identified as necropoleis: the first in the northeast, around the Temple of Saturn and the Victoria Church, the second in the northwest, a zone which also encompasses the dolmens on the site, the third in the west, between the A\u00efn Mizeb and A\u00efn El Hammam cisterns and to the north of the Temple of Juno Caelestis, the fourth and the fifth in the south and the south-east, one around the mausoleum and the other around Septimius Severus\u2019 triumphal arch.\n\n\n=== Hypogeum ===\nThe hypogeum is a half-buried edifice from the 3rd century. It was erected in the middle of the oldest necropolis, which was excavated in 1913. The hypogeum was designed to house funeral urns in small niches in the walls; at the time of its discovery, it contained sarcophagi, which suggests that it was in use for a long time.\n\n\n== Political monuments ==\n\n\n=== Triumphal arches ===\n\nDougga still contains two triumphal arches, which are in different states of disrepair.\n\nSeptimius Severus\u2019s arch, which is heavily damaged, stands close to the mausoleum and on the route leading from Carthage to Th\u00e9veste. It was erected in AD 205.\nAlexander Severus' arch, which dates from 222-235, is relatively well preserved, despite the loss of its upper elements. It is equidistant from the capitol and the Temple of Juno Caelestis. Its arcade is 4 m (13 ft) tall.A third triumphal arch, dating from the Tetrarchy, has been completely lost.\n\n\n=== Forum ===\n\nThe city forum, which is 924 m2 (9,950 sq ft) in size is small. It is better preserved in some places than others, because the construction of the Byzantine fort damaged a large section of it. The capitol, which stands on an area surrounded by porticos, dominates its surroundings by virtue of its imposing appearance. The \"square of the Rose of the Winds\" (which is named after a decorative element) seems more like an esplanade leading to the Temple of Mercury, which stands on its northern side, than an open public space. The city's curia and a tribune for speeches probably also stood here.Long ago, archaeologists believed that Roman settlement at Dougga occurred ex nihilo. This suggestion has been contradicted by the discovery of a sanctuary dedicated to Massinissa amongst the substructures to the rear of the capitol.\n\n\n== Recreational facilities ==\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nRoman theatres were a fundamental element of the monumental make-up of a city from the reign of Augustus.The theatre, which was built in AD 168 or 169, is one of the best preserved examples in Roman Africa. It could seat 3500 spectators, even though Dougga only had 5000 inhabitants. It was one of a series of imperial buildings constructed over the course of two centuries at Dougga which deviate from the classic \"blueprints\" only inasmuch as they have been adapted to take account of the local terrain. Some minor adjustments have been made and the local architects had a certain freedom with regard to the ornamentation of the buildings.\n\nA dedication engraved into the pediment of the stage and on the portico the dominates the city, recalls the building's commissioner, P. Marcius Quadratus, who \"built [it] for his homeland with his own denarii\"; the dedication was celebrated with \"scenic representations, distributions of life, a festival and athletic games\".\nThe theater is still used for performances of classic theater, particularly during the festival of Dougga, and conservation work has been carried out on it.\n\n\n=== Auditorium ===\nThe site known as the auditorium is an annex of the Temple of Liber, which probably served for the initiation of novices. Despite its modern appellation, the auditorium was not a site for spectacles; only its form suggests otherwise. It measures 20 m \u00d7 20 m (66 ft \u00d7 66 ft).\n\n\n=== Circus ===\n\nThe city has a circus designed for chariot racing, but it is barely visible nowadays. Originally, the circus consisted of nothing more than a field; an inscription in the temple in honor of Caracalla's victory in Germany notes that the land was donated by the Gabinii in 214 and describes it as an ager qui appellatur circus (field that serves as a circus) ) \u00b7 . In 225 though, the site was prepared and the circus was constructed. It was financed by the magistrates (duumviri and aedile) after they had promised to do so following in response to a request from the entire population of the city. The circus was built to take the maximum possible advantage of the surrounding landscape, in reflection of an understandable need to limit costs in a medium-sized city with limited resources, but certainly also out of desire to finish the construction works as quickly as possible, given that magistrates\u2019 mandates were limited to one year. The construction was nonetheless expected to have \"a certain magnitude\"; at 393 m (1,289 ft) long with a spina 190 m \u00d7 6 m (623 ft \u00d7 20 ft), the circus is quite extraordinary in Roman Africa. The circus marks Dougga out as one of the most important cities in the province, alongside Carthage, Thysdrus, Leptis Magna, Hadrumet et Utica. The donation of the land for the pleasure of the general populace (ad voluptatem populi) and its development following a request from the entire population (postulante universo populo) are a reminder of the importance of spectacles in the social life of Roman cities and the demand for popular entertainment.\n\n\n=== Amphitheater ===\nThe question of whether there was an amphitheater at Dougga has not been conclusively answered. Traditionally, a large elliptic depression to the northwest of the site has been interpreted as the site of an amphitheater. Archeologists have however become much more cautious on this subject.\n\n\n=== Baths ===\n\nThree Roman baths have been completely excavated at Dougga; a fourth has so far only been partially uncovered. Of these four baths, one (\"the bath of the house to the west of the Temple of Tellus\") belongs to a private residence, two, the A\u00efn Doura bath and the bath known for a long time as the \"Licinian bath\", were, judging by their size, open to the public, while the nature of the last bath, the bath of the Cyclopses, is more difficult to interpret.\n\n\n==== Bath of the Cyclopses ====\nDuring the excavation of the Bath of the Cyclopses, a mosaic of cyclopses forging Jupiter\u2019s thunderbolts was uncovered. It is now on display at the Bardo National Museum, where several very well preserved latrines are also on display. The building has been dated to the 3rd century CE on the basis of a study of the mosaic.\nThe size of the building (its frigidarium is less than 30 m2 (320 sq ft)) has led some experts to believe that it was a private bath, but the identification of a domus in the immediate vicinity has proven difficult. The \"trifolium villa\" is quite distant, and the closest ruins are hard to identify as they have not been well preserved. Yvon Th\u00e9bert therefore suggests that the bath served the local quarter.\n\n\n==== Antonian or Licinian Bath ====\n\nThe Antonian Bath, which dates from the 3rd century, was known as the Licinian Baths (after emperor Publius Licinius Egnatius Gallienus) and has several storeys. Louis Poinssot's identification of the bath as dating to Gallienus\u2019 reign on the basis of incomplete inscriptions and Dougga's prosperity at this time has been called into question by recent research, conducted in particular by Michel Christol. Christol has suggested that the bath dates from the reign of Caracalla; this thesis has since been confirmed by an analysis of inscriptions. Others have even suggested that the bath dates from the reign of the Severan dynasty, because of a particularity which became common a century later in the west: the columns in the northwest peristyle feature daises bearing arches.The bath was later used for the production of olive oil at an unknown date.The symmetrical building is medium-sized, with an area of 1,700 m2 (18,000 sq ft) excluding the palaestra, of which 175 m2 (1,880 sq ft) are taken up by the frigidarium. The construction of the bath required work both to lower and to raise sections of the slope on which it stood, which may explain why parts of the building have been better preserved than others; the section built on raised ground has for the most part been lost.\n\n\n==== A\u00efn Doura Baths ====\n\nIn the immediate vicinity of A\u00efn Doura is a partially excavated complex that could turn out to be the largest bath in the city, the A\u00efn Doura Baths. On the basis of the mosaics that have been found here, it has been suggested that the bath dates from the end of the 2nd century or the start of the 3rd century, and that the mosaic d\u00e9cor was renewed in the 4th century CE.The complex remains largely unexposed, but it seems, according to Yvon Th\u00e9bert, that it has a symmetrical design, of which only a section of the cold rooms has been excavated.\n\n\n==== The bath of the house to the west of the Temple of Tellus ====\nThis bath, measuring 75 m2 (810 sq ft), which can be accessed from the house and from the street, was uncovered at the start of the 20th century. The archaeological analysis of the bath's relationship with the house in which it is located has led Th\u00e9bert to suggest that it was a later addition to the original construction but he does not propose a date for this event.\n\n\n== Religious edifices ==\nThere is archaeological or epigraphic evidence for more than twenty temples at Dougga; a significant number for a small city. There are archaeological remains and inscriptions proving the existence of eleven temples, archaeological remains of a further eight, and inscriptions referring to another fourteen. This abundance of religious sites is the result in particular of the philanthropy of wealthy families.\n\n\n=== Temple of Massinissa ===\nThe Temple of Massinissa is located on the western flank of the capital. The first archaeologists believed that the remains of the temple were a monumental fountain, even though an inscription proving the existence of a sanctuary to the deceased Numidian king was discovered in 1904. This inscription has been dated to 139 BC, during the reign of Micipsa.The remains are similar to those of the temple in Chemtou and are evidence of the fact that the political center of the Roman city was in the same place as the Hellenic agora. The stone remains found in this area seem to belong to several different structures; the exact location of the sanctuary is still open to debate.Although it is believed that the sanctuary set Massinissa on par with a god, this is debated by some experts. Gsell believes that a temple to the king would reflect a continuation of eastern and Hellenic practices; Camps builds on this hypothesis, pointing out the lack of any antique sources testifying to anything more than simple expressions of respect by a people vis-\u00e0-vis its king. According to Camps, the temple is only a memorial, a site belonging to a funeral cult. Its construction ten years into Micipsa\u2019s reign can be explained by its political symbolism: Micipsa, sole ruler after the death of his brothers Gulussa and Mastanabal, was affirming the unity of his kingdom around the person of the king.\n\n\n=== The Capitol ===\n\nThe Capitol is a Roman temple from the 2nd century, principally dedicated to Rome\u2019s protective triad: Jupiter Best and Greatest (Jupiter Optimus Maximus), Juno the Queen (Juno Regina), and Minerva the August (Minerva Augusta). It has a secondary dedication to the wellbeing of the emperors Lucius Verus and Marcus Aurelius; judging by this reference, the Capitol must have been completed in AD 166-167.Thomas d\u2019Arcos identified the Capitol as a temple of Jupiter in the 17th century. It was the object of further research at the end of the 19th century, led in particular by the doctor Louis Carton in 1893. The walls, executed in opus africanum style, and the entablature of the portico were restored between 1903 and 1910. Claude Poinssot discovered a crypt beneath the cella in 1955. The most recent works were carried out by the Tunisian Institut national du patrimoine between 1994 and 1996.The Capitol is exceptionally well preserved, which is a consequence of its inclusion in the Byzantine fortification. A series of eleven stairs lead up to the front portico. The temple front's Corinthian columns are 8 m (26 ft) tall, on top of which is the perfectly preserved pediment. The pediment bears a depiction of emperor Antoninus Pius\u2019s elevation to godhood. The emperor is being carried by an eagle.The base of the cella still features alcoves for three statues. The middle alcove houses a colossal statue of Jupiter.The discovery of the head of a statue of Jupiter has led Poinssot to suggest that the crypt dates from the period of Christianity\u2019s triumph over the old religions. St-Amans does not exclude the possibility that the crypt was built at the same time as the Byzantine citadel, of which the forum and capitol formed the nerve center.\nThe construction of the Capitol at Dougga occurred at the same time as the construction of other monuments of the same type elsewhere in North Africa, which Gros explains as a consequence of the greater proximity of the imperial cult and the cult of Jupiter.Near the Capitol are the \"square of the Rose of the Winds\"\u2014which is named after a compass rose that is engraved on the floor\u2014and the remains of the Byzantine citadel, which reused a section of the ruins after the city's decline.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Temple of Mercury ===\n\nThe Temple of Mercury is also dedicated to Tellus. It faces towards the market; between the two lies the \"square of the Rose of the Winds\". The temple is largely in ruins. It has three cellae but no courtyard. The sanctuary, which can be accessed via a series of four stairs, stands on a faded podium. It was excavated and shored up between 1904 and 1908.\n\n\n=== Temple of August Piety ===\n\nThe small Temple of August Piety was built during the reign of Hadrian. It was financed through the philanthropy of a certain Caius Pompeius Nahanius. The temple faces the \"square of the Rose of the Winds\". Part of the vestibule survives. Behind the temple, on the foundations of the Temple of Fortuna, Venus Concordia and Mercury, stands a mosque. The mosque is the last remnant of the little village that existed on the site until the creation of New Dougga.D'Arcos identified the temple in 1631 thanks to an inscription that was still in place at the time. The podium is relatively low (1\u20131.5 m or 3 ft 3 in\u20134 ft 11 in); it can be ascended by a series of seven stairs on the southern side.\n\n\n=== Temple of Minerva ===\n\nThe first Temple of Minerva at Dougga was a gift of the patron of the civitas at the end of the 1st century, but the more important site dedicated to this divinity is a building which features a temple and an area surrounded by a portico dating from the reign of Antoninus Pius. It was financed through the philanthropy of a priestess of the imperial cult, Julia Paula Laenatiana. The building was designed to take advantage of the slope on which it stands; the podium is at the level of the roof of the portico and the temple in the strict sense of the word is located outside the surrounding building. The stairs providing access to the temple accentuates the inaccessible nature of the divinity.\n\n\n=== Temple of Caracalla's Victory in Germany ===\n\nThe Temple of Caracalla's Victory in Germany is the only edifice dedicated to the imperial cult to have been located precisely at Dougga. Fragments of an inscription on the temple's lintel were discovered in 1835, but the temple was not identified until 1966. It features a nymphaeum that dates to the reign of Commodus.The temple, which is relatively narrow, has an unusual design. It is 41.5 m \u00d7 14.2 m (136 ft \u00d7 47 ft), and is situated beside the road that descends from the forum to the A\u00efn Doura Bath. The temple is associated with a triumphal arch over the road. The temple can be accessed via a semi-circular staircase; in each corner of the courtyard in front of the staircase is a reservoir for rain water. The cella inside the sanctuary features six lateral niches which are designed to hold the bases of statues of Apollo, Liber, Neptune, Mercury and of two other gods that can no longer be identified.\nThe temple can be seen from afar, but passers-by can only see the cella, the foundations of which are decoratively rusticated. Seven columns are spaced along the cella, linking to the lateral door, which opens onto the staircase. The tetrastyle temple is built in Tuscan order in antis. The temple's design is unusual inasmuch as temples of the imperial cult are generally Corinthian and located in the middle of a vast courtyard with a portico; the Tuscan order was thus quite rare in the provinces.The temple therefore bears witness to a desire to construct something that was different from other such buildings, doubtless in response to the constraints created by the terrain. The dedication in the temple sheds light on its construction: the inscription, which has been very precisely dated to AD 214, consecrates the temple to the personification of victory, Victoria, here specifically in connection with the emperor's campaigns in Germany, for the welfare of Caracalla and of his mother Iulia Domna.The text recalls the military projects of the son of Septimius Severus and their celebration within the context of the imperial cult. This inscription also explains that the temple was constructed at a cost of 100,000 sestertii on the wishes of a great lady of Dougga named Gabinia Hermiona after her death. Besides the generosity of this act of philanthropy, her will foresaw the holding of an annual banquet for the ordo decurionum to be financed by her inheritors on the anniversary of the dedication of the temple. At the same time, Gabinia Hermiona bequeathed the land for the circus \"for the pleasure of the people\".\nThe temple occupied what was doubtlessly one of the last free spaces in the vicinity of the forum. The temple's benefactor preferred this site in the city center to those that she owned in the outskirts: the site of the circus or the site where the Temple of Celeste was later built. Gabinia's family, one of the richest in Dougga, was well placed within Carthage's notables and maintained its power at Dougga, even during the reduction of the local aristocracy in the 3rd century. The terms of Gabinia's will provide evidence of her concern that the family should endure - the annual banquet would keep alive the memory of the family's generosity and emphasize its sociability, while the circus would provide for the pleasure of the most humble of the city's inhabitants.\n\nAt the end of the 4th century, the Temple of Caracalla's Victory in Germany was transformed into a church. The reservoirs in the courtyard were filled in order to provide space for the faithful, while pulpits were added to the cella. The decoration of the cella was also modified.\n\n\n=== Temple of Pluto ===\nPluto receives particular honor at Dougga as the city's patron divinity, as demonstrated by the Genius Thuggae.It is possible that the Temple of Pluto is located near Septimius Severus's triumphal arch in an area of the city that has only been partially excavated as yet, but this hypothesis is not very firm and is based on the discovery of a bust in a courtyard, which has been dated by Poinssot to the 2nd or 3rd century. The associated building was excavated in the 1960s but little is known about the manner in which the excavation was conducted and the stabilization work carried out at the site. A cella with just one niche has been discovered on a podium in the middle of a courtyard and the altar has also been preserved.\nAn architectural study was carried out between 2000 and 2002, but it did not lead to any excavation work.\n\n\n=== Temple of Saturn ===\n\nSaturn was the successor of the Punic Ba'al Hammon and was the attendant (paredros) of Tanit or Heavenly Juno (Juno Caelestis). During the Roman era, the city of Dougga had at least two sanctuaries dedicated to Saturn. The evidence for the existence of one of the two derives mostly from inscriptions found in the city \u00b7 . The second temple, which is the one commonly known as the Temple of Saturn at Dougga, has been excavated. The remains of this temple, which are less significant than those of the capitol or the Temple of Juno Caelestis, are of particular interest because of their location. The ruins lie atop a promontory that overlooks the rich cereal valley of the Oued Khalled, 160 m (520 ft) from the theater and outside the bounds of the city. During the excavation works, remains of a temple of Ba'al Hammon, particularly ritual ditches (favissae) containing ex-votos, were discovered. The Roman temple thus replaced an indigenous sanctuary that dated back at least to the 2nd century BC. This sanctuary consisted essentially of a wide open space designed to receive ex-votos and sacrifices. It was covered over to facilitate the construction of the Temple of Saturn, the ruins of which can still be seen today.\nThe Roman temple was built during the reign of Septimius Severus. It consists of three cellae, a courtyard with a portico, and a vestibule. Water from the temple roof was collected in cisterns. An inscription provides details about the temple's construction: it was erected using funds bequeathed in the testament of a notable local resident named Lucius Octavius Victor Roscianus at a cost of at least 150,000 sestertii, which seems expensive but may be explained by the extent of the earthworks required to give the temple a solid foundation; these works nonetheless seem to have proven insufficient as work to restore and shore up the edifice appear to have been carried out before it finally fell into ruin.\n\n\n=== Temple of Juno Caelestis ===\n\nThe Temple of Juno Caelestis, which was built on the outskirts of the city, was described in the 17th century and excavated in the 1890s. Significant restoration work was undertaken between 1904 and 1914, and new studies were carried out between 1999 and 2002.\n\nThe temple is dedicated to Heavenly Juno (Juno Caelestis), the successor of the Punic god Tanit. Its well-preserved temenos is demarcated by a wall, a large section of which has been very well preserved. The court is only partially tiled and has two symmetrical doors. A portico with 25 bays runs along the circular section of the temenos. The portico is topped with a frieze depicting the construction of the temple.The temple in the strict sense of the word stands on a high podium that can be accessed via a series of eleven steps. It is a Corinthian hexastyle peripteros. The pediment features a dedication to Alexander Severus. The cella has been completely lost.The temple, which was erected between AD 222 and 235, was paid for by a certain Q. Gabinius Rufus Felix, who donated inter alia two silver statues of Juno Caelestis that cost 35,000 sestertii.The temenos, which is 52 m (171 ft) in diameter, is reminiscent of a crescent moon, the symbol of Juno Caelestis.\n\n\n=== Dar Lacheb ===\n\nThe purpose of the edifice known as Dar Lacheb (Latin: Domus Lachebia, \"House of Lacheb\") has not been clearly identified. St-Amans believes that it is a sanctuary dedicated to Aesculapius, which accords with Poinssot\u2019s hypothesis that it is a temple.Dar Lacheb was excavated at the end of the 19th century by Carton and has not been the subject of further works since 1912. A house that was built nearby re-using antique remains was destroyed at the start of the 20th century.\nDar Lacheb was built between AD 164 and 166, at the same era as the capitol, which is 50 m (160 ft) away. The entrance to the building has been perfectly preserved, as has one of the columns of the entrance porch. The interior consists of a courtyard that was once surrounded with a portico. To the south is the cella of a temple that has been entirely destroyed.\n\n\n=== Victoria Church ===\n\nThe Victoria Church, which stands in the northeast of the site, below the Temple of Saturn, is the only Christian building that has been so far excavated at Dougga. At the end of the 4th century or at the start of the 5th century, the Christian community erected the unusually designed little church over a pagan cemetery. The small hypogeum is located nearby.\n\n\n== Bishopric ==\nDuring antiquity, Thugga was also the seat of the bishop of Thucca Terenbenthina. The bishopric was founded during the Roman Empire and survived through the Arian Vandal Kingdom and Orthodox Byzantine Empire, only ceasing to function with the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb. The diocese was re-founded by the Roman Catholic Church as a titular see in the 20th century.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Cisterns and aqueducts ===\n\nDougga has two networks of cisterns, in the north and in the west, one of which is particularly well preserved. An aqueduct leading to the city, located a short distance from the well-preserved cisterns, is amongst the best preserved examples of this type of structure on the territory of modern-day Tunisia.\nThe six cisterns of A\u00efn El Hammam, situated close to the Temple of Juno Caelestis, have a total capacity of 6000 m\u00b3 but are in ruins. They were fed by a spring 12 km (7.5 mi) away and an aqueduct constructed during the reign of Commodus and restored in the last quarter of the 4th century CE.This site is still used once annually for a festival celebrating Mokhola, who was a female saint and benefactor of Moroccan origin according to local oral tradition The veneration of Mokhola is accompanied with animal sacrifices. It has been shown that this tradition has pagan origins; the object of veneration was originally the spring, known as fons moccolitanusThe second network of cisterns, the cisterns of A\u00efn Mizeb, is very well preserved. Located close to the Temple of Minerva, these eight domed reservoirs can hold 9,000 m3 (320,000 cu ft) and feature a basin into which they decant. The cisterns are fed by a spring located 200 m (660 ft) away connected via an underground aqueduct.A final network of secondary cisterns is located in the vicinity of the A\u00efn Doura Bath, in the south-west of the site.\n\n\n=== Streets ===\n\nDougga's streets are not laid out as prescribed by the normal theoretical model of a Roman settlement\u2014around a cardo and a decumanus\u2014as a result of the city's unique design.\nThe center of the city was probably paved; the streets resembled meandering lanes. The city had sewers, as is evidenced by the access stones that are still in place in the streets. At the foot of the hill, there are traces of streets joining with the main road from Carthage to Theveste\n\n\n== Discoveries made at Dougga ==\nThe site at Dougga has offered up numerous works or art, many of which have been removed and placed in museums, most notably the Bardo National Museum in Tunis.\n\n\n=== Works on site ===\n\nFew works of art have been left on site, with the exception of a sculpture of a togate man (togatus) at the \"Square of the Rose of the Winds\" and a number of mosaics, including those in the building known as the house of Venus and in particular at the A\u00efn Doura Bath. This is a consequence of the discovery of Dougga's works of art at a time when archaeological sites were robbed of their treasures and abandoned after a dig. This approach has made it possible to preserve a certain number of mosaics with their colours intact; other mosaics that were uncovered but not removed have suffered due to their exposure to the elements.\nA proposal to construct a museum on the site is being studied. It would serve in particular to house recent discoveries and those yet to be made.\n\n\n=== Works at the Bardo National Museum ===\n\n\n==== Statues ====\n\nA number of heads of emperors have been discovered during the digs at the site. Amongst these, the portrait of Lucius Verus is particularly noteworthy: he is depicted with a generous head of hair, a full beard and a vivacity that makes it one of the most significant statues yet discovered in Roman Africa. This African masterpiece was realized in marble from Carrara and still has traces of color amongst the hairs.The Bardo National Museum also houses a togate man (togatus) that dates from the 3rd century. It depicts an aged man, who has a short beard and is dressed in a toga. It seems certain that this is a later work of art reflective of the contemporary taste in art.\n\n\n==== Mosaics ====\nThe \"butler\u2019s mosaic\" dating from the middle of the 3rd century features a drinking scene. Two characters are serving two others, who are much smaller, from amphoras on their shoulders. The two amphoras bear the letters \u03a1\u0399\u0395 (Rie, \"Drink!\" in Ancient Greek) and \u0396\u0397\u03f9\u0397\u03f9 (Z\u0113s\u0113s, \"You will live!\"). The amphora bearers are flanked by another two characters, one of whom is carrying another amphora, the other of whom is carrying a branch of laurel and a basket of roses. This depiction is a greeting to all guests and a promise of hospitality. The same is true of another mosaic held at the museum which bears the phrase Omnia tibi felicia (\"May everything please you\").\nThe \"mosaic of the victorious charioteer\" is younger than these works. It dates from the second half of the 4th century, and features the phrase Eros omnia per te (\"All things through you, Eros\"). The depiction of the charioteer shows great attention to realism, as do the depictions of the horses, two of which are named Amandus and Frunitus after their characters. The horses are arranged symmetrically; such symmetries were very popular at the time. The charioteer is holding a whip, a crown made of branches and a palm branch. The starting blocks of the circus can be seen in the background. This work of art was found in a private residence and it appears that it must be interpreted as a monument donated by the owner celebrating the victory of a charioteer named Eros.The \"Ulysses mosaic\" is a work inspired by the Odyssey: the Greek hero Odysseus (Ulysses to the Romans) is seen standing on a boat that is decorated with a human head and a palm branch and that has two sails and a battering ram. Ulysses's hands are tied to the main mast so that he will not succumb to the fatal charm of the sirens\u2019 music. Ulysses\u2019s companions are seated around him, their ears blocked with wax as described in the legend. Three sirens stand at the base of a rocky crag. They are depicted with the upper body of a woman but the wings and legs of a bird. One of them holds a flute, the second a lyre, while the third, who does not carry an instrument, is believed to be the singing siren. In front of Ulysses\u2019s boat, there is a small barque with a fisherman holding a lobster, the depiction of which is over-sized. The mosaic has been dated to around AD 260\u2013268; it was discovered in the \"House of Ulysses and the Pirates\".The mosaic \"Neptune and the pirates\" originates from the same peristyle as the preceding work. It depicts the punishment of pirates on the Tyrrhenian Sea, merging themes linked to Dionysus and more common marine themes. The god is standing, ready to throw his spear. He is supported by a maenad, a satyr and aged Silenus, who is holding the ship's rudder. A leopard is attacking one of the pirates, who are transformed into dolphins as soon as they recognize the divine nature of their adversary. To the left, genii have boarded another ship, while to the right, fishermen are attempting to catch an octopus with a net.Yacoub attributes a protective function to these two scenes, a means of invoking fate, a practice which is probably based on Hellenic tradition.The mosaic of the \"cyclopses forging Jupiter\u2019s thunderbolts\" from the floor of a frigidarium depicts three cyclopses: Brontes, Steropes, and Pyracmon or Arges. They are depicted naked, forging Jupiter\u2019s thunderbolts, which Vulcan, seated in front of them, is holding on an anvil. This last element has been lost. The mosaic dates to the end of the 3rd century and was discovered in the \"Bath of the Cyclopses\".\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Works held in other museums ===\nThe bilingual inscription from the mausoleum taken by the British consul Read is held by the British Museum.

          "Dougga is one of the finest Roman ruins I have been to. It is a complete city with an amphitheater, bath, temple, etc.. Everything is in a high state of preservation. It is worth the 2 to 3 hour drive from Tunis. The day I was there, only a handful of other tourists were there.",
          "It was the best place I've ever seen related to Roman culture. I recommend to everyone. Very calm place. There aren't many people so you can relax. In the summer it's very hot so be careful",

          "Desipte the fact that we've visited a number of Roman sites in countries like Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Morroco, Dougga still comes top of all. It's a massive area on a plateau overlooking the valley. From the ruins of various buildings and structures, you can imagine the",

          "Stunning views, amazing place with such a great history. It was a pleasure to walk there and see all these buildings, scluptures, mosaic and other interesting things. The place isn't very well known and you can spend there day almost alone, without crowds making selfies",
          "This time last night I was very wary of going to Dougga as travel information by public transport was scarce. Now I can tell you that it was the easiest trip: I decided to walk from Porte de France (30 mins) to Bab Saadoun Bus and Louage station, immediately found a louage",

          "I have seen a lot but this is just unbelievable, the quality and the richness of the site is amazingly well preserved. You are really walking through history in a very cool and relaxed way because it is like walking in an open museum in a park. You can touch and feel the ruins",
          "Quite a lot to see as is, but our guide told they've only uncovered but a few of the 60 hectares still get to uncover I couldn't believe it. The narrow alleyways, the tunnels the slaves used and the roads worn down from carts, almost gives you a feeling of what life was like.",
          "Dougga occupies a fantastic site - on top of a hill overlooking a large fertile plain. Even today, you get a sense of why it was important and the source of its wealth. It is very well preserved and you can see all the normal attributes of a prosperous Roman town - plus some",
          "I really enjoyed this - there's so much here that's preserved so you can really get a feel for the town. You can even see the track marks from the old carts. Mosaics, Roman baths, the town hall - I would definitely revisit this place.",
          "Dougga is about two hours from Tunis. I hired a car to drive me there and to the ruins at Bulla Regia. If you like to explore ruins, this is a very fun sight as there are many different ancient streets and paths winding through the site. Dougga is a large site with a wide",

          "Dougga is a must see if you have a free day in Tunis. We are so glad we made the time to visit (it was a full day trip). To get there, we walked to the northern louage station at Bab Saadoun. A louage driver was yelling \"DOUGGA, DOUGGA, DOUGGA\" and we hopped in and waited for",

          "If you only visit one place in Tunisia then visit Dougga. Spectacular ruins with hardly anyone else there. Try to get the female guide as she is very knowledgeable, speaks excellent English and will really bring the place to life. Highly recommended.",
          "I have revisited Dougga after 2 years. The site has much improved and has been well-cleaned and amazingly well-kept. It is even more, now, the best preserved Roman ruins in the whole of North Africa. Well done to the Tunisians. The roads to the site have been very much upgraded",
          "A life-changing experience. Dougga is an absolutely incredible site, large and well-preserved. I cannot rate it highly enough. Give yourself plenty of time (I had 4 hours and could easily have done with more). Transport can be a bit of a hassle. Here's what I did: go to the Bab",
          "These are some of the best kept, more stunning Roman ruins I've ever seen. Best of all, there are hardly any people that visit this place. Unlike somewhere like Ephesus, Turkey where you can expect a small town every day, I saw four Tunisian tourists, and two korean tourists",
          "Awesome is such and overused word its lost its meaning but visit Dougga and you will be in awe. It is truly and definitively awesome. We hired a taxi from our hotel in Sidi Bou Said (10 miles north of Tunis ) and it took just over 2 hours. I agree with just about all the",
          "The only criticism I have about Dougga is the lack of guide. We had read lots of great reviews and have to agree - the site is amazingly well preserved and every corner we turned there were more ruins to explore - not enough to see comfortably in 3 hours at all. We were",
          "If you only visit one place this has to be it. A massive site and some truly wonderful ruins from the phonecian and roman era. Still some still very well preserved buildings and it truely has to be seen to be believed and the access you get is unparalleled - it is worth",

          "This Ruins are great. The Theater is great, the whole site is worth the trip from Tunis. It is a easy 1/2 day trip from Tunis. A guide is a good idea as the site is not marked for exploring on your own, There are rest rooms and a small caf\u00e9 on site. Still on working",
          "Wow! This is a terrific site that should be part of any itinerary in Tunisia. It's a good day trip from Tunis, best if combined with Bulla Rigia. It's a fairly large site, yet we were the only people there. As good as almost anything you'll see in Italy. One of the best",
          "Our tour guide insisted that we make the drive from Tunis to Dougga. We are so glad that he did. This site, which is only 30% uncovered, has remnants of a Berber City, which the Romans built on, and which were then developed by other subsequent inhabitants. We had recently",
          "Other than El Jem, Dougga is the must see Punic and Roman ruins \\ archaeological site in Tunisia. Not only is the site fascinating, but the region surrounding it is beautiful with its agriculture fields and terrain features. I visited in the middle of October and it was hot.",
          "It is simply beautiful and special. I was there in October 2014 and there were not many tourists around. I had the site almost for myself and spent hours there photographing. The views from the site are also beautiful. It is worth the long road trip from Tunis. Don't miss it. By",

          "Dougga is a must-see for ruins fanatics like me. The ruins are in a excellent state of preservation. In particular, the theatre and the Temple of Jupiter in the forum are quite exquisite. Sitting on the seating in the theatre you can really imagine what it must have been like.",
          "Great Roman site. Loved the in tact ruins and the lack of tourists but that's also bad for the economy. Tourism is off 90% due to instability in the region but it's a great time to go for no crowds. Very safe country, very friendly people.",

          "To say this site was 'great' would be an understatement. 'Awesome' does not do it justice. You can sit in the amphitheatre and hear voices from the past in the breeze ....... climb into and out of houses......stand on the steps of the Captiol and look 'aristocratic'. This well",
          "Magnificent & stunning , dominated by the Capitole which is in remarkable condition. Set in a beautiful location overlooking fertile fields & olive groves. Wandering around this ancient city : The Theatre , The Square of The Winds , the baths & latrines, the arch Of Septimius",

          "If you go there, get a guide, they Speak English and french. Give them around 20-30 Dinars, (about 20$). It is worth it. Dougga is a Roman City that the visitor will witness details about the living style that was there 1800 years ago. In the Summer they have festivals.",
          "It was Sunday, so me and my two Angolan friends decided to visit the world famous Roman ruins of Dougga. Normally the taxis from the hotels are expensive so we hired a taxi from outside. 99% of people speak French, so we had a hard time in making the taxi driver understand that",
          "The plice are very corrupt and if you get stopped in a car they always ask for money, we were stopped at the end of the Toll road from Beja and we had to pay 50 dinars before they let us go on our journey",

        "wiki": "Tunis (Arabic: \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633\u200e T\u016bnis) is the capital and largest city of Tunisia. The greater metropolitan area of Tunis, often referred to as \"Grand Tunis\", has about 2,700,000 inhabitants, making it the third-largest city in the Maghreb region (after Casablanca and Algiers) and the sixteenth-largest in the Arab world. \nSituated on a large Mediterranean Sea gulf (the Gulf of Tunis), behind the Lake of Tunis and the port of La Goulette (\u1e24alq il-W\u0101d), the city extends along the coastal plain and the hills that surround it. At its core lies its ancient medina, a World Heritage Site. East of the medina through the Sea Gate (also known as the Bab el Bhar and the Porte de France) begins the modern city, or Ville Nouvelle, traversed by the grand Avenue Habib Bourguiba (often referred to by popular press and travel guides as \"the Tunisian Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\"), where the colonial-era buildings provide a clear contrast to smaller, older structures. Further east by the sea lie the suburbs of Carthage, La Marsa, and Sidi Bou Said. As the capital city of the country, Tunis is the focus of Tunisian political and administrative life and also the centre of the country's commercial and cultural activities. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nTunis is the transcription of the Arabic name \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633 which can be pronounced as \"T\u016bnus\", \"T\u016bnas\", or \"T\u016bnis\". All three variations were mentioned by the Greek-Syrian geographer al-Rumi Yaqout in his Mu'jam al-B\u00fbldan (Dictionary of Countries).\nDifferent explanations exist for the origin of the name Tunis. Some scholars relate it to the Phoenician goddess Tanith ('Tanit or Tanut), as many ancient cities were named after patron deities. Some scholars claim that it originated from Tynes, which was mentioned by Diodorus Siculus and Polybius in the course of descriptions of a location resembling present-day Al-Kasbah; Tunis's old Berber Bourgade.Another possibility is that it was derived from the Berber verbal root ens which means \"to lie down\" or \"to pass the night\". The term Tunis can possibly mean \"camp at night\", \"camp\", or \"stop\", or may have referred to as \"the last stop before Carthage\" by people who were journeying to Carthage by land. There are also some mentions in ancient Roman sources of such names of nearby towns as Tuniza (now El Kala), Thunusuda (now Sidi-Meskin), Thinissut (now Bir Bouregba), and Thunisa (now Ras Jebel). As all of these Berber villages were situated on Roman roads, they undoubtedly served as rest-stations or stops.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Carthage ===\n\nThe historical study of Carthage is problematic. Because its culture and records were destroyed by the Romans at the end of the Third Punic War, very few Carthaginian primary historical sources survive. While there are a few ancient translations of Punic texts into Greek and Latin, as well as inscriptions on monuments and buildings discovered in Northwest Africa, the main sources are Greek and Roman historians, including Livy, Polybius, Appian, Cornelius Nepos, Silius Italicus, Plutarch, Dio Cassius, and Herodotus. These writers belonged to peoples in competition, and often in conflict, with Carthage. Greek cities contended with Carthage over Sicily, and the Romans fought three wars against Carthage. Not surprisingly, their accounts of Carthage are extremely hostile; while there are a few Greek authors who took a favourable view, these works have been lost.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nTunis was originally a Berber settlement. The existence of the town is attested by sources dating from the 4th century BC. Situated on a hill, Tunis served as an excellent point from which the comings and goings of naval and caravan traffic to and from Carthage could be observed. Tunis was one of the first towns in the region to fall under Carthaginian control, and in the centuries that followed Tunis was mentioned in the military histories associated with Carthage. Thus, during Agathocles' expedition, which landed at Cape Bon in 310 BC, Tunis changed hands on various occasions.During the Mercenary War, it is possible that Tunis served as a center for the native population of the area, and that its population was mainly composed of peasants, fishermen, and craftsmen. Compared to the ancient ruins of Carthage, the ruins of ancient Tunis are not as large. According to Strabo, it was destroyed by the Romans in 146 BC during the Third Punic War. Both Tunis and Carthage were destroyed; Tunis, however, was rebuilt first under the rule of Augustus and became an important town under Roman control and the center of a booming agricultural industry. The city is mentioned in the Tabula Peutingeriana as Thuni. In the system of Roman roads for the Roman province of Africa, Tunis had the title of mutatio (\"way station, resting place\"). Tunis, increasingly Romanized, was also eventually Christianized and became the seat of a bishop. However, Tunis remained modestly sized compared to Carthage during this time.\n\n\n=== Early Islamic period ===\n\nWhen the Arab Muslim troops conquered the region at the end of the 7th century, they established themselves at the outskirts of ancient Tunes, and the small town soon became the city of Tunis that could easily be taken for an Arab foundation. The medina of Tunis, the oldest section of the city, dates from this period, during which the region was conquered by the Umayyad emir Hasan ibn al-Nu'man al-Ghasani. The city had the natural advantage of coastal access, via the Mediterranean, to the major ports of southern Europe. Early on, Tunis played a military role; the Arabs recognized the strategic importance of its proximity to the Strait of Sicily. From the beginning of the 8th century Tunis was the chef-lieu of the area: it became the Arabs' naval base in the western Mediterranean Sea, and took on considerable military importance. Under the Aghlabids, the people of Tunis revolted numerous times, but the city benefited from economic improvements and quickly became the second most important in the kingdom. It was briefly the national capital, from the end of the reign of Ibrahim II in 902, until 909 when control over Ifriqiya was lost to the newly founded Fatimid Caliphate.\nLocal opposition to the authorities began to intensify in September 945, when Kharijite insurgents occupied Tunis, resulting in general pillaging. With the rise of the Zirid dynasty Tunis gained importance, but the Sunni population tolerated Shi'ite rule less and less, and carried out massacres against the Shi'ite community. In 1048 the Zirid ruler Al-Muizz ibn Badis rejected his city's obedience to the Fatimids and re-established Sunni rites throughout all of Ifriqiya. This decision infuriated the Shi'ite caliph Al-Mustansir Billah. To punish the Zirids, he unleashed the Banu Hilal Arab tribe on Ifriqiya; a large part of the country was set to the torch, the Zirid capital Kairouan was razed in 1057, and only a few coastal towns, including Tunis and Mahdia, escaped destruction. Exposed to violence from the hostile tribes that settled around the city, the population of Tunis repudiated the authority of the Zirids and swore allegiance to the Hammadid prince El Nacer ibn Alennas, who was based in B\u00e9ja\u00efa, in 1059. The governor appointed by B\u00e9ja\u00efa, having reestablished order in the country, did not hesitate to free himself from the Hammadids to found the Khurasanid dynasty with Tunis as its capital. This small independent kingdom picked up the threads of trade and commerce with other nations, and brought the region back to peace and prosperity.\n\n\n=== New capital of Tunisia ===\nIn 1159, the Almohad 'Abd al-Mu'min took Tunis, overthrew the last Khurasanid leader and installed a new government in the kasbah of Tunis. The Almohad conquest marked the beginning of the dominance of the city in Tunisia. Having previously played a minor role behind Kairouan and Mahdia, Tunis was promoted to the rank of provincial capital.\nIn 1228, Governor Abu Zakariya seized power and, a year later, took the title of Emir and founded the Hafsid dynasty. The city became the capital of a Hafsid kingdom stretching towards Tripoli and Fez. Walls were built to protect the emerging principal town of the kingdom, surrounding the medina, the kasbah and the new suburbs of Tunis. In 1270 the city was taken briefly by Louis IX of France, who was hoping to convert the Hafsid sovereign to Christianity. King Louis easily captured Carthage, but his army soon fell victim to an outbreak of dysentery. Louis himself died before the walls of the capital and the army was forced out.  At the same time, driven by the reconquest of Spain, the first Andalusian Muslims and Jews arrived in Tunis and would become of importance to the economic prosperity of the Hafsid capital and the development of its intellectual life.During the Almohad and Hafsid periods Tunis was one of the richest and grandest cities in the Islamic world, with a population of about 100,000.\nDuring this period, one of the famous travellers to Tunis was Ibn Battuta. In his travel account, when Ibn Battuta and his group arrived in Tunis, the population of the city came out to meet him and the other the members of his party. They all greeted them and were very curious, many were asking questions, however, no one in Tunis personally greeted Ibn Battuta, greatly upsetting him. He felt very lonely and could not hold back the tears coming from his eyes. This went on for a while until one of the pilgrims realized he was upset, he went up and greeted and talked to Ibn until he entered the city. At the time, the Sultan of Tunis was Abu Yahya and during Ibn Battuta's stay, the Festival of the Breaking of the Fast was taking place. The people in the city assembled in large numbers to celebrate the festival, in extravagant and most luxurious outfits. Abu Yahya arrived on horseback, where all of his relatives joined him. After the performance, the people returned to their homes.\n\n\n=== Spanish occupation and Ottoman control ===\n\nThe Ottoman Empire took nominal control of Tunis in 1534 when Hayreddin Barbarossa captured it from the Hafsid Sultan Mulai Hassan, who fled to the court of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. Charles, suffering losses from the corsairs operating out of Djerba, Tunis, and Algiers, agreed to reinstate Mulai Hassan in exchange for his acceptance of Spanish suzerainty. A naval expedition led by Charles himself was dispatched in 1535, and the city was recaptured. The victory against the corsairs is recorded in a tapestry at the Royal Palace of Madrid. The Spanish governor of La Goulette, Luys Peres Varga,  fortified the island of Chikly in the lake of Tunis to strengthen the city's defences between 1546 and 1550. \n\n \nThe Ottoman Ulu\u00e7 Ali Reis, at the head of an army of janissaries and Kabyles, retook Tunis in 1569. However, following the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the Spanish under John of Austria succeeded in retaking the city and re-establishing the Hafsid sovereign in October 1573. Following these conflicts, the city finally fell into Ottoman hands in August 1574. Having become an Ottoman province governed by a Pasha who was appointed by the Sultan based in Constantinople, the country attained a degree of autonomy. After 1591, the Ottoman governors (Beys) were relatively independent, and both piracy and trade continued to flourish. Under the rule of deys and Moorish beys, the capital sprang into new life. Its population grew by additions from various ethnicities, among which were Moorish refugees from Spain, and economic activities diversified. To traditional industry and trade with distant lands was added the activity of the Barbary pirates, then in their golden age. Profits obtained from the trade in Christian slaves allowed the rulers to build sumptuous structures that revived the architectural heritage of the Middle Ages.\n\nIn April 1655 the English admiral Robert Blake was sent to the Mediterranean to extract compensation from states that had been attacking English shipping. Only the Bey of Tunis refused to comply, with the result that Blake's fifteen ships attacked the Bey's arsenal at Porto Farina (Ghar el Melh), destroying nine Algerian ships and two shore batteries, the first time in naval warfare that shore batteries had been eliminated without landing men ashore.\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Tunisia entered into a new period in its history with the advent of the Husainid dynasty. Successive Husainid rulers made great progress in developing the city and its buildings. During this period, the city prospered as a centre of commerce. Taking advantage of divisions within the ruling house, Algerians captured Tunis in 1756 and put the country under supervision. Hammouda Bey faced bombardment by the Venetian fleet, and the city experienced a rebellion in 1811. Under the reign of Hussein Bey II, naval defeats by the British (1826) and French (1827) saw the French become increasingly active in the city and in the economy.Various sources estimate the 19th-century population to have ranged from 90,000 to 110,000 inhabitants. During the later 19th century, Tunis became increasingly populated by Europeans, particularly the French, and immigration dramatically increased the size of the city. This resulted in the first demolition of the old city walls, from 1860, to accommodate growth in the suburbs. The city spilled outside the area of the earlier town and the banks of the lake, and the new districts were modernised with running water (1860), lighting gas (1872), roads, waste collection (1873), and communication with adjacent suburbs and the city centre. The crafts and traditional trades declined somewhat, as the newcomers increased trade with Europe, introducing the first modern industries and new forms of urban life.\n\n\n=== Development under the French protectorate ===\n\nThe creation of the French protectorate in 1881 was a turning point in Tunis's history, leading to rapid redevelopment of the city in the span of two to three decades. The city quickly spread out of its fortifications: it divided into a traditional Arab-populated old city, and a new city populated by immigrants, with a different structure from that of the traditional medina. Tunis also benefited from French construction of a water supply, natural gas and electricity networks, public transport services and other public infrastructure.\nUnder French rule, a substantial number of Europeans settled (like the Tunisian Italians); half of the population was European in origin. The city expanded and created new boulevards and neighborhoods.\nTunis was quiet during the First World War. After the war, the city faced new transformations as the modern portion grew in importance and extended its network of boulevards and streets in all directions. In addition, a series of satellite cities emerged on the urban rim and encroached on the municipality of Tunis proper. In the economic sphere, commercial activities expanded and diversified as modern industries continued to grow, while traditional industry continued to decline.\nDuring World War II, Tunis was held by Axis forces from November 1942 to May 1943. It was their last base in Africa, as they retreated towards Sicily after being surrounded by Allied forces from Algeria to the west and from Libya to the east. \nOn 7 May 1943, at about 15:30 in the afternoon, Tunis fell to troops of British 1st Army and the U.S. 1st Army, which had defeated the German 5th Panzer Army guarding the city. At midday on 20 May 1943, the Allies held a victory parade on Avenue Mar\u00e9chal Galli\u00e9ni, and Avenue Jules Ferry, to signal the end of fighting in North Africa.Having succeeded in driving the Axis powers out of Tunisia, the Allies used Tunis as a base of operations from which to stage amphibious assaults first against the island of Pantelleria, and then Sicily, and finally the mainland of Italy.\n\n\n=== Growth since independence ===\n\nAfter independence in 1956, Tunis consolidated its role as the capital, first with the establishment of a constitution stating that the Chamber of Deputies and the Presidency of the Republic must have their headquarters in Tunis and its suburbs. In a very short time, the colonial city transformed rapidly. As the city has grown and native Tunisians gradually began to replace the extensive European population, conflict between the Arab city and the European city has gradually decreased with the arabization of the population.\nBecause of population pressure and the rate of migration to the capital, the city continued to grow, even with the creation of new districts in the suburbs. Old buildings have gradually been renovated and upgraded and new buildings have come to influence the urban landscape. At the same time, an active policy of industrialization is developing the municipal economy.\nThe Arab League was headquartered in Tunis from 1979 to 1990. The Arab League, which represents 22 Arab nations, transferred its headquarters to Tunis in 1979 because of Egypt's peace with Israel but has been headquartered back in Egypt since 1990.\nThe Palestine Liberation Organization also had its headquarters in Tunis, from 1982 to 2003.\nIn 1985, the PLO's headquarters was bombed by Israeli Air Force F-15s, killing approximately 60 people.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nMany protests took place during the Arab Spring of 2011\u201312.\nOn 18 March 2015, two gunmen attacked the Bardo National Museum and held hostages. Twenty civilians and one policeman were killed in the attack, while around 50 others were injured. Five Japanese, two Colombians, and visitors from Italy, Poland, and Spain were among the dead. Both gunmen were killed by Tunisian police. The incident has been treated as a terrorist attack.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTunis is located in north-eastern Tunisia on the Lake of Tunis, and is connected to the Mediterranean sea's Gulf of Tunis by a canal which terminates at the port of La Goulette/Halq al Wadi. The ancient city of Carthage is located just north of Tunis along the coastal part. The city lies on a similar latitude as the southernmost points of Europe.\nThe city of Tunis is built on a hill slope down to the lake of Tunis. These hills contain places such as Notre-Dame de Tunis, Ras Tabia, La Rabta, La Kasbah, Montfleury and La Manoubia with altitudes just above 50 metres (160 feet). The city is located at the crossroads of a narrow strip of land between Lake Tunis and S\u00e9joumi. The isthmus between them is what geologists call the \"Tunis dome\", which includes hills of limestone and sediments. It forms a natural bridge and since ancient times several major roads linking to Egypt and elsewhere in Tunisia have branched out from it. The roads also connect with Carthage, emphasising its political and economic importance not only in Tunisia but more widely in North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea in ancient times.\nThe Greater Tunis area has an area of 300,000 hectares, 30,000 of which is urbanized, the rest being shared between bodies of water (20,000 hectares of lakes or lagoons) and agricultural or natural land (250,000 hectares). However, urban growth, which is estimated to be increasing by 500 hectares per year, is gradually changing the landscape with urban sprawl.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Suburbs ===\nAfter World War II, suburbs began to rapidly spring up on the outskirts of Tunis. These form a large percentage of the population of the Tunis metropolitan area. It grew from 27% of the total population in 1956, to 37% in 1975 and 50% in 2006.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTunis has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa), characterized by hot and dry, prolonged summers and mild winters with moderate rainfall. The local climate is also affected somewhat by the latitude of the city, the moderating influence of the Mediterranean sea and the terrain of the hills.\nWinter is the wettest season of the year, when more than a third of the annual rainfall falls during this period, raining on average every two or three days.  The sun may still increase the temperature from 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F) in the morning to 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) in the afternoon on average during the winter. Frosts are rare.  In spring, rainfall declines by half.  The sunshine becomes dominant in May when it reaches 10 hours a day on average.  In March temperatures may vary between 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F) and 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), and between 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) and 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) in May. However, it is common for temperatures to soar even as early as April with record temperatures reaching 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F).  In summer, rain is almost completely absent and the sunlight is at a maximum.  The average temperatures in the summer months of June, July, August, and September are very high. Sea breezes may mitigate the heat, but sometimes the sirocco winds reverse the trend.  In autumn, it begins to rain, often with short thunderstorms, which can sometimes cause flash floods or even flood some parts of the city.  The month of November marks a break in the general heat with average temperatures ranging from 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) to 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Capital ===\n\nTunis has been the capital of Tunisia since 1159. Under Articles 43 and 24 of the Constitution of 1959, Tunis and its suburbs host the national institutions: the Presidential Palace, which is known as Carthage Palace, residence of the President of Tunisia, the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Advisors and parliament, the Constitutional Council and the main judicial institutions  and public bodies. The revised Tunisian Constitution of 2014 similarly provides that the National Assembly is to sit in Tunis (article 51) and that the Presidency is based there (article 73).\n\n\n=== Municipality ===\n\n\n==== Institutions ====\n\nFollowing the municipal elections of 6 May 2018, Ennahdha obtained 21 seats out of 60. Nidaa Tounes came second with 17 seats. On 3 July 2018, the head of the Ennahdha list Souad Abderrahim was elected by the council as the new mayor of the capital.\nBefore 2011, unlike other mayors in Tunisia, the mayor of Tunis is appointed by decree of the President of the Republic from among the members of the City Council.\n\n\n==== Budget ====\nThe 2008 budget adopted by the City Council is structured as follows: 61.61 million dinars for operations and 32,516 million dinars for investment. It reflects the improved financial situation of the municipality, the year 2007 was a year registering a surplus in resources that allowed the settlement of debts of the municipality and the strengthening of its credibility with respect its suppliers and public and private partners.\nRevenues are generated by the proceeds of taxes on buildings and vacant lots, fees for the rental of municipal property, income from the operation of the public, advertising, and that the fact that the municipality has capital shares in some companies. On the expenditure side, provision is made for the consolidation of hygiene and cleanliness, the state of the environment and urban design, infrastructure maintenance, rehabilitation and renovation of facilities, and strengthening the logistics and means of work and transport.\n\n\n==== Administrative divisions ====\n\nThe city of Tunis, whose size has increased significantly during the second half of the 20th century, now extends beyond the Tunis Governorate into parts of the governorates of Ben Arous, Ariana and Manouba.\nThe municipality of Tunis is divided into 15 municipal districts:  These include El Bab Bhar, Bab Souika, Cit\u00e9 El Khadra, Jelloud Jebel El Kabaria, El Menzah, El Ouardia, Ettahrir, Ezzouhour, Hra\u00efria, Medina, El Omrane, El Omrane Higher S\u00e9joumi, Sidi El-Bashir and Sidi Hassine.\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nIn the years following independence, the population of the metropolitan area continued to grow: by 21.1% from 1956 to 1966 and by 28.5% from 1966 to 1975 (55.6% between 1956 and 1975). This steady growth was accompanied by changes which affected the nature of the settlement of the capital. Decolonization led to the exodus of some European minorities whose numbers dwindled every year. The gaps created by their departure were filled by Tunisians who emigrated to Tunis from other parts of the country.\nThe population of the city of Tunis exceeds 2,000,000 inhabitants. After independence, the Tunisian government implemented a plan to cope with population growth of the city and country, a system of family planning, to attempt to lower the rate of population growth. However, between 1994 and 2004, the population of the governorate of Tunis grew more than 1.03% per annum. It represents, in the 2004 census, 9.9% of the total population of Tunisia. As in the rest of Tunisia, literacy in the region of Tunis evolved rapidly during the second half of the 20th century and has reached a level slightly higher than the national average. The education level is only exceeded by the neighbouring governorate of Ariana which has many institutions of education.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nProducts include textiles, carpets, and olive oil. Tourism also provides a significant portion of the city's income.\nBecause of the concentration of political authority (headquarters of the central government, presidency, parliament, ministries and central government) and culture (festivals and mainstream media), Tunis is the only nationally ranking metropolis. Tunis is the heartland of the Tunisian economy and is the industrial and economic hub of the country, home to one third of Tunisian companies\u2014including almost all the head offices of companies with more than fifty employees, with the exception of the Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa, headquartered in Gafsa\u2014and produces a third of the national gross domestic product.  Tunis attracts foreign investors (33% of companies, 26% of investments and 27% of employment), excluding several areas due to economic imbalances. According to the Mercer 2017 Cost of Living Rankings, Tunis has the lowest cost of living for expatriates in the world. The urban unemployment rate of university graduates is increasing and the illiteracy rate remains high among the elderly (27% of women and 12% of men). The number of people living below the poverty line, falling at the national level, remains higher in urban areas. In addition, unemployment is high in young people aged 18 to 24, with one in three unemployed as compared to one in six at the national level. In Greater Tunis, the proportion of young unemployed is at 35%.Gulf finance house or GFH has invested $10 billion in order for the construction of tunis financial harbor, that will transform Tunisia as the gateway to Africa from Europe. The project hopes to boost the economy of Tunisia as well as increase the number of tourists visiting Tunisia annually. The project is going through planning.\n\n\n=== Sectors ===\nThe economic structure of Tunis, as well as that of the country, is overwhelmingly tertiary industry.  The city is the largest financial center in the country hosting the headquarters of 65% of financial companies \u2013 while the industrial sectors are gradually declining in importance.  However the secondary industry is still very represented and Tunis hosts 85% of industrial establishments in the four governorates, with a trend towards the spread of specialized industrial zones in the suburbs.\nPrimary industry such as agriculture, however, is active in specialized agricultural areas on the suburbs, particularly in the wine and olive oil industries. The generally flat terrain and the two main rivers in Tunisia, the Medjerda to the north and the Milian to the south, the soils are fertile.  Tunis has several large plains, the most productive are in Ariana and La Soukra (north), the plain of Manouba (west) and the plain of Mornag (south).  In addition, groundwater is easily accessible through the drilling of deep wells, providing water for the different agriculture crops. The soils are heavy and contain limestone in the north but are lighter and sandy containing clay in the south.  There is much diversification in the municipality of Tunis, with Durum grown in Manouba, Olives and olive oil in Ariana and Mornag, wine (Mornag), and fruit, vegetable and legumes are grown in all regions.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Architecture and landscape ==\n\n\n=== Urban landscape ===\n\nThe Medina, built on a gentle hill slope on the way down to the Lake of Tunis, is the historical heart of the city and home to many monuments, including palaces, such as the Dar Ben Abdallah and Dar Hussein, the mausoleum of Tourbet el Bey or many mosques such as the Al-Zaytuna Mosque. Some of the fortifications around it have now largely disappeared, and it is flanked by the two suburbs of Bab Souika to the north and Bab El Jazira to the south. Located near the Bab Souika, the neighborhood of Halfaouine which gained international attention through the film 'Halfaouine Child of the Terraces'.\nBut east of the original nucleus, first with the construction of the French Consulate, the modern city was built gradually with the introduction of the French protectorate at the end of the 19th century, on open land between the city and the lake. The axis to the structure of this part of the city is the Avenue Habib Bourguiba, designed by the French to be a Tunisian form of Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris with its cafes, major hotels, shops and cultural venues. On both sides of the tree lines avenue, north and south, the city was extended in various districts, with the northern end welcoming residential and business districts while the south receives industrial districts and poorer peoples.\nSouth-east of the Avenue Bourguiba the district of La Petite Sicile (Little Sicily) is adjacent to the old port area and takes its name from its original population of workers from Italy. It is now the subject of a redevelopment project including the construction of twin towers. North of the Avenue Bourguiba is the district of La Fayette, which is still home to the Great Synagogue of Tunis and the Habib Thameur Gardens, built on the site of an ancient Jewish cemetery which lay outside the walls. Also to the north is the long Avenue Mohamed V, which leads to the Boulevard of 7 November through the neighborhood of the big banks where there are hotels and Abu Nawas Lake and finally to the Belvedere area around the place Pasteur. This is where the Belvedere Park lies, the largest in the city, and home to a zoo and the Pasteur Institute founded by Adrien Loir in 1893. Continuing to the north are the most exclusive neighborhoods of Mutuelleville which house the French Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-Mend\u00e8s-France, the Sheraton Hotel and some embassies.\nStill further north of the Belvedere Park, behind the Boulevard of 7 November are the neighborhoods of El Menzah and El Manar now reaching the peaks of the hills overlooking the north of the town. They support a range of residential and commercial buildings. To the west of the park lies the district of El Omrane which holds the main Muslim cemetery in the capital and the warehouses of public transport.  Heading east is the Tunis-Carthage International Airport and the neighborhoods of Borgel, giving his name to the existing Jewish and Christian cemeteries in the capital, and the neighbourhood of Montplaisir. Beyond that, several kilometers north-east, on the road to La Marsa,  the Berges du Lac was built on land reclaimed from the north shore of the lake near the airport, which has holds offices of Tunisian and foreign companies, many embassies as well as shops.\nSouthwest of the Medina, on the crest of the hills across the Isthmus of Tunis, is the Montfleury district then on down to the foothills of S\u00e9joumi, the poor neighborhood of Mellassine. Northwest of the latter, north of the National Route 3 leading to the west, is the city of Ezzouhour (formerly El Kharrouba), which spans more than three metres (9.8 feet) and is divided into five sections. It is still surrounded with farmland and vegetables are grown which supply many of the souks in the region.\nThe south of Tunis is made up of disadvantaged neighborhoods, especially due to the strong industry in this part of the metropolis. These include Jebel Jelloud, located in the south-east of Tunis, which concentrates on the heavy industry of cement production, the treatment plant of phosphate s, etc. The main cemetery in Tunis, the Djellaz Cemetery, dominates this part of town, perched on the slopes of a rocky outcrop.\n\n\n=== M\u00e9dina ===\n\nThe medina of Tunis has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979. The Medina contains some 700 monuments, including palaces, mosques, mausoleums, madrasas and fountains dating from the Almohad and the Hafsid periods. These ancient buildings include:\n\nThe Aghlabid Al-Zaytouna Mosque (\"Mosque of the Olive\") built in 723 by Ubayd Allah ibn al-Habhab to celebrate the new capital.\nThe Dar El Bey, or Bey's Palace, comprises architecture and decoration from many different styles and periods and is believed to stand on the remains of a Roman theatre as well as the 10th-century palace of Ziadib-Allah II al Aghlab.With an area of 270 hectares (over 29 hectares for the Kasbah)  and more than 100,000 people, the Medina comprises one-tenth of the population of Tunis. The planning of the Medina of Tunis has the distinction of not grid lines or formal geometric compositions. However, studies were undertaken in the 1930s with the arrival of the first anthropologists who found that the space of the Medina is not random: the houses are based on a socio-cultural code according to the types of complex human relations.\nDomestic architecture (palaces and townhouses), official and civilian (libraries and administrations), religious (mosques and zaou\u00efas) and services (commercial and fondouks) are located in the Medina. The notion of public space is ambiguous in the case of Medina where the streets are seen as an extension of the houses and subject to social tags. The concept of ownership is low however and souks often spill out onto public roads. Today, each district has its culture and rivalries can be strong.\nThe northern end supports the football club of Esperance Sportive de Tunis while at the other end is the rival Club Africain. The Medina also has a social sectorization: with the neighborhood of Tourbet el Bey and the Kasbah district being aristocratic, with a population of judges and politicians, while the streets of Pacha often being military and bourgeois.\nFounded in 698 is the Al-Zaytuna Mosque and the surrounding area which developed throughout the Middle Ages,  dividing Tunis into a main town in two suburbs, in the north (Bab Souika) and the south (Bab El Jazira). The area became the capital of a powerful kingdom during the Hafsid era, and was considered a religious and intellectual home and economic center for the Middle East, Africa and Europe. A great fusion of influences can be seen blending Andalusian styles with eastern influences, and Roman or Byzantine columns, and typical Arab architecture, characterized by the archways.\nThe architectural heritage is also omnipresent in the homes of individuals and small palace officials as well as in the palace of the sovereign of Kasbah. Although some palaces and houses date back to the Middle Ages, a greater number of prestigious houses were built in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries such as Dar Othman (early 17th century), Dar Ben Abdallah (18th century), Dar Hussein, Dar Cherif and other houses. The main palace beys are those of La Marsa, Bardo and Ksar Said. If we add the mosques and oratories (about 200), the madrasahs (El Bachia, Slimania, El Achouria, Bir El Ahjar, Ennakhla, etc..), The zaouias (Mahrez Sidi Sidi Ali Azouz, Sidi Abdel Kader, etc.) and Tourbet El Fellari, Tourbet Aziza Othman and Tourbet El Bey the number of monuments in Tunis approaches 600. Unlike Algiers, Palermo and Naples, its historical heart has never suffered from major natural disasters or urban radical interventions. The main conflicts and potentially destructive human behavior has been experienced in the city occurred relatively recently following the country's independence which it why it made into a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. At the beginning of the 21st century, the Medina is one of the best preserved urban locations in the Arab world.Furthermore, along the boulevards, the contribution of the architectural period 1850\u20131950 can be felt in the buildings, such as the government buildings of the nine ministries and the headquarters of the municipality of Tunis.\n\n\n=== Other landmarks ===\nThe Bardo Museum was originally a 13th-century Hafsid palace, located in the (then) suburbs of Tunis. It contains a major collection of Roman empires and other antiquities of interest from Ancient Greece, Tunisia, and from the Arab period.\nThe ruins of Carthage are nearby, along the coast to the northeast, with many ancient ruins.\n\n\n==== Souks ====\n\nThe souks are a network of covered streets lined with shops and traders and artisans ordered by specialty.  Clothing merchants, perfumers, fruit sellers, booksellers and wool merchants have goods at the souks, while fishmongers, blacksmiths and potters tend to be relegated to the periphery of the markets.\n\nNorth of the Al-Zaytuna Mosque is the Souk El Attarine, built in the early 18th century. It is known for its essences and perfumes. From this souk, there is a street leading to the Souk Ech-Chaouachine (chachia). The main company that operates it is one of the oldest in the country and they are generally descendants of Andalusian immigrants expelled from Spain. Attached to El Attarine are two other souks: the first, which runs along the western coast of the Al-Zaytuna Mosque, is the Souk El Kmach which is noted for its fabrics, and the second, the Souk El Berka, which was built in the 17th century and houses embroiderers and jewelers. Given the valuable items it sells, it is the only souk whose doors are closed and guarded during the night. In the middle there is a square where the former slave market stood until the middle of the 19th century.\nSouk El Berka leads to Souk El Leffa, a souk that sells all kinds of carpets, blankets and other weavings, and extends with the Souk Es Sarragine, built in the early 18th century and specializing in leather. At the periphery are the souks Et Trouk, El Blat, El Blaghgia, El K\u00e9babgia, En Nhas (copper), Es Sabbaghine (dyeing) and El Grana that sell clothing and blankets and was occupied by Jewish merchants.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Walls and gates ====\n\nFrom the early days of its founding, Tunis has been considered an important military base. The Arab geographer El Yacoubi has written that in the 9th century Tunis was surrounded by a wall of brick and clay except the side of the sea where it was stone.  Bab El-Jazeera, perhaps the oldest gate of the south wall, opened onto the southern road. Bab Cartagena gave access to Carthage, important for bringing in construction materials needed for the city. Bab Souika (initially known as Bab El Saqqayin) had a strategic role to keep the roads to Bizerte, B\u00e9ja and Le Kef. Bab Menara (initially known as Bab El Artha) opened onto the medina and on the suburb of El Haoua. As for El Bab Bhar, it allowed access to some funduqs where Christian merchants lived in Tunis.\nWith the development of the capital under the reign of the Hafsids, two emerging suburbs grew outside the walls; Bab El Jazira in the south and Bab Souika to the north. In the early 14th century, Hafsid Darba Ab\u00fb al-Muhammad al-Mustansir Lihy\u00e2n\u00ee ordered the construction of a second chamber including the Medina and two suburbs outside. Six new gates were built including Bab El Khadra, Bab Saadoun, Bab El Allouj (initially called Bab Er-Rehiba), Khalid or Bab Bab Sidi Abdallah Cherif, Bab El Fellah and Bab Alioua. In the Ottoman period, four new gates were established: Bab Laassal, Bab Sidi Abdesselam, Bab El Bab Gorjani and Sidi Kacem. The city retains some of these gates including Bab El Khadra, Bab El Bhar and Bab Jedid but some of the earlier ones have long disappeared.\n\n\n=== Places of worship ===\n\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslim mosques.   There are also Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tunis (Catholic Church), Protestant churches, Evangelical Churches.As in the rest of Tunisia, a very large majority of the population of Tunis (around 99%) is Sunni Muslim.  The capital is home to a large number of mosques in various architectural styles, signs of construction of their respective eras.  The main and oldest of them, is the Al-Zaytuna Mosque, founded in 698 and built in 732 and is in the heart of the Medina. Practicing the Maliki rite as the vast majority of Tunisia's Mosques. It was completely rebuilt in 864 and is a prestigious place of worship, and was long an important place of culture and knowledge with the University of Ez-Zitouna on the premises until the independence of Tunisia.  It still hosts the main ceremonies marking the dates on the Muslim calendar and is regularly attended by the president.\nThe medina contains most of the major mosques in the capital which were built before the advent of the French protectorate.  The mosque in the Kasbah, was founded in 1230.  Practicing the Hanafi rite since 1584, it is recognisable mainly by the dome as well as its minaret, similar to the Koutoubia in Marrakesh and is the highest in the city. Ksar Mosque, also of the Hanafi rite, is located in front of Dar Hussein (Bab Menara) and was built in the 12th century.  The Hammouda Pasha Mosque, built in 1655, is the second mosque built by the Hanafi rite in Tunis. Youssef Dey Mosque operated primarily as public speaking venue before becoming a real mosque in 1631. The Sidi Mahrez Mosque is the largest mosque Hanafi mosque in terms of area but not the tallest.  Built in 1692, it resembles the Ottoman S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul.  The Saheb Ettaba\u00e2 Mosque, built between 1808 and 1814 was the last mosque built by the Tunis Husseinites before the French occupation.The presence of modern churches in Tunis are also testimony to the French presence for half a century.  Tunis is the seat of the Diocese of Tunis, with the seat located at the Cathedral of St Vincent de Paul, The church was built in 1897 on the site of the old Christian cemetery of Saint-Antoine.  This includes a network of Catholic buildings, including the Church of St. Joan of Arc, but also with the Protestant Reformed Church and the Anglican church Saint-Georges.Greeks used to enjoy an important presence in the city since ancient times. Tunis is the headquarters of the Greek Orthodox Holy Archdiocese of Carthage with jurisdiction over Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia. It belongs to the Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa, and its cathedral, small school and other buildings are in Central Tunis.\nIn total, there are three Greek Orthodox and two Russian Orthodox parishes in Tunisia. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria also maintains jurisdiction in Tunisia.\nThe small Orthodox community is centred around the Greek Orthodox Church (1862), managed by the Greek Embassy and the Russian Orthodox Church (1957), reflecting the presence in Tunisia of a small colony of Russian immigrants.Judaism, meanwhile, enjoys a long tradition of presence in the city despite the emigration of a large part of the community after independence.  Among the places of worship are Beit Yaacouv Synagogue and especially the Great Synagogue of Tunis, built at the end of the 1940s to replace the former Great Synagogue which was demolished as part of the Jewish redevelopment area, the Hara.\n\n\n=== Parks and greenery ===\n\nTunis has some large parks, many of which were installed at the end of the 19th century by the authorities of the French protectorate. The largest Park, Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re Park, was founded in 1892 overlooks Lake Tunis. It is the oldest public park in the country and is built in the landscape style common to France.  The park covers an area of more than one hundred hectares across roads that can be explored on foot or by car. It is also home to Tunis Zoo, which houses African fauna, and the Museum of Modern Art.\nHabib Thameur garden in Tunis has a central pond and flower beds. The Gorjani garden, is an English garden located southwest of the city, which notably takes an irregular form, partly due to the steep topography of the land.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nLocated in an old beylical palace (the palace of the Bey of Tunis since the end of the 18th century), the Bardo National Museum (Tunis) is the most important archaeological museum in the Maghreb, and has one of the richest Roman mosaic collections in the world.  Its collections developed rapidly, thanks to numerous archaeological discoveries in the surrounding territory.\nIn 1964 the Dar Ben Abdallah, a palace probably dating back to the 18th century, became the seat of the capital's Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions.  In its exposition halls it holds numerous traditional items, witnesses of the everyday lives of families of the Medina quarter.\nThe Museum of the National Movement is situated in Dar Ma\u00e2kal Az-Za\u00efm, which was the residence of nationalist Habib Bourguiba for the entirety of the fight for independence.  After the advent of independence, a museum was built there to relate the details of the national struggle between 1938 and 1952.\nThe National Military Museum, opened in 1989 in the suburbs west of the city, holds a collection of 23,000 weapons, 13,000 of which date back to the 19th century, and some of which were used by the Tunisian troops during the Crimean War.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nTunis holds some of the most prestigious musical institutions in the country. The Rachidia was founded in 1934 to safeguard Arab music, and in particular to promote Tunisian and malouf music.  The group is made up of 22 members, both instrumental players and choral musicians.The Musical Troupe of the City of Tunis was created in 1954 by Salah El Mahdi. In 1955 he placed his student Mohamed Sa\u00e2da in charge of the ensemble, which at that time included the best artists, and later merged with the ensemble of Radio Tunis.  This group contributed to the rise to stardom of numerous Tunisian singers, including Oulaya.\nThe Association of Arab Orchestra of the City of Tunis began its activities at the end of April 1982, as a workshop linked to the cultural center of the city.  It worked on promoting Arab music, on music education and training, and on cooperation with various partners both in Tunisia and abroad.  The Tunisian Symphony Orchestra, created in 1969 by the Minister of Culture, has also produced monthly concerts at the Municipal Theater and in various cultural spaces in the city.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nTunis is a center of Tunisian culture. The Th\u00e9\u00e2tre municipal de Tunis, opened on 20 November 1902, showcases opera, ballet, symphonic concerts, drama, etc. On the stage of this theater, many performances are regularly given by Tunisian, Arabic and international actors. The National Theatre of Tunisia is an important public enterprise in Tunis, and since 1988 been located in the Khaznadar palace (dating from the middle of the 19th century and situated in the Halfaouine quarter), renamed \"Theater Palace.\" In 1993, it also took possession of the former movie theater Le Paris, with a 350-person seating capacity.  During each \"cultural season\" (from October 1 to 30 June) the theater holds over 80 events.  The Al Hamra theater was the second theater to be opened in Tunis, situated on El Jazira Road.  Al Hamra was one of the most famous theaters in the capital during the 1930s and 1940s.  After being closed for fifteen years, it was turned into a small theater in 1986, and since 2001 has housed the first Arab-African center for theater training and research.  One should also note the El Teatro and \u00c9toile du Nord theater groups.\nOther arts are also represented in the capital. The National Center of the Arts established the puppet theatre in 1976.  The National School of Circus Arts was founded following a meeting between the Director of the National Theater and the Director General of the National Center for Arts of Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne (France) in 1998. In addition, various small theatres and cultural centres are scattered throughout the city and display various artistic performances.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nFilm producers and cinema have long been present in the city of Tunis. The first animated film was shown in Tunis by the Lumiere brothers as early as 1896. The first screenings were held the following year and the first cinema, the Omnia Path\u00e9, opened in October 1908. The first film club opened in Tunis in 1946 and the Globe, in 1965. The Carthage Film Festival is the oldest established film festival in Africa, running biennially until 2014 and annually thereafter.\nIn 1990, Ferid Boughedir shot the notable film Halfaouine Child of the Terraces in Halfaouine district. The films The English Patient (1996) and The Last Days of Pompeii (2003) were also shot in studios in Tunis.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nThe city holds several festivals each year, of which the largest is the International Festival of Carthage which takes place in July and August. Founded in 1964, much of the festival is held in an old amphitheater of Carthage (with a capacity of 7,500 seats), and hosts the performances of singers, musicians, actors, dancers and films on display on outdoor screens.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nTunis and its suburbs have many of the major Tunisian universities including the University of Tunis, Tunisia Private University, University of Ez-Zitouna, the University of Tunis \u2013 El Manar, the University of Carthage and the Manouba University. It therefore has the highest concentration of students in Tunisia, with a student population of 75,597 as of 2006.\n\nThere are also a number of other post-secondary institutions, such as the National School of Engineers of Tunis, the National School of Science, the Graduate School of Communications of Tunis, and the Higher Institute of Technological Studies in Communications of Tunis. In addition, private training institutes include the Open University of Tunis, the Central University Private Business Administration and Technology, the Graduate School of Private Engineering and Technology, and the North African Institute of Economics and Technology.\nAmong the high schools in the capital, the best-known are the Lyc\u00e9e de la Rue du Pacha (founded 1900), Lyc\u00e9e Bab El Khadhra, Lyc\u00e9e de la Rue de Russie, Lyc\u00e9e Bourguiba (formerly Lyc\u00e9e Carnot de Tunis), and the Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui. Until independence, Sadiki College (founded 1875) and Khaldounia (founded 1896) were also among the most recognized. A legacy of the French presence in the country remains, and the city retains many French schools, the most important being the Lyc\u00e9e Pierre Mendes-France at Mutuelleville.\nStudents can pursue language studies at small private schools such as Sidi Bou Said Centre for Languages (Centre Sidi Bou Said de Langues et d'Informatique) in the picturesque Tunis suburb of Sidi Bou Said, next to the Sidi Bou Said TGM station that specializes in Arabic, offering classes in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), classical Arabic, Tunisian Arabic and the various dialects of North Africa, the Gulf and the Levant.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nTunis has some of the most important libraries in Tunisia including the National Library of Tunisia which was first installed in 1924 in the Medina, in a building built in 1810 by Hammouda Bey to serve as barracks for troops and then a jail.  The library moved to its current location on Boulevard 9 April in 1938. The new building contains a reading room, conference room, laboratories, an exhibition gallery, a block of technical and administrative services, a restaurant, a parking and green space areas.\nHoused in a former home of a Hafsid scholar, the library of the Khaldounia was founded in 1896 along with the creation of the educational institution. After independence and following the consolidation of programs of education, the association ceased operations but the library is now linked to the National Library, which provides for its management.Built in the 17th century, the Dar Ben Achour also contains a library. Acquired in the late 1970s by the municipality of Tunis, the house was restored in 1983 into a library.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nTunis is served by the Tunis-Carthage International Airport. The growing metropolitan area is served by an extensive network of public transportation including buses, an above-ground light rail system (le Metro), as well a regional train line (the TGM) that links the city centre to its closest northern suburbs. Multi-lane autoroutes surround the city and serve the increasing number of privately owned cars one encounters in Tunisia.\nThe Tunis area is served by the m\u00e9tro l\u00e9ger (Ar.: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0631\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0641\u064a\u0641 \u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633) and TGM (Tunis-Goulette-Marsa), as well as bus services, and is linked to other places in Tunisia by SNCFT, the national railways. The important transport authorities are the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Transports de Tunis (STT) and the Ministry of Transport (Airports)\n\nThe A1 motorway connects Tunis with Sfax to the south, and the A3 with Oued Zarga and B\u00e9ja to the west, while the A4 is the link with Bizerte.\nThe city has, as of the beginning of the 21st century, a public transportation system developed under the management of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des transports de Tunis (STT). In addition to some 200 bus routes, the first light rail line opened in 1985. The M\u00e9tro l\u00e9ger de Tunis network has extended gradually since then to reach the suburbs. The capital is also linked to its northern suburbs by the railway line that crosses the lake, dividing the lake into two.\nA new mass transit was planned for Greater Tunis in 2009. This was the RTS (rapid rail network), the local equivalent of the Paris RER, which was to carry tens of thousands of travellers from the distant suburbs of Tunis to the centre by using either existing tracks or new tracks yet to be built. The plan was for lines based on certain criteria such as population density and the lack of coverage for a given area. Among the priority lines were: Tunis-Borj C\u00e9dria (23 km) where modernization and electrification are already planned; Tunis-Mohamedia-Fouchana (19.4 km); Tunis-Manouba-Mnihla (19.2 km); Tunis-Ezzouhour-Sidi Hassine S\u00e9joumi (13.9 km). In addition, the TGM will be integrated into the light-rail network and a new line built around Ayn Zaghouan and Bhar Lazrag (8.4 km). Such an operation would require the upgrading of the docks' TGM stations so that they become suitable for light rail trains. Among other projects are a line to the city of Ennasr (8.4 km) and the extension of the Tunis-Ettadhamen to Mnihla (1.7 km). For its part, the south light-rail line was extended in November 2008 to El Mourouj with a length of 6.8 kilometres (4.2 miles). The total length of the network will eventually be in the range of 84 km (52 mi).\n\n\n=== Infrastructure ===\n\nTunis is served by Tunis-Carthage International Airport, located 8 kilometers (5.0 mi) northeast of downtown, which began operating in 1940 under the name of Tunis El Aouina.  The terminal had 4.4 million passengers (35.98% of total airport traffic in the country) in 2006.  In 2007 that increased to 6 million passengers with a rise in tourism to the city.\nAfter independence, in the 1960s, the National Board of Seaports, which supports all ports in the country, modernized the infrastructure of the port of Tunis.  In the 21st Century, the port of Tunis underwent further transformation with a marina as part of the redevelopment district of La Petite Sicile.\nTunis is the starting point from which the main roads and all highways that serve different parts of the country of Tunis originate.  This city has a high density of traffic because vehicle ownership is rising at 7.5% per year.  The capital is home to approximately 40% of the cars in Tunisia, with 700,000 cars on average used in the city per day.  In this context, major road infrastructure (bridges, interchanges, roads, etc..) was initiated in the late 1990s to decongest the main areas of the capital.  The main roads to other Tunisian cities include: Autoroute A1, Tunis-Sfax; Autoroute A3, Tunis-Oued Zarga; and Autoroute A4, Tunis-Bizerte. Also, as part of the major infrastructure project, the city's traffic lights were increased from 5,000 to 7,500.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, a number of sports institutions were established in Tunis, particularly in school and college settings. In 1905 the Muslim Association of Tunisia brought together students from Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui and Sadiki College to organize gymnastics. A regional gymnastics competition was held in Tunis in 1912 with the participation of thousands of French gymnasts. Football made its appearance in the capital on 15 September 1904, followed by the formal creation of the country's first league, the Racing Club Tunis, on 11 May 1905. It took some time to run properly but soon organized meetings between the teams in schools. The first took place on 9 June 1907, between teams from Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui and Lyc\u00e9e Carnot (1\u20131).\nBut football is not the only discipline to emerge. Between 1928 and 1955 the city hosted nine rounds of the Grand Prix of Tunis, where notable drivers such as Marcel Lehoux, Achille Varzi, Tazio Nuvolari and Rudolf Caracciola took part. The Grand Prix of Tunis has re-emerged since 2000. The city has also held the Mediterranean Games twice, in 1967 and 2001, and the international tennis tournament, the Tunis Open, which is included in the ATP Challenger Series. The 2005 World Championship final for men in team handball was played in Tunis.\nIn total the governorate of Tunis registered 24,095 licences for various clubs in the municipal area in 2007. The city further put itself onto the international basketball map as it hosted the FIBA Africa Championship 1965 and the FIBA Africa Championship 1987.\n\nThe Esperance Sportive de Tunis (EST), Club Africain (CA), and Stade Tunisien are the major sports clubs in the city. A symbolic class difference is present between the EST's and the CA's supporters, despite their playing at the same stadium. The EST is supported by the majority of the masses, while the CA, a poorer club, is supported by the others.\nThe first true sports facilities were managed under the French protectorate, as illustrated by the development of the Ksar Said racecourse and construction of the Stade Chedli Zouiten in the neighborhood of Belvedere, which had long been the main stadium in the capital before being supplanted by the Olympic stadium, Stade El Menzah, where EST and CA play their football today. The Olympic stadium and village area was built to accommodate the Mediterranean Games in 1967. A 60,000-seat stadium was also built in Rad\u00e8s for the Mediterranean Games in 2001 at an estimated cost of 170 million dinars, with nearly half of the loans financed by South Korean businessmen. The Olympic village was financed by an investment estimated at 50 million dinars.  In 2008, the government announced the start of construction of a large sports complex that will include several sports academies, a 20,000-seat stadium, and a swimming centre. Known as Tunis Sports City, it will expand around the lake of Tunis, on the road to La Marsa.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nTunis is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Other cooperations ===\n\n\n== Notable inhabitants ==\n\nIbn Khaldun (1332\u20131406), Arab sociologist and scholar\nTahar Haddad (1899\u20131935), promoter of women's emancipation in Tunisia\nAlbert Memmi (1920-2020), French writer and sociologist\nSalah El Mahdi (1925\u20132014), musicologist and composer\nAlberto Pellegrino (1930\u20131996), Italian fencer\nPhillip King (born 1934), British sculptor\nFouad Mebazaa (born 1933), politician, President of Tunisia in 2011\nNicola Pietrangeli (born 1933), Italian tennis player\nPierre Darmon (born 1934), French tennis player\nGeorges Wolinski (1934\u20132015), French illustrator and caricaturist\nRoberto Blanco (born 1937), German pop singer and actor\nYazid Zerhouni (born 1937), Algerian politician\nClaudia Cardinale (born 1938), Italian actress\nFatma Moalla (born 1939), mathematician\nMustapha Ben Jafar (born 1940), Tunisian politician\nAlain Boublil (born 1941), French musical author\nAbdelwahab Meddeb (1946\u20132014), Tunisian-French writer and radio staff\nSerge Adda (1948\u20132004), president of the French TV channel TV5\nSophie Bessis, (born 1947), Franco-Tunisian historian, journalist and researcher\nTarak Ben Ammar (born 1949), film producer\nBertrand Delano\u00eb (born 1950), mayor of Paris\nKarine Chemla (born 1958), historian of mathematics and sinologist\nAbdellatif Kechiche (born 1960), French film director, screenwriter and actor\nChokri El Ouaer (born 1966), Tunisian football goalkeeper\nAmel Karboul (born 1973), Tunisian entrepreneur, business consultant and politician\nMarc Gicquel (born 1977), French tennis player\nKhaled Mouelhi (born 1981), Tunisian footballer\nKarim Saidi (born 1983), Tunisian footballer\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBarbary pirates\nTunisian Community Center\nTunisian Italians\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nJellal Abdelkafi, La m\u00e9dina de Tunis, \u00e9d.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Tourbet el Bey (Arabic: \u062a\u0631\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u064a\u200e) is a Tunisian royal mausoleum in the southwest of the medina of Tunis at rue Tourbet el Bey 62.It is the last resting place of most of the Husainid dynasty rulers of Tunisia.  Among those not buried there are the last two - Moncef Bey, who is buried in the Jellaz Cemetery and Lamine Bey who is buried in La Marsa. The building,  constructed in the reign of Ali II ibn Hussein (1759-1782) is the largest funerary monument in Tunis. The first tourba of Al-Husayn I ibn Ali stands opposite it.\n\n\n== Royal mausoleum ==\nThe building is topped with domes, the main ones covered with green tortoiseshell-shaped tiles, and the facades are of ochre sandstone, decorated at regular intervals by pilasters and Italian-style entablatures in light-coloured stone. They correspond with the different funerary chambers inside which house the tombs of the ruling family and their wives, as well as of a number of their ministers and servants. The tombs, dug into the ground, are covered with marble chests ornamented in bas relief. The sarcophagi of the men have regularly-shaped columns bearing inscriptions, topped with a fez or a turban. Those of the women have marble plaques at each end, one of which carries an inscription.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Architecture and interior decoration ==\nThe monument is entered through a large hall which shows a distinct Italian influence in its decoration, mixed with Ottoman style, notably in the chamber of the beys. The mausoleum, which comprises eight funerary chambers covered with cupolas, is built around two patios.  These are covered in slabs, and surrounded by porticos which rest on pillars of Carrara marble with neo-doric capitals. These patios open, on each side, into a funerary chamber.  Some of these chambers are also linked directly to each other.\n\nThe south-west side opens into the chamber of the Beys, the most important chamber in the complex, housing the tombs of thirteen reigning Beys. The chamber is square, with walls fifteen metres long, and it replicates the proportions of an Ottoman mosque: four large cruciform pillars support a large central cupola which is slightly bulbous in form and flanked by four demi-cupolas on the sides and four in the corners. The only other building with this form in the medina of Tunis is the Sidi Mahrez mosque. The intricate decoration of the room blends Italian, Ottoman and local influences; the lower parts of the walls and the pillars are covered in panels of polychrome marble marquetry to a height of 2.5 metres, while finely-sculpted plaster lines the caps of the cupolas.The ceilings of the mausoleum, either vaults or cupolas, are ornamented with stucco in geometric or plant designs. Some of these are polychrome, with the richness of the colours denoting the rank of the people buried in the chamber. One in particular is surprising in its architectural form - a large oval cupola.  The walls are generally covered with ceramic tiles in orange and yellow hues, some of which were imported from Italy, particularly from Naples, while others are of local manufacture, from the Qallaline workshops.  The chamber of the reigning Beys is the only one richly decorated with polychrome marble in the Italian style.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Conservation ==\n\nFor around thirty years the tourbet was abandoned and even partly squatted for a time and its roof structures and rich decorations deteriorated. In the 1990s the National Heritage Institute\n(INP) began restoration work and opened a ticket office to allow visitors. Nevertheless, it seems that the upkeep of the building continues to leave much to be desired. Care of this monument depends ultimately on the Tunisian Culture Ministry through the National Heritage Institute and the Agency for the Development of National Heritage and Cultural Promotion.\n\n\n== See also ==\n(buried in Tourbet el Bey)\n\nMustapha Dinguizli\nM'hamed Djellouli\nMustapha Khaznadar\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMohamed El Aziz Ben Achour, \u00ab Tourbet-el-Bey, s\u00e9pulture des beys et de la famille husaynite \u00e0 Tunis \u00bb, IBLA, 1985\n\n\n== External links ==\nvideo of the interior of Tourbet El Bey\nvirtual visit to the Tourbet El Bey\nAgency for the Development of National Heritage and Cultural Protection\nUNESCO site on the Tunis Medina",

        "wiki": "Tunis (Arabic: \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633\u200e T\u016bnis) is the capital and largest city of Tunisia. The greater metropolitan area of Tunis, often referred to as \"Grand Tunis\", has about 2,700,000 inhabitants, making it the third-largest city in the Maghreb region (after Casablanca and Algiers) and the sixteenth-largest in the Arab world. \nSituated on a large Mediterranean Sea gulf (the Gulf of Tunis), behind the Lake of Tunis and the port of La Goulette (\u1e24alq il-W\u0101d), the city extends along the coastal plain and the hills that surround it. At its core lies its ancient medina, a World Heritage Site. East of the medina through the Sea Gate (also known as the Bab el Bhar and the Porte de France) begins the modern city, or Ville Nouvelle, traversed by the grand Avenue Habib Bourguiba (often referred to by popular press and travel guides as \"the Tunisian Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\"), where the colonial-era buildings provide a clear contrast to smaller, older structures. Further east by the sea lie the suburbs of Carthage, La Marsa, and Sidi Bou Said. As the capital city of the country, Tunis is the focus of Tunisian political and administrative life and also the centre of the country's commercial and cultural activities. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nTunis is the transcription of the Arabic name \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633 which can be pronounced as \"T\u016bnus\", \"T\u016bnas\", or \"T\u016bnis\". All three variations were mentioned by the Greek-Syrian geographer al-Rumi Yaqout in his Mu'jam al-B\u00fbldan (Dictionary of Countries).\nDifferent explanations exist for the origin of the name Tunis. Some scholars relate it to the Phoenician goddess Tanith ('Tanit or Tanut), as many ancient cities were named after patron deities. Some scholars claim that it originated from Tynes, which was mentioned by Diodorus Siculus and Polybius in the course of descriptions of a location resembling present-day Al-Kasbah; Tunis's old Berber Bourgade.Another possibility is that it was derived from the Berber verbal root ens which means \"to lie down\" or \"to pass the night\". The term Tunis can possibly mean \"camp at night\", \"camp\", or \"stop\", or may have referred to as \"the last stop before Carthage\" by people who were journeying to Carthage by land. There are also some mentions in ancient Roman sources of such names of nearby towns as Tuniza (now El Kala), Thunusuda (now Sidi-Meskin), Thinissut (now Bir Bouregba), and Thunisa (now Ras Jebel). As all of these Berber villages were situated on Roman roads, they undoubtedly served as rest-stations or stops.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Carthage ===\n\nThe historical study of Carthage is problematic. Because its culture and records were destroyed by the Romans at the end of the Third Punic War, very few Carthaginian primary historical sources survive. While there are a few ancient translations of Punic texts into Greek and Latin, as well as inscriptions on monuments and buildings discovered in Northwest Africa, the main sources are Greek and Roman historians, including Livy, Polybius, Appian, Cornelius Nepos, Silius Italicus, Plutarch, Dio Cassius, and Herodotus. These writers belonged to peoples in competition, and often in conflict, with Carthage. Greek cities contended with Carthage over Sicily, and the Romans fought three wars against Carthage. Not surprisingly, their accounts of Carthage are extremely hostile; while there are a few Greek authors who took a favourable view, these works have been lost.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nTunis was originally a Berber settlement. The existence of the town is attested by sources dating from the 4th century BC. Situated on a hill, Tunis served as an excellent point from which the comings and goings of naval and caravan traffic to and from Carthage could be observed. Tunis was one of the first towns in the region to fall under Carthaginian control, and in the centuries that followed Tunis was mentioned in the military histories associated with Carthage. Thus, during Agathocles' expedition, which landed at Cape Bon in 310 BC, Tunis changed hands on various occasions.During the Mercenary War, it is possible that Tunis served as a center for the native population of the area, and that its population was mainly composed of peasants, fishermen, and craftsmen. Compared to the ancient ruins of Carthage, the ruins of ancient Tunis are not as large. According to Strabo, it was destroyed by the Romans in 146 BC during the Third Punic War. Both Tunis and Carthage were destroyed; Tunis, however, was rebuilt first under the rule of Augustus and became an important town under Roman control and the center of a booming agricultural industry. The city is mentioned in the Tabula Peutingeriana as Thuni. In the system of Roman roads for the Roman province of Africa, Tunis had the title of mutatio (\"way station, resting place\"). Tunis, increasingly Romanized, was also eventually Christianized and became the seat of a bishop. However, Tunis remained modestly sized compared to Carthage during this time.\n\n\n=== Early Islamic period ===\n\nWhen the Arab Muslim troops conquered the region at the end of the 7th century, they established themselves at the outskirts of ancient Tunes, and the small town soon became the city of Tunis that could easily be taken for an Arab foundation. The medina of Tunis, the oldest section of the city, dates from this period, during which the region was conquered by the Umayyad emir Hasan ibn al-Nu'man al-Ghasani. The city had the natural advantage of coastal access, via the Mediterranean, to the major ports of southern Europe. Early on, Tunis played a military role; the Arabs recognized the strategic importance of its proximity to the Strait of Sicily. From the beginning of the 8th century Tunis was the chef-lieu of the area: it became the Arabs' naval base in the western Mediterranean Sea, and took on considerable military importance. Under the Aghlabids, the people of Tunis revolted numerous times, but the city benefited from economic improvements and quickly became the second most important in the kingdom. It was briefly the national capital, from the end of the reign of Ibrahim II in 902, until 909 when control over Ifriqiya was lost to the newly founded Fatimid Caliphate.\nLocal opposition to the authorities began to intensify in September 945, when Kharijite insurgents occupied Tunis, resulting in general pillaging. With the rise of the Zirid dynasty Tunis gained importance, but the Sunni population tolerated Shi'ite rule less and less, and carried out massacres against the Shi'ite community. In 1048 the Zirid ruler Al-Muizz ibn Badis rejected his city's obedience to the Fatimids and re-established Sunni rites throughout all of Ifriqiya. This decision infuriated the Shi'ite caliph Al-Mustansir Billah. To punish the Zirids, he unleashed the Banu Hilal Arab tribe on Ifriqiya; a large part of the country was set to the torch, the Zirid capital Kairouan was razed in 1057, and only a few coastal towns, including Tunis and Mahdia, escaped destruction. Exposed to violence from the hostile tribes that settled around the city, the population of Tunis repudiated the authority of the Zirids and swore allegiance to the Hammadid prince El Nacer ibn Alennas, who was based in B\u00e9ja\u00efa, in 1059. The governor appointed by B\u00e9ja\u00efa, having reestablished order in the country, did not hesitate to free himself from the Hammadids to found the Khurasanid dynasty with Tunis as its capital. This small independent kingdom picked up the threads of trade and commerce with other nations, and brought the region back to peace and prosperity.\n\n\n=== New capital of Tunisia ===\nIn 1159, the Almohad 'Abd al-Mu'min took Tunis, overthrew the last Khurasanid leader and installed a new government in the kasbah of Tunis. The Almohad conquest marked the beginning of the dominance of the city in Tunisia. Having previously played a minor role behind Kairouan and Mahdia, Tunis was promoted to the rank of provincial capital.\nIn 1228, Governor Abu Zakariya seized power and, a year later, took the title of Emir and founded the Hafsid dynasty. The city became the capital of a Hafsid kingdom stretching towards Tripoli and Fez. Walls were built to protect the emerging principal town of the kingdom, surrounding the medina, the kasbah and the new suburbs of Tunis. In 1270 the city was taken briefly by Louis IX of France, who was hoping to convert the Hafsid sovereign to Christianity. King Louis easily captured Carthage, but his army soon fell victim to an outbreak of dysentery. Louis himself died before the walls of the capital and the army was forced out.  At the same time, driven by the reconquest of Spain, the first Andalusian Muslims and Jews arrived in Tunis and would become of importance to the economic prosperity of the Hafsid capital and the development of its intellectual life.During the Almohad and Hafsid periods Tunis was one of the richest and grandest cities in the Islamic world, with a population of about 100,000.\nDuring this period, one of the famous travellers to Tunis was Ibn Battuta. In his travel account, when Ibn Battuta and his group arrived in Tunis, the population of the city came out to meet him and the other the members of his party. They all greeted them and were very curious, many were asking questions, however, no one in Tunis personally greeted Ibn Battuta, greatly upsetting him. He felt very lonely and could not hold back the tears coming from his eyes. This went on for a while until one of the pilgrims realized he was upset, he went up and greeted and talked to Ibn until he entered the city. At the time, the Sultan of Tunis was Abu Yahya and during Ibn Battuta's stay, the Festival of the Breaking of the Fast was taking place. The people in the city assembled in large numbers to celebrate the festival, in extravagant and most luxurious outfits. Abu Yahya arrived on horseback, where all of his relatives joined him. After the performance, the people returned to their homes.\n\n\n=== Spanish occupation and Ottoman control ===\n\nThe Ottoman Empire took nominal control of Tunis in 1534 when Hayreddin Barbarossa captured it from the Hafsid Sultan Mulai Hassan, who fled to the court of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. Charles, suffering losses from the corsairs operating out of Djerba, Tunis, and Algiers, agreed to reinstate Mulai Hassan in exchange for his acceptance of Spanish suzerainty. A naval expedition led by Charles himself was dispatched in 1535, and the city was recaptured. The victory against the corsairs is recorded in a tapestry at the Royal Palace of Madrid. The Spanish governor of La Goulette, Luys Peres Varga,  fortified the island of Chikly in the lake of Tunis to strengthen the city's defences between 1546 and 1550. \n\n \nThe Ottoman Ulu\u00e7 Ali Reis, at the head of an army of janissaries and Kabyles, retook Tunis in 1569. However, following the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the Spanish under John of Austria succeeded in retaking the city and re-establishing the Hafsid sovereign in October 1573. Following these conflicts, the city finally fell into Ottoman hands in August 1574. Having become an Ottoman province governed by a Pasha who was appointed by the Sultan based in Constantinople, the country attained a degree of autonomy. After 1591, the Ottoman governors (Beys) were relatively independent, and both piracy and trade continued to flourish. Under the rule of deys and Moorish beys, the capital sprang into new life. Its population grew by additions from various ethnicities, among which were Moorish refugees from Spain, and economic activities diversified. To traditional industry and trade with distant lands was added the activity of the Barbary pirates, then in their golden age. Profits obtained from the trade in Christian slaves allowed the rulers to build sumptuous structures that revived the architectural heritage of the Middle Ages.\n\nIn April 1655 the English admiral Robert Blake was sent to the Mediterranean to extract compensation from states that had been attacking English shipping. Only the Bey of Tunis refused to comply, with the result that Blake's fifteen ships attacked the Bey's arsenal at Porto Farina (Ghar el Melh), destroying nine Algerian ships and two shore batteries, the first time in naval warfare that shore batteries had been eliminated without landing men ashore.\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Tunisia entered into a new period in its history with the advent of the Husainid dynasty. Successive Husainid rulers made great progress in developing the city and its buildings. During this period, the city prospered as a centre of commerce. Taking advantage of divisions within the ruling house, Algerians captured Tunis in 1756 and put the country under supervision. Hammouda Bey faced bombardment by the Venetian fleet, and the city experienced a rebellion in 1811. Under the reign of Hussein Bey II, naval defeats by the British (1826) and French (1827) saw the French become increasingly active in the city and in the economy.Various sources estimate the 19th-century population to have ranged from 90,000 to 110,000 inhabitants. During the later 19th century, Tunis became increasingly populated by Europeans, particularly the French, and immigration dramatically increased the size of the city. This resulted in the first demolition of the old city walls, from 1860, to accommodate growth in the suburbs. The city spilled outside the area of the earlier town and the banks of the lake, and the new districts were modernised with running water (1860), lighting gas (1872), roads, waste collection (1873), and communication with adjacent suburbs and the city centre. The crafts and traditional trades declined somewhat, as the newcomers increased trade with Europe, introducing the first modern industries and new forms of urban life.\n\n\n=== Development under the French protectorate ===\n\nThe creation of the French protectorate in 1881 was a turning point in Tunis's history, leading to rapid redevelopment of the city in the span of two to three decades. The city quickly spread out of its fortifications: it divided into a traditional Arab-populated old city, and a new city populated by immigrants, with a different structure from that of the traditional medina. Tunis also benefited from French construction of a water supply, natural gas and electricity networks, public transport services and other public infrastructure.\nUnder French rule, a substantial number of Europeans settled (like the Tunisian Italians); half of the population was European in origin. The city expanded and created new boulevards and neighborhoods.\nTunis was quiet during the First World War. After the war, the city faced new transformations as the modern portion grew in importance and extended its network of boulevards and streets in all directions. In addition, a series of satellite cities emerged on the urban rim and encroached on the municipality of Tunis proper. In the economic sphere, commercial activities expanded and diversified as modern industries continued to grow, while traditional industry continued to decline.\nDuring World War II, Tunis was held by Axis forces from November 1942 to May 1943. It was their last base in Africa, as they retreated towards Sicily after being surrounded by Allied forces from Algeria to the west and from Libya to the east. \nOn 7 May 1943, at about 15:30 in the afternoon, Tunis fell to troops of British 1st Army and the U.S. 1st Army, which had defeated the German 5th Panzer Army guarding the city. At midday on 20 May 1943, the Allies held a victory parade on Avenue Mar\u00e9chal Galli\u00e9ni, and Avenue Jules Ferry, to signal the end of fighting in North Africa.Having succeeded in driving the Axis powers out of Tunisia, the Allies used Tunis as a base of operations from which to stage amphibious assaults first against the island of Pantelleria, and then Sicily, and finally the mainland of Italy.\n\n\n=== Growth since independence ===\n\nAfter independence in 1956, Tunis consolidated its role as the capital, first with the establishment of a constitution stating that the Chamber of Deputies and the Presidency of the Republic must have their headquarters in Tunis and its suburbs. In a very short time, the colonial city transformed rapidly. As the city has grown and native Tunisians gradually began to replace the extensive European population, conflict between the Arab city and the European city has gradually decreased with the arabization of the population.\nBecause of population pressure and the rate of migration to the capital, the city continued to grow, even with the creation of new districts in the suburbs. Old buildings have gradually been renovated and upgraded and new buildings have come to influence the urban landscape. At the same time, an active policy of industrialization is developing the municipal economy.\nThe Arab League was headquartered in Tunis from 1979 to 1990. The Arab League, which represents 22 Arab nations, transferred its headquarters to Tunis in 1979 because of Egypt's peace with Israel but has been headquartered back in Egypt since 1990.\nThe Palestine Liberation Organization also had its headquarters in Tunis, from 1982 to 2003.\nIn 1985, the PLO's headquarters was bombed by Israeli Air Force F-15s, killing approximately 60 people.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nMany protests took place during the Arab Spring of 2011\u201312.\nOn 18 March 2015, two gunmen attacked the Bardo National Museum and held hostages. Twenty civilians and one policeman were killed in the attack, while around 50 others were injured. Five Japanese, two Colombians, and visitors from Italy, Poland, and Spain were among the dead. Both gunmen were killed by Tunisian police. The incident has been treated as a terrorist attack.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTunis is located in north-eastern Tunisia on the Lake of Tunis, and is connected to the Mediterranean sea's Gulf of Tunis by a canal which terminates at the port of La Goulette/Halq al Wadi. The ancient city of Carthage is located just north of Tunis along the coastal part. The city lies on a similar latitude as the southernmost points of Europe.\nThe city of Tunis is built on a hill slope down to the lake of Tunis. These hills contain places such as Notre-Dame de Tunis, Ras Tabia, La Rabta, La Kasbah, Montfleury and La Manoubia with altitudes just above 50 metres (160 feet). The city is located at the crossroads of a narrow strip of land between Lake Tunis and S\u00e9joumi. The isthmus between them is what geologists call the \"Tunis dome\", which includes hills of limestone and sediments. It forms a natural bridge and since ancient times several major roads linking to Egypt and elsewhere in Tunisia have branched out from it. The roads also connect with Carthage, emphasising its political and economic importance not only in Tunisia but more widely in North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea in ancient times.\nThe Greater Tunis area has an area of 300,000 hectares, 30,000 of which is urbanized, the rest being shared between bodies of water (20,000 hectares of lakes or lagoons) and agricultural or natural land (250,000 hectares). However, urban growth, which is estimated to be increasing by 500 hectares per year, is gradually changing the landscape with urban sprawl.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Suburbs ===\nAfter World War II, suburbs began to rapidly spring up on the outskirts of Tunis. These form a large percentage of the population of the Tunis metropolitan area. It grew from 27% of the total population in 1956, to 37% in 1975 and 50% in 2006.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTunis has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa), characterized by hot and dry, prolonged summers and mild winters with moderate rainfall. The local climate is also affected somewhat by the latitude of the city, the moderating influence of the Mediterranean sea and the terrain of the hills.\nWinter is the wettest season of the year, when more than a third of the annual rainfall falls during this period, raining on average every two or three days.  The sun may still increase the temperature from 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F) in the morning to 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) in the afternoon on average during the winter. Frosts are rare.  In spring, rainfall declines by half.  The sunshine becomes dominant in May when it reaches 10 hours a day on average.  In March temperatures may vary between 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F) and 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), and between 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) and 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) in May. However, it is common for temperatures to soar even as early as April with record temperatures reaching 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F).  In summer, rain is almost completely absent and the sunlight is at a maximum.  The average temperatures in the summer months of June, July, August, and September are very high. Sea breezes may mitigate the heat, but sometimes the sirocco winds reverse the trend.  In autumn, it begins to rain, often with short thunderstorms, which can sometimes cause flash floods or even flood some parts of the city.  The month of November marks a break in the general heat with average temperatures ranging from 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) to 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Capital ===\n\nTunis has been the capital of Tunisia since 1159. Under Articles 43 and 24 of the Constitution of 1959, Tunis and its suburbs host the national institutions: the Presidential Palace, which is known as Carthage Palace, residence of the President of Tunisia, the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Advisors and parliament, the Constitutional Council and the main judicial institutions  and public bodies. The revised Tunisian Constitution of 2014 similarly provides that the National Assembly is to sit in Tunis (article 51) and that the Presidency is based there (article 73).\n\n\n=== Municipality ===\n\n\n==== Institutions ====\n\nFollowing the municipal elections of 6 May 2018, Ennahdha obtained 21 seats out of 60. Nidaa Tounes came second with 17 seats. On 3 July 2018, the head of the Ennahdha list Souad Abderrahim was elected by the council as the new mayor of the capital.\nBefore 2011, unlike other mayors in Tunisia, the mayor of Tunis is appointed by decree of the President of the Republic from among the members of the City Council.\n\n\n==== Budget ====\nThe 2008 budget adopted by the City Council is structured as follows: 61.61 million dinars for operations and 32,516 million dinars for investment. It reflects the improved financial situation of the municipality, the year 2007 was a year registering a surplus in resources that allowed the settlement of debts of the municipality and the strengthening of its credibility with respect its suppliers and public and private partners.\nRevenues are generated by the proceeds of taxes on buildings and vacant lots, fees for the rental of municipal property, income from the operation of the public, advertising, and that the fact that the municipality has capital shares in some companies. On the expenditure side, provision is made for the consolidation of hygiene and cleanliness, the state of the environment and urban design, infrastructure maintenance, rehabilitation and renovation of facilities, and strengthening the logistics and means of work and transport.\n\n\n==== Administrative divisions ====\n\nThe city of Tunis, whose size has increased significantly during the second half of the 20th century, now extends beyond the Tunis Governorate into parts of the governorates of Ben Arous, Ariana and Manouba.\nThe municipality of Tunis is divided into 15 municipal districts:  These include El Bab Bhar, Bab Souika, Cit\u00e9 El Khadra, Jelloud Jebel El Kabaria, El Menzah, El Ouardia, Ettahrir, Ezzouhour, Hra\u00efria, Medina, El Omrane, El Omrane Higher S\u00e9joumi, Sidi El-Bashir and Sidi Hassine.\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nIn the years following independence, the population of the metropolitan area continued to grow: by 21.1% from 1956 to 1966 and by 28.5% from 1966 to 1975 (55.6% between 1956 and 1975). This steady growth was accompanied by changes which affected the nature of the settlement of the capital. Decolonization led to the exodus of some European minorities whose numbers dwindled every year. The gaps created by their departure were filled by Tunisians who emigrated to Tunis from other parts of the country.\nThe population of the city of Tunis exceeds 2,000,000 inhabitants. After independence, the Tunisian government implemented a plan to cope with population growth of the city and country, a system of family planning, to attempt to lower the rate of population growth. However, between 1994 and 2004, the population of the governorate of Tunis grew more than 1.03% per annum. It represents, in the 2004 census, 9.9% of the total population of Tunisia. As in the rest of Tunisia, literacy in the region of Tunis evolved rapidly during the second half of the 20th century and has reached a level slightly higher than the national average. The education level is only exceeded by the neighbouring governorate of Ariana which has many institutions of education.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nProducts include textiles, carpets, and olive oil. Tourism also provides a significant portion of the city's income.\nBecause of the concentration of political authority (headquarters of the central government, presidency, parliament, ministries and central government) and culture (festivals and mainstream media), Tunis is the only nationally ranking metropolis. Tunis is the heartland of the Tunisian economy and is the industrial and economic hub of the country, home to one third of Tunisian companies\u2014including almost all the head offices of companies with more than fifty employees, with the exception of the Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa, headquartered in Gafsa\u2014and produces a third of the national gross domestic product.  Tunis attracts foreign investors (33% of companies, 26% of investments and 27% of employment), excluding several areas due to economic imbalances. According to the Mercer 2017 Cost of Living Rankings, Tunis has the lowest cost of living for expatriates in the world. The urban unemployment rate of university graduates is increasing and the illiteracy rate remains high among the elderly (27% of women and 12% of men). The number of people living below the poverty line, falling at the national level, remains higher in urban areas. In addition, unemployment is high in young people aged 18 to 24, with one in three unemployed as compared to one in six at the national level. In Greater Tunis, the proportion of young unemployed is at 35%.Gulf finance house or GFH has invested $10 billion in order for the construction of tunis financial harbor, that will transform Tunisia as the gateway to Africa from Europe. The project hopes to boost the economy of Tunisia as well as increase the number of tourists visiting Tunisia annually. The project is going through planning.\n\n\n=== Sectors ===\nThe economic structure of Tunis, as well as that of the country, is overwhelmingly tertiary industry.  The city is the largest financial center in the country hosting the headquarters of 65% of financial companies \u2013 while the industrial sectors are gradually declining in importance.  However the secondary industry is still very represented and Tunis hosts 85% of industrial establishments in the four governorates, with a trend towards the spread of specialized industrial zones in the suburbs.\nPrimary industry such as agriculture, however, is active in specialized agricultural areas on the suburbs, particularly in the wine and olive oil industries. The generally flat terrain and the two main rivers in Tunisia, the Medjerda to the north and the Milian to the south, the soils are fertile.  Tunis has several large plains, the most productive are in Ariana and La Soukra (north), the plain of Manouba (west) and the plain of Mornag (south).  In addition, groundwater is easily accessible through the drilling of deep wells, providing water for the different agriculture crops. The soils are heavy and contain limestone in the north but are lighter and sandy containing clay in the south.  There is much diversification in the municipality of Tunis, with Durum grown in Manouba, Olives and olive oil in Ariana and Mornag, wine (Mornag), and fruit, vegetable and legumes are grown in all regions.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Architecture and landscape ==\n\n\n=== Urban landscape ===\n\nThe Medina, built on a gentle hill slope on the way down to the Lake of Tunis, is the historical heart of the city and home to many monuments, including palaces, such as the Dar Ben Abdallah and Dar Hussein, the mausoleum of Tourbet el Bey or many mosques such as the Al-Zaytuna Mosque. Some of the fortifications around it have now largely disappeared, and it is flanked by the two suburbs of Bab Souika to the north and Bab El Jazira to the south. Located near the Bab Souika, the neighborhood of Halfaouine which gained international attention through the film 'Halfaouine Child of the Terraces'.\nBut east of the original nucleus, first with the construction of the French Consulate, the modern city was built gradually with the introduction of the French protectorate at the end of the 19th century, on open land between the city and the lake. The axis to the structure of this part of the city is the Avenue Habib Bourguiba, designed by the French to be a Tunisian form of Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris with its cafes, major hotels, shops and cultural venues. On both sides of the tree lines avenue, north and south, the city was extended in various districts, with the northern end welcoming residential and business districts while the south receives industrial districts and poorer peoples.\nSouth-east of the Avenue Bourguiba the district of La Petite Sicile (Little Sicily) is adjacent to the old port area and takes its name from its original population of workers from Italy. It is now the subject of a redevelopment project including the construction of twin towers. North of the Avenue Bourguiba is the district of La Fayette, which is still home to the Great Synagogue of Tunis and the Habib Thameur Gardens, built on the site of an ancient Jewish cemetery which lay outside the walls. Also to the north is the long Avenue Mohamed V, which leads to the Boulevard of 7 November through the neighborhood of the big banks where there are hotels and Abu Nawas Lake and finally to the Belvedere area around the place Pasteur. This is where the Belvedere Park lies, the largest in the city, and home to a zoo and the Pasteur Institute founded by Adrien Loir in 1893. Continuing to the north are the most exclusive neighborhoods of Mutuelleville which house the French Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-Mend\u00e8s-France, the Sheraton Hotel and some embassies.\nStill further north of the Belvedere Park, behind the Boulevard of 7 November are the neighborhoods of El Menzah and El Manar now reaching the peaks of the hills overlooking the north of the town. They support a range of residential and commercial buildings. To the west of the park lies the district of El Omrane which holds the main Muslim cemetery in the capital and the warehouses of public transport.  Heading east is the Tunis-Carthage International Airport and the neighborhoods of Borgel, giving his name to the existing Jewish and Christian cemeteries in the capital, and the neighbourhood of Montplaisir. Beyond that, several kilometers north-east, on the road to La Marsa,  the Berges du Lac was built on land reclaimed from the north shore of the lake near the airport, which has holds offices of Tunisian and foreign companies, many embassies as well as shops.\nSouthwest of the Medina, on the crest of the hills across the Isthmus of Tunis, is the Montfleury district then on down to the foothills of S\u00e9joumi, the poor neighborhood of Mellassine. Northwest of the latter, north of the National Route 3 leading to the west, is the city of Ezzouhour (formerly El Kharrouba), which spans more than three metres (9.8 feet) and is divided into five sections. It is still surrounded with farmland and vegetables are grown which supply many of the souks in the region.\nThe south of Tunis is made up of disadvantaged neighborhoods, especially due to the strong industry in this part of the metropolis. These include Jebel Jelloud, located in the south-east of Tunis, which concentrates on the heavy industry of cement production, the treatment plant of phosphate s, etc. The main cemetery in Tunis, the Djellaz Cemetery, dominates this part of town, perched on the slopes of a rocky outcrop.\n\n\n=== M\u00e9dina ===\n\nThe medina of Tunis has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979. The Medina contains some 700 monuments, including palaces, mosques, mausoleums, madrasas and fountains dating from the Almohad and the Hafsid periods. These ancient buildings include:\n\nThe Aghlabid Al-Zaytouna Mosque (\"Mosque of the Olive\") built in 723 by Ubayd Allah ibn al-Habhab to celebrate the new capital.\nThe Dar El Bey, or Bey's Palace, comprises architecture and decoration from many different styles and periods and is believed to stand on the remains of a Roman theatre as well as the 10th-century palace of Ziadib-Allah II al Aghlab.With an area of 270 hectares (over 29 hectares for the Kasbah)  and more than 100,000 people, the Medina comprises one-tenth of the population of Tunis. The planning of the Medina of Tunis has the distinction of not grid lines or formal geometric compositions. However, studies were undertaken in the 1930s with the arrival of the first anthropologists who found that the space of the Medina is not random: the houses are based on a socio-cultural code according to the types of complex human relations.\nDomestic architecture (palaces and townhouses), official and civilian (libraries and administrations), religious (mosques and zaou\u00efas) and services (commercial and fondouks) are located in the Medina. The notion of public space is ambiguous in the case of Medina where the streets are seen as an extension of the houses and subject to social tags. The concept of ownership is low however and souks often spill out onto public roads. Today, each district has its culture and rivalries can be strong.\nThe northern end supports the football club of Esperance Sportive de Tunis while at the other end is the rival Club Africain. The Medina also has a social sectorization: with the neighborhood of Tourbet el Bey and the Kasbah district being aristocratic, with a population of judges and politicians, while the streets of Pacha often being military and bourgeois.\nFounded in 698 is the Al-Zaytuna Mosque and the surrounding area which developed throughout the Middle Ages,  dividing Tunis into a main town in two suburbs, in the north (Bab Souika) and the south (Bab El Jazira). The area became the capital of a powerful kingdom during the Hafsid era, and was considered a religious and intellectual home and economic center for the Middle East, Africa and Europe. A great fusion of influences can be seen blending Andalusian styles with eastern influences, and Roman or Byzantine columns, and typical Arab architecture, characterized by the archways.\nThe architectural heritage is also omnipresent in the homes of individuals and small palace officials as well as in the palace of the sovereign of Kasbah. Although some palaces and houses date back to the Middle Ages, a greater number of prestigious houses were built in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries such as Dar Othman (early 17th century), Dar Ben Abdallah (18th century), Dar Hussein, Dar Cherif and other houses. The main palace beys are those of La Marsa, Bardo and Ksar Said. If we add the mosques and oratories (about 200), the madrasahs (El Bachia, Slimania, El Achouria, Bir El Ahjar, Ennakhla, etc..), The zaouias (Mahrez Sidi Sidi Ali Azouz, Sidi Abdel Kader, etc.) and Tourbet El Fellari, Tourbet Aziza Othman and Tourbet El Bey the number of monuments in Tunis approaches 600. Unlike Algiers, Palermo and Naples, its historical heart has never suffered from major natural disasters or urban radical interventions. The main conflicts and potentially destructive human behavior has been experienced in the city occurred relatively recently following the country's independence which it why it made into a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. At the beginning of the 21st century, the Medina is one of the best preserved urban locations in the Arab world.Furthermore, along the boulevards, the contribution of the architectural period 1850\u20131950 can be felt in the buildings, such as the government buildings of the nine ministries and the headquarters of the municipality of Tunis.\n\n\n=== Other landmarks ===\nThe Bardo Museum was originally a 13th-century Hafsid palace, located in the (then) suburbs of Tunis. It contains a major collection of Roman empires and other antiquities of interest from Ancient Greece, Tunisia, and from the Arab period.\nThe ruins of Carthage are nearby, along the coast to the northeast, with many ancient ruins.\n\n\n==== Souks ====\n\nThe souks are a network of covered streets lined with shops and traders and artisans ordered by specialty.  Clothing merchants, perfumers, fruit sellers, booksellers and wool merchants have goods at the souks, while fishmongers, blacksmiths and potters tend to be relegated to the periphery of the markets.\n\nNorth of the Al-Zaytuna Mosque is the Souk El Attarine, built in the early 18th century. It is known for its essences and perfumes. From this souk, there is a street leading to the Souk Ech-Chaouachine (chachia). The main company that operates it is one of the oldest in the country and they are generally descendants of Andalusian immigrants expelled from Spain. Attached to El Attarine are two other souks: the first, which runs along the western coast of the Al-Zaytuna Mosque, is the Souk El Kmach which is noted for its fabrics, and the second, the Souk El Berka, which was built in the 17th century and houses embroiderers and jewelers. Given the valuable items it sells, it is the only souk whose doors are closed and guarded during the night. In the middle there is a square where the former slave market stood until the middle of the 19th century.\nSouk El Berka leads to Souk El Leffa, a souk that sells all kinds of carpets, blankets and other weavings, and extends with the Souk Es Sarragine, built in the early 18th century and specializing in leather. At the periphery are the souks Et Trouk, El Blat, El Blaghgia, El K\u00e9babgia, En Nhas (copper), Es Sabbaghine (dyeing) and El Grana that sell clothing and blankets and was occupied by Jewish merchants.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Walls and gates ====\n\nFrom the early days of its founding, Tunis has been considered an important military base. The Arab geographer El Yacoubi has written that in the 9th century Tunis was surrounded by a wall of brick and clay except the side of the sea where it was stone.  Bab El-Jazeera, perhaps the oldest gate of the south wall, opened onto the southern road. Bab Cartagena gave access to Carthage, important for bringing in construction materials needed for the city. Bab Souika (initially known as Bab El Saqqayin) had a strategic role to keep the roads to Bizerte, B\u00e9ja and Le Kef. Bab Menara (initially known as Bab El Artha) opened onto the medina and on the suburb of El Haoua. As for El Bab Bhar, it allowed access to some funduqs where Christian merchants lived in Tunis.\nWith the development of the capital under the reign of the Hafsids, two emerging suburbs grew outside the walls; Bab El Jazira in the south and Bab Souika to the north. In the early 14th century, Hafsid Darba Ab\u00fb al-Muhammad al-Mustansir Lihy\u00e2n\u00ee ordered the construction of a second chamber including the Medina and two suburbs outside. Six new gates were built including Bab El Khadra, Bab Saadoun, Bab El Allouj (initially called Bab Er-Rehiba), Khalid or Bab Bab Sidi Abdallah Cherif, Bab El Fellah and Bab Alioua. In the Ottoman period, four new gates were established: Bab Laassal, Bab Sidi Abdesselam, Bab El Bab Gorjani and Sidi Kacem. The city retains some of these gates including Bab El Khadra, Bab El Bhar and Bab Jedid but some of the earlier ones have long disappeared.\n\n\n=== Places of worship ===\n\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslim mosques.   There are also Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tunis (Catholic Church), Protestant churches, Evangelical Churches.As in the rest of Tunisia, a very large majority of the population of Tunis (around 99%) is Sunni Muslim.  The capital is home to a large number of mosques in various architectural styles, signs of construction of their respective eras.  The main and oldest of them, is the Al-Zaytuna Mosque, founded in 698 and built in 732 and is in the heart of the Medina. Practicing the Maliki rite as the vast majority of Tunisia's Mosques. It was completely rebuilt in 864 and is a prestigious place of worship, and was long an important place of culture and knowledge with the University of Ez-Zitouna on the premises until the independence of Tunisia.  It still hosts the main ceremonies marking the dates on the Muslim calendar and is regularly attended by the president.\nThe medina contains most of the major mosques in the capital which were built before the advent of the French protectorate.  The mosque in the Kasbah, was founded in 1230.  Practicing the Hanafi rite since 1584, it is recognisable mainly by the dome as well as its minaret, similar to the Koutoubia in Marrakesh and is the highest in the city. Ksar Mosque, also of the Hanafi rite, is located in front of Dar Hussein (Bab Menara) and was built in the 12th century.  The Hammouda Pasha Mosque, built in 1655, is the second mosque built by the Hanafi rite in Tunis. Youssef Dey Mosque operated primarily as public speaking venue before becoming a real mosque in 1631. The Sidi Mahrez Mosque is the largest mosque Hanafi mosque in terms of area but not the tallest.  Built in 1692, it resembles the Ottoman S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul.  The Saheb Ettaba\u00e2 Mosque, built between 1808 and 1814 was the last mosque built by the Tunis Husseinites before the French occupation.The presence of modern churches in Tunis are also testimony to the French presence for half a century.  Tunis is the seat of the Diocese of Tunis, with the seat located at the Cathedral of St Vincent de Paul, The church was built in 1897 on the site of the old Christian cemetery of Saint-Antoine.  This includes a network of Catholic buildings, including the Church of St. Joan of Arc, but also with the Protestant Reformed Church and the Anglican church Saint-Georges.Greeks used to enjoy an important presence in the city since ancient times. Tunis is the headquarters of the Greek Orthodox Holy Archdiocese of Carthage with jurisdiction over Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia. It belongs to the Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa, and its cathedral, small school and other buildings are in Central Tunis.\nIn total, there are three Greek Orthodox and two Russian Orthodox parishes in Tunisia. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria also maintains jurisdiction in Tunisia.\nThe small Orthodox community is centred around the Greek Orthodox Church (1862), managed by the Greek Embassy and the Russian Orthodox Church (1957), reflecting the presence in Tunisia of a small colony of Russian immigrants.Judaism, meanwhile, enjoys a long tradition of presence in the city despite the emigration of a large part of the community after independence.  Among the places of worship are Beit Yaacouv Synagogue and especially the Great Synagogue of Tunis, built at the end of the 1940s to replace the former Great Synagogue which was demolished as part of the Jewish redevelopment area, the Hara.\n\n\n=== Parks and greenery ===\n\nTunis has some large parks, many of which were installed at the end of the 19th century by the authorities of the French protectorate. The largest Park, Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re Park, was founded in 1892 overlooks Lake Tunis. It is the oldest public park in the country and is built in the landscape style common to France.  The park covers an area of more than one hundred hectares across roads that can be explored on foot or by car. It is also home to Tunis Zoo, which houses African fauna, and the Museum of Modern Art.\nHabib Thameur garden in Tunis has a central pond and flower beds. The Gorjani garden, is an English garden located southwest of the city, which notably takes an irregular form, partly due to the steep topography of the land.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nLocated in an old beylical palace (the palace of the Bey of Tunis since the end of the 18th century), the Bardo National Museum (Tunis) is the most important archaeological museum in the Maghreb, and has one of the richest Roman mosaic collections in the world.  Its collections developed rapidly, thanks to numerous archaeological discoveries in the surrounding territory.\nIn 1964 the Dar Ben Abdallah, a palace probably dating back to the 18th century, became the seat of the capital's Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions.  In its exposition halls it holds numerous traditional items, witnesses of the everyday lives of families of the Medina quarter.\nThe Museum of the National Movement is situated in Dar Ma\u00e2kal Az-Za\u00efm, which was the residence of nationalist Habib Bourguiba for the entirety of the fight for independence.  After the advent of independence, a museum was built there to relate the details of the national struggle between 1938 and 1952.\nThe National Military Museum, opened in 1989 in the suburbs west of the city, holds a collection of 23,000 weapons, 13,000 of which date back to the 19th century, and some of which were used by the Tunisian troops during the Crimean War.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nTunis holds some of the most prestigious musical institutions in the country. The Rachidia was founded in 1934 to safeguard Arab music, and in particular to promote Tunisian and malouf music.  The group is made up of 22 members, both instrumental players and choral musicians.The Musical Troupe of the City of Tunis was created in 1954 by Salah El Mahdi. In 1955 he placed his student Mohamed Sa\u00e2da in charge of the ensemble, which at that time included the best artists, and later merged with the ensemble of Radio Tunis.  This group contributed to the rise to stardom of numerous Tunisian singers, including Oulaya.\nThe Association of Arab Orchestra of the City of Tunis began its activities at the end of April 1982, as a workshop linked to the cultural center of the city.  It worked on promoting Arab music, on music education and training, and on cooperation with various partners both in Tunisia and abroad.  The Tunisian Symphony Orchestra, created in 1969 by the Minister of Culture, has also produced monthly concerts at the Municipal Theater and in various cultural spaces in the city.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nTunis is a center of Tunisian culture. The Th\u00e9\u00e2tre municipal de Tunis, opened on 20 November 1902, showcases opera, ballet, symphonic concerts, drama, etc. On the stage of this theater, many performances are regularly given by Tunisian, Arabic and international actors. The National Theatre of Tunisia is an important public enterprise in Tunis, and since 1988 been located in the Khaznadar palace (dating from the middle of the 19th century and situated in the Halfaouine quarter), renamed \"Theater Palace.\" In 1993, it also took possession of the former movie theater Le Paris, with a 350-person seating capacity.  During each \"cultural season\" (from October 1 to 30 June) the theater holds over 80 events.  The Al Hamra theater was the second theater to be opened in Tunis, situated on El Jazira Road.  Al Hamra was one of the most famous theaters in the capital during the 1930s and 1940s.  After being closed for fifteen years, it was turned into a small theater in 1986, and since 2001 has housed the first Arab-African center for theater training and research.  One should also note the El Teatro and \u00c9toile du Nord theater groups.\nOther arts are also represented in the capital. The National Center of the Arts established the puppet theatre in 1976.  The National School of Circus Arts was founded following a meeting between the Director of the National Theater and the Director General of the National Center for Arts of Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne (France) in 1998. In addition, various small theatres and cultural centres are scattered throughout the city and display various artistic performances.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nFilm producers and cinema have long been present in the city of Tunis. The first animated film was shown in Tunis by the Lumiere brothers as early as 1896. The first screenings were held the following year and the first cinema, the Omnia Path\u00e9, opened in October 1908. The first film club opened in Tunis in 1946 and the Globe, in 1965. The Carthage Film Festival is the oldest established film festival in Africa, running biennially until 2014 and annually thereafter.\nIn 1990, Ferid Boughedir shot the notable film Halfaouine Child of the Terraces in Halfaouine district. The films The English Patient (1996) and The Last Days of Pompeii (2003) were also shot in studios in Tunis.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nThe city holds several festivals each year, of which the largest is the International Festival of Carthage which takes place in July and August. Founded in 1964, much of the festival is held in an old amphitheater of Carthage (with a capacity of 7,500 seats), and hosts the performances of singers, musicians, actors, dancers and films on display on outdoor screens.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nTunis and its suburbs have many of the major Tunisian universities including the University of Tunis, Tunisia Private University, University of Ez-Zitouna, the University of Tunis \u2013 El Manar, the University of Carthage and the Manouba University. It therefore has the highest concentration of students in Tunisia, with a student population of 75,597 as of 2006.\n\nThere are also a number of other post-secondary institutions, such as the National School of Engineers of Tunis, the National School of Science, the Graduate School of Communications of Tunis, and the Higher Institute of Technological Studies in Communications of Tunis. In addition, private training institutes include the Open University of Tunis, the Central University Private Business Administration and Technology, the Graduate School of Private Engineering and Technology, and the North African Institute of Economics and Technology.\nAmong the high schools in the capital, the best-known are the Lyc\u00e9e de la Rue du Pacha (founded 1900), Lyc\u00e9e Bab El Khadhra, Lyc\u00e9e de la Rue de Russie, Lyc\u00e9e Bourguiba (formerly Lyc\u00e9e Carnot de Tunis), and the Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui. Until independence, Sadiki College (founded 1875) and Khaldounia (founded 1896) were also among the most recognized. A legacy of the French presence in the country remains, and the city retains many French schools, the most important being the Lyc\u00e9e Pierre Mendes-France at Mutuelleville.\nStudents can pursue language studies at small private schools such as Sidi Bou Said Centre for Languages (Centre Sidi Bou Said de Langues et d'Informatique) in the picturesque Tunis suburb of Sidi Bou Said, next to the Sidi Bou Said TGM station that specializes in Arabic, offering classes in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), classical Arabic, Tunisian Arabic and the various dialects of North Africa, the Gulf and the Levant.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nTunis has some of the most important libraries in Tunisia including the National Library of Tunisia which was first installed in 1924 in the Medina, in a building built in 1810 by Hammouda Bey to serve as barracks for troops and then a jail.  The library moved to its current location on Boulevard 9 April in 1938. The new building contains a reading room, conference room, laboratories, an exhibition gallery, a block of technical and administrative services, a restaurant, a parking and green space areas.\nHoused in a former home of a Hafsid scholar, the library of the Khaldounia was founded in 1896 along with the creation of the educational institution. After independence and following the consolidation of programs of education, the association ceased operations but the library is now linked to the National Library, which provides for its management.Built in the 17th century, the Dar Ben Achour also contains a library. Acquired in the late 1970s by the municipality of Tunis, the house was restored in 1983 into a library.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nTunis is served by the Tunis-Carthage International Airport. The growing metropolitan area is served by an extensive network of public transportation including buses, an above-ground light rail system (le Metro), as well a regional train line (the TGM) that links the city centre to its closest northern suburbs. Multi-lane autoroutes surround the city and serve the increasing number of privately owned cars one encounters in Tunisia.\nThe Tunis area is served by the m\u00e9tro l\u00e9ger (Ar.: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0631\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0641\u064a\u0641 \u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633) and TGM (Tunis-Goulette-Marsa), as well as bus services, and is linked to other places in Tunisia by SNCFT, the national railways. The important transport authorities are the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Transports de Tunis (STT) and the Ministry of Transport (Airports)\n\nThe A1 motorway connects Tunis with Sfax to the south, and the A3 with Oued Zarga and B\u00e9ja to the west, while the A4 is the link with Bizerte.\nThe city has, as of the beginning of the 21st century, a public transportation system developed under the management of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des transports de Tunis (STT). In addition to some 200 bus routes, the first light rail line opened in 1985. The M\u00e9tro l\u00e9ger de Tunis network has extended gradually since then to reach the suburbs. The capital is also linked to its northern suburbs by the railway line that crosses the lake, dividing the lake into two.\nA new mass transit was planned for Greater Tunis in 2009. This was the RTS (rapid rail network), the local equivalent of the Paris RER, which was to carry tens of thousands of travellers from the distant suburbs of Tunis to the centre by using either existing tracks or new tracks yet to be built. The plan was for lines based on certain criteria such as population density and the lack of coverage for a given area. Among the priority lines were: Tunis-Borj C\u00e9dria (23 km) where modernization and electrification are already planned; Tunis-Mohamedia-Fouchana (19.4 km); Tunis-Manouba-Mnihla (19.2 km); Tunis-Ezzouhour-Sidi Hassine S\u00e9joumi (13.9 km). In addition, the TGM will be integrated into the light-rail network and a new line built around Ayn Zaghouan and Bhar Lazrag (8.4 km). Such an operation would require the upgrading of the docks' TGM stations so that they become suitable for light rail trains. Among other projects are a line to the city of Ennasr (8.4 km) and the extension of the Tunis-Ettadhamen to Mnihla (1.7 km). For its part, the south light-rail line was extended in November 2008 to El Mourouj with a length of 6.8 kilometres (4.2 miles). The total length of the network will eventually be in the range of 84 km (52 mi).\n\n\n=== Infrastructure ===\n\nTunis is served by Tunis-Carthage International Airport, located 8 kilometers (5.0 mi) northeast of downtown, which began operating in 1940 under the name of Tunis El Aouina.  The terminal had 4.4 million passengers (35.98% of total airport traffic in the country) in 2006.  In 2007 that increased to 6 million passengers with a rise in tourism to the city.\nAfter independence, in the 1960s, the National Board of Seaports, which supports all ports in the country, modernized the infrastructure of the port of Tunis.  In the 21st Century, the port of Tunis underwent further transformation with a marina as part of the redevelopment district of La Petite Sicile.\nTunis is the starting point from which the main roads and all highways that serve different parts of the country of Tunis originate.  This city has a high density of traffic because vehicle ownership is rising at 7.5% per year.  The capital is home to approximately 40% of the cars in Tunisia, with 700,000 cars on average used in the city per day.  In this context, major road infrastructure (bridges, interchanges, roads, etc..) was initiated in the late 1990s to decongest the main areas of the capital.  The main roads to other Tunisian cities include: Autoroute A1, Tunis-Sfax; Autoroute A3, Tunis-Oued Zarga; and Autoroute A4, Tunis-Bizerte. Also, as part of the major infrastructure project, the city's traffic lights were increased from 5,000 to 7,500.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, a number of sports institutions were established in Tunis, particularly in school and college settings. In 1905 the Muslim Association of Tunisia brought together students from Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui and Sadiki College to organize gymnastics. A regional gymnastics competition was held in Tunis in 1912 with the participation of thousands of French gymnasts. Football made its appearance in the capital on 15 September 1904, followed by the formal creation of the country's first league, the Racing Club Tunis, on 11 May 1905. It took some time to run properly but soon organized meetings between the teams in schools. The first took place on 9 June 1907, between teams from Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui and Lyc\u00e9e Carnot (1\u20131).\nBut football is not the only discipline to emerge. Between 1928 and 1955 the city hosted nine rounds of the Grand Prix of Tunis, where notable drivers such as Marcel Lehoux, Achille Varzi, Tazio Nuvolari and Rudolf Caracciola took part. The Grand Prix of Tunis has re-emerged since 2000. The city has also held the Mediterranean Games twice, in 1967 and 2001, and the international tennis tournament, the Tunis Open, which is included in the ATP Challenger Series. The 2005 World Championship final for men in team handball was played in Tunis.\nIn total the governorate of Tunis registered 24,095 licences for various clubs in the municipal area in 2007. The city further put itself onto the international basketball map as it hosted the FIBA Africa Championship 1965 and the FIBA Africa Championship 1987.\n\nThe Esperance Sportive de Tunis (EST), Club Africain (CA), and Stade Tunisien are the major sports clubs in the city. A symbolic class difference is present between the EST's and the CA's supporters, despite their playing at the same stadium. The EST is supported by the majority of the masses, while the CA, a poorer club, is supported by the others.\nThe first true sports facilities were managed under the French protectorate, as illustrated by the development of the Ksar Said racecourse and construction of the Stade Chedli Zouiten in the neighborhood of Belvedere, which had long been the main stadium in the capital before being supplanted by the Olympic stadium, Stade El Menzah, where EST and CA play their football today. The Olympic stadium and village area was built to accommodate the Mediterranean Games in 1967. A 60,000-seat stadium was also built in Rad\u00e8s for the Mediterranean Games in 2001 at an estimated cost of 170 million dinars, with nearly half of the loans financed by South Korean businessmen.

        "wiki": "The Amphitheatre of El Jem is an oval amphitheatre in the modern-day city of El Djem, Tunisia, formerly Thysdrus in the Roman province of Africa. It is listed by UNESCO since 1979 as a World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe amphitheatre was built around 238 AD in Thysdrus, located in the Roman province of Africa Proconsularis in present-day El Djem, Tunisia. It is one of the best preserved Roman stone ruins in the world, and is unique in Africa. As other amphitheatres in the Roman Empire, it was built for spectator events, and it is one of the biggest amphitheatres in the world. The estimated capacity is 35,000, and the sizes of the big and the small axes are respectively 148 metres (486 ft) and 122 metres (400 ft). The amphitheatre is built of stone blocks, located on a flat ground, and is exceptionally well conserved.The amphitheatre of El Jem is the third amphitheatre built on the same place. The belief is that it was constructed by the local proconsul Gordian, who became the emperor as Gordian III. In the Middle Ages, it served as a fortress, and the population sought shelter here during the attacks of Vandals in 430 and Arabs in 647. In 1695, during the Revolutions of Tunis, Mohamed Bey El Mouradi made an opening in one of the walls to stop the resistance of the followers of his brother Ali Bey al-Muradi who gathered inside the amphitheater.It is believed that the amphiteatre was used as a saltpetre manufacture in the end of the 18th and in the 19th century. Around 1850, the breach in the wall was enlarged by Ahmad I ibn Mustafa to approximately 30 metres (98 ft). In the second half of the 19th century, the structure was used for shops, dwellings, and grain storage.\n\n\n== References in popular culture ==\nIt was featured in films such as Monty Python's Life of Brian and the television series Long Way Down.\nAmerican sportswear company Nike used this location in 1996 to shoot a television commercial titled \"Good vs Evil\", which depicts a gladiatorial-style soccer game set in a Roman amphitheatre. Football players from around the world, including Eric Cantona, Ronaldo, Paolo Maldini, Lu\u00eds Figo, Patrick Kluivert and Jorge Campos defend \"the beautiful game\" against a team of unsportsmanlike demonic warriors, which ends with Cantona receiving the ball from Ronaldo, pulling up his shirt collar as was his trademark, and delivering the final line, \"Au Revoir\", before striking the ball which punches right through the demon goalkeeper.The fourth episode of The Amazing Race 1 concluded at the amphitheatre.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Roman amphitheatres\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

          "The first stop on a two day whistle stop tour through some historic and commercial areas of Tunisia . Tour guide Mehdi very knowledgeable , spoke four languages so briefed all travellers on trip with relevant information . A well preserved example of a Roman Colosseum very",
          "To be seen. 3rd antic theatre after Roma. Excellent status. You can see everything on the 3 stages. 7 DT per person.",
          "What a magnificent structure with innate complex fascinating history. Few people around with little restrictions so plenty of time and space to view everything & take in the unique atmosphere.",
          "My son chose this excursion! With it being such a hot day I was thinking I wouldn\u2019t enjoy it so much. But it was amazing! The building is wonderful and so much of it to see! I loved the preservation of it and it had some of the most wonderful views. Booked this trip through the",
          "None of our pictures does this place justice. It\u2019s hard to explain the complexity of this structure. The stairs that go several stories up and the long winding tunnels and the steep stadium seating...it\u2019s all very impressive.",
          "This amphitheatre is said to be the one in which all the follies of the earlier amphitheatres were corrected. Alas, it was never used as an amphitheater but being the most prominent feature in the city, was the target of the guns of whichever faction chose to target it!! It\u2019s a",
          "What a place definitely worth a visit really well preserved and you are free to go we're you like even in the dungeons they were setting it up to watch the England Tunisia game when we were there",
          "I havent been to the one in Rome but this definitely looks better and bigger!! easily accessible and once you are in it is huuuuuge i would definitely recommend a visit to this place if you are ever visiting - we visited back in May 2015.",
          "Eat this Rome : your Colloseum amfitheatre is nothing compared with this giant in El Jem. Well preserved (except for 1 side), and very accessable, even in the dungeons. To me the highlight of my Tunesia trip, stayed there over 3 hours. Don't pay to park, even if locals tell you",
          "El Jem is easy to find driving south from Tunis. Parking is easy to find. It is amazing that the amphitheater is relatively intact, considering its age. It is a gem. While there, have a meal in one of the cafes to the south. There is an excellent museum to the south as well with",
          "Fantastic amphitheater. Much of it in intact. One can walk in the subterranean chambers. The town overall had little to offer and I would not spend a night there. We drive down from Tunis and stayed in Souse.",
          "Like the Colosseum in Rome, but better preserved and less people. A must see if you are anywhere near.",
          "Went on an organised trip from hotel in Hammamet and the hairs stood up on the back of my neck, incredibly. You could really take in how fantastic the building would have been in its hay day and when you went down to what would have been the cages it left you breathless",
          "El Jem is extraordinary and worth a drive out of your way to visit. The amount of the structure remaining in tact is breath-taking, including the underground passage ways. El Jem provides a backdrop for stunning photos and views, and is a reminder of how integrated the region",
          "Enjoyed walking the grounds of this place. You can climb almost anywhere and get a real sense of the place without the crowds and noise and hawkers you get in Rome. If you want photos of the place without people it's easy with some patience as the place was almost empty when",
          "Everything I ever want to do at Rome's Coliseum I could do in El Jem. I walked through every corridor, seated in some bleachers, stood in the center stage and even went to the cellar where gladiators and animals cages used to be. It's the real thing.",
          "This well preserved Amphitheatre was used as a filming location for the film gladiator. But forget that. They are ruins. You can climb quite high up using the modern steps and walkways to get outstanding views and photo opportunities. You can also walk underneath the arena in",
          "This amphitheater is one of the worlds great examples of Roman architecture. Although I\u2019ve been to the coliseum in Rome, and that\u2019s a much larger scale, this amphitheater offers much more ability to see the layers of the design and architecture. Being a smaller scale than the",
          "Too bad they stole most of the stones to build the Grand Mosque of Kairouan, otherwise this would have been much grater and nicer. I wont preach you about history, who knows about Romans already saw this and those that do not know will probably read Wikipedia instead for more",
          "We came here because we are Roman fanatics, I guess. This is on the plains in Tunis. The amphitheater was built by the Romans in the early centuries AD. It sat 30,000 spectaters. You can walk around the underpinnings where slaves kept animals and kept up the show. You can",
          "It was a surreal feeling walking in the town of El Jem and seeing the colosseum in the background of the city as the contrast between old and new is just so striking. I have read comments of people saying that this colosseum is not impressive or big as that in Rome, and I have",
          "This oval amphitheatre, listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site since 1979, was built around 238 AD in El Djem. It is one of the best preserved Roman stone ruins and one of the biggest amphitheatres in the world. It is estimated to hold a capacity of nearly 35,000 and built",
          "Right in the centre of town. 3rd biggest in the world, bigger than those in Nimes or Arles, able to seat 40,000, rising out of the plain like the Cathedral of Chartres.",
          "This is definitely one of the best historic places to visit when in Tunisia and surpasses the other Roman areas in Europe by its size and what is left after almost 1800 years since it was built (it was built around 230 AD) You will get fantastic photographs (see under photos)",
          "You should definitely visit if you travel in Tunis. Very good conditions and as per to me Top 1 in Tunis.",
          "This is a must see place if you\u2019re into ancient places. I enjoyed walking in all parts of the amphitheater,climb to the top,go underground. It\u2019s really deserve visiting.",
          "If you're seeking for true historical Arabic charm, Tunisia is a perfect place for you. Loved the atmosphere of El Jem, always sunny and beautiful Roman amphitheatre protected as UNESCO Heritage site. Easily could imagine gladiator fights and chariot races. If you like going",
          "Great view around the city , there's always a lot of tourists there , its big , still in a good condition .",
          "We stayed in Hammamet and went to El Jem early morning by mini buses, firstly we went to Sousse and spend time in medina and Harbor, after we went to El Jem. Entry ticket to amphitheater allows to visit museum too. We didn't regret that we came. It was amazing experience, we",
          "Best to visit in the morning while there are no much tourists. Its actually in better condition than Coloseum in Roma. Still working for musical shows, so its amazing if you manage to be part of one. Very nice trip and great view around El Jem :)",
          "I visited it in 2016 with my family It was so nice and impressive visit, it's big place and it takes us like 3 hours around and in the museum riding a camel, will do it again.",
          "By approaching El Jem I could not believe my eyes when I saw the beautiful Roman amphitheater. The amphitheater of El Jem was a symbol of Roman power and the prosperity of the provincial town of Thysdrus, El Jem's original name, its impressive remains preserved not only the",
          "I visited twice in 2015. El Jem is a good 3 hours or so drive from Tunis, but the roads are good and once you get to El Jem the town it's easy to find your way to the Colosseum. It's very impressive and immediately conjures up images of films like Gladiator and Spartacus.",
          "I stopped by the museum before heading for the amphitheatre. the museum is worth a stop. It had enough excellent mosaics without being overwhelming and there was a nice variety of topics. Villa remains with intact but well-weathered mosaics were out back, and were worth a look.",
          "After quite a long journey we arrived here at El Djem. It was July 2013 and a scorcher of a day ( drink lots of water ). Our rep lead us inside the amphitheatre and more or less told us to wander round freely. I was expecting a guided tour around with facts about the place. We",
          "Although the facade that faces the street/entrance is much more complete than the rest of the colosseum, this ancient monument is still a great place to visit. As other reviewers have pointed out, one is free to wander and explore the arches, stairways and tunnels. One of the",
          "For some reason this place does not have the promotion it deserves. It is a wonderful place with unrestricted access. Entrance is 10 dinar which includes the museum, also not to be missed. V easy to find. Public transport is pretty good, I took the louage from Sfax. Great",
          "Absolutely fantasic colosseum. Very good trip. you are free to roam and look at everything in your own time. nice quiet surroundings. The whole floor of the arena is sill intact allowing you to go underneath and see the rooms. I think there is more intact than Romes colosseum.",
          "I understand this amphitheatre is one of the best preserved and third largest of its kind in the begotten Roman Empire. There is still major renovation work to be carried out but in the circular street market around the perimeter you can imagine the hustle and bustle of the",
          "If you have the time, this is a great day trip from Tunis. We took the train from Tunis early in the morning, and it took about 2h30 or something like that. The amphitheatre was wonderful. There were maybe a few people there all morning, and we had the entire place to",
          "Awesome place which you have free reign to explore. Having been around Romes colosseum this was liberating and I would say almost as good.",
          "If going to Tunisia, a trip to the El Jen amphitheater should be a priority. A great opportunity to see one of the most beautiful and better preserved Roman amphitheaters of the empire",
          "We took a long roundtrip train ride from Tunis central train station. I'd recommend a round trip from Sousse though(just 1 hr). But it was totally worth it , we enjoyed the amphitheatre as well as the surrounding museums (short walks). It was clean and not crowded. We had lunch",
          "Super friendly staff, we could leave our heavy luggage at the entrance. The place is just incredible. The fact that such a small town has this huge coliseum is quite impressive. Once you have visited the Amphitheatre, go to the superb Archaeologic Museum which is just situated",
          "Africa was Latin for this central part of Mare Nostrum's southern shore. The name caught on. This late Roman Bread'n'Circus is the original heart of darkness. Arguably the most impressive example of the Amphitheatre, including The Colosseum, Verona's al fresco opera house,",
          "We visited here last year, absolutely amazing to see the ins and outs of the amphitheatre such a majestic viewing",
          "Everybody who is visiting Tunisia should pay a visit to El Jem, to visit the amphitheatre and the museum (not publicized but really interesting). Only 1 hour from Sousse or Monastir by car. better visiting it during the afternoon to enjoy the light of the sunset.",
          "Unfortunately we weren't given long on our coach trip to see the amphitheatre so it was a bit of a rush around, but we found it interesting. It's an impressive place and well worth a visit.",
          "For history buffs, this is a must see reminder of the influence of the Roman empire. The ruins are very well preserved, given their age and the tumultuous history of the region and unlike many ruins/historic sites in western countries they are not overly sanitised with health",
          "El-Jem is extraordinarily is a solid and well preserved amphitheatre. The top level is nice for panoramic city photos.",
          "Really big and well preserved. Couldn't help to get the feeling of how it must have been there back in time. When I was there it was no crowds and a really pleasent time",
          "I visited with my wife as it was a place recommended through friends and family. It's steeped with history and we were fortunate to go in the height of summer to see in it in such splendour. Can understand why Gladiator was filmed here too.... we worth a visit when in Tunisia",
          "This place is under rated. Far bettet than in rome. Its huge. You can roam freely. Great photo opportunities. Very cheap to enter. Nice toilets. Left in natural state it has not been hyped up for tourists. Its situated in middle of a busy town. Nice to walk around the town too.",
          "better than Rome for photographers: no tourists, no barricades, no lines to wait in! and open to the public until sunset - enjoy the light! do plan to stay somewhere close by as the roads aren't ideal for driving after dark - we drove down from Tunis, got our photography fix",
          "Bit of a trip but worth it came here on a half day trip try and get a longer time if you can we got right round in the allotted time just my dad 75 and youngest 6 so do able.",
          "Some of our local friends took us here and what a great day out it was, we got to see the history, take it all in and just have a fun filled day out. I would highly recommend coming here, just be prepared to climb lots of steps.",
          "El Jem coleseum is one of the best monuments to visit in Tunisia , its sad that alot of people ignore that such a coleseum exists in this country ! You can even ride a Camel there :) My advice , never miss the opportunity to visit it when you come to Tunisia.",
          "Very impressive ruins, good vibe, unfortunately there no explanations, no interpretation center, no 3D video to show how it used to be. A lot of empty space that they could use for an interpretation center.",
          "amazing place .i felt like i was in the movie Gladiator! this is were they filmed the Nike commercial with Eric Cantona against the eveil football team. this place is full of history and is worth the trip",
          "I have heard that El Jem amphitheatre is unique and similar to Roma One... I have visited it during symphonic music festival in Summer...though did not visit in detail, but sure that it is worth a visit...Don't miss the occasion to visit it out of festival as well..",
          "This is where they filmed Russell Crows Gladiator. Sorry people not Rome Italy and certainly not the Collesium, this is where it really happened even in the old times, you can really feel that you were actually part of History. A must visit if you go Tunisia",
          "What an amazing place to wander around. So well preserved and lots to see - it's quite spooky down in the pit, and from the top the views are great. You can really soak up the atmosphere and imagine what it was like to be there when it was actually in use. A must see if you are",
          "Unlike the Colosseum in Rome, you can go underground and walk on the stage. A portion of the sitting area remains, as well as the many stairwells that take you to the upper levels so you can see the Amphitheatre from different vieiwng levels.",
          "such a well preserved amphitheater such a surprise we wondered around for about an hour lots of climbing steps involved but worth it for the view",
          "In my opinion I think that this is unrivalled in an amphitheatre such as this and we have seen a fair few including Rome's Coliseum amongst others. There are various spellings of El Jem, with El Djem being quite popular as well. It is just breathtaking to believe that this is",
          "Visited here with my partner for our first Holiday! We stayed in hammamet but chose to do the Sahara Tour with Tunisia Travel Service. One of the final stops was the El Jem Ampitheatre! We were given so much information from our tour guide and got some really beautiful pictures",
          "Although this amphitheatre is smaller than that in Rome, it is worthwhile to have a look for it given that it is one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites.",
          "We were in Tunisia for our Daughters wedding and our new son in law decided to take us to El Jem but didn't tell us what it was. We were amazed when we got there that this beautifully preserved ancient ruin is just sitting there in the middle of busy town, and no-one seems to",
          "A lovely and fascinating look into the ancient Roman architecture at El Djem, which is the 2nd largest Amphitheatre after Rome. get the chance to go down the steps which lead to the area where the lions and gladiators where held until they entered the arena. There are coffee",
          "Having been to the Colosseum in Rome and Aspendos in Turkey, it takes a bit to impress me. El Jem was a gem, indeed. Visited and had the place to ourselves for most of our visit. Truly remarkable.",
          "This is a gem! Great amphitheatre. Nothing else on site really, just wonderful to explore. I have been twice and never seen it busy, no queues. It might get busy in the height of summer. It can be combined with a visit to the small mosaic museum just a 10 minute walk away and",
          "The 3rd largest amphitheatre in the world, empty of crowds. The tunnels under the arena are intact!!",
          "My favorite place in Tunisia.history at your fingertips.walk,explore or just sit and try to imagine how was it back then...worth the trip",
          "Loved seeing the colosseum. We took a public taxi there which took about 2.5 hours. The truth is it was so hot so we took a quick juice break at one of the stands before you enter the colosseum. Do your research about the pricing to enter and be aware from scammers who will try",
          "The town of El Jem is around 2 hours drive south of Tunis. Starting from Tunis in the morning, a visit to El Jem - to see both the amphitheatre and the museum - would make an interesting full-day visit. Well worth the travel time. The amphitheatre is said to be the third",
          "They have left open so many parts of this historic building for you to venture through it and nothing is closed off. The building is still in very good tact so you can get a real feel for how it was when in use. It is beautiful and well preserved. x",
          "I visited many Roman ruins, this is the best as far as I know. I could climb up to the top floor, enter jail under the Arena in 2000.",
          "I would personally recommend this, it was used in the Gladiator film, excellent condition definitely equil to the one in Rome. 1 hour and you will see it all, though getting up to the nose bleeds will test your legs, though the views are worth the burning thighs lol",
          "Visited here in June 2014 with my boyfriend. Absolutely beautiful place. Stunning views if you climb all the way to the top which I recommend doing even though the stairs seem to go on forever - it is definitely worth it. The one downside is the small market you have to walk",
          "All I can say is do it, it was an absolute amazing experience that we would not have missed for the world, is very hot take plenty of water and head covering but truly awesome & will take your breath away",
          "If you are in Tunisia and miss this monument, your trip is incomplete. If you have seen the colosseum of Rome, only El Jem can give it fulfilling experience and views. Whatever you did not do with Colosseum (View from Top or Underground), its welcome here. Stunning.",
          "You must visit if in this part of Tunisia. El Djem is famous for its amphitheater, often incorrectly called a Colosseum (roughly translated from Latin as 'that thing by the Colossus'), which is capable of seating 35,000 spectators. Only the Flavian Amphitheater in Rome (about",
          "A beautiful architectural and historical site. The price is totally accessible and the monument information spots with some historic context about it. There was, however, a bit of garbage in some places. It is worth the visit.",
          "Amazing preserved amphitheatre, beautiful heritage from romans time, I've been told that every July they are having festival of music held there, next year that time for sure I am going",
          "Beautiful place , well worth the visit. It was a little hot. A lot of steps so be careful. You can stand and just imagine how it was back then .",
          "This was an excellent day out it is really great if you go you by default in your entry to the ampitheatre there is entry to the Museum which is on exiting the theatre turn right and just keep walking and you will find it",
          "This place is amazing inside, It's just a shame about the town around it. When inside though it is very impressive.",
          "Amazing - it's a bit smaller than the more famous Colosseum in Rome, but this is MUCH better preserved. Visited during an organised tour from Hammamet to visit the sand dunes of the northern Sahara, and this was a highlight of the tour.",
          "Should you have just one free day in Tunis visit El Jem . This theatre along with the one in Pula Croatia are the best preserved in the world. Carthage is Meezly compared to this site which is about 1 3/4 hours drive from Tunis. It is past the resort city of Hammamet going",
          "What can I say but WOW. This was superb, I really loved visiting here. To walk in the steps of Romans thousands of years ago. The weather was 40\u00b0+ and you certainly felt it when you stood in the centre of the Amphitheater. It was really interesting to visit all the nooks and",
          "Went here on a day trip organised by Thomas Cook. Really interesting place, very atmospheric. There's the ubiquitous souvenir shop but it was well stocked and reasonably priced. One thing to be aware of is that you need to run the gauntlet of stall holders leading up to the",
          "I don't think twice to visit to El Jem.I did visit here twice in this trip. First trip was from Tunis by private tour. It cost me 100 /- TD. The second trip was with VLT Tour and it cost 180TD including trips to Douz , Sahara , Tozeur, Tamaza and kairouan. By train from Sousse",
          "It was just like walking into accent Rome AD.with the Underground Tunnels at the ancient Amphitheatre you can imagine the lions going though to tack part in the Ancient Customs of the Roman Empire.",
          "The largest amphitheater just after the Rome Coliseum, El Jem undoubtedly worth the visit. This great amphitheater in the middle of North Africa is very well conserved and cared. Unlike Rome's Coliseum, in here visitors can walk freely in the amphitheater, with almost none",
          "A great day out, take lots of water as can get very hot and beware there are many steep stairs to climb.",
          "This (I am told) is the second largest Colosseum in the world and is in a pretty good state of repair for a 2000 year old building. It seated 30,000 people when used in ancient times and is still used for concerts etc. It was nice to be able to walk underneath the stadium where",
          "Any visit to Tunisia will become a lesson in history. It is amazing to be driving through the countryside and see this magnificent structure in the distance. El Djem will not disappoint. You can not wander in the Rome Coliseum like you can here and even if you are not able to",
          "My daughter and I visited El Djem and were blown away by the size and condition of the \"ruins\". I've been to Rome and walked around the Colassium but many area are roped off. Not in Tunisia, we were free to walk where we wanted. The result of this was that I \"over-walked\" myself",
          "El Jem is certainly worthy of a couple of hours of your time. you can let your imagination flow as you go down below the arena floor into the holding rooms below. and have a seat on the steps high above the arena floor. Maybe not to much to hold the interest of young children,",
          "It is surprising that is is so well preserved. It is not crowded so there are plenty to explore and you can get excellent photos of you and your friends, and with the geometry and light, they will come out stunning.",
          "Came here as something to do as I was starting to get bored of staying in the hotel all day. Was pleasantly surprised by the size and quality of the place. Considering it's over a 1000 years old it's in very good condition and the fact that I could walk around most if not all of",
          "The Amphitheatre is very well preserved. Absolutely stunning design, the architecture is just beautiful. In one of the rooms you can actually see a lions paw print embossed into the wall, as well as markings on the walls of peoples names and the days counted down until the",
          "Fantastic trip, brilliant photo opportunities. The guides talk really gave us an understanding of what this amazing sight once looked like. Would recommend you visit as it's truly amazing \ud83d\ude00",
          "This is a great place to visit! We went stayed near Monistier and had about an hour mini bus drive to El Jem. We got there and the first thing we did was ride a camel outside the amphitheater which was a great experience, it will set you back 20D per person but well worth it!",
          "Well worth a visit, like nothing i had seen before. The history is wonderful. Make sure to wear good walking shoes as it can be a bit uneven under foot",
          "The amphitheatre at El Jem is splendid. It's great to be able to explore the various different areas and to be able to get an appreciation of the site. You could almost smell the animals when walking in the underground tunnels. We were on an organised tour and could have",
          "The amphitheatre itself is very impressive and very well preserved, and well worth a visit. However, you do have to swot your way through some rather persistent street vendors all selling the same scarf for 1 dinar, and take your life in your hands walking along the road to get",
          "We had looked at going to Tunisia and as we like to see things while we are on a holiday, we chose to stay in Sousse as it was not to far from El Jem which we really wanted to see while in Tunisia. We booked our holiday through Thomas Cook and we went to our rep meeting the day",
          "We went by train a great way to see the real Tunisia got to El jem a great little town had a coffee outside the amphitheater had a look at the shops one of the shop owners dressed us up and took lots of photos then paid only \u00a34.00 each to get in and wow wot a place you could go",
          "We visited in June, it was very quiet with not many people wandering about so we got fantastic view and areas to our selves. Such a beautiful place, we were able to wander round everywhere , nowhere was off limits. Some fantastic view from the very top but also quite captivating",
          "This is a must visit attraction if anywhere near this area.You can wander around as you please or have a guided tour .You will see the remains of marble around arena to make the sides difficult to climb out and the lower seats where the poor would sit in case of flying",
          "a very nice amphitheatre, however nothing else to do in the area. Not worth the price if your only visiting this and the moasaic musuem that comes in the ticket price",
          "Booked the excursion through the Thomson rep at the hotel. This was the most expensive way to undertake this tour as it cost 69 dinar per person (\u00a320+ pounds) but due to the heightened security in Tunisia after the recent atttack, my fiancee and I felt that this would be the",
          "This was a lovely half day trip. The ampitheatre itself breathtaking. Cheap to enter (10D per adult, kids go free). We stayed around an hour and a half wandering through the underground chambers and climbing the stairs. We weren't offered a tour of any kind which we would have",
          "was realy interesting place we went with a guide so lots of information it was a very hot day but there was bits of shade it is a very big place if you have trouble walking might be a problem and lots of steps but well worth a visit",
          "Go there. The place is amazing gladiator scenes were modelled on this place and you can tell! our trip alos included a trip to a museum which was good not really my thing lots of mosaics and stuff.",
          "Well worth visiting good value for money if you like historical places gives you the opportunity to walk around the site Andover look the city",
          "Wooooow what a sight for sore eyes!! Absolutely loved it. Amazingly breath taking. Pictures cannot do it justice. Go on a hot sunny day. Appreciate the tones and colours of the stone in bright sun light. Had the theatre all to myself. Absolutely adored it. Very well preserved &",
          "Definitely worth a visit. Will only need an hour or so to walk around and view. Not much information on site to read but an impressive example of Roman architecture. Apparently this is where they filmed Gladiator.",
          "This place is full of history, you can almost imagine hearing the gladiators as they prepare to battle. You could easily spend a day going around this magnificent ruin. The shop has the usual gifts and postcards and if you don't enjoy bartering they are set prices. There was no",
          "this is an amazing site if you get to see it. You can just sense on the things that actually happened between gladiators and wild animals, the tunnels which they had walked through is just amazing.",
          "Definatly worth a visit. Really amazing to walk around and think about the history of the place. Make sure you walk along to the museum also... And have your camera ready.",
          "It is a very historical place. We really recommend the people to do it. If you are in Tunisia and you have the time, you should do it. You will feel the real history.",
          "This was my second visit to these Roman ruins. It just an amazing site to see and to take in past history. We only spent about an hour here, but worth the stop.",
          "This amphitheatre really was amazing, once you stepped inside you could feel the history and the events which took place here. For its age it is well kept and you can also go into the cellars and climb the stairs to the top. If you visit the area you definitely have to visit El",
          "Amazing, Well preserved Amphitheatre. El Djem, Tunisia. On a grand scale, superbly overwhelming structure. Architecturally a master\u2019s work. El Djem Amphitheatre was used for pleasure. Less fortunate people were used as target for pleasure games. One cannot help but place Romans",
          "Visited it with a tour on the way to Sahara. I am not a history fan so would not put effort to visit it separately, however it was interesting to see, especially those underground passages where gladiators and animals were kept. Entry is free of charge, you just need to pay 1",
          "The third biggest of its kind. A must see f you go to Sousse or monastir. Get a louage to go there is quite easy.",
          "Hardly anyone was there during our visit...unlike the Rome version. It is in fairly good shape. This is definitely worth a visit along with the local museum.",
          "It is a very interesting place to see. We could not belive how it was protected like this. It is as original as it was built. Not far away from the hotel. It is one our driving and the cost is 35 dinnars.",
          "We went to El Jem Amphitheatre, a great attraction...BUT...Wheelchair users/and the less mobile need to be aware of the extremely steep ramp getting down to the amphitheatre, and also quite a large step down too, My OH is a big lad and I would have really struggled getting Him",
          "It is the colosseum of the founder of Tunisia. Habib Bourghiba. It close to the marina. There is an interesting mosque architect wisely. A halve day nice excurison but they have to clean the garden.",
          "Wow, an incredibley well looked after gem :-) We spent about an hour exploring under where the lions and prisoners were kept and up to the top where the view was incredible!! Rome is heaving with regulations, people and stops you exploring where this is practically empty",
          "Went to ElJem, in May fantastic attraction, lots to see, the history of the place is great, knowing once gladiators once was their fighting with lions and other wild animals well worth a trip.",
          "husband did this trip and loved it. Highly recommended. Take coins if you want to take photos as the locals will charge a dinar. Rich in history",
          "the 3rd largest amphitheatre in the world .You need good legs to explore this one.but its worth it Go down to the underground where the lions and gladiators were led out.Then climb to the top to get the best view of it all .Enjoyed this one.",
          "was very interesting. Climbed to the top of the stairs to get a better view. Amazing. Can just imagine what it was like when the gladiators fought.",
          "Our guide was very knowledgeable and the trip was interesting you can walk round pretty much all of it, including the underground bits. Amazing views from the top but as the step are quite steep it's hard work and I needed to use my inhaler once I got to the top as the walk up",
          "For the price, this is definitely worth a visit. The views from the top are stunning. Got some great photos after a friend recommended we visited. Don't be put off by the market sellers outside - and if you want to buy something, aim to pay 40% of what they ask maximum :)",
          "This amphitheatre is even more preserved than the colusseum in Rome! Fantastic guides full of information, brilliant photo opportunities as when we went there were no crowds. There was access into the pits which was amazing! The only annoying thing about our visit was the amount",
          "I feel I had to mention about being disabled after reading a review about this attraction written online by a another limited mobility disabled person. They moaned that you could not get around it all if you were disabled, but what they did not mention was that mobility",
          "The coloseum here is brilliantly preserved. We visited on an organised trip from Port el Kantaoui which is about an hours drive away. There isn't enough here to spend a lot of time, but the entrance fee is very reasonable, and it's well worth the effort.",
          "Loved it well worth a visit could do in a morning and in fact best to do in the morning as very quiet so pretty much get the place to yourself",
          "Well worth a visit, the building was in good condition and access to everywhere. We went on a tour with our rep and learnt a lot about the place and how they raised the animals to the stadium etc. We then went onto the roman museum with all the mosaics which was also well",
          "We stayed in a hotel at port El kantoui. Spoke with Thomson and they said they will charge about \u00a325 or 70 DT(Dinar) per person (It was 4 of us with a 6 months old baby). I then asked hotel reception for taxi to el Jem. They said taxi will charge us 180 DT. We then decided to",

          "This is an amazing place to visit so full of history. Not for the faint hearted loads of stairs. You can have a guide to take you round which is well worth it. Admittance was 10 dinar about \u00a33.50 and this also allows you into the museum further down the way. There some",
          "one of the best attractions In El Jeim Plenty of historical facts displayed and great opportunity to go underneath the auditorium and to the top. Great views over the town surrounding the colosseum too.",
          "Booked from the hotel in Sousse as part of the tale of 3 Cities tour. Runs on saturdays and was cheaper than booking online! I visted the one in Rome 6 weeks earlier and this one is nice as there's no queues, you can go pretty much anywhere in it and its much better preserved. A",
          "We bookedvthis trip as an excursion on our holiday last week. Awesome is the only thing i can say. The trip was for half a day but worth every minute. It was jaw dropping how they could build this in eight years 2000 years ago. The guide we had was very good and it felt like he",
          "Booking with Thomas Cook costs \u00a325pp... A rip off! It took us 4 hrs to get there from port El kantoui after collecting guests from almost every hotel then travelling just over an hour. When you get there you're told you've only got 1 hr, considering you need to look around the",
          "Always wanted to do the coliseum in Rome but after visiting the Ampitheatre Of El Jem in Tunisia I think I have seen more than I could expect in Rome. Although it is not as big it is in much better condition as you can climb pretty well all the way to the top but you can also",
          "We hire a car from Yasmin hamammet to see the Eljem . It is like collesium In Rome . Very nice corridors to walk and take a pictures . Nothing to do around . Just see the collesium and return .",
          "This amphitheatre is very well preserved and a must do if you visit tunisia, this is the second largest in the world after the coliseum and in very good condiction for its age. Below the 30,000 seater (as was) is where the lions would would have been kept in the basement and",
          "This is a must for any discerning historian, you really get a sense of what it must of been like to have had to fight in a place such as this. So much death and carnage really leaves an indelible aura!",
          "This was a good trip. We went as part of a coach tour and got there very early meaning we had the place to ourselves basically. It's a really nice place and very well preserved. The views from the top are good and it's definitely better maintained than the one in Rome. A",
          "Really really enjoyed this visit despite it being a really cold day...we went all round the building scaling the heights and exploring the dungeons,well worth a visit",
          "The ampitheatre was amazing to see and, to my surprise, there were only about 10 other people there. I expected the place to be swimming with eager tourists! It didn't have a great deal of signs around to give you much history about certain parts but it was great to move freely",
          "Although this is a hugely delayed review, I've chosen to write it purely because of how much this place stood out on a trip my girlfriend and I took. This is something like the 3rd largest amphitheatre built by the Romans in the 3rd century, and to this day it remains one of the",
          "historic attraction, gives you a feeling of history. Well worth the visit. Be careful with small children there are not many safety rails/barrriers etc.Nice photoshoot place.",
          "The Colosseo in Monastir is interesting to visit. It is the Colosseo of Habib Bourgibba, the first president and founder of Tunisia. The mosque and colosseo is interest g to visit for sure. The only thing is there is almost nothing to do around the Colosseo. No cafe's or",
          "We spent half a day here, entry ticket was cheap, about 10 dinar, same ticket you can use to enter the museum also. Place has a real sense of historic atmosphere, almost feels like being there in that age era. There's an underground chamber too which is open to public. Very well",
          "If one thinks history of ant value at all....you will love this visit. Stunned us both as it is the most complete Roman amphitheatre in the world. What a fabtastic place",
          "Went with the mrs to this attraction and we enjoyed our tour and our tour guide was full of knowledge and history. We also had spare time to take loads of awesome photos. Highly recommend.",
          "Loved this place with the mrs. We wet to Rome last year and loved their. We loved this place just as much. Great history learnt from our tour guide. Also a great place to take great pictures. Highly recommend for people to visit. Won't be disappointed.",
          "A very impressive ruin and no crowds to spoil it the weather could have been better but made the best of what we had, left the tour at the gates and made our way around at our own pace from the under ground holding cells for animals and gladiators to the top most heights all",
          "Easy to visit without going with tour operators! We self guided and got the train from Sousse (10dnr return) and the amphitheatre is a 5 minutes walk from El Jem station - you can see it when you step of the train! The ticket to the amphitheatre is 10dnr which also includes",
          "Well worth a visit, the best colosseum I've ever visited. Unlike the one in Rome you can fully explore this one, from the highest point to the lowest dungeons. We had great fun with our kids playing gladiators emerging from the dungeons and play fighting in the arena - can't",
          "I visited this already in 1983, but I was very impressed to see how the whole site has been improved in the intervening years! There has been not only restoration, of staircases and seats, enabling you to visit higher levels, but it has been cleaned and tidied up, with good",
          "It was my second visit in the amphitheatre of El Jem (the first one was in 2004). We took the train from Sousse. The trains are comfortable, however, they don't really respect their schedules. I really liked the amphitheatre, it has remained in a very good condition, and it's",
          "Visited last August as part of a day tour organised by our hotel. Definitely worth the visit, the amphitheater is in excellent condition and you can even go under into the dungeons which you cannot do in the one in Rome.",
          "This was a real treat to see the guide that was with us throughout the trip was very knowledgable. The whole arena gave you a sense of what it was like when it was at its best",
          "He went to see thos monument to the past as part of a tour organised through thomson. Our guide couldn't have been more helpful and willing answer any questions. We were given time to explore and in the dungeons u can see the claw marks made by large animals. All in all ot was",
          "The amphitheater is just fabulous, amazing and miraculous. It takes to you old Roman era and makes you feel there are a lot of stories you should tell others. It is quite easy to go there by louage from Sousse louage station, about one hour. A small and quiet city with such a",
          "if you are in Tunisia, you should definitely visit here. Amazing(u can check out the photos)!!! It is definitely worth the price!! However, the restaurant around is quite expensive, try to find other place to fill your stomach! Also, beware of the camel owners around. They will",
          "easy to get to a must see nice and quite early morning , later coach parties turning up with school parties",
          "You know that scene from Gladiator when Russell Crow is in the middle of the amphitheatre and shouts \"are you not entertained?!\"... well I managed to get a cracking video of myself emulating that scene as you have full access to the site and there is barely anyone about. Cheap",
          "The amphitheatre of El Jem is the world's 3rd largest amphitheatre. It is incredibly well preserved and was the amphitheatre used in the movie Gladiator. Having been to a few others, most of them look similar but the one thing that makes El Jem far superior to its Roman",
          "We visited the Amphitheatre as part of *The 3 Cities* excursion with the rep, although we arrived at about 8:30am'ish, it was still worth the visit, no matter where you stood or sat within the amphitheatre, the views were truly amazing, for a country that is poor in wealth for",
          "Went here on an organised trip combining museum and amphitheater, both of which ate worth a visit. Having a guide really helped to explain the surroundings and the history of the area. The amphitheatre is well preserved so you get a good feel of the place and most areas are open",
          "If the chance arises for a trip to El Jem, then it's definitely worth taking. We took a coach excursion from Monastir which takes about an hour and a half or so. The amphitheatre is a great place to see. Its still possible to see the construction of it and thats not bad for a",
          "We did visit the Colosseum during our NY vacation in Tunisia. We booked a private car with driver (certified for driving tourists) from our tour guide in Yasmine Hammamet. The driver picked us up at about 9 in the morning and drove us first to Kairouan and then to El Jem. We",
          "This is awesome ! Well worth a visit if staying anywhere near in Tunisia. The scale of what remains (both above and below ground) is not only very interesting but also amazing. Not crowded at all in January.",
          "Never seen an amphitheatre before and my was this impressive. Standing in the centre you can try and imagine the noise of the 30,000 spectators all watching as the gladiators come out. You can even get down in the area below the floor to the rooms where the animals where kept",
          "Very impressive remains, definitely worth a visit. Entry fee was only about \u00a33 Most people visit the remains as part of a guided tour, but for independent travellers, I could only find two very weather beaten, difficult to read boards, which gave any information about the site.",
          "If travelling to Tunisia, it is worth a visit. It is magnificent and allow yourself time to explore it all and to have a look around the quaint little shops on the streets outside also",
          "It is so well preserved and was unbelievable how massive it was. There was a show on when we were there and that added to the beauty of it",
          "Highlight of my trip to Tunisia. Not as big as the Colosseum in Rome but in better nick. Very atmospheric. Not really independent traveler friendly unless your pretty adventurous, we did a coach trip from the hotel visiting the Bourghiba Mausoleum (ok) and Port El-Kantaoui",
          "Anyone who visits Tunisia must make the effort to get here. It is one of the worlds finest Roman ruins and is in a great state of preservation, easily rivalling the Colosseum. It's walls rise to 35m and from the upper levels you can see the straight roman roads radiating across",
          "There is something very special about this amphitheatre/coliseum. Perhaps it is because you can go down under the arena where the animals and gladiators were housed before the jousts; perhaps it is the seating where the populace (up to 30,000 plus) went to watch the spectacles",
          "One of the worlds largest and best preserved Roman amphitheatres. It was built in the 3rd C AD and could seat 30,000. It sits in the centre of the former Roman town of Thysdrus, famous for olive oil production and once the second largest city in Tunisia after Carthage. As you",
          "From the walk up to the amphitheatre through the atmospheric shopping streets with the amphitheatre on the other side this is an experience to not be missed. The preservation and restoration of this third century is wonderful. There are different levels to walk on and you can",
          "We visited the amphitheatre as part of First Choice excursion. The trip was about 2 hours from Nabeul but was definitely worth it. There is a great freedom to explore throughout the whole amphitheatre. You could walk up into some higher parts on built steps and best of all,",
          "Visited with family, impressive as you have access all areas, from the terraces where the spectators sat, to the underground cells and cages. The arena itself gives a real feeling of how the condemned felt. I'd often wondered how these places were built, but my curiosity was",
          "Came to El Jem as part of an excursion with Thomas Cook. Having recently been to the Colosseum in Rome it was not as well preserved on the outside, but unlike rome you could go underneath into the dungeons! You have complete freedom as well which was a breath of fresh air. You",
          "The amphitheatre at El Jem is the third largest in the world and very well preserved. It is well worth a visit.",
          "I LOVE this place, how random to find a beautifully preserved Roman Amphitheatre in the middle of a built up area?! You can get right up to the top and see beautiful views of El Djem as well as right down into the tunnels where they filmed some of Gladiator. When you come out,",
          "We visited El Jem (El Dem) in October this year and we were the only people in the site! Having previously visited the Colosseum we knew what we could expect to see but were blown away by the condition of the site! It is almost access all areas, lower levels, ground levels, the",
          "For the amount you pay here to see this place is quite surprising. It felt like I was in Rome but a lot quieter. We arrived here at 3pm so not sure if it was busy in the morning but definitely very quiet when me and my family were there. A well preserved site and very",
          "Highlight of our trip to Tunisia and all the other reviews on here say it all. Remarkable how well preserved it is. Fully accesible underground and quite eerie to think of the animals and gladiators waiting to go out to do battle. Steep steps allow you access to the higher",
          "A Must See. This was about one hour by coach trip from the Hotel but was well worth the wait. We was very impressed with the conditon of the sandstone and what remains of the structure.",

          "Don't miss it if you're in Tunisia. El Jem is worth a side trip from Tunis (it's probably an overnight trip, but you might make a long day trip from Tunis). Some of the books say the amphitheater is better preserved than the Colosseum in Rome. I suppose that's a matter of",
          "Absolutely fantastic, definitely a must-do while holidaying in Tunisia. So tall & so much of it! Also did anybody mention it was used on the movie Gladiator ;)",
          "Very well preserved amphitheater. Excellent site to visit, You can go into the under ground area and see where the animals were kept and where they entered the theater. You can also climb to the upper level and see over the entire site. This site is very well preserved and",

          "Viewing the tour company's offering as expensive, we made our own arrangements and booked a taxi. The journey through rural Tunisia gives you a good idea of life as it really is. The large structure centred in a small town is quite a revelation. Thanks o the dry climate it is",

          "Amazing view from a distance. Close up even better. We paid 10td each plus 1 to take photos and were then just left to wander around. It's huge! You can climb 4 floors up and then go down into the holding area under the stage where animals and gladiators waited to fight.",
          "Such a beautiful excursion. Such history and a stone throw from Sousse. Again Thomas Cook supplied the very best in guides for this 4 hour visit of one of the Romans best preserved amphitheatres out of Rome. When walking around the things that go through your mind, did Julius",
          "Visit from Hammamet as part of a tour. We had approx 45 mins and this was enough. The guide allowed you to wander around on your own which was o.k. as there were a lot of signs that explained about the different parts of the amphitheatre. You were able to wander around all parts",
          "Our hotel rep recommended getting the hotel driver to take us as we didn't want to get up for the early morning start of the official Thomas Cook tour. As there were 3 of us at 100 dinar for the car and 10 dinar each entrance fee, it was also cheaper than the official tour.",

          "Made the trip over to El-Djem on the train for the second time from Sousse. The coliseum is in better shape than the one in Tome which makes exploring it very nice! Love the fact the underground tunnels are still in tact. Cheap to get in to and An amazing two or three hours",

          "WE loved the place and history and the little bar/restaurant just opposite the entrance.beautiful food and staff",
          "this is well worth a visit amazing place the views are brill so make sure you have your camera and no hassle from no one so you can enjoy the sights in please very tranquil makes you feel a bit of history",
          "The amphitheatre of El Jem, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a site - and a sight - not to be missed! Built in the 3rd century AD, this magnificent structure could hold up to 35,000 spectators. We were lucky: we had the place entirely to ourselves. Great opportunity to take",
          "A must see, the architecture is fantastic and it is great being able to walk round the the whole Amphitheatre. It I very atmospheric standing in the middle of the arena.",
          "We went there as a tourist. Lots of places to take pictures and to look at the surroundings. The weather was too hot but we can't complain the excursion made up for it.",
          "we visited the Amphitheater as part of the 3 cities tour with Thomson Holidays it was very interesting and a great place to visit. We were, like many others, told by our rep that Gladiator was filmed there then told by the tour guide that it wasn't. He said it was filmed in Rome",
          "This is a very well preserved,impressive Roman amphitheatre which was used for filming scenes in the Gladiator. You can expore the whole site by climbing to the top and also going beneath the floor of the amphitheatre.",
          "Well worth a visit, it is pretty awsome. we went on an organised tour but could have spent a lot longer there.",
          "Visited on a day trip, really wasn't disappointed. Favourite part of trip was going underneath to see where the animals were kept prior to release into the theatre. Brilliant!!",
          "Had no expectation when we arrived, but it was an amazing scenery that meet us. It was off season and we had the place almost to our selfs. Only interruption was some local boys using the ruins as their personal playgroup climbing the fragile structure. A disgrace and disrespect",
          "Excellent views and lovely trip. Liked the history and you are literally allowed to scale any part of the coliseum.",
          "Reallly good and a must see wilst in tunisia lots of history with it, stunning architecture we got lots of brilliant photos here. Third largest coliseum in the world and the best preserved in the world",
          "This place gave me shivers. You can really imagine what happened and what went on there. As a tip, go to the museum around the corner first and see the stunning, beautiful, immaculate and beautifully preserved mosaics that show some scenes from the amphitheatre. .. A good",
          "When I first visited El Jem in the 1970s the amphitheatre was still inhabited by local families. Now it is a tip top tourist attraction. The highlight for me were the subterranean passages where the gladiators and wild animals were kept before they fought. Easily reachable by",
          "When in Tunisia, you have to visit this attraction. It's beautiful and interesting. They say it's more preserved than the colosseum in Rome. We loved it and got loads of great pics here. There is a nice little cafe within the grounds to get refreshments. Definitely visit this",
          "The beauty of the this structure is breath taking and it only takes a tiny imaginative step to picture it as it would have been almost two thousand years ago. The cool breeze in the entrance tunnel, the scorching heat of the arena, the magnificant views over the town and the",
          "Really interesting and certainly as good as Rome. Guide Mohammed really knowledgeable and bought it all to life. Well worth a visit.",
          "... and more well preserved than the one in Rome. Apparently that's why scenes in The Gladiator was shot here. My visit was very short, but I've been to the one in Rome, or I would've needed more time to explore it all. Only puzzling thing was that I heard myths the Italians",
          "The 'Best preserved and 3rd largest colosseum in the world'!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the stairs have been reconstructed so you can climb right up to the top of the colosseum stadia where the plebs would have sat AND right down into the bowls of the arena where the lions and the slaves",
          "good trip to El Jem. Nice to be able to walk underneath which you can't do in Rome. Beware of the market sellers en route from where the coaches drop you off - they are persistent! If you do wish to buy make sure you haggle the price down.",
          "This was by far the most amazing place we visited while we stayed in Tunisia, it was quite a long hot coach journey but Wow was it worth it, maybe not as famous as the one in Rome but it is in outstanding condition when you think it is thousands of years old (built 3rd century)",
          "Great historical place where Gladiator was filmed. Amazing. There are camels right next to colosseum so its worth trying.",
          "Highly recommended - this place takes you back in time a few hundred years. They have done well to reconstruct a lot of the building to a very high standard. There is a lot of historical information all around, its a very eerie experience in the tiger enclosures and the where",
          "The colleseum was just amazing, we went there before seeing the one in Rome and then when we did go to Rome that one paled in comparison to this amazing structure in the middle of the desert!",
          "Not as famous as one in Rome, but also beautiful and worth visiting. There are lots of bars around with their original tea drinking ceremony, do not miss that. Traditional Arabic hospitality. Awesome!",
          "Very well maintained for a building of its age, and makes you feel like you\u2019re in the set of the Gladiator. Around the amphitheater, a little walk to the left of the entrance, there\u2019s a shop making hand-made mosaic pictures, regretted I haven\u2019t bought one.",
          "This is the best persevered Amphitheatre and it is very impressive when you enter and have a walk around. When you go through the gates you have to pay to be able to take photographs but it is only 1 Dinar which is about 40p. The only down side is the stalls outside when",
          "I have to admit, I hadn't even realised there was an amphitheatre in Tunisia until I'd booked the holiday, so it was a pleasant surprise. Really lovely to see it so in tact, and thoroughly recommend a visit.",
          "Got a taxi for 4 from our hotel in Port El Kantaoiu 100 dinar \u00a337.50 and the driver gave us as long as we wanted .Amazing to see how much of the Colosseum has survived.It was 10 Dinar to get in and 1 Dinar to take photos. Had a wonderful couple of hours and took some great",
          "A very interesting and worth while trip to do whilst holidaying in tunisia. Just watch out for the locals",
          "We went to el jem from our hotel in monastir. The taxi was 90 dinar which is roughly \u00a335 and the driver waited 2 hours for us. The small town is very busy and dirty much as most of Tunisia but the amphitheatre is pretty impressive! 10 dinar each adult entrance fee which is",
          "This was the first stop of our 3 Cities tour, El Jem, Kairouan and Monastir, booked through Tompson Holiday in our resort at El Kantaoui. It was an early start to the day as the coach picked us up at our hotel at 7.15 am, there was a minimal breakfast available at our hotel,",
          "Absolutely stunning building and highly recommended when visiting tunisia, you can access all parts from arena to cells.",
          "We took a 1-day trip, wich also led us to the colosseum. It is impressive, well kept and can be visited from bottom to top. There is a nice view over the town from there.",
          "This place is a must to see will take your breath away steeped in history if you go you probably need three to four hours to look around and if you don't have a tour guide you can always listen in to others who are full of fascinating facts a must",
          "Absolutely magnificent structure and with great access to the upper levels. We spent a good hour walking around and we could of spent longer! Amazingly, towards the back of the 'stands' there was piles of rubble with intricate carvings on that had been left there! Defiantly",
          "Brilliant ruin tour local tour guide told stories of the country brilliant full of information and learnt so much about the culture lifestyle and uprising and why the country is like it is and how it used to be.",
          "What an amazing experience !! I would recommend this whole-heartedly, you can feel the atmosphere as you walk around. The amphitheatre is beautifully preserved. Make sure you go to the top, the views are incredible. I agree with other reviewers it is better than the Colosseum",
          "Every-one loves this place. You need to walk around this both outside the fence and inside. Take time to go up to the very top- there are handrails and the views are so worth it. The fact that you can explore this on your own makes it even more worthwhile so allow an hour an",
          "Well preserved amphitheatre. And you can even go on top of it!!!! The underground part is exceptionally well preserved, is definitely worth a look!",
          "Spent a morning in this brilliantly preserved Roman Amphitheatre in El Jem. You can feel the history in the arena. Go underground to were the a Gladiators rested and waited to go up an fight. See were the Lions were kept. Utterly amazing. This is a true place of historical",
          "If you only visit one place in Tunisia visit this. It's beautiful and very well preserved. We did it as part of the Thomas cook sahara explorer trip.",
          "I've seen some reviews saying that this Colosseum is better than the one in Rome and I totally agree. This Roman amphitheatre is well preserved and looked after well. Going around this place taking some fantastic shots in every corner of the Colosseum is worth it. Make sure you",
          "Better than the one in Rome! Well-maintained and in a sunny setting! Accessible by coach from most hotels & resorts so get off the pool-lounger and show the kids something brain-improving! Watch out for pick-pockets & con-men selling cards etc - they will steal money right out",
          "A must. a well preserved Roman Ampitheatre - will step you back in time. if you want the Gladiator experience - here it is.",
          "A very well preserved coliseum - better than Rome, although obviously smaller. My teenage children let their imaginations run wild whilst they were able to wander freely around the site. The local Roman Mosaic Museum, about 3 mins walk away, was also well worth a visit.",
          "Having seen the colosseum in Rome I was prepared to be underwhelmed but think I found this place to be better, it was certainly much less crowded than its better known counterpart. It is an excellent day trip from Sousse and certainly worth the effort of going.",
          "We went here on train and back on the louage. Admission includes the very good museum with amazing 3rd century mosaics. Amphitheatre is awesome and you can climb to the top. There is a gift shop and clean toilets. Admission is 10 dinars + 1 dinar for your camera. Great day out.",
          "There isn't really nothing else to do in El Jem, rather than visiting this Amphitheatre. There is a museum but it's not a must-visit site. So I guess it'll be best to visit here as you're on your way to somewhere else.. just stop over to see it. You can go on a day trip, but",
          "This is one of the best preserved Roman amphitheatres. Climb the stone stairs to the top tier & the view is amazing . You can imagine how it would have been to be a spectator. From ground level you go down to the dungeons & holding cells where the slaves & lions were held until",
          "This was the most educational and satisfying of the trips we went on whilst visiting Tunisia.(39 dinars each I think) We had a very good ,well informed guide who knew his subject inside out!(Even if He was rather talkative).You could not fault his presentation of the History and",

          "Visited in February 2012, drove down from Sousse, but you can get a train or go on an organised excursion. But going by car meant that we could go at our own pace and spend as long as we wanted there. It is really well preserved and plenty to see and some great photos to be",
          "Forget the Colosseum in Rome - visit El Jem. For just 10 dinars you can take yourself back in time as you wander the underground corridors and climb the terraced seating of this well- preserved Roman amphitheatre. Make sure you visit the museum too, a 10 Minute stroll away, with",
          "My gf and I went here one day as we wanted to get out of Tunis to see the countryside. There is an express train to El Jem from Tunis so we jumped on it - like 50 dinars round trip for the two of us, I think two hours one-way. Go. Just go. Totally worth it. Comparison vs",
          "You need a torch to visit part of the Amphitheatre since the only way you can get to the bottom part is down stairs. There is a handrail but it isn't safe to go down stairs in pitch black. The ruins are impressive but there again it is just a ruin",
          "well worth a visit with fantastic Roman ruins as good as anything in Italy but with far fewer tourists, lower prices and more freedom to wander",
          "Amazing sight. When approaching the city, you start seeing it from the distance and you just want to arrive. Very well preserved, it is absolutely a must when visiting Tunisia. It's even worth a visit to Tunisia just because of it.",

          "Loved the place -- absolutely stunning. One of the highlights of my week in Tunisia. But why don't they provide any guides or information about the place?!",
          "Some friends were hanging out in Tunis in 2010 during Ramadan and decided to visit some sites outside the city. El-Jem is definitely worth the drive (which was great, plenty of opportunities to stop along the way). Makes the Coliseum in Rome look like a half-baked effort, this",
          "This Roman amphitheatre is considered one of the largest in the world. It is very well preserved and you can visit even the spaces below the arena. I hadn't expected it to be that impressive since it's located in an isolated area of Tunisia. I believe it's one of the most",
          "This amphitheatre is just awesome. It is one of the best preserved anywhere in the Roman world, is massive and all of it is accessible. This visit can be combined with the museum s the inexpensive ticket covers both.",
          "quite a surprising site, stuck in the middle of a small town, this amphitheatre is very impressive and in some ways finer than the Colosseum in Rome. It has been extensively renovated but even so it was interesting to see the chambers under the arena where the animals were kept",
          "on a recent trip to Port El Kantaoui my fiancee and i visited the Colosseum in El Djem as part of a day trip. the colosseum is in great condition and you are allowed free reign when inside to walk about with no limitation which is great. i actually found it to be better",
          "Had a brief visit here during an excursion. I have to say that we were really impressed. The place is in excellent condition and you can wonder around and look just about anywhere in the grounds. Stunning place and truly awe inspiring, if you just do one thing go see this. Only",
          "Wow... no wonder it's a UNESCO site, it's absolutely stunning and great that it's open to be explored in its entirety, to walk where our ancestors walked & touch the walls they touched before putting on the performance of their life (or death), was truly amazing. I was pleased",
          "By chance 2 friends independently said whilst in Tunisia El Jem is a must. Not being ones to do official organised rep. tours, we found trains run from Hammamet area (starts in Tunis) straight to El Jem (20 DN return, about 1 hour 45 min - although trains are often late). There",
          "You can see this place towering over the plains from miles away, and seeing as it is 1800 years old the fact you can climb up to the top is incredible. The underground areas where the animals and gladiators spent their final moments before competing was particularly memorable.",
          "My Mum & I had a great visit to this quite complete amphitheatre. It was particularly interesting to go below the arena to see where the beasts were kept. I didn't go in the Colloseum in Rome as it was so busy but this was marvellous, lots of room to explore and the oval shape",
          "I thought that this amphitheater built by tihe Romans in El jem, Tunisia was actually as nice as the Colosseum in Rome! Perhaps bigger?",
          "loved the fact that you could explore under the amphitheatre, were the animals were kept, beautiful views at the highest point.",
          "I was rather apprehensive about visiting this place, expecting crowds of tourists and aggressive guides. There were neither, visiting at the end of the season and at 0930 in the morning. You can pretty much wander where you want, the information boards are informative, and",
          "Awesome structure. Very impressive place. Well worth a visit. I liked the simplicity of the place and the nice pictures you could get.",
          "Had a brief visit here for about an hour during a excursion. I have to say that we were really impressed. The place is in excellent condition and you can wonder around and look just about anywhere in the grounds. Well worth the visit. If you want to take photo's you have to",
          "had a great few hours here, is very intact and easy to get around. Only thing that spoils it was a platform they had built in the middle for a music show/festival that was going to be happening there. Still its good to know is is still be used. The Guides all seem knowledgable",
          "This place is very mystical, you can feel the atmosphere from each pillar. Take a trip to the dungeon where the gladiators and the beasts were kept and you will then really feel the chill. Also have a seat in the emperor's loggia and you will truly feel on the top of the world.",
          "I have never been to Rome, so seeing this amphitheatre was, to me, spectacular. It is well preserved. We did not go as part of an organised tour so could spend as much time as we wanted at the site. I enjoyed being able to go beneath the floor of the amphitheatre as well as",

          "We travelled two hours from hammamet on the train to visit the site. It is impressive and the entrance fee quite good value, but there isn't a great deal to see inside and after half an hour we felt as though we had finished. You should also know that el jem is not tourist",
          "Stunning place and truly awe inspiring, if you just do one thing go see this. Only downside was our trip with Thomson very rushed only having 45 mins to explore, you really need longer",
          "Great place to literally touch history. Great condition, amazing views, make sure to check the mosaic manufacture a bit behind the Amphitheater. Great place, definitely worth seeing.",
          "What a difference to Rome, you can really explore this site, you can walk around all areas and really take in the atmosphere. Being able to take your time and not be caught up in a massive crowd really will make your visit more enjoyable. I loved it, it's very cheap to enter,",
          "Apparently, this is the 7th largest colosseum in the world...and the only one I have visited so I have nothing to compare it to. A big deal was made of the fact 'The Gladiator' was filmed there but a quick Google search shows that very little of it was actually filmed in",
          "This Amphitheatre is in great condition, It costs 1 Dinar to take pictures which is great value. From the top you have an excellent view of the arena and the surrounding town. We stayed Port El Kantaoui which is about an hour away, it's very much worth the trip.",
          "On a family holiday we were told we could each have one day were we did exactly what we wanted. Mine was the most incredible exploring history day. Number one on the list... El Jem! We hired a chauffeur with driver to drive us for the day (cheaper than some hire cars we were",
          "We visited this Colosseum as part of a 2 day excursion with First Choice. The Amphitheatre is well preserved and quite a spectacle. The 3rd largest in the world, much of its original features still remain, particularly in the undercroft. It's well worth a visit. As with all",
          "full of history you have to go its in such a good condition lots of stairs worth a trip to the top for the view.",
          "A really well-kept amphitheatre ! It's beautiful and you can go down in the basement where the slaves and animals where kept - you can also go up to the top to look at the whole building. There are also giftshops at the entrance. You have to pay 1 dinar for a photo ticket.",
          "When we decided to go to Tunisia we either wanted to visit El Jem or go to Matmata or the ruins at Carthage. The walk from the coach park to the amphitheatre is a bit of a nightmare, especially if you stop to look at some of the stalls. The sellers do understand \"no thank you\"",
          "I had heard about the amphitheatre before travelling to Tunisia so I was really pleased to be able to visit. There is an amazing atmosphere and when we were there there were only about four other people looking around. Its much bigger and more complete than I was expecting and",
          "If you're in Tunisia, this is a must. A fabulous example of the might of the Roman Empire. So well done Romans for building it, well done Tunisians for preserving it and boo to Turkey for destroying some of it. I was thoroughly impressed by the place.",
          "Enjoy the journey and when you get there what a spectacle. How they managed to build something so symmetrical and precise with the resources they had is amazing. It is a wonder. You can feel the atmosphere. Hear the crowd roar, feel the fear before they were put out to fight.",
          "We started a 2day tour of Tunisia here & wow! What an amazing piece of history so well preserved. Worth a trip.",
          "I am not sure how anyone could give this amphitheatre anything less than excellent; we were so impressed with it!!! We got a train (very cheap) there from Sousse. We got in for free and then wandered around without a tour guide taking lots of pictures. We were there on 16 July",
          "If you're in Tunisia you have to see El-Jam. It is much better preserved then Colosseum the amphitheater in Rome. El- Jam is really a MUST see.",
          "This is well worth a visit if you're in Tunisia. It is well maintained and an incredible piece of architecture, with an interesting history. The lion cages and gladiator cells are in great condition and a highlight of the tour. Be sure to take sun cream as it is quite exposed.",
          "We went to a day trip to this place arranged by Thomas cook. The guide was very knowledgeable and tell us all the noteworthy details for a bit then let us look around on our own. No word is going to express the amazement you'd experience once you enter the grounds. The stairs",
          "Went to see this on a day trip organised by Thomas Cook. A truly spectacular site to see although I suspect young kids would fail to appreciate the history etc. Was a little disappointed with the actual information supplied. We were given a brief overview by the guide upon",
          "This is well worth a visit if you're in Tunisia. Well maintained and an absolute incredible piece of architecture, with an interesting history. It's also rarely congested, so it's easy to roam round at leisure.",
          "Book this trip through Thomas cook at the hotel and it was good and very interesting but very rushed. We drove for about 90 minutes from the resort and when we arrived we were only given 60 minutes to look around. Once the tour guide had given his speech about what he knew the",
          "Another must visit in Tunisia It's is amazing when you are driving towards it and you can see it in the distance Walking around is great and you get to see some breathtaking views! You do need to pay to be able to take photos but it is only 1 dinar and it covers you both here",
          "If in the area, you must visit. - supposedly better than anything in Rome. Only downside was names carved in the stone by previous visitors, but no big deal.",
          "I've never been to Rome, but after seeing El-Jem Amphitheater, I would definitely go there to have a comparison, although this one is the best preserved. Lots of history over your mind when you gaze at the the ruins from inside. Breathtaking views from above. Worth climbing all",
          "I really enjoyed my visit to the Roman Amphitheatre at El-Jem in Tunisia, The site is so well preserved and in fantastic condition after all these years, So much better then some of the Architecture in Rome, It's really well worth a visit. I stayed at Port El Kantaoui and had no",
          "Built in the 3rd century, it is one of the largest amphitheatres of the ancient world. It is so well preserved that you really get such an amazing feeling of the gladiators about to jump out at you. You can walk around at your leisure and altho you have to obtain a licence to",

          "We visited this old Roman Amphitheatre during a 5-day tour in Tunisia. Our guide explained us almost everything we needed to know about that place with 1,800 years of history. The amphitheatre is very-well conserved and you can admire it's greatness and splendor once in it. It",
          "Set in a low rise town, the amphitheatre is an incredible sight - very well looked after and this should be on the list for all travellers to Tunisia. We went by train which was easy and relatively cheap.",
          "We hired a car to get to El Jem and it was well-worth the effort. El Jem is a typical Tunisian town.....with a great big impressive amphitheatre right next to it. Wonderful to look around, lots of photo opportunities and some cafes over the road to take in the view. Camels",
          "Well worth a visit, you can roam around anywhere and soak in the atmosphere. An experience not to be missed.",
          "This site retains many of the features it had when built. It takes very little imagination to feel and to see what it must have been like 2000 years ago. The buildings illustrate the outstanding art of the Romans but the purpose of the build illustrates the depravity of the",
          "You get the opportunity to roam around exploring every aspect of this site. It was truly amazing. It was really hot when we went so pack plenty of water. Young children may not find it as interesting or fun because it is an historical site, so lots of steps for little feet.",

        "wiki": "The Bardo National Museum (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0637\u0646\u064a \u0628\u0628\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0648\u200e, romanized: al-Mat\u1e25af al-Wa\u1e6dan\u012b bi-B\u0101rd\u016b; French: Mus\u00e9e national du Bardo) is a museum of Tunis, Tunisia, located in the suburbs of Le Bardo.\nIt is one of the most important museums in the Mediterranean region and the second museum of the African continent after the Egyptian Museum of Cairo by richness of its collections. It traces the history of Tunisia over several millennia and across several civilizations through a wide variety of archaeological pieces.\nHoused in an old beylical palace since 1888, it has been the setting for the exhibition of many major works discovered since the beginning of archaeological research in the country. Originally called Alaoui Museum (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0648\u064a\u200e, romanized: al-Mat\u1e25af al-\u02bfAlaw\u012b), named after the reigning bey at the time, it takes its current name of Bardo Museum after the independence of the country even if the denomination is attested before that date.\nThe museum houses one of the largest collections of Roman mosaics in the world, thanks to excavations at the beginning of 20th century in various archaeological sites in the country including Carthage, Hadrumetum, Dougga and Utica. Generally, the mosaics of Bardo, such as the Virgil Mosaic, represent a unique source for research on everyday life in Roman Africa. From the Roman era, the museum also contains a rich collection of marble statues representing the deities and the Roman emperors found on different sites including those of Carthage and Thuburbo Majus.\nThe museum also houses pieces discovered during the excavations of Libyco-Punic sites including Carthage, although the National Museum of Carthage has is the primary museum of the Carthage archaeological site. The essential pieces of this department are grimacing masks, terracotta statues and stelae of major interest for Semitic epigraphy, and the stele of the priest and the child. The museum also houses Greek works discovered especially in the excavations of the shipwreck of Mahdia, whose emblematic piece remains the bust of Aphrodite in marble, gnawed by the sea.\nThe Islamic Department contains, in addition to famous works such as the Blue Qur'an of Kairouan, a collection of ceramics from the Maghreb and Anatolia.\nIn order to increase the reception capacity and optimize the presentation of the collections, the museum is the subject of a vast operation which was to be completed initially in 2011 but was not finished until 2012 due to the Tunisian Revolution. The work concerns the increase of the exhibition surfaces by adding new buildings and redeploying the collections. The project aims to make the museum a major pole for a quality cultural development, so that the visitor can appreciate the artistic pieces deposited.\nOn March 18, 2015, an Islamist terrorist group attacked the museum and took tourists hostage in the building. The attack, which killed 22 people including 21 foreign tourists, was claimed by ISIS.\n\n\n== Location and description ==\n\nThe Bardo National Museum building was originally a 15th-century Hafsid palace, located in the suburbs of Tunis.\nThe Bardo is one of the most important museums of the Mediterranean basin, and the second largest on the African continent after the Egyptian Museum. It traces the history of Tunisia over several millennia and through many civilizations through a wide variety of archaeological pieces. Being in the former palace, it offers many major works discovered since the beginnings of archaeological research in the country. Originally called Museum Alaoui (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0648\u064a), the name of the reigning bey at the time, it has had its current name of Museum of Bardo only since the country's independence.\nIn addition to famous works such as the Blue Koran of Kairouan, the Islamic Department contains a collection of ceramics from North Africa and Asia Minor.\nThe Bardo brings together one of the finest and largest collections of Roman mosaics in the world thanks to the excavations undertaken from the beginning of the 20th century on archaeological sites in the country including Carthage, Hadrumetum, Dougga, or Utica. The mosaics represent a unique source for research on everyday life in Roman Africa. The Museum also contains a rich collection of marble statues representing the gods and Roman emperors found on various sites including those of Carthage and Thuburbo Majus.\nThe Bardo has also rich pieces discovered during the excavations of Libyco-Punic sites including mainly Carthage, although the Carthage National Museum also possesses an important collection. The main parts of this Department are grimacing masks, terracotta statues and stelae of major interest for the Semitic epigraphy, the stele of the priest and the child being the most famous. The Museum also houses Greek works discovered in particular in the excavations of the ship of Mahdia, whose iconic piece is a marble bust of Aphrodite.The museum underwent a major refurbishment, completed in 2011, that was interrupted due to the Tunisian revolution.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nIt contains a major collection of Roman mosaics and other antiquities of interest from Ancient Greece, Carthage, Tunisia, and the Islamic period.\nThe museum displays objects ranging from pre-historical artifacts to modern jewelry.\n\n\n== 2015 terrorist attack ==\n\nOn 18 March 2015, 24 people were killed in a terrorist attack  when three terrorists in civil uniform attacked the Bardo National Museum in the Tunisian capital city of Tunis, and took hostages. Twenty-one people, mostly European tourists, were killed at the scene, while an additional victim died ten days later. Around fifty others were injured. This attack took place after the famous Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris where many journalists were killed   Two of the gunmen, Tunisian citizens Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaoui, were killed by police, while the third attacker is currently at large. Police treated the event as a terrorist attack. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in Tunisian history; surpassing the 2002 Ghriba synagogue bombing, which killed twenty-one people, most of whom were also European tourists, and injured more than thirty others.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nFamous Mosaic\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nPieces in The Ground Floor\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nRoofs of Oudna Room\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Technologies ==\nStarting from June 17, 2014, the museum offers visitors a digital guide in English, French, and Arabic. Developed by Orange Tunisia using Near-field communication technology, it comes in the form of a free downloadable application for smartphones and visitors can also borrow a free smartphone at the museum entrance. It offers audio commentaries, photo slideshows, and a historical and geographical perspective of the displayed works.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCulture of Tunisia\nList of museums in Tunisia\nHistory of Tunisia\nHistory of Carthage\nAncient Carthage\nMosaic of Dominus Julius, Carthage\nNorth Africa during Antiquity\nCarthage National Museum\nCarthage Paleo-Christian Museum\nEl Djem Archaeological Museum\nNabeul Museum\nMosaic of Dominus Julius, Carthage\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe National Bardo Museum",

          "The palace in which the museum is housed is an experience for itself, the beautiful quarters of Tunisian beys remind the spanish Alhambra. Ceramics, small details carved in stone, the playing of the light, the design ... The exhibits are simply amazing. Their richnessand,",
          "A wonderful collection in a lovely palace. However, the museum suffers greatly from lack of organization, curation, or any form of audio or live guidance. Such wonderful treasures presented in such a horrible way. It all made me wish the French had taken all these items back to",
          "Our visit accompanied by a talented guide was a real hit. We had heard so much about Bardo museum so our expectation was high. It surpassed it. I do particular recommend the terra cotta masks section and the 4 seasons Neptune monumental fresque both on the upper floor. Just a",
          "The Bardo Museum is a must if you ever make a stop at the Tunisian capital. With its spacious setting and amazing artifacts and mosaics, it has with a doubt an amazing historical collection that makes you wonder with a long lost past.",
          "Before we went to the museum on a Monday, I checked the website. It gave the opening hours, but no mention that it would be closed on Mondays. Imagine our chagrin when the guard at the door told us that the museum was closed, especially since we spent quite a bit of time trying",
          "Visiting Bardo museum is a Must to know Tunisian history. There are Roman mosaics of incredible beauty and value , fine techniques to express human faces. It surprised me that such big mosaics were freed from the roman palaces without any damage I have to study this type",
          "I've been to the mosaic museum in Antakya - which I thought was stunning, and the Zeugma Mosaic Museum in Gaziantep which is one gorgeous museum with beautiful mosaics - but the Bardo isn't overshadowed by either of them. Baffling layout of rooms - worth having a guide.",
          "The Bardo museum has beautiful mosaics and is worth a visit if you appreciate the beauty of mosaics. Kids could be bored quickly however. I did not find the staff to be friendly though. You will need to take a taxi or the city Metro to get there if you are staying in the City",
          "The museum has good car park inside and no bags are allowed inside. Only at the entrance u have to deposit. Camera is allowed. Tickets cost 13 local so 4 euros. Guides are available at the entrance. They charge 20 local so 5 euro. We had a great time with lassad bou Ali a french",
          "The museum offers a vast array of precious Roman mosaics. Plan to spend at least two hours there. It is definitely a must-see but still has a long way to go to compete with other great museums elsewhere in the world. Quite a few glass boxes were empty, even some rooms. Basic",
          "One of the main reasons for going to Tunisia was to visit this museum . The Museum is a fair distance out of Tunis .You will need a taxi to get there unless you are proficient in French or Arabic to use their Bus system . Taxis are very inexpensive . Security has been",
          "What a marvelous collection of history. Well organized. Beautifully displayed. No English maps. We managed just fine without.",
          "This is a huge building with lots of space to wander and take in the huge array of roman mosaics, statues and other artefacts. The building used to be a royal palace so there are also lots of random empty rooms that are due to be brought into use. We travelled independently so",
          "A very modern museum beautifully and thoughtfully laid out. The mosaics were stunning and most in superb condition. The descriptions were in English and there was a lot of history to read. We were rushed through on our tour but it really needs at least 2 hours for a visit.",
          "With an interest in mosaics, the Bardo was on our short list of things to do in Tunis. We were delighted with all of the mosaics. They are displayed handsomely, being housed in a palace converted to a museum which displays them in a majestic setting, befitting their history",
          "Never seen such a marvelous mosaics in any other museum. The history here speaks to you since the days of the Roman empire. The statues ,some without heads,are great indeed. Never miss visiting it,preferably with a professional tourist guide who can enlighten you about the very",
          "Do go - the mosaics are incredibly detailed and so many and so enormous, room after room, some 3 floors high - and there are wonderful artefacts and sadly ( tho lovely for us ) no one there! Photos don\u2019t do it justice.",
          "Honestly I have seen better museum than this one. Paid around 10 dinars/person yet we still have to pay for toilet. It needs more enhancements I guess. No leaflets for visitors, and some kids were stepping to \u201cdo not step\u201d areas and no one warns them. Such a pity !",
          "A Very diverse and rich collection of mosaics back to the Carthaginian and Roman empire. It is really impressive how well preserved was the exposed manuscrits, mosaics and statutes in this museum. Something very captivating actually ; the architecture and the charm of both",

          "A very unique museum dedicated primarily to mosaic from way back in the day, I mean 200AD and so on. Place us well organized, security vastly improved. At least worth 2 hours if you time.",
          "The people who market Tunis have kept quiet about this museum. If you are into mosaics, this is the museum to go to. From Carthaginian to Roman to Arab, they have it all. This is a must see when in Tunis.",
          "Over the years we have been to similar museums in other countries - always leaving somewhat let down. Not so in this case. This place is quite big with many of the best mosaics anywhere. Definitely go and allow yourself a couple of hours.",
          "One of the must do's of Tunis. Mosaics are everywhere and they are splendid. By means of statues from roman empire, I have seen better but still one of the best mosaic museum ever...",
          "The best collection of Mosaics I have seen and housed in a modern, bright museum. Incredible the way the Romans designed and made these 'carpets'.",
          "This museum has one of the largest Roman era mosaic collections of the world. We saw many great collections. However, somehow we felt the way the museum displays the collections are too jammed, so we did not have good views of each precious collection.",
          "Visited as part of a guided tour. Took 2 hours but could have been much longer. Lighting not perfect but mosaic displays breathtaking. Rooms impressive and pre- and post- Roman displays very good too. Good bookshop and friendly cafe. A \u201cmust see\u201d in Tunis.",
          "Very interesting mosaics on display - including the biggest mosaics in the world. The detail is amazing. Pity not all the lighting seems to be working as this detracts from being able to appreciate the exhibits.",

          "One of the best places we chose to visit and did not regret at all. In fact, would likely go again. Has the largest collection of mosaic pieces that are thousands of years old and some are really huge. Some of these treasures are actually used as flooring for the museum! The",
          "I was taken here by a personal guide, that had an enormous knowledge of the history of Tunisia and Carthage. He showed me his favorite places and mosaics, and had a story with each and every one of them, so I can definitely recommend going here with an experienced guide!",
          "You'd probably need a week in this fabulous museum to truly do it justice. There is so much to see. The 3rd Century AD Roman mosaics are enormous, mostly intact and truly beautiful. The Arabic mosaics too, are extraordinary. And the building itself, once the home of the Bey of",
          "The Bardo Museum is a must visit in Tunis. It has the largest collection of mosaic in the world with unique historic collections.",
          "Heaven for mosaic lovers, history buffs and everyone else. It's jaw-dropping collection of mosaics and artifacts assembled from sites all over Tunis.",
          "If you're into Roman History and been enamoured by the stories of Hannibal/Carthage/Marcus Aurelius and life in Carthage after that time then you have to see the Bardo! Yes there was some trepidation as we parked in the car park where the tourist bus had been fired upon, but",
          "If you go to Tunis you CANNOT miss Museum Bardo! It is a great place to fill your eyes with beautiful walls and mosaics!",
          "I have a house near Rome . I have also travelled and seen Roman ruins and artefacts all over Western and Central Europe, but nothing I have seen prepared me for the wealth of mosaics and other fascinating artefacts in the Bardo. The combination of the weather that preserved",

          "I am always very skeptical about museums and how much I connect with the pieces on display, but this one is really impressive with the mosaics and status and the mix of architecture inside. It really is worth visiting.",
          "One of the most important african museums. Very well preserved sculptures from 6-7 c BC. And of course huge and very beautiful mosaics",
          "You go there for the mosaics. There are so many, huge and well preservdd, that you think it is unreal. The museum itself is not huge and could do with better explanations of the works. A treat.",
          "Enjoyed visiting the museum. Eldest child enjoyed but younger did not as its basically lots of different but similar mosaics and statues. As you would expect from a museum. Wasn\u2019t too expensive to enter and you pay a little bit extra so you can take photos not that anyone",
          "The museum has a lot to share on Tunisia history with a big highlight on mosaics from the Roman period. Probably as good as some of the Museums in Rome for its quality of mosaics.",
          "We visited the Bardo museum as part of a trip to Tunis from Hammamet. The museum has incredible displays of breathtaking Romain mosaics and Arabic artwork. This is a 'must see' museum in your lifetime. A one dinar (30p) charge for using a camera is worthwhile. Unfortunately we",
          "I wasn't expecting to see the amount of mosaics that were on show here. They are in such great condition and beautifully displayed. You need to buy a photo permit (there are a few places that require you to purchase these). It cost 1dn (30p). If you are part of a tour group you",
          "Had the pleasure to visit Bardo Museum for a couple of hours in February 2018 , was gobsmacked how amazing the mosaics were there , Could have spent all day wandering around looking at these magnificent artefacts . The actual building that houses the museum is spacious and",

          "This was a beautiful museum! We ran through it quickly because it was near closing time. The quick hour walk through was perfect to see everything briefly with our 8 and 12 year old boys. Great history!",
          "I have some doubts though, there are so many pristine condition mosaic collections in Tunis that I am already asking myself: Is that possible? are they real? If they are genuine this place is simply amazing. And it is not all about the mosaic, it is much more than that. Concise",
          "Don\u2019t miss it, even of you have only limited time (like me). The place with the function rooms , the magnificent mosaics, and yes: the memorial of the 2015 attack",
          "A lovely museum with mosaics superbly displayed. There are very few visitors and you can freely wonder and enjoy the displays.",
          "Even for those generally not interested in museums, the mosaics cannot but impress. The description of the exhibits, in French and English, is very helpful. (For the wrong reasons) there are not many visitors, which is all the more reason to enjoy this experience sooner rather",
          "Museum is big and requires half day if you want to explore it properly. It takes visitor on a trip through North Africa and Tunisia history. Like Gaziantep museum in Turkey, Bardo has incredible collection of mosaics. I recommend to every visitor coming to city of Tunis.",
          "I was there for about 4,5 hours going through the different floors. It gives you a very good overview over the history of Northern Africa and the different rule that has been there over the years. Very interesting to see how things have changed from the Romans to the Arabs and",
          "The Bardo is a great morning or afternoon visit in Tunis. The museum offers a world-renowned collection of mosaics. Most of the signs for the major mosaics have Arabic, French, and English descriptions. Cost: 12 dinars (about $5USD) 11 TDN for ticket, 1 TDN for photo ticket",

          "My wife and I visited today and really enjoyed the museum. When you consider their age, the mosaics are extraordinary and the way the museum has 'filled in the blanks' to give the complete picture of mosaics and pottery items and even beds gives you a clear view on what the",

          "Bardo National Museum is housed in an old Beylic palace of the XIXth Century. It showcases a big part of Tunisia\u2019s history (from Prehistory to the contemporary epoch) and contains the largest collection of mosaics in the world. They are amazingly beautiful. Worthwhile to spend",
          "Getting to this museum thinking how good can it really be I got a chock. It was beyond everything I ever imagined. The villa it self is fantastic and easily compared to bigger palaces like the Topkapi in Istanbul. Its collection of mosaics mouth dropping. What many museums in",
          "Big museum out of the centre of Tunis. The metro line number 4 goes nearby (Bardo stop) but then from there one must ask for directions or follow a map. The museum is made of a modern part blended with the old bey palace in a rather successful way, at least aesthetically. The",
          "The Bardo museum was part of the King's palace and the other half is the current Tunisian parliament. It is a wonderful and spacious museum filled with mosaics. It has the largest collection of mosaics in the world. The palace part of the building is also very beautiful and you",
          "This museum could be fascinating, but for some details. First, English explanations are needed. French and Arabic are not global languages. Second, charging extra for camera (a minimal sum) use is silly - just incorporate into price. Third, and most important: Some of the",
          "Lovely museum, possible to get there using the Metro (tram) but taxis are cheap in Tunis. Shame the cafe is not open and the new building is beginning to look like the maintenance is a bit hit and miss. However the old Tunisian palace rooms are wonderful and the mosaics take the",

          "I had very little time and knew exactly what I wanted to see but of course all the sections I wanted were closed, including the whole of the second floor. A shame they don't only charge half price for seeing only half the exhibits!",
          "this museum does seem to have the best collection of Roman mosaics. Besides the mosaics, there are sculptures and a display of traditional furnishings. The museum is a nice size .",
          "Wow. Having traversed most of the Mediterranean by this point, I've seen a lot of ruins: Roman, Hellenistic, Phoenician even. And one can expect many attempts at preservation or semi-preservation depending on the country. The Bardo manages to imbue a sense of wonder and awe at",
          "It took a 25 minute taxi ride from Tunis to reach Bardo, and I loved every minute of it. Great place to spend anything between half an hour and half a day depending on how much of a history geek you are. The place is empty, quiet, and well maintained with its mosaics, statues",
          "Spectacular mosaics, very well designed exposition. Prepare for half a day of exploring, have coffee and something to eat prior to the visit as there is no coffee place on the premises. Definitely worth the visit, but one needs to hop on the taxi to get there. We tried to walk",

          "Really very impressive collection of Punic, Greek and Roman artifacts. Some of the mosaics are truly massive. It's a little hard to imagine them in their original context. And there's not a lot of explanation about that. But nearly everything is labeled in Arabic, French and",
          "Towards the end of our stay in Tunisia, we went to the Bardo Museum. Some people many remember it as the place where, on 18 March 2015, 21 people, mostly European tourists, were killed in a terrorist shooting. Around 50 others were injured. When we visited, two years after",

          "A must-see when in Tunis. Utterly amazing collection of ancient Roman mosaics and other art. There were far more staff and security guards than tourists. A memorial at the museum's entrance, in the style of a mosaic, pays tribute to those killed in the 2015 attack.",

          "The museum contains a large collection of excellent Roman and Carthaginian mosaics, as well as a few other items such as statues, pottery and various objects recovered from a shipwreck - including Roman beds. The detail and quality of the mosaics is amazing. They vary in size",
          "Most of what there is to see here is mosaics. There are a few other things, but the mosaics are incredibly impressive. We went on a Sunday afternoon and were pleasantly surprised (and a little sad) by how not crowded it was. Almost all of the descriptions are in English. Highly",
          "A real fusion of lots of cultures. Romans. Islam. Carthage. Simply wonderful. If you have been to the museum in Cairo, this one is a very very close second. If not better. Blue Koran for example.",

          "The guided tour was great and our host did show patience with the young kids. A new discovery of the exposition with the family and kids. A lot of energy is put to keep kids in line.",
          "Bardo National Museum was on top of our list during our visit to Tunisia. It was very easy reaching the museum from Habib Bourguiba Avenue using the public transportation. We decided to have a full day visit and it was worthy. The fees were average but there were no discounts to",
          "People were murdered in this museum last year. People are being murdered all over the world every year. Bardo staff are lovely. The museum is too. Come back.",
          "The facility is quite nice, a good location to spend quality time. the musem is beautiful with lots of history and mosaics. highly recommended.",
          "Lots of Roman artifacts and mosaics in this museum. There seem to be a lot of attendants (guides) who latch onto you and take you into closed off sections pretending they're doing you a big favour. It's all a scam to get a tip off you.",
          "The museum has an incredible beautiful collection of mosaics. The building is beautiful and is well taken care of. Highly recommended to visit.",
          "Well organized, with access for an older person like myself, great signage and very friendly staff, from booking office to the guards inside & out. Our guid was Haitham, very knowledgeable and well versed in Arabic, English & French. Plenty of mosaics from roman time till last",
          "The museum gives a great insight into ancient history in Northern Africa. Preferably start with the first and second floors which are certainly featuring the most impressive exhibits. It's a pity the building itself isn't better maintained. A lot of security at the entrance.",
          "Great museum with lots of mosaics. It is a must to see if you are in Tunis. It gives you a good history overview of the region.",
          "Since I was young, I visited this museum many times. It is excellent and give you a very big idea about the civilizations which stayed in our country Tunisia. It is a big opportunity to know the history of our country.",
          "It shows One of The best roman mosaic and objects also it has an amazing collection of Carthaginian and Phoenician sculpture and mosaics. It was hit by terrorism and obscurantism a few months ago and art and love won after all . Art and death collided in this place so the",
          "A big palace from the Turkish era. I liked best the Roman and older parts, and the building itself. Peaceful, a lot of space because tourists have not yet returned since 2015. We had the guides practically to ourselves.",
          "Wonderful place with impressive collection of mosaics. Walking on the ancient mosaics on the floor is something special. we had a nice guide who considering our short time could meet the \"deadline\". Even children were impressed by the gorgeous place. Must see in Tunis!",
          "If you have the time, you must visit the Bardo. You can also combine this with a visit the the old medina as they are located in the same area. Found myself wandering around the Bardo in a daze, just thinking about the history and connections that some of the pieces gave me.",
          "Unbelievable mosaic collection!!! Very rich on all other items such as statues, jewelry, artcraft across ages. Well maintained as museum into a museum. Basic support to visitors, but it is definetely a must see place . Don't miss it",
          "Do not miss the Bardo. It was far better than I expected - and I was expecting it to be good. The building itself is marvellous - a former Ottoman palace with modern extensions and improvements. The collection is outstanding - notably the collection of mosaics. Many are",
          "A beautiful and culturally enriching experience , tells you a lot about Tunisia very rich history and how it played a key role in the history or the region over centuries",
          "This place is beautifully maintained and is jaw dropping in its collection. You get up close and personal with so many mosaics and antique treasures that it is hard to not feel insignificant in this must-see attraction. The guides and curators are very friendly, and you really",
          "The Bardo Museum is superb. The museum displays a fantastic collection of mosaics in a former Turkish palace, A better collection of mosaics you will not find. Superb and a must see in Tunis",
          "Great museum with a great collection of mosaics and artifacts covering the Carthaginian, Roman, Arab and Punic eras to mention those. Needs some improvements inside in terms of naming, guidance and directions but still more than ok and worth the visit.",
          "Beautiful museum with many ancient artifacts. So many civilizations have crossed trough time in Tunisia and this museum is a perfect example of it.",
          "I've wanted to visit the Bardo for a number of years and made my way here on my first afternoon in Tunis. It is located on the outskirts of the city, about 20 minutes' taxi ride from the city center (about TD 4-5 in my experience). The compound is heavily guarded. The building",
          "The Bardo museum is among the hundreds of museums I have visited around the world. This is one of the museums where I was taken over not only by the beauty and splendor of the exquisite arts and crafts but I was also impressed by the display of the influnce of civilizations one",
          "Second to the Egyptian Museum, the Bardo houses many mosaics and is the national museum of Tunisia. The must-sees include Ulysses and the Sirens; and Virgil. Part of the museum is housed in an old palace, so the Carthage Room is also very nice to see. You will be reminded of the",
          "The mosaics are not to be missed! SO glad we took the time to visit! Tunisia's rich history is fascinating!",
          "This is an incredible museum and was on my must see list...and I am glad it was. The museum has an incredible selection of mosaics and original art works. Well displayed and described. The exhibits are nicely laid out and can be done in couple of hours - so can see without",
          "The Bardo Museum is surprisingly well designed, laid out, and full of incredible historical artifacts from Tunisian history. Tunisia has been an influential locale for thousands of years and for many empires and while many people aren't aware of the full breadth of Tunisia's",
          "I really enjoyed the Bardo very much. It had an amazingly good collection of antiquities from all eras of Tunis' history, but the amount, size and quality of the mosaics is shocking. There are so many mosaics they pave many of the public spaces with them, and some are so large",
          "The Bardo Museum lived up to the hype. Room after room was filled with one beautiful mosaic after the next. On top of the wonderful historical pieces that were in the Bardo, the building itself was beautiful. The older parts of the Bardo are pieces of art themselves.",
          "A visit to the Bardo is a must if in Tunis (10 Dinar entrance fee plus 1 Dinar for photography). Housed in a former palace, the mosaics are jaw dropping. Nothing else in the world compares to the collection in the Bardo. You can easily spend half a day here. Security has been",
          "Having family in Tunis allowed us to get a hands on and very special tour of the Bardo. The tile floor and walls the adorn it exhibit the Roman history to the country. Tunisia, that once was the major provider of agricultural products to the Roman Empire. It was aptly named the",

          "Great Place and interesting museum which let you get knowledge about the important history of Tunisia. There are very nice and beautiful Roman mosaics and unique ones. The rooms are well arranged and the guides can make your visit the best one.",
          "This is a must see for all visitors to Tunis. it is an important museum containing the largest collection of Roman mosaics in the world. the exhibits are spectacular and housed on a number of floors in this large and well designed museum, which is thankfully air conditioned.",
          "Very interesting even if poorly displayed. No other museum like it in terms of roman mosaics in the world so definitively worth it. Shocked that one actual;y walks on some pot the ancient mosaics (they are on the floor). Tunisia needs to do better with what is world class museum.",
          "We had the luck of having the services of Nour El Houda for a couple of days...she was awesome! Her youthful appearance should not, and will not , cloak her knowledge of the history of Tunisia from Punic through to Roman to more modern times. She is soft spoken and funny and",
          "You have not see mosaics until you have seen the Bardo. I went only a few months after the awful attacks which left so many dead and injured; unsurprisingly it was almost empty. The guides were desperate - their livelihood has been destroyed. But they were also very keen to",
          "Food was amazing! I had best cuscuos ever!! Ambiance will take to era of kings & Queens!! Must book before hand if you wish to have a seat.",
          "I wanted to visit for such a long time, so glad I finally made it. Staff are not that friendly for Tunisians. I thought one was being nice when he offered to show me some items cordoned off, but then he asked for money. The entrance is not cheap for Tunisia but there is much to",
          "We thought the museum is closed on Saturday, but it isn't and we still don't really know whether they close on a Friday or Monday... It was almost empty except for the two of us and maybe 3 - 4 other guys. We were there rather late, around half 2 and the museum closed at",
          "This is the oldest and the most important of Tunisian museums. Over a century ago, it was established in the premises of a Beylical palace, for the most part built in the mid XIXth century, and which has retained all the features of a princely residence. It underwent several",
          "If you are into mosaics, it was definitely pretty neat, but nothing amazing. One note, since the terrorist attack last year, the museum did not fix the bullet holes or broken class in the exhibits, which is quite surreal to see.",
          "Nice cultural place. Worth to visit and discover tunisian history and the deepest civilisations since ages.",
          "I went there in June of 2014 and had a great time at this museum. We spent about 3 total hours looking at all the incredible mosaics and other interesting historical artifacts. I loved learning about different time periods and the influence of Middle Eastern and Punic/Roman",
          "Bardo Museum is not only seen the stranger who came to Tunisia. I most liked the part of the Arab era, which was the harem. The ceilings are with wery beautiful plaster work, beautiful arabesques. Very interesting is the part of the mosaic that is left of the ancient Romans.",
          "We visited the Bardo with high expectations after all we'd heard about the museum, and we were definitely not disappointed. I've never seen such an amazing collection of mosaics from Roman and early Christian times, and spent a long while studying their detail. I also give",
          "the best collection of mosaics in the world... Punic, Roman and Christian mosaics . I visited this museum after visiting the Museo Archeologique in Sousse, which is smaller and also a great collection.",
          "We went to the Bardo recently and it was beautiful. It gives a great glimpse into the storied history of Tunisia, and is a must for anyone who loves museums. Personally I am not that in to museums, but I am still glad I went. If you have the opportunity to go with a tour guide",
          "Sadly, this museum is mostly empty now, but the collection is world-class. Come to enjoy a beautiful museum that is full of history and amazing treasures (including some of the largest mosaics in the world).",
          "Go to the Bardo. Go to Tunis. Tunisia is magnificent and deserves every support from respectful visitors.",
          "The building of the museum is a former palace that was renovated between 2009 and 2012 bringing modernity to the museum. The collection of ancient mosaics is breathtaking.Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Very nice place to visit, it is a place where you can enjoy history and periods of Tunisia historical developments and ages. The place is very clam and the information shared are beyond value.",
          "A ton of history is present at the museum. It's not huge, but large enough to keep you busy for few hours. They are closed ok Mondays.",
          "I loved this museum. You can see so many kinds of things. And the building is very romantic as well. It is a must if you are in Tunis. :)",
          "Great museum, with collection of mosaics. Beautiful Carthaginian artefacts from 7th century BC onwards.",
          "This must be the best mosaic museum in the world. From the small to ones that cover the floor, if you're interested in Ancient roman artefacts this is a must",
          "My favorite Roman mosaic museum unquestionably is the one in Gaziantep in southern Turkey, and there are many others in Italy that I have been to many times. But I have been coming here for decades, and I truly marvel every time I come here.",
          "We visited the museum just a month after the massacre in March 2015 and chose to use a guide (highly recommended). There were still bullet holes in some of the display cases and the walls which was a little distressing but the artefacts were well displayed and the mosaics",
          "We simply loved the museum. In time of little tourism and relatively short time after the attacks on the museum it was a special experience to be there. The shooting wholes in the glass monters reminded us of this. But the hundreds of mosaics are as always simply amazing. For us",
          "This is a great museum, with a world class collection of mosaics. Even for the uneducated like me, you cannot help but be impressed with the size, variety, skill, artistry ... and the living history. After initially \"naah, too boring\", I'm glad I did: I have been three times",
          "Amazing place - located in a palace that once belonged to the Bey (king) of Tunisia. The new extension financed by the World Bank is excellent, exhibits are very well exposed and even big mosaics can be admired in great detail. Very good exhibits on the history of Tunisia.",
          "Wonderful Roman mosaics as well as fascinating, and often beautiful Carthaginian artefacts from 7th century BC onwards. All very well displayed and instructively labelled..",
          "Inspiring in more than one way. Go and be part of the new wave of tourists to support theSe wonderful people",
          "World class museum of possibly the best Roman mosaics. Well laid out in a large modern museum. If in Tunis this is a must. Easily accessible by tram. Security now good. Take time to relax in the lovely garden after.",
          "You haven't been to Tunis if you didn't visit Bardo Museum. It has the largest mosaic collection of the world. It's simply grandiose ! The museum does also include artefacts from all civilizations that have crossed the country, which are very many. I would recommend a guided",
          "Love this museum so sad it had to be a place where there was an act of terrorism. It's a shame. I love Tunisia.",
          "We had a guided tour of this museum. The mosaics and ancient artifacts are amazing. We are not scholars but surely anyone can appreciate the skill and artistry that has has gone into making these wonderfully preserved pieces. Strongly recommend.",
          "A different and beautiful museum which I recommend to visit. At first I did not feel extremely attracted to go to a museum full of Roman mosaics, but I loved it once there. I believe it is the largest colection of Roman mosaics, which means you cannot find a place like this even",
          "This is a very nice museum with ancient artifacts from the Romans and Phoenicians aging thousands of years old! Amazing things to see here. It is very nice and the museum guides are very helpful.",
          "Beautiful and sprawling museum. Definitely worth spending the entire afternoon. The museum encompasses a large breadth of history, from Roman mosaics to Greek pottery and North African relics. The building is a former palace with cavernous ceremony rooms. Admission is very",
          "If you like mosaics this is the best place to come as the world's best and biggest collection is there. Once you've seen this museum you don't need to bother going to any of the other ones that sell themselves as having mosaics. There's a few more items to see there but mosaics",
          "The Bardo musueum is in a nice building, with a mix of varied architeture styles according to th evarious epochs of building and extensions. The collection of tiled floors is simply amazing, and the other pi\u00e8ces on display give a glimpse of the local and regional history. To be",
          "For anyone worried about security, we felt safe and welcome. The mosaics are stunning and on a scale that is just amazing!",
          "This is one of the world's great museums. You cannot go to Tunis without visiting. The Roman mosaics are exceptional.",
          "Historically rich and surprisingly well maintained. Courageous are the tunisian people who continue to oppose the scoundrels that are trying to bring their country down",
          "Much has changed here since 2009, and another Islamic Museum next door is set to reopen before long. The Bardo is tops for Roman mosaics, with a small but impressive collection of Qallaline pottery and tiles and a high-class miscellany of classical and Islamic art.",
          "You really need a good guide to make you travel across 3000 years of rich civilizations that ruled this tiny but great country. From prehistoric finds, you move to Phoenician times, Carthage, Roman era then Byzantines and Vandals to a complete change after the Arabs came to",
          "This was the same museam that sadly there was an attack earlier this year that killed over 23 people. Outside the entrance you can see those killed, their names ands ages which is surreal. However don't let this put you off! This is a very interesting museam full of original",
          "This museum had the most excellent mosaics and historical artifacts from Ancient Rome and great historical information about the history of Carthage. It is well organized and very manageable in two-three hours as an independent traveler.",
          "Bardo was better than expected. Mosaic collection is second to none. New section does great job of displaying them uncluttered. Poignant reminder of the attacks with memorial out front and bullet damaged cases and room. Very sad.",
          "My visit to the Bardo was just a few weeks after the terrible acts that happened there. The museum had just reopened and I can not imagine a visit to Tunis without stopping here. The quality and quantity of mosaics is incredible. From the small samples to the incredible",
          "You must see this museum. There are unbelievable roman and arabic beautiful stuff and arts there. Amazing!",
          "This museum houses the largest collection of Rom, an mosaics in the world, very well displayed and lit, of incredible lifelikeness - unlike less refined mosaics, many of the ppl or Gods depicted in the best works have actual personalities and you feel you can sense their",
          "This is a world class museum. I visited it before the terrorist attack so I'm not sure what all was damaged in the attack but it is worth seeing. If you have an interest in ancient history then this is a must-see. Lots of Roman, Carthaginian, and Mediterranean history. The main",
          "I was impressed with this museum, plenty to see and showed lots of history. Glad I visited before the troubles started. Nice photo opportunities.",

          "Security is evident at the museum but not so obtrusive as to spoil your visit to this incredible place. Have never seen so many beautiful mosaics. The building itself is a museum having gone through many renovations and restorations over the centuries. The ancient mosaics and",
          "On a rainy day, our guide takes us to the Bardo museum, a miracle of ancient mosaics and Roman statues. Our guide rushes us through the ground floor of the museum and when I inquire about the other two floors he lies without blinking that they are both empty! The museum has one",
          "We had no idea about it before. But really we are under the impression. How they did things like that many many years ago. You cannot describe but only experience.",
          "It is worth the detour. Never saw this number of mosaics in one place. I really liked it a lot. The old palace itself has some rooms that are worth seen (music room, harem, etc.) Careful. It closes early (16:00 or 16:30) as you need to see them with the day light.",
          "We had a guided tour through the museum and we were fascinated. The museum offers a lot of great restored historical art such as mosaics, pottery, sarcophagus and statues and the guide told us a lot about the Tunesian history and the history of some pieces of art in the museum.",
          "So glad we went to The Bardo. I was nervous about going but was reassured by the obvious presence of security. The museum is amazing and for 1 dinar you can take as many photos as you want. My only gripe and the reason for 4* is the lack of a tea/coffee area. Just a slot machine",
          "We visited the Bardo in May 2015 about a month after the shootings. There is a thoughtful memorial by the entrance. The museum is well-organized and interesting, the mosaics are fabulous.",
          "Heavy security since the attack in March, but very few tourists on the day I went. It's a fabulous place to spend a couple of hours wandering around. Beautiful architecture and spectacular artefacts that cover all the important periods of the Carthegian, Punic and Roman era.",
          "The quality of the mosaics collected in this museum is extraordinary. It's hard to believe they are still here after so many years of use and exposure to the elements. The museum building itself is beautiful and modern. If you really like mosaics, also go to El Jem and go to the",
          "You will never see as many mosaics in one place in your entire lifetime as here. Not especially intuitive in its lay-out, one wanders around and is constantly surprised by the variety and quality of the museum's contents.",
          "I can't believe people don't talk about this museum like they do about all the greats ...it is amazing, I have never seen mosaics like it. Don't be put off by the terrible events there bardo is amazing and well worth the visit",
          "So many brilliant mosaics over 2000 years old.Also carpet,statues,ceiling and wall decorations.Beautiful",
          "If there was enough signage the visit would have been greater. But I, with friends, made sure we visit all the halls and see most of the contents of the museum. Here you find Rome, Cairo, Istanbul fingerprints along with Berber heritage. Tunisia was the perfect location for",
          "Plus bullet holes that demonstrate that unfortunately senseless violence lives right alongside beauty. The museum is a truly great one if you appreciate ROMAN ANTIQUITIES. The Tunisian people are rightfully proud of this museum. Support them by visiting it and their country.",
          "Fab museum and quite breathtaking to see the collection of ancient relics from the area. The museum itself is modern, clean, has helpful information in multiple languages and the staff were friendly and Cleary wanted visitors to have the best experience.",
          "The Bardo Museum comprises statues from the Romanian period and Phoenician periods in Tunisia but is specially known as the largest Mosaic Museum in the world. This art prevailed in this roman proconsular region of North Africa.",
          "Maybe this was because too many items were \"Exhibited in Leiden\", maybe because I'm just not a fan of mosaics, but the general impression was not that good, as I expected.",
          "Went with a Thomas cook visit was a beautiful place the mosaics and artifacts are lovely well worth seeing no need to worry about security it is right here with police and armed guards the sad part is they still haven't replaced the glass and plaster on the walls the bullet",

          "I visited there two weeks before the sad day. Actually, when I found this, there are two guardians with no caution, of course holding rifles. Anyway, it is the very big place displaying so many tiles from the ancient days. The most are explained in both french and english.",
          "A place where you can have an idea Tunisia history. Great collection of Mosaics. Not to far from the Medina which make it easy to reach.",
          "You could say it is obscene to recommend it after the terrorist attack of 18 March, but a. It will be totally safe now and b. An act of solidarity. It is the home of an uncomparably stunning collection of antique mosaics.",
          "An English speaking guide was available at the museum which really highlighted some of the displays and to appreciate it more. The history of the building (which was a palace) is just as interesting as the history displayed by the mosaic carpets which came from rich peoples'",
          "very good preserve mosaics and Roman scuptures and if you like a little bit of history this trip is for you , for me nothing exciting!",
          "An amazing collection, covering over 3000 years of history. From the Punic, the native civilization of the country to all the the ones that succeeded, the Romans, the Visigoths, the Byzantines, The Arabs, the Ottomans, the Italians, the Spanish, the French... Special mention",
          "The price was 11 Tunisian dinars which is about \u00a34 so it was reasonably priced. There was a great collection of Roman mosaics and the museum, which used to be a palace, was very beautiful. I didn't feel like there was much more in the museum except a few bits and pieces of Roman",
          "Beautiful art and architecture. A cool and calm place in the middle of a bustling city. Easy to reach by metro, with a little walking.",
          "The building didn't look that much from the outside but inside we were blown away by the amount of mosaics and the sizes of them. We were whisked back in time and thoroughly enjoyed what we thought was going to be a short boring visit! How rude of us and how wrong. These",

          "The mosaics are unbelievable. A really well-curated museum. Unlike some of the other musea in Tunis, this has been done profesionally. It's also a lovely building. See especially the Virgil mosaic.",
          "Stunning Roman Carthaginian collection of mosaics and statues. Museum sadly lacks information at each display point ; thank goodness we had our guide.Poor museum shop; no cafe; other museums do it so much better. Yet it is a very interesting collection.....",
          "We enjoyed a trip to the Bardo Museum. If you like mosaics and a bit of history then you are in the right place. We went with a tour guide which was helpful and then for some lunch in a very nice restaurant.",
          "I was blown away by the quality of this museum. You can see they've put a lot of effort into renovating and restoring this museum over the last few years. Its well laid out, easy to navigate and extremely rich with exhibits and history. If you want to understand Tunisia and it's",
          "We visited here whilst we had a driver for the day. If you're into Roman history then it's a must do, if not then you can take it or leave it. There seemed to be a lot of the same and not much variety. Many of the rooms were just closed off. After an hour we felt we'd seen all",
          "The ancient- the christian and the byzantine idioms are enlivened here. Good state, pristine, 'pebble work', metaphorically the mosaic is solid, constructivist brush work. Here at its best. Thematically, coloristically, narrative and beauty.",
          "This is an amazing museum! There are almost too many great mosaics to take in during a single visit. The building is being renovated but open nonetheless. Don't forget your camera, pictures are allowed.",
          "This is an interesting space. It combines an old historic building with a contemporary new one. Endless rooms of mosaics and ruins pulled from around the nation. Could use some more explanations in English, but it's pretty amazing to see what they've put here. Lots was missing",

          "As other travelers have noted, this is the place to see stunning examples of mosaics, sculptures, artifacts, etc. The museum is beautifully done with lots of natural light. I was surprised tot be allowed to walk on 7th c. mosaics! You won't be able to see this anywhere else in",
          "When the taxi dropped us off.. I thought a mistake had been made. The building is in the middle of the true city (not a touristy spot, as far as I could tell) and fairly unassuming from the entrance...But step inside and WOW! Step in further....AMAZING! If you are a history",
          "The museum is very good with a lot of mosaics and other statues. Is very beautiful and the entire visit takes a lot of time.",
          "It is easy to get n with taxi. Not accept more than 6 dinars from the center to museum. Inside very precious Greek repert at 1 floor. The harem is fascinating and very impressive. The location and the exposition are beautiful. Ask for the free guide. Everityng become more",

          "Having visited Carthage yesterday, we were unprepared for the sheer scale and quality/quantity of mosaics. assumed the ones on floor we walked across were recreations but no! The underwater treasures from Mahdia were truly amazing.",
          "A fantastic museum, really a must see while in Tunis. The amount of mosaics is amazing, I heard they had a vast collection but never imagined what a fantastic amount of mosaics and such a beautiful display. A world class museum.",
          "This place has the most Roman mosaics anywhere in the world. Very nicely kept up, thought eh electricity was out when we were there. Good guides. Overall, definitely a must visit if in Tunis.",
          "The museum was worth every Euro we spent. It was very accessible. If you like history and art is a must go. The bad thing is if you are part of the cruise ship this is the last place they will take you and in a rush.",
          "If you are into mosaics then you are going to love this museum! Took a taxi out and the tram back. Very easy to get to and once inside the museum it was beautiful. Definitely a world-class museum.",

          "Some wonderful pieces but as the museum is in the process of renovation/additions the access to some areas is unpredictable - but there is so much to see, anyway.",
          "An extensive and beautiful collection of mosaics. The museum itself is gorgeous. The museum was made out of someone's palacial home.",
          "Best selection we have seen in our travels ,spacious and very well lite lots of natural light . First Class",
          "This is a must see place for anyone visiting Tunisia. Ideally before you head out to the temples and ancient sites as you will get to see many of the original mosaics so you will have a better appreciation of the scale of this art form. The museum is vast and is worth visiting",
          "We were lucky enough to have our guide with us when we visited the museum and he was able to show us around the best rooms of this very extensive museum, and I would certainly recommend a guide to show you around. The sheer number of mosaics on display was amazing, and they were",
          "I loved the set up. Large rooms giving space to great artifacts.. There were good descriptions explaining what you were looking at. I spent much time reading. I would have liked a better arrow system that would lead us to all the rooms in sequence.",
          "Our fixed price taxi (5 hours, 70 euro) picked up from the port took us on a tour that was simply stunning, surprising and informative. The Bardo museum was simply breathtaking in its historical footprint of a bygone era and provided us with insight into the wonders of ancient",
          "The national museum is very nice, if you like roman mosaics they have a very large collection of them and make up a good part of the Museum, Part of the Museum is in an old Palace and that very ornate rooms and ceilings.",
          "The Bardo Museum is definitely worth seeing if you are in Tunis. It has the most amazing mosaic collection I have ever seen, better than anything in Rome. And it is house partly in an old presidential palace that is almost worth the price of admission itself. We went with a",
          "This museum is huge that you'll spend more time that you think. So many beautiful mosaics that are very well preserved! You might get lost in all the information you read, I think it will be better if you have a guided tour as it is really interesting and you will definitely",
          "Maybe I'm not a museum person. But the Bardo does have some wonderful Roman and Byzantine mosaics displayed. It's just after seeing too many of them that I lose interest. I was more interested in Carthaginian relics, and the Bardo does have some of that. If you need to get out",
          "It is a bit far from City Center but worth the visit. Great architecture, great displays, great mosaics. What a surprise!!!!!",
          "I've seen Roman mosaics all over the Roman world but this museum has actually used them as they were originally intended as floor coverings as well as on the walls. I've never seen so many in such good condition anywhere. The museum itself is beautiful and a former palace. The",

          "This place is amazing. If you love mosaics and love classics, this is literally the best place on earth to see them!",
          "A very big place with plenty of mosaics, the museum itself is converted from an old palace with nice architecture (interior) and decorations... worth spent a half day there given there is not much to see in Tunis",
          "The mosaics found here are known throughout the world and they do not disappoint. They are amazing. So well preserved. They are housed in an old palace the ceilings of which are magnificent. I suppose you have to be into this kind of thing but the museum is unmissable.",
          "Beautiful museum and well laid out. Most of the exhibits are mosaics, but exquisitely preserved. Both our tour guide and I cringed, however, to see mobs of tourists traipsing across centuries-old mosaic floors........",
          "Hundreds of square meters of incredible roman mosaics, in what was once the bey palace, now contained within a larger modern building of fine architectural design. And bits of punic remains from Carthage. Accessible by tramway (metro) plus a short walk.",
          "Really impressive museum with a fantastic collection of huge mosaics and I had a well informed helpful guide. I went there alone on the tram from Tunis. It was quite easy as the tram station is just opposite the main train station.",
          "Really impressive. Rooms of fabulous mosaics. Note it is closed Monday.It is possible to go there by tram from the centre of Tunis. The tram station is opposite the maine station. Its really easy as the tram stops about 5 minutes walk from the entrance.",
          "Vary modern facilities but they were still many sections closed off and empty. Easily found return taxi across the street.",
          "OK - I love all aspects of Roman history but the mosaics in this museum are the finest you will see in the world - including Rome, Pompeii, Ephesus. They are all remarkably well preserved and presented beautifully in a 13th century palace (all the ceilings of the palace have",
          "If you like Mosaics, this is your place. Perhaps you will find there more mosaics than what you will find in Rome or Greece. What is impressive is that the mosaic in Tunisia is well kept and preserved, some of them look almost untouched. We combined our trip to Bardo Museum with",
          "This amazing museum is housed inside of a 13th-century palace, which is located in the suburbs of Tunis. It contains a vast collection of Roman mosaics and other antiquities from Ancient Greece, Tunisia, and the Islamic period. Very well laid out and really peaceful. Since",
          "This museum has the best collection of ancient mosaics in the world - the world. It is worth a trip to Tunis just to see this museum, along with the ruins in Carthage. The museum is not air conditioned, and there was no cafe, so it's not good for an all-day visit. But, the",
          "Although not usually a museum fan, this one is worth a visit. It's a 10 - 15 minute taxi ride from the medina and should cost 5 - 6 dinars. The collection of mosaics are stunning.",
          "It is a must! Very impressive collection and great design of the museum itself. We aware of the taxi drivers all over Tunis, 3/4 will try to over charge by ridiculous amounts. One asked 30 euros for a 5 dollar trip. We obviously didn't take it, but be conscious that it happens.",
          "The Bardo is well laid out in a very beautiful building. Its explanations in four languages are long (very long!) but manageable. If you're not into mosaics, don't come, but otherwise: Do spend a couple of hours here!",
          "This unique collection of Roman mosaics ( found in Tunisia ) nare housed in the former palace of the Bey of Tunis. The appartments of the former Bey were designed and made by 17th century Italian artists. The mosaics are of the highest quality. We were only able to sped 2",

          "Beautiful mosaics. Quite and cool. Overall one of the most peaceful places in the city. I gladly payed the ten dinar more than once to have a place to sit and write sans cigarette smoke or unwanted attention.",
          "you can't leave Tunisi and Tunisia without seeing this attraction. Unique. You can find big roman mosaics that we don't find anymore in our country. Archeological museum: you can compare the mosaics of different historical times: roman, punic, christian, islamic. Fascinating.",
          "A visit to Tunis would not be complete without a visit to the Bardo Museum which houses an excellent collection of mosaics, statuary and artifacts spanning the ages. Here you'll find all the Carthage that you wished was on the Carthage tour and so much more. Arrive early,",
          "Worth the trip: the most impressive display of mosaics I ever saw. You will not find such a display of Roman mosaics in Roms itself, unique and a true must.",
          "I went to the Bardo Museum the first day after arriving in Tunis, which was great because my visit gave me a wonderful perspective of the places I would see in Tunisia. It is a lovely, relaxing place where you can absorb the history and culture of Tunisia...totally awesome",
          "Two connected, but different, streams of cultural and religious history. Huge collection of mosaics - many being put to the purpose they were designed for: being walked on. Just think about walking on two thousand years of history. Lots about early christian development and the",
          "Not having visited the Bardo Museum for many years, an invitation to a private evening event there was the chance to see the how the restoration work is progressing. This wasn't an occasion for a full tour but I could appreciate how beautifully the mosaics are now displayed and",
          "Too much to see when you are doing Carthage. Some amazing mosaicsthat have been painstakingly restored and conserved. Don't be tempted into the cupboard by the staff who will show you something \"special\". In our case a pitch dark gallery that was only visible once I had looked",
          "Since I first visited this museum over 15 years a go things have changed. Well done to them too. The changes improve the experience immensely. Ok it can be a little hard to find the specific room you are looking for and the caf\u00e9 seems non existent with the book shop an area that",
          "Bardo has some amazing items, such as Roman mosaics and sarcophagi, and a mosaic baptistry from 2nd century. Loved the Punic material and the items from a ship that sank some 1700 years ago which were discovered in 1907 at Mahdia. You could see the shell of the creatures that",
          "If there were only one place to visit in Tunis. If you want waste time in meaningless Souks or attraction. Only ONE MUST SEE... LE BARDO Museum. Walking literally on history in the widest collection of Roman empire artefacts but not only...Feel it! Touch it! Live it...",
          "My first activity in Tunisia and definitely worth the trip. The mosaics were beautiful as well as the modern art exhibition. A wonderful introduction to Tunisia in my opinion--highly recommended.",
          "This museum is 2nd biggest in Africa after Egyptian Museum. Beautifully Crafted arts with Roman and Christian mosaics. Worth a visit for 1 hour. The building is modern and chic as well.",
          "I loved visiting the Bardo Museum: I had never seen such a beautiful collection of mosaics. The space is also nice, very modern and airy. i also really loved the rooms from Ottoman times. The museum shops is somewhat disappointing: they run out of many books (in French and",
          "This is a beautiful museum filled with beautiful art. It's easy to get to by Tunis's inexpensive taxis and you can spend an afternoon here. The Romans loved north Africa and left behind floors, walls and panels of decorative mosaics. I love the Bardo.",
          "I was expecting to see a good collection of mosaics but was blown away both by the number and the quality of these. The building is roomy and well laid out so you have a good chance to browse and get close up. Watch out for the attendants trick of showing you the sectioned off",
          "Make sure to visit the second floor! This museum offers the largest collection of Roman mosaics in the world. This museum is two-fold since it was beforehand a palace. Therefore you get to see an outstanding museum collection while learning about the life as it was in the",

          "Large Museum with the definitive collection of Old Roman Mosaics - some on the floor - some on the walls. Just an excellent collection.",
          "This museum is really a trip. If you think about it, most museums you walk into, you go and look at statues, you look at paintings, etc. This museum you walk into a room and you are blown away by the room as a whole. Two-story mosaics, mosaics spanning two different rooms,",
          "Reached this Museum from Tunis centre by yellow taxi for about 7 Tunisian Dinars (1 TD = approx 40p). It took about 30 mins in the heavy lunch time traffic. This is a large, fascinating museum with huge ancient mosaics, artefacts, beautiful tiling and ceilings. There are many",
          "Our guide was an archaeology professor and he took us through the highlights of the museum as we were only in Tunis for 1 day. The collection of mosaics is impressive but eventually it gets somewhat repetitious. There were also some earlier works such as statues of Numidian",
          "this is the place for you. I have been to many museums around the world but I have never seen so many mosaics, so well preserved. Part of the museum is in the old palace of the Bey and that has the most beautiful tile work and ceilings, reminiscent of the Alhambra in Granada.",
          "This museum has beautiful ancient mosiacs - very well preserved and presented. I would recommend a trip to this old palace which houses artifacts pre-roman and arabic. Very little of the actual city of Carthage survived the looting and stealing of many other countries. It has",

          "The most impressive mosaic collection I've ever seen. The exposition is well organized into historical periods and themes and displayed on three levels. When I was there (December 2013), some minor rooms were in the preparation, but this does not diminish the overall stunning",
          "Museum itself is good but I encountered an unhappy instance. There was a guard who was nice to explain the display and showed us around. Then he directed us to an area with restricted lines for marble coffins. He removed the line and said we can go to visit. Then when we got out",

          "If you are interested in roman history, this is a unique opportunity. There are plenty of mosaics that showing different aspects of roman life that time. On top, I've seen a few mosaics I found provided unique insights, differing much from Italian roman history. One example, I",
          "I am not that interested in mosaics and I was totally in awe of the Bardo. There are more mosaics there than I would guess nearly anywhere else in the world and they are of astonishing quality. The mosaics are mostly from the Roman era in the 1st through 5th centuries AD,",
          "Usually I appreciate renovations and modern architecture, but I think that Bardo has lost a little of its incredible atmosphere by its inclusion in a modern aseptic building. Perhaps once all rooms will be filled with archaeological finds it will be better. Nonetheless the roman",

          "Great museum for someone who is into mosaics. However, I am passionate about history but this museum gave almost nothing for me. The mosaics were beautiful but there was almost no information about them at all. I like museums that tell (his)tory, not just show works of art. In",

          "Its a beautiful place to visit with family .you have to be so early there so you can enjoy all the games there ! I just dislike the part when kids they dont have much games to play because of security conditions based on how tall they are and not on how dangerous they can be",

          "It's a place that can be visited for amusement, mainly for children. The main problem is that it get get very crowded at certain times. You have to have an idea about it before buying your tickets.",

          "Can be seen as quite dated and when we went quite a few rides were closed. Very empty in may - upside, no waiting to go on rides. Not many concession stands round the establishment, so you can be walking around for ages before you are able to get a drink. The option to buy",

          "A good place for families. It was included in our booking. We went there with the whole group. Donno hiw much is the entrance fee but it is a nice place for families. You can eat the best ice cream here from Macedonia. The park is in wel state and gives you the chance to enjoy",

          "We didn't go into the amusements as they do not appeal to us, but we did go upstairs to the shops, it drives you mad the shop keepers try to anything to go into shops. Prices are high and you need to barter well. There are plenty of restaurants about and again the waiters are",
          "Go careful they have a baby camel you can strike and feed and they takes picture with your iPad/phone and they charge you dinar. Be very careful most in this place are very demanding so it can be a bit patient testing but there are some nice shops who don't pester you.x advice",
          "It is in Jasmine hammamet. Surrounded by a lot of restaurants and bars. You pay for the entry 20 dinnars but it is worth to do. You will for sure enjoy. It is no very big but they have enough attractions to enjoy.",

          "This is a fairly small park. We visited late in the day and were given a discounted rate as park was closing within 2 hours. I'm glad we didn't allocate a full day to spend here because of we had, we'd have been very disappointed! Grounds are well looked after, waterslides are",
          "We were able to go to Carthageland for free through our hotel. We thought it was worth a try and it wasn't too far away to walk from our hotel. It's not massive but there was plenty to do for a half day trip. They have rides such as The Log Flume, River Canyon, Pirate Ship, a",
          "It only had a few rides of note. A spinny thing, a rapids (we went on that 4 times to get our money's worth) and a log flume. The log flume was \"opening in one hour\".....for the whole time we were there...we left with disappointed children and went back to our hotel complex",
          "Not much there, about 6 rides for children, 6 rides for adults. Play park, face painting, we arrived in april 2015 at 11.00a.m. opening time and no one else was there. My granddaughter her thr rides to herself and one of the staff operating the rides took ger from one ride to",

          "Visited Carthageland Hammamet Museum. Beautiful and interested scenary and to a certain degree hassle free. Found a place that did a decent cup of coffee .... (Cafe Latte). Beautiful buildings - so if you get a chance it's worth a visit ...",
          "If you like lifesize models of elephants and pushy shopkeepers you'll love it... A few decent shops but be prepared to bargain hard.",

          "Whilst staying Tunis, this was something of fun day out. Typical theme park and lots to do. Not as big as the theme parks in the UK but it had its fair share of thrills and spills. As it was just near the hotel I stayed in it was worth the half day visit. I would come back",
          "We didn't really plan to come here by stumbled across it. Entrance fee is 20DT although if you have kids or want to go into the 5D cinema you can get an offer at the ticket desk for other activities. Lots of school kids when we went, luckily they queued behind us on each ride",
          "been told it was very good by people who visited it from same hotel. It looked very good value and locals seem to flock there at weekends so must be good",
          "We got tickets to go to the Theme park for free by our hotel and we ended up going twice while we was away. Its got good rides but there's only 5 rides there but there's a water park there as well which looked good but wasn't open as we went in march 2015. If we return to",
          "Rubber ring water ride was good but now very shabby and many of the features in the tunnels did not work and this was on first day 7th March after being closed.Log flume elevator kept breaking down with people half way up bit scary,one couple had to gingerly move from one canoe",
          "felt intimidatd by shopkeepers did not stay nonstop hassle from entry to exit very rude if not buying in shop",
          "you like your history this is really good. As we went on an organised trip you didn't have much time there, so try and go on your own.",
          "Contrary to other opinions I thought this was rather poor. It might make a good pastime for a few hours with the children but only if you can get a deal to get in cheaper than the gate prices. Not worth the money in my opinion.",
          "Wow this is a must visit!! There a seal lion show! And all the African Safari experience to wet your appitite for a visit to other parts of this amazing country",
          "We went here a few times during our holiday, two females. The atmosphere is amazing, lots of shops, pubs, nightclub and even a cinema inside. It is vibrant, colourful and has some fantastic sights, sounds and smells. At night it is really busy, so hold on to little ones and",

          "We paid a visit as it was included with our hotel package it killed a couple of hours but there is t a great deal there some of the rides were closed witch was dissapointing but we got in for free don't think I would have been very happy if I paid",
          "Went here a few tubes during our week in Tunisia. We did a horse & cartridge ride which are located just outside. The atmosphere is very good both day and Eve when we went.",
          "Me and my family really enjoyed the day out. The zoo was really good. And good food and drink for the day",
          "It's very interesting place to visit.Most of all I liked waterslides.There are two of them.The first one is on a boat with up and downs. It was very exciting.The second one is like an adventure into the history of Tunisia. It was magic! It's a good place to visit with children.",
          "Had a great time round this ancient building site, did get tied with a guide which anyone should try and avoid if they are in a hurry! Luckily enough we made our own way there",
          "Very tired and tacky no more to say avoid it waste of money same old tack in all the shops and pressure selling, looked better at night when you couldn't see the faults",
          "We went there in the evening. It is a very nice area to walk. Have attractions, many restaurants and many souvenir shops. It was not very crowded because as they told us it is in the dead season, but I liked the area very beautiful.",
          "Good walk about shops, camels, elephants and places to eat. Enjoyed our trip.. Didn't like the shop keepers telling you to come into my shop, they all sold the same....",
          "Not great for all kids. We went with three 10 7 and 2. Fairground rides here suitable for 2 year old only 10 year old coul get on. 7 year old got on another but not 10 year old. 2 year old could not get on anything. Think they need to review policy.",
          "Terrific place for kids and grown up adults. The ticket is not expensive and it also includes 5D cinema and one other attraction I forgot the name of. We had so much fun there :)",
          "Good trip, very interesting guide but would have liked longer to browse. The history was fascinating and the views were stunning.",
          "Nice to see real camels sat at the front entrance, but that was it. Again people wanting money form taking a picture on my own camera. Couldn't wait to leave.",
          "Not many rides to go on, and the rides are not great either, u couldnt spend a full day here, u also get asked for a tip in the loos for them passing u loo roll!",
          "Pay 13 Dinar for a pint of \"beer\" at the British pub.... or go buy a handbag. Handbag is much better value",
          "Excellent value for money A few of the rides were not running and the park staff didn't seem to be in any hurry to open them for us to use even though they were not faulty",
          "It is the place where kids want to be... the adults can enjoy some of the rides as well. Food is available but you can take your own as well. We had great time, the rides are nice, not many though, it is a theme park with the American understanding of a theme park, but a very",
          "Carthageland is almost dead at the height of the day.. Why, because all the rides have ridiculous height restrictions. People avoid tbe place as it is not really suitable for kids unless they are about 10+",

          "... it was free / included in our all-inclusive package deal at a Medina hotel! The log flume was the only decent ride really - the rapid-river was closed on the day we were there. Very little shade for people queuing for rides (e.g. the pirate ship ride), not that queuing was",
          "Had a very disappointing hour at the park. Maybe we were expecting too much for 20 dr per head however the park was very small, only two rides suitable for teenagers, very loud with the resident DJ playing his music at full volume. The park felt generally dirty, seedy, with long",
          "Yasmine is the kind of place I would never go by myself, but it's excellent for children. Carthageland is not a very big park, you can do it in two hours. It gets very hot there in summer, so consider going towards the end of the day, Don't hesitate if you can buy the entrance",
          "loads to do for adults and children things you can not do in england. bad side is steep hills. didnt see dolphins but been told they are good",
          "We visited Carthage land with my 4 year old son in August 2014 and had a great day out. The park is quite small by our British theme park standards and has more for younger children. I think if you come with kids over 8 or 9 they may be disappointed as there are very few 'scary'",
          "This is a good change for smaller children from the sunbathing. There are rides for teenagers but not many. Our hotel gave us free entry so we went along and it did provide a change of scenery but not for long",
          "The staff members are very unprofessional and very few speak English. Absolute waste of time and money.",
          "We were there early on in July in the afternoon, it was very quiet and not a lot going on,but the whole resort was like this most rides were not on.It was fine for us as it come free with our all inclusive package from hotel. |I would not have been happy if id paid for it.It",
          "crap dont go.. only 3 rides and not worth the money.. we didnt know what it was before we went here.",
          "Reviewing for both the water park and the main theme park. The theme park was not family friendly. Doesn't open until 11am, just as it is getting too hot. Too many rides are over 110cm limit, which meant our youngest couldn't go on, leaving him with about 6 rides to choose",
          "I believe this is a wonderful place if you are travelling with children. It is reasonably priced and great fun. I was travelling alone so did not fine it to my taste.",
          "We enjoyed the rides especially the water ride however there isn't many rides to choose from. You could walk around the whole park and do some rides in less than an hour. However if you have children then they would enjoy it as there are quite a few children rides. We paid 17tnd",
          "we visit cartageland with my freinds really nice place and near our hotel just 5 munits.ther is mony restourand and cofe shop and magazine",
          "We were given tickets as part of the hotel all inclusive....it was awful. Most of it was closed. The guards were constantly blowing their whistle so my son felt he couldn't do anything!",
          "Great day trips, plenty. Of history, and not too long, just enough time to explore without getting bored. Guide was also excellent.",
          "Loved the sightseeing at Carthage - soaking up the ancient history with a very good guide! Then visited a medina and a museum showing how the people used to dress for special occasions such as weddings.",
          "a staged setting but quite authentic , kids would love this area, there is also a number of bars restaurants &shops to cater for everyone, well worth a visit",
          "Not like the theme parks in England, but had a good few hours there. A 4D cinema just on the outside with lots of places to eat near by. I have to say some of the rides are out dated and go abit against health and safety. There are a good selection of animals in the zoo area.",
          "we went on two trips to cathage land within our 2 week holiday, the first was to the waterpark which is small but very clean and good fun to get out and about for a few hours, the second we went to the theme park side of it which was good fun too and had lots of animals! we",
          "Cheap for the money but very little there, animals on display are not that interesting, park rides aimed at under 5s. Water park next door basic but does a job",
          "Different types of attractions. \u0131f you like to have fun that is the right place. Here is a kids like place.",
          "We went here for the afternoon. There are basically 2 sides, the wet side (swimming pool, wave machine, log flume etc) and the dry side (fun fair). and tickets have to be purchased separately. We opted for the dry side.. Has the usual that any funfair has, pirate ship, bumper",
          "A amusementpar for all in the family. But only one problem, that some of the things is only allowed for children or adults (Problem when the child is a little affraid, and wants a parent with him, and this is not allowed)",
          "special for parents and children it is big and nice place for a familly.the price not so expencive .and kids they love this place",

          "So so disappointed, my son is a good swimmer but still wasn't allowed to go on slides as they said he was too small (he is 9 ) one good thing to say about the place is the toilets were spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated with fresh flowers",
          "Really is an unforgetable day we have passed a perfect day in Carthage Land people have fun Good organisation Of course the 5D Cinema is the best one really you find yourself into the film with all details Good food in Aladin restaurant with the economic tarif Really we have",
          "Visited on the basis of having the day in aqua land water park.... A group of 4 of us (adults) visited thinking this would be a good day at a big water park... Got there and it's situated in the centre of Yasmin hammamet... Ok, not a bad thing. Went to get our tickets and was",
          "When we went we found not many of the rides were open, the children liked the bumper cars and log flume, and we had lkots of fun in the maze. Would not have been too impressed if we had paid but was a nice trip out with it been free.",
          "Visited this attraction as it was free and part of our \"all inclusive\" deal. It's a small theme park with more fast food outlets than rides!!..there is a small pets corner(Tunisia style). All in all if your younger than13 I think this place would keep you occupied for a couple",
          "I came here with two friends from Sousse. It was about 1.5 hour drive. We stayed for 3 hours but because of all the people we only managed 3 rides. Its more of kids park, we only counted 4 large rides in total. Nothing in comparison to six flags, reminded me more of a luna park",
          "Monstrous artificial construction which looks like something out of a bad Hollywood epic. Kids love it!",
          "We saw this thought I'd looked good and to be honest it was great for the kids and like me older big kids lots dancing music and shows going on",
          "If you go here to do some shopping go to the fixed price shops as they still work out cheaper even after all the bartering. They often give you a discount also.",
          "Plenty of activities and fun for the little ones including water slides also real camels at the entrance that you can take a sneeky picture of for free.",
          "Didnt give this a visit but passed the outside ,and as the queues were long and really busy it wouldnt entice me to go in ,if you have children it seems a very popular area of entertainment",
          "Well it wishes it was Disney. They are trying to make a memorable place for the tourists but it all feels a little forced. A pleasant enough afternoon but the locals do want your trade and can be quite forthright.",
          "This is more suited to younger children say under 14 years old, me and family did not go inside main park as little man to small,I am guessing theme park around 20 years old, nothing like UK Alton towers, Chessington ot Thorpe Park, more like Margate or Blackpool style",
          "Very nice inside many restaurants to pick from and shopping ,,, the fun fair in small but very cheep to go in ,,,",
          "The rides that we're open we're great fun & we enjoyed them but a lot of rides were in staffed so we were unable to go on everything that we'd paid for . Took less than an hour to do it all - pity",
          "we went to carthagland on day,there isnt a load of rides like we have here but great fun at a great price only cost us about 28 pound for 6 of us,the rapids is so much fun well worth a visit",
          "Two hours of awkward entertainment ending with nervous clapping. No veggie options either. Don't waste your money.",
          "Looks lovely from the outside but not worth the 22 dinar we paid for a 3 in 1 when half the attractions weren't working",
          "in my review of yasmin hammamet icalled it elephant land my appoligies, carthage land i thought although looking a bit a bit worse for wear was very good for children with enough to do for a day out , the 3-d cinema was good so was the aqua park as i say it was o.k. just",
          "Nobody told us that you weren't allowed to take food & drink in so it was all confiscated on arrival. (This was in th e Aqua Land part.). Was very surprised at the lack of slides. Not a great deal else in Carthage Land.",
          "I went here briefly whilst on Holiday in Hammanet and I guess I wouldn't want to spend the whole day there look and felt a bit bland.",
          "there were not so many rollercoasters as I expected but everything is beautiful, it just makes you smile all the time. Must see!!!",
          "A good day out but do not expect Alton Towers. This is a good park - Carthage Land and Aqua Land but it is not up to the standards of Disneyland. We enjoyed it though",
          "We were able to walk to Carthageland very easily and there was plenty to see and do. It was a local holiday when we went so I guess it was busier than usual but we still enjoyed our visit.",
          "We went to Carthage Land with 2 young children. They liked it of course, but we expected more from that place, as we had heard before that it is interesting place to visit. POSITIVES: - The idea is wonderful. Park is not far from any hotel in Yasmin Hammamet. In our case the",
          "Always love a visit here. Where else can you go on a log flume and go straight back on again without queuing? Staff welcoming and helpful.",
          "The good, the rides when staffed and open compare with their opposites in the EU. The bad, very few of the rides are open at one time and there are only a few rides. The ugly, the zoo part of the park contains small cages and you can see the animals in distress. Go at 9.30pm at",
          "Well worth a visit if you have young children. Not that suited for teenagers as they don't have rollercoasters but we have a three and 6 year old and perfect for them. It's not too big and not much queuing for the rides so ideal.",
          "great for children they just love seeing the animals and goin on the rides very reasonable price ,nice coffee shops to relax while children are going on rides ,they have even added a wave pool come slide section to carthage land so could spend all day",
          "Not as big as I thought it would be fir shopping prefer sousse and was lead to believe that the had plenty of fixed priced shops but was dissapointed",
          "for a moment of emotional release is good, lovely home, a little expensive for a 5 or 6 games. located in the tourist area, very nice to try",
          "Water park is quite small and if you have been to other water parks give it a miss. The other parks are not bad. Be aware on leaving park especially at night. It can get crowded and there are those around looking to take advantage. Be especially aware if you have a rented car!",
          "Got a lot to do here, ALI BABA land is great soft play area for kids, 5D cinema and small aqupark as well as other things",
          "A small hannibal themed park. A few rides the only decent ones really are the log flume and the rapids......OF NOTE dont bother going if you have kids under 1.2 metres. The staff here are rigid over height restrictions with a capital R. In a country whose attitude towards health",
          "The rides are very limited unless you are with a 5 year old. Luckily, we were, so he was happy. But we were not. The rides were worn down and in disrepair. Many of the rides were closed. Others didn't work at all. Not worth it all. Go on the pirate ships at the Marina",
          "Really annoying dont let you get past try stick stuff in your face to buy and even gave kids stuff then expected money.",
          "We had entrance included with our all inclusive deal and had a walk around. I'm sure young children will love it but the rides are not exciting or big enough for adults.",
          "A little bit expensive when you have children who are taller than 1.40m as they have to pay adult, but great fun once inside, Try not to go at the weekend as it gets very busy with local's and the queue's are very long for all the rides.",
          "It was OK but the ride with the boats which goes fast and spins is not safe so be careful, you can hurt yourself",
          "Very tacky, but seemingly enjoyed by the localsy who go there in numbers at the weekend.Sounded to be having great times,untill I realised that the screams of delight and joy were recorded",
          "A new attraction purpose built medina upper level has a mix of shops and restaurants there is a small theme park and water rides which the children will love The bars are great and if having a beer will keep on bringing you out dples of food on their menu which was great but",
          "Amazing park with a water park, rides and a great magical place for children especially. reasonable priced too",
          "Thisi s the theme park inside the medina area. Only open in the summer but it is clean and is the attraction of the area. Its based around Hannibal and the elephants.",
          "This is a wonderful place for kids, in the m\u00e9dina of Hammamet South. Lots of fun rides and during the summer they sometimes have baby lions and tigers you can pet. Nice cafes nearby for adults to rest while the kids have fun.",
          "open only in the weekends when we went. I would say its a great day out for the kids to have some fun.",
          "Indoor recreation area worth a trip but gets very busy. A combination of tunnels kids can run through. Also has restaurants on other levels.",
          "Visited while on holiday here and like others found the animals to be in poor nick, except for the camels at the entrance. Again not all rides were open but otherwise ok.",
          "This park has about 10(?) rides but they are not all open at the same time. A small animal section houses some poor looking animals including a lion and tiger which are kept in awful conditions - hard ground, small enclosure, nothing for them to do. Looks like solitary",
          "Rides werent all open and for those which were, were being manned by the same staff who closed one to run to the other in 15 min intervals. Zoo part was worse - animals neglected.",
          "aqualand was closed only open in summer even though temp was in 30's all week. so went around the attraction park and only 1 ride open 1 activity and a few animals all for \u00a36 each spent 15mins in there awful",
          "Small park, this would suit families with younger children who want a smaller area to look around. This is based in the new medina with the aqua park and cinema close by.",
          "Its small..like a mini thorpe park but lovely for kids..a few rides..there is also a museam that u see whilst on a ride..kids will love it//tells you about hammemet and has realistic moving dummies showing scenes..the aqua park wasnt open..may have been because we went in",
          "for the tourist who likes to be in with the crowds. Its impressive in some ways but total tourist tack! Loads of places to eat and drink!",
          "lots to do, 5d cinema is excellent best ive been to very fun for kids and adults. good for the price its 5dn to watch a short film it lasts around 10 mins",
          "It's only around \u00a310 per adult to get in to the theme park & the water park. The theme park was really good, a few decent rides & lots of kids ones. The river rapids & log flume were the best. There's also a mini zoo with monkeys, deer, goats, ostriches etc. There are plenty",
          "There are elephants not real that you can take photos together.. It seems a lovely place. Out Tunisia friends advised it so much but we did not have time to stop this time.",
          "Carthage land is geared more towards younger children but is good value especially as you only pay for the attractions you want to pay for so there is a varying price list as there are different options for play park, aqua land, 5D cinema etc. This allows for a family to budget",
          "We bought the 4 in 1 ticket that gives you access to the main entertainment area, the water park, a 5D cinema, and a Medina experience. it's quite a small scale affair, btu good all the same",
          "brilliant value for money! we went there the day we were leaving to pass away the hours. Good rides and a little zoo in there as well.",
          "Trip to Carthageland was too long with too many stops. You are given an hour to wander around on your own and then you meet back at your tour bus with your tour guide to go on to the next stop. When you have free time you are hassled by the locals to buy their wares.",
          "Plenty of fun on the slides and the wave pool. The entrance fee, food and drink also reasonably priced.",
          "Very very small, it was included in our package at Hotel DIar Mendina so went along. Poor and the water park has only 3 slides...also not worth going to. However It is open until 0230, so maybe when it is cooler the rides dont seem so much like torture, the log flume is the only",
          "It's not the Disney World of course but it has some good attractions for the kids ... And it's a great way to meet tunisian family there also !",
          "Nothing there, hardly anything open. Terrible rides. We were walking around the maze and found someone urinating against the wall - that just about sums it up! Give it a miss",
          "great theme park - just \u00a314 for a pass for here and the aqua park next door. Both small but at that price, cant complain!",
          "it is very nice even for kids and for adults, but make sure to get information for packages, as the information people don't offer you a package unless you ask.",
          "You can spend a whole day here and still want to go back for more. Height restrictions apply and our 4 year old missed out on a few things but it was still a great place to visit.",
          "This newish attraction is a kind of Disney-fied attempt at creating an old style Tunisia with fake plastic bricks and over-pushy and rude staff. Not worth the bother.",
          "This is a shopping Haven built for tourists and they see you coming, be wary! stick to you guns barter or leave the goods and shop in the Nabul Medina!",

          "if you can see the funny side of life then an experience!!",
          "It's a nice attraction, to visit with friends in order to have fun. Not a real priority if you're visiting Tunisia, but could be fun to have an evening there.",
          "As the season had not really begun most rides were closed. This park is aimed more at kids rather than adults. There are a few rides for adults.",
          "Can spend most of the day here. Reasonable snack bar inside as well",
          "very limited rides in comparison to other theme parks, but filled in an hour or so!",
          "the price was only 15dinah each ,once you were in ,u could go on the rides that they have then you can buy photos for 5dinahs each,there is a mini zoo,a camel u can go on,stalls that you can have something to eat at",
          "A fun afternoon for both kids and grown ups. Rides and activities catered for all ages, my kids 4,5,8 all had great fun. Rides go by height. Plenty to eat and drink. We were lucky to have a warm sunny day, although still too early in the season for the aqualand to be open.",

          "A good day out although be aware some of the locals with camels, birds of prey and desert foxes can get a bit pushy regarding paying to take photos",
          "been in the summer 2009 and a good day out, closed in winter time.",
          "This is the place where young and adult can have a good time together. There are many good cafes and restaurants. In summer it in very crowded.",
          "You\u2019ll find a world of entertainment in Yasmine Hammamet, the relatively recently developed adjunct to the popular holiday resort. It might not be to everyone\u2019s taste, but not everyone comes to Tunisia for desert culture and haggling in the souks. Take Cathageland. As theme",
          "Not worth the money and a very pale imitation of a disney resort ;skip it and you can hang around the surrounding new medina which you can like or dislike depending on your travel background",

It is reached from Tunis by the R23 road via La Goulette, or by the N9 road via Tunis-Carthage Airport.\nThe population as of January 2013 was estimated at 21,276, \nmostly attracting the more wealthy residents. \nThe Carthage Palace (the Tunisian presidential palace) is located on the coast.Carthage has six train stations of the TGM line between Le Kram and Sidi Bou Said: \nCarthage Salammbo (named for Salambo, the fictional daughter of Hamilcar), Carthage Byrsa (named for Byrsa hill), Carthage Dermech (Derm\u00e8che), Carthage Hannibal (named for Hannibal), Carthage Pr\u00e9sidence (named for the Presidential Palace) and Carthage Amilcar (named for Hamilcar).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nRoman Carthage was destroyed following the Muslim invasion of 698, and it remained undeveloped for more than a thousand years (being replaced in the function of regional capital by the Medina of Tunis under Arab and later Ottoman rule), until the establishment of the French protectorate of Tunisia in 1881.\nThe cathedral of St. Louis of Carthage was built  on Byrsa hill  in 1884.\nIn 1885, Pope Leo XIII acknowledged the revived Archdiocese of Carthage as the primatial see of Africa and Charles Lavigerie as primate.\n\nEuropean-style villas were built along the beach beginning in 1906; one such villa was chosen by Habib Bourguiba as the presidential palace in 1960.\nThe municipality was created by a decree of 15 June 1919.\nConstruction on the Tunis-Carthage Airport, which was fully funded by France, began in 1944, and in 1948 the airport become the main hub for Tunisair. \nIn the 1950s the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de Carthage was established to serve French families in Carthage. In 1961 it was given to the Tunisian government as part of the Independence of Tunisia, so the nearby Coll\u00e8ge Maurice Cailloux in La Marsa, previously an annex of the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de Carthage, was renamed to the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de La Marsa and began serving the lyc\u00e9e level. It is currently the Lyc\u00e9e Gustave Flaubert.After Tunisian independence in 1956, the Tunis conurbation gradually extended around the airport, and Carthage is now a suburb of Tunis.In February 1985, Ugo Vetere, the mayor of Rome, and Chedly Klibi, the mayor of Carthage, signed a symbolic treaty \"officially\" ending the conflict between their cities, which had been supposedly extended by the lack of a peace treaty for more than 2,100 years.\n\nThe office of mayor was held by Chedli Klibi from 1963 to 1990, by \nFouad Mebazaa from 1995 to 1998 and by Sami Tarzi from 2003 to 2011, and by \nAzedine Beschaouch from 2011.\nThe monumental Malik ibn Anas mosque\n(also El Abidine  mosque; (\u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0643 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u0646\u0633 (\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0642\u0627 \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0628\u062f\u064a\u0646)), built on an area of three hectares on Od\u00e9on hill, was inaugurated in 2003.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nAncient Carthage\nCarthage (archaeological site)\nHistory of Carthage\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n Media related to Carthage at Wikimedia Commons",

          "An open ground of history. A museum full of mosaics and Roman and Phoenician statues, buildings. Bi lingual and even trilingual guides. Just a step away from the basilique St Augustin, the 5 star hotel La villa Didon, the train station that takes you to downtown Tunis or Sidi",
          "This museum is not massive (a good thing in my opinion) but really gets you up close and personal with the ruins of Carthage. There was a man on site who had been there for 40 years- he gave us a walking tour (in English), pointing various points of interest and even condensing",

          "I've always wanted to come to an ancient historical site like this. Being here was like a dream come true and I can spend hours in this place. I would recommend having a guide to bring you around and explain to you in detail about the history of Tunisia and the story behind the",
          "The museum is a must see, shows really interesting items and the displays are well explained. However, I agree with a few that the displays are showing too much information in one place as the so many items are gathered in one place, so you can miss a few.",
          "The history represented is fantastic, but some displays are just \"lumped\" together without much care.",
          "We visited this museum as part of our visit to Carthage. The museum has a number of interesting exhibits and artifacts. As noted by others, this museum pales in comparison to the Bardo. Admission is included in the admission to the ruins.",
          "I have dreamed of coming to Carthage my entire life. The works hear are amazing and worth the visit. Also make sure you go down to the port and see where the old military ships were.",
          "A great tour made better by a great tour guide. Beautiful pictures and a great array of artefacts to view and take pictures of, only 1 dinar per camera which is truly well worth it. But be careful not to walk to far up the hill towards the palace as armed police/ army stop you",
          "This is a small collection of artifacts from the local ruins. They are nice but if you are used to seeing museums in Italy with Roman ruins, this may disappoint you. There is some cool things like painted ostrich eggs, coins, ceramics and mosaics. There is a charge to enter.",
          "This is an extremely interesting museum with a good overview of the local history. Although relatively small, it's worth the visit if you're interested in archaeology and history, and there are some truly amazing mosaics and statues here. It's definitely worth the stopover on",
          "The best bits are in the Bardo museum in Tunis but some interesting displays of every day objects. A few beautiful glass jugs and a great statue of a Silene carried by satyres",
          "This museum is located at the main entrance site to the ruins. There was not much explanation about what the exhibits were but fortunately we had a guide who was an archaeology professor who was greatly helpful in explaining what we were seeing. If you are pressed for time you",
          "This was a good place to see some older Punic ruins of Carthage also with a number of artifacts from Punic and Roman times. Coins, mosaics, statues etc. Since it's on top of a hill the view is excellent also. Drawings of the port from Punic and Roman times with maps are also",
          "It is clear that the Tunisians are trying to build their tourism industry. The museum houses an impressive collection of mosaic art from various eras. It was fine, but a little too much of one thing. I have attached a few pictures with other featured displays.",
          "not huge but certainly a must if youve any interest in archaeology the punic houses in the park are amazing as is the view over the bay to bou Kornine",
          "It was a blustery day in North Africa, cooler than I expected. This museum really did have a lot to offer and the ruins were fun. How the people of the day built the things they built without the tool we have today is truely amazing.",

          "The guides in there will tell you a lot of stories, stuff you might not have read in the history books. It's a bit of an enlightenment. The place is small littered with columns and slabs of rocks. It's nice to combine with visit to the Punic Port Museum.",

          "There is an amazing view from this vantage point, You can look down into the city of Carthage and see the Punic Port and the mountains in the distance. There are several marble statues, although broken, they have tried to display what is left of the, Tunisia does not have a lot",
          "I was expecting a museum full of Roman artifacts and that's what, in part, it is. I was knocked out by the Carthaginian artifacts too. Well kept, well presented, easy to find you way around. Signage is excellent. If you are interested in the Carthaginian civilisation, the Punic",
          "I was very very disappointed in this museum. Display was poor. I could not get anything new out from Tunisia's history from this museum. Punic Tunisia? Roman Tunisia? Muslim Tunisia? And their stories? Where were they? I was very disappointed. Tunisia has much more to offer. The",

          "Don't have great expectations about this museum. Small budgets mean Punic and Roman artefacts aren't numerous, or even particularly well preserved or displayed. However, to get an idea of the scale of mosaics or the minutiae of Carthaginian life (jewellery, weapons, pottery),",
          "Although there lies the history i was totally shocked to see how the tunisians underestimated the ruins and the importance of history. The displays were so rotten and the ruins were badly displayed, if these ruins were in europe i am sure this place will be very popular place",

          "When we went to Carthage Museum, the top floor was being rearranged, so the displays weren't complete or set up well. The explanations on the bottom floor were in Arabic, French and English, which was great, but the top floor only had Arabic and French. There were some great",
          "If the Bardo is still under renovation, you will see a lot more at the Carthage Museum a bit out of town (about 20 minutes or so on train). Most of the exhibits have French and or English explanations and you can also walk around the ruins. There is also a large mosaic",
          "It is a pity how much more this museum could make out of the fascinating site of ancient Carthage, the city's long, proud & at times violend history both in Punic & Roman times. Instead, this museum is a collection of few (!) old shards, mosics and statues with little",
          "We have bought the permit to Tunis three days before flying away, but I have already known that I want to visit. The well-known phrase: \u201cCarthage should be destroyed\u201c has defined one of places for visiting (main thing). Time for gathering is not enough, but I have familiarized"

        "wiki": "Rabat (, also UK: , US: ; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0637\u200e, romanized: ar-rib\u0101\u1e6d; Berber languages: \u2d30\u2d55\u2d31\u2d30\u2d5f, romanized: a\u1e5b\u1e5bba\u1e6d) is the capital city of Morocco and the country's seventh largest city with an urban population of approximately 580,000 (2014) and a metropolitan population of over 1.2 million.  It is also the capital city of the Rabat-Sal\u00e9-K\u00e9nitra administrative region. Rabat is located on the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the river Bou Regreg, opposite Sal\u00e9, the city's main commuter town.\nRabat was founded in the 12th century by the Almohad ruler Abd al-Mu'min as a military town. The city steadily grew but went into an extended period of decline following the collapse of the Almohads. In the 17th century Rabat became a haven for Barbary pirates. The French established a protectorate over Morocco in 1912 and made Rabat its administrative center. Morocco achieved independence in 1955 and Rabat became its capital.\nRabat, Temara, and Sal\u00e9 form a conurbation of over 1.8 million people. Silt-related problems have diminished Rabat's role as a port; however, Rabat, and Sal\u00e9 still maintain important textile, food processing and construction industries. In addition, tourism and the presence of all foreign embassies in Morocco serve to make Rabat one of the most important cities in the country. The Moroccan capital was ranked at second place by CNN in its \"Top Travel Destinations of 2013\". It is one of four Imperial cities of Morocco, and the medina of Rabat is listed as a World Heritage Site. Rabat is accessible by train through the ONCF system and by plane through the nearby Rabat\u2013Sal\u00e9 Airport.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Rabat comes from \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0650\u0651\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0637 (ar-rib\u0101\u1e6d) meaning the ribat, an Islamic base or fortification. This name is short for \u0631\u0650\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064e\u062a\u0652\u062d (rib\u0101\u1e6du l-fat\u1e25) meaning the ribat of conquest or  stronghold of victory\u2014a title the city acquired in 1170, due to its military importance.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 12th to 17th century ===\nRabat has a relatively modern history compared to the nearby ancient city of Sal\u00e9. In 1146, the Almohad ruler Abd al-Mu'min turned Rabat's ribat into a full-scale fortress to use as a launching point for attacks on Iberia.\nYaqub al-Mansur (known as Moulay Yacoub in Morocco), another Almohad Caliph, moved the capital of his empire to Rabat. He built Rabat's city walls, the Kasbah of the Udayas and began construction on what would have been the world's largest mosque. However, Yaqub died and construction stopped. The ruins of the unfinished mosque, along with the Hassan Tower, still stand today.\nYaqub's death initiated a period of decline. The Almohad empire lost control of its possessions in Spain and much of its African territory, eventually leading to its total collapse.  In the 13th century, much of Rabat's economic power shifted to Fez. In 1515 a Moorish explorer, El Wassan, reported that Rabat had declined so much that only 100 inhabited houses remained. An influx of Moriscos, who had been expelled from Spain, in the early 17th century helped boost Rabat's growth.\n\n\n=== Corsair republics ===\nRabat and neighboring Sal\u00e9 united to form the Republic of Bou Regreg in 1627.  The republic was run by Barbary pirates who used the two cities as base ports for launching attacks on shipping. The pirates did not have to contend with any central authority until the Alaouite Dynasty united Morocco in 1666.  The latter attempted to establish control over the pirates, but failed.  European and Muslim authorities continued to attempt to control the pirates over many years, but the Republic of Bou Regreg did not collapse until 1818.  Even after the republic's collapse, pirates continued to use the port of Rabat, which led to the shelling of the city by Austria in 1829 after an Austrian ship had been lost to a pirate attack.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n\n==== French invasion ====\nThe French invasion of Morocco began in the east with General Hubert Lyautey's occupation of Oujda March 1907 and in the west with the Bombardment of Casablanca August 1907. The Treaty of Fes established the protectorate March 1912. Acting as French administrator of Morocco, Lyautey, decided to relocate the country's capital from Fes to Rabat.  Among other factors, rebellious citizens had made Fes an unstable place. Sultan Moulay Youssef followed the decision of the French and moved his residence to Rabat.  In 1913, Lyautey hired Henri Prost who designed the Ville Nouvelle (Rabat's modern quarter) as an administrative sector.  When Morocco achieved independence in 1955, Mohammed V, the then King of Morocco, chose to have the capital remain at Rabat.\n\n\n==== Post World War II ====\nFollowing World War II, the United States established a military presence in Rabat at the former French air base.  By the early 1950s, Rabat Sal\u00e9 Air Base was a U.S. Air Force installation hosting the 17th Air Force and the 5th Air Division, which oversaw forward basing for Strategic Air Command (SAC) B-47 Stratojet aircraft in the country.  With the destabilization of French government in Morocco, and Moroccan independence in 1956, the government of Mohammed V wanted the U.S. Air Force to pull out of the SAC bases in Morocco, insisting on such action after American intervention in Lebanon in 1958. The United States agreed to leave as of December 1959, and was fully out of Morocco by 1963. SAC felt the Moroccan bases were much less critical with the long range capability of the B-52 Stratofortresses that were replacing the B-47s and with the completion of the USAF installations in Spain in 1959.With the USAF withdrawal from Rabat-Sal\u00e9 in the 1960s, the facility became a primary facility for the Royal Moroccan Air Force known as Air Base N\u00ba 1, a status it continues to hold.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Neighbourhoods of Rabat ===\nRabat is an administrative city. It does have many shopping districts and residential neighbourhoods. The geographically spread out neighbourhoods are as follows:\nThe heart of the city consists of three parts: the Medina (old town); the Oudayas and Hassan both located to meet the Bou Regreg; and the Atlantic Ocean.\nTo the west, and along the waterfront, there is a succession of neighbourhoods.\nFirst, around the ramparts, there is the old neighbourhoods, Quartier l'Oc\u00e9an and Quartier les Orangers. Beyond that, a succession of mostly working-class districts: Diour Jamaa, Akkari, Yacoub El Mansour, Massira and Hay el Fath are the main parts of this axis. Hay el Fath, which ends this sequence, evolves into a middle-class neighbourhood.\nTo the east, along the Bouregreg, the Youssoufia region (working and middle class) : Mabella; Taqaddoum; Hay Nahda(mostly middle class); Aviation(middle and upper middle class); and Rommani.\nBetween the two axes, from north to south, there are three main neighbourhoods (middle class to affluent): Agdal (Ward Building; a lively mix of residential and commercial buildings. The residents are predominantly upper middle class); Hay Riad (affluent villas; this neighbourhood has experienced a surge of momentum since the 2000s); and Souissi (residential neighborhood).\nOn the outskirts of Souissi, are a number of less-dense regions mainly comprising large private houses to areas that seem out of the city.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Bouregreg Marina ===\nLocated between the Atlantic and the Bouregreg Valley, this river marina is paved with famous historical sites like the esplanade of the Hassan Tower and the picturesque Chellah necropolis, which has witnessed many Mediterranean civilizations pass by.\nOutfitted with the most modern equipment to host up to 240 boats, the Bouregreg Marina aims to become an essential destination for recreational boaters seeking long stays or just a stopover on their way to West Africa, the Caribbean or the shores of North America.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nThe prefecture is divided administratively into the following:\n\n\n=== Families of Rabat ===\nCalled Rbatis, these families have lived for more than 400 years with many events in common. From the expulsion of the Moriscos to arrive at the foundation of a culture that combines the Arabic and Andalusian cultures, through the Republic of Bouregreg events than other families coming to live in Rabat recently, have not known.\nSince its founding, Rabat was inhabited by several families from the High Atlas with Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur, who founded the city in 1198, then families from many parts of Morocco have settled. Rabat has around 1240 a few hundred fifty families whose families Chiadmi, Regragui, Loudiyi, etc.\nSince the end of the thirteenth century, the city has had an influx of Moriscos expelled from Granada until 1609, the year of total expulsion of Muslims from Spain by Philip III. These families include: Bargach (Vargas); Guedira (Guadaira); Mouline (Molina); Sebbata (Zapata); and Frej.\nThe said families are considered, until today, as \"Rbati's Families of strain\". They are about four hundred families.\nOther families in the city are considered residents of Rabat because they came at the time when Rabat became the capital of the country, either through rural exodus or to work in public administration based in the city since the establishment of the protectorate.\nThe city is on the territory of Zaer, an Arab tribe of Maqil origin. Leo Africanus in the early 16th century the signals in the region of Khenifra there, she continued on to the north to the Rabat region.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nRabat features a Mediterranean climate (Csa) with warm to hot dry summers and mild damp winters. Located along the Atlantic Ocean, Rabat has a mild, temperate climate, shifting from cool in winter to warm days in the summer months. The nights are always cool (or cold in winter, it can reach sub 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) sometimes), with daytime temperatures generally rising about 7\u20138 \u00b0C (13\u201314 \u00b0F).

          "Main attraction of the town. Nice to see it and the view is worth it. For the rat there is not too Much inside to see",
          "Actually a late review - went in Jan 2019. This is a really cheap excursion. Great for a wander and a touch of Tunisian history. Kids enjoyed exploring (9 & 15) and seeing a bit of the culture. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Some footage for Life of Brian was shot here, including \"He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy\". Be warned, there are a lot of steps.",
          "This ancient fortress is not expensive to enter and is well worth a visit to see the views of the town but one needs to be mobile to climb the steps and towers. There could be much more in English than there is and a better gift shop.",
          "If you visit Ribat of Monastir do not miss climbing the watchtower, the view is amazing. The entrance fee is not that expensive.",
          "Ancient castle that has it's own mueseam inside, brilliant views of marina and surrounding area, only draw back not sutible for those with mobility problems as to get round the place be prepared to climb plenty of stairs, also Monty phython life of Brian was filmed here.",
          "I really enjoyed the freedom this building offers, you can explore every corner of it and, i can recommend a visit to it, and it is next to the beatiful mauselum.",
          "We really enjoyed our walk round the Ribat though we ached the next day after climbing all the stairs to the top. It costs 8 dinars each entrance and we were given a pamphlet explaining the layout and history of the place. Very enjoyable.",
          "Very imposing looking fortress. Our guide (taxi driver), Abdasaleem told us about the history of the place, but advised that it looked it's best from the outside and it wasn't worth the entrance charge to go inside. Not much to see but poky passageways and very steep circular",
          "We came here last hour just before sunset and the place was almost empty. Staff were super friendly and the little museum was rather interesting but the views from the Ribat were breathtaking.",
          "A very beautiful place to visit in Monastir. It's near the tomb of the former president Habib Bourguiba. This ancient fort has been restored. There is a wonderful view up from the tower. You can also find a museum inside. There is a fee about 8 dinars I think. Parking is outside",
          "As I was staying literally 2 minutes away from the Ribat of Monastir, I visited it once and went past it another time. It's a nice place to look at if you're in the area, but I wouldn't travel to Monastir to visit it. There are surrounding sights to look at also, like the",
          "If you like history then you will like this. Not much else to it. Good view of city and marina. Entry is 8TND",
          "Just spent the day there very cleanand beautiful though the shop owners are very aggressive in trying to make you buy they block your way not a very nice feeling when it's 3 women on thier own but we found a lovely shop with everything you could possibly want it looks really",
          "You can buy this trip at the reception of you hotel, not expensive at all and it is a return ticket. You will get taken to Monastir to the shops and picked up again 2hrs 30mins later, you can do shopping with the prices on items really cheap, buy your gifts here not the hotel as",
          "This was a great place to roam around and explore every nook and cranny. I didn't have a guide but I would recommend one. There aren't many information panels so a guide would be really useful.",
          "Beautiful castle to see ... Not advise for people with reduced mobility or who are not stable on their legs",
          "This is a must if you\u2019re visiting the area. Adults are 8 tnd and children under 13 free. The views from the top are beautiful and the site is beautiful to clamber around. Really enjoyed this day. Not suitable for those with mobility problems.",
          "Stopped by here on the way back from El Jem and was duly impressed. Great views of the Mediterranean and city. Impressive historical fort. There was a movie shoot going on at the time, so had some fun interacting with some of the soldier characters that were part of the",
          "A very nice fort which I mostly wanted to visit for the fact it was used in Monty Python's Life of Brian. Still, it's a nice thing to see even without that.",
          "Very large with lots of rooms to discover. The steps are quite steep and narrow so those with mobility issues or young children may find it an issue. My son did the climb to the top of the watch tower and said you could see the whole of monastir from up there. A great place for",
          "Favourite place in Tunisia . Relaxing . Romantic . Beautiful . Nice views . Nice museum . Putted off a bit bye the movie they were filming workers",
          "We visited the Ribat today only to find a large entourage of movie makers all over it. Although it looked as if you couldn't get in, with a little perseverance the security guards will let you pass to get a ticket. You just need to keep your head down when they shout \"action\"",
          "Nice to wander around while in monastir, it's right on the seafront with lovely views. we didn't try to see if you could go inside.",
          "It is a place from ancient history that shows how fortresses were at that time. Also, the view that you get from the top is breathtaking. All Sousse will be infront of you. A must visit.",
          "Went to Monastir just to see the Ribat, wandered around for a good hour and half, exploring all the little rooms, and up the tower for the spectacular views up the coast and over the city. The museum has pictures of Monastir in the 1960s when it was a very small town compared to",
          "We spent an hour walking around the fort, up the stairs and even went up the tower with it\u2019s narrow stairs. The view from the tower with the flag was breathtaking but not to be attempted by the faint hearted or those with a fear of heights. A memorable walk back in time.",
          "Although the outlook is pretty much the same with the one in Sousse, this ribat in Monastir is at Least 3 times bigger in size. In the meantime there\u2019s a small museum inside with reasonable numbers of relics. And its location is much more closer to the coast, in other words,",
          "This is one of the top attractions in Monastir and it is bigger than you think. For me, from the outside it doesn't look like a big fortress, but when I got inside, I could easily spend a couple of hours just exploring the towers and the different rooms, corridors and 'holes'",
          "We visited this fortress while being in Monastir. It is a nice place to wander about and take pictures. It looks very imposing. They could work a bit more on their cleaning, it would make the place better. Overall it was a nice experience.",
          "If you visit Monastir, stop by for an hour. You will discover an historic place with many levels and rooms. Really a magic place to bring family and friends...",
          "Wow how the other half live, it\u2019s big and beautiful inside is like a maze so much to see the little museums are quite interesting and it\u2019s in English too I was informed that English is there 3rd language that is why it was easy to communicate the tower is a bit of a trek but if",
          "The Ribat of Monastir is very beautiful. It was very easy to park our car there, and from its tower, you have an excellent overview on the city and its surroundings.",
          "Wonderful wibat only 7 dinars \u00a32 to enter great views, weally worth wisit. Bigger than Sousse but preferred Sousse M\u00e9dina.",
          "I liked this fort very much. It was in remarkably good condition bearing in mind some parts were constructed over 1000 years ago. The entry cost is only 7 dinar. You get some great views from the tower. Well worth a visit.",
          "This is a great Ribat/Castle that sits on the edge of the seafront and once would protect the town from any attackers. A number of films have been filmed here and the most famous being (in my opinion) the \u2018Life of Brian\u2019. The cost of admission is 7 TND which is reasonable for",
          "So many rooms on different levels this fort would be great fun for children. From the top, there is a good view of Monastir.",
          "Went to the Ribat well worth the 7 Dina each we paid Fantastic views from the top even very windy great culture of Tunisia",
          "I wanted to visit this place to see what it was all about and I was not disappointed. You can easily spend a couple of hours here soaking up the views and walking around. The museum was interesting, shame everything was in French. It was 7TD for the entry, which is nothing",
          "We had a great night of music in the castle, but the act were over 1 hour late on stage. I nearly gave up and got a taxi back to the hotel. But they were good when they came on.",
          "Small museum, but wonderful place to explore the old architecture and history. Inexpensive. Perfect view from the tower.",
          "The Ribat is impressive. The view from the top of the tower is worth the slick stairwell. Reading about the history (some of it was in English) made this monument even more interesting.",
          "This ancient building can be seen from all points around the main town of Monastir Surrounded by little cafes shops and the markets it makes for a very interesting day out",
          "We went to this castle when we visited Monastir city on the little train in our hotel. The kids wanted to go it and I wasn\u2019t sure if they\u2019d like it. 7 dinar each for us adults and nothing for the children, so I didn\u2019t really mind if they didn\u2019t. My god the views of the city from",
          "If this is number 2 in Monastir of things to do, it says a lot about Monastir itself. In this purely tourstic little city are just a bunch of hotels and tourists. Period. So not suprisingly this is the second thing to do. A small kasbah, like there are many in Tunesia which is",
          "An austere early Islamic fortresss that positively reeks of the Sahara and the French Foreign Legion \u2014 even though it\u2019s many centuries earlier and next to the sea. Not much to see inside but the architecture and the views. Be sure to climb the tower for great panoramas of the",
          "It is a great rabat..well preseved,to visit absolutely ...it contains a collection of objects (monnet, pottery, fabrics, book, wood ..) dating from the first presence of Arabs in North Africa. you can easily spend more than an hour walking between these arcades and bastion, you",
          "Not much of a commercial town with busy streets and crowded Medina. Actually Medina is almost nonexistent. It was intentionally reduced to enhance the city attraction towards its religious and culture. Monastir has retained a certain peace and a more genuine feel. Monastir\u2019s",
          "This Ribat/fort is the largest in Tunisia and it is worth visiting. The ticket to the fort and museum costs 7 TND for foreigners and 5 TND for locals. It only cost me 5 because they gave me the local ticket when they knew I was Palestinian. The museum is small but has a lot of",
          "Wow have not been here for a while as it was being refurbished for ages. They have spent a lot of money on it but not put the price up. They even have toilets now. There are information boards and now they have safety railings too. Plenty to roam around and even a tower to climb",
          "Highly recommended attraction in Monastir. Same type of fortress as the one in Sousse, but much bigger and spectacular. Placed in an isolated position on the sea next to the mosque and at close distance to the mausoleum of Bourguiba, from its tower a spectacular view can be",
          "Small fort yet has a labyrinthe of cells, doorways, and stairs. Larger and much better than the Ribat in Sousse, worth visiting. Make sure to climb up to the top- the stairs are narrow but in good shape. Great views of the beach and sea. 5min walk from the Bourghiba Mausoleum,",
          "Big fort next to the sea! It is truly remarkable! Fun little side note, the Life of Brian was filmed here.",
          "The identity of Monastir as islamic town is expressed when you look at this amaizing monument standing in front of the see.",
          "It is nice castle and has great views to the city and the sea and it is not big as it is just a small place and near has the shopping area that can get some souvenirs",
          "Spectacular old fortress and one of the filming locations of the Life of Brian! Make sure you go to the top of the tower as the views are amazing.",
          "An old fortress located near the sea. This was the most impressive sight I visited in Monastir. Make sure to go to the top of the tower where you will find an amazing view of the city.",
          "This is an impressive castle and well worth a visit (as we realised later it's where one of the Monty Python's was filmed!) Just as impressive is the view from nearby the castle down to the sea. A lovely spot",
          "When we arrived it turned out the entrance is 7 dinars, at first I was a bit upset but now I can say it's not much and I think it was totally worth it. There is a very clean toilet inside and a small museum on the 2nd floor. After that we climbed the highest tower with a flag",
          "Visiting the city of Monastir with its historic sites makes you dive into the story and makes you live unforgettable moments . Walking through the streets of the \" FORTE EL RIBAT \" will leave you appreciate the depth of history that has this charming town with its many shops of",

          "This is a lovely town with a a huge shopping centre, banks, cafes and isn't badly priced at all. Any souvenirs you wish to buy are half price here in comparison to many hotels or local shops. Get metro too it's cheap, vented and easy to use :-)",
          "Well maintained, sometimes bustling around it but worth the tour. The old city inside is also busy at times but a nice walk-around to discover how it might have been in the Arab city. You can buy some items, negotiating is a required skill.",

          "This was class. Loved watching Life of Brian after visiting here. It was so old and beautiful. A strange Old man in a suit collared us and gave us a great potted history of the place and info on Muslim burial customs. It cost us 10 Dinar but he was cool. We have named him the",

          "Easy to find and a short stroll from the mausoleum. Current entry price is 7td - be wary of the 'photo charge' which is only 1td but not advertised anywhere.... Some might say it is a little side earner for the ticket sales man? Say no you're not going to take photos then do so",
          "This is one of my favorite places I have ever visited. It is so old, just being there is amazing. The fact that Monty Python filmed The Life of Brian is an exciting little footnote as well. Exploring this space was humbling and awe-inspiring, thinking of all the people who",

          "You must visit these and then go to the village of Sidi Bou Said. The village is all in white and blue ( reminds me of an island in Greece) and has a great souk area there. So pretty to walk around -and has some great cafe and views overlooking the sea there.",
          "There is not much left of the former glory of this place. Maybe because we visited on a rainy day. The Romans built baths, roads and aqueducts everywhere they went. I remember reading, a couple of months ago, that the Punic wars finally ended officially in 2009, by signing a",
          "Went to Carthage Roman baths very interesting place you have to pay 1 dinar per camera to take photos lots of ruins to walk through pillars etc",
          "What realy blew my mind about this place was when I was finishing up and I saw the artist's impression of what it would have looked like in its prime. It was awe inspiring! Anyway, you must visit this place and it is conveniently located near other must see sites.",
          "There are illustrations on site of what the baths once looked like. Really, they looked like they were ahead in construction and design of the Europeans by 1,500 years. Looked similar in size and shape as a 1,500 to 1,600 AD European cathedral. Except - there was baths with",
          "These were close to impressive, way better than many of the other ruins. There isn't a lot at any of the sites, but this probably has the most intact ruins ....and it's right on the ocean. Beautiful ...but 30 mins was more than enough time...I virtually had the place to",
          "The story goes, that these baths are the greatest ever built in the roman world, showing the proportion that Tunis-Carthage already had since ancient times",
          "We visited the Roman site on our short break in Tunisia and must say that it was the highlight of our holiday, we both are keen history buffs a and to see this once wonderuse site even in the condition it is in was one not to be missed. Lots of photos and fond memories to keep",
          "Whilst on a cruise with MSC we booked a tour and one of the places we visited was the Roman Baths. The ruins are positioned next to the Presidential Palace and right beside the sea. Our tour guide was very informative and was able to tell us lots about the history of the Roman",
          "Second or third largest baths of the Roman Empire. The site also contains 6th century ruins of a church and school. Don't miss the 80 seat latrine.",
          "It was amazing to walk around the ancient baths, a large complex that once boasted hot, warm, and cold baths. The ruins are in reasonably good shape so we could get the idea of the full grandeur of what was once there. Great for the whole family.",
          "we went to the baths as a part of tour in Tunis. The baths were the best ruin we saw, though we dont think we saw all the carthage ruins. This Was a very good site, well preserved and a beautiful location right by the water.",
          "The scenery is beautiful but the ruins are not impressive - too little is left of the place's glorious past.",
          "Before leaving Tunisia after a business trip, my colleague and i decided to visit the Carthage ancient site which is not too far from the airport. This was quite a letdown. There are only a couple of columns standing, the rest is all ruins and the site is rather delapidated. For",
          "To see few stones you pay a lot. Just go to any beach youll see stones. Shame on the management. Really.",
          "There are lots of Roman baths from the ancient world and we've seen a few, but these are the best. First of all, the view of the sea from the site is wonderful; it's easy to imagine what a prime resort this was back 20 centuries ago. There are remnants of the heating system",
          "I considered this to be the best historic site of Carthage. The scale is trully impressive and a helpful pictorial reconstruction alllows the visitor to contextuslise the remains. Staff were bery polite and helpful in the cafe.",
          "A ticket to the museum and Carthage ruin also allow entry here as well. Carthage was a big place and the multiple sites can be a way from each other, so it's a car or a tour not a walk. This area was nice because it is large and not well attended by other tourists, but more",
          "Must have spectacular when in full flow, massive buildings when intact. Now just the base of the buildings left, but you get a feel of the magnificence, by the coast (and near to the presidents residence which has guards walking around) Only 2 other people there and no real",
          "Small and almost hidden No information available. Not all that much there. Price was right, it was free. Vety disappointed in how the ruins of Carthage have not been kept up",
          "We visited a lot of phonecian and roman sites over our visit and this was great. Lots to see and explore and you can see the layers of history built on top of each other. Really good to get up close and personal with the ruins as well. Again in tunisia access is unparalleled",
          "The ruins at Carthage aren't as impressive as those at Ephesus or at Jerash, but they're certainly worth a visit. The sites are fairly spread out, so don't expect to see everything in a day, especially if you want to take things at a leisurely pace. Probably a good idea to",
          "We saved this attraction for last when we visited Carthage and are we glad we did! This is by far the best site in the area. It is a huge place with so many relics and ruins. The views are amazing and the ohotos you can get are out of this world. Highly recommend you visit this",
          "Being a full on ancient Rome history buff I must say that I fully geeked out during my visit. Here is one of the largest and most well preserved roman ruin in northern Africa and since it's Tunisia there are no restrictions other than a a sign that asks one to not climb on",
          "I am a history buff so visiting this location was a pleasure. I recommend reading about the area and history first but in general this is a must. Hire a taxi or come with a tour as there is no transportation between sites and it is not only a large area but there are many",
          "Carthage location near the capital of Tunis consists of several parts, 4 or 5 I think. This one is the most scenic one, as it is by the sea. It is also pretty good conserved considering the origin time. The entrance fee is only 10 dinars (children free), and it applies to all",
          "I had no idea what to expect on this trip and it was a two day stop over planned for me by a friend. The Roman Baths were breathtaking. To truly understand Carthage and world history, places like this are a must see. They are well preserved and give just a glimpse of the",
          "This is definitely a must-see on the list of \"old stones\" in the Tunis-Carthage area, along with the Thermes d'Antonin and the Amphitheatre. The seaside location is amazing, it's a pity the Ben Ali-era seawall (which was the private road to his helipad) ruins the unobstructed",
          "Loved it here spent a couple of hours totally amazed by it. Well worth taking time to visit hate having to make it to 100 charatures a small review is as good",
          "These Roman ruins are steeped in history and are situated on a perfect setting just overlooking the gulf of Tunis on the coastline.Well worth visiting and exploring the the various chambers and rooms that are left standing,it really must have been a sight to behold and actually",
          "Ruins of Roman Baths(Antonine) near Tunis-Carthage are outstanding.Visited them Decembar 2010.When Carthage was completely defeated 146bc after the third Punic-Roman war,the Senat decided neither grass to grow there.But Julius Cezar thought opposite and the next 700years there",
          "Having learnt about Carthage many years ago I wanted to visit this historic site. Although the baths are in ruins there is plenty to see to gain an impression of how large and important this site was. Having been to Rome and seeing Roman sites around Europe this is another piece",
          "well worth a visit with fantastic Roman ruins (as good as anything in Italy with far fewer tourists, lower prices and more freedom to wander). What is amazing is that this place is amazing but it is only the lower gallery of a what was once about six stories high!",
          "This complex must have been an impressive site as it is still very impressive and is located just on the sea. We were fortunate to have a guide who was a Tunisian archaeology professor. I definitely think we got more out of this attraction because of this.",
          "This was one of my favorite spots in Tunisia. Quite large ruins of the Roman baths along with the story of what was going on here and how they came to be. Roman coins for \"special service\", small children size coffins around the park and a nice view of the presidential palace",
          "I've seen Roman baths in Rome, Pompeii, Bath in England but nothing compares to the Antonine Baths in Carthage. This is a jaw-droppingly huge site, and what we can see is only the ground floor. When you look at the information board showing how it looked in its heyday you",
          "The Roman Baths in Tunisia were quite impressive spanning over a large area. The view of the Mediterranean also impressive. It is nice to be a part of the past and this venue helps the imagination fill in the holes for going back to Roman times.",
          "This a must see if you go to Tunisia. We had our 3 boys with us and you know how teens can be but even they were impressed! How they managed all the detail is incredible. Don't miss this.",
          "This ruin was bigger than expected. There are not so many places even in Japan, which has a number of spas, to offer such large public spa facility. In the ruin, there is drawing showing one tall remaining pole was one of the poles of the ancient public spa in Roman area, and",
          "We had the opportunity to be at the Roman baths when no one else was there. So much fun to walk around the magnificent ruins! They have done a great job in keep it all in tact. Another MUST See in Carthage, Tunisia!",
          "it was very nice and interesting for the whole family to see how the people lived those days. Even our youngest kids aged 8-9 enjoyed this place very much!",
          "It\u2019s quite the eye-opener to see the geographic scope of the Roman Empire. How grand it must have been to enjoy the hot baths over-looking the Mediterranean. But not-so-grand for those that built it and served the bathers. This was a great cruise ship excursion while docked",
          "Great visit and a must see in area, only below level on show now it would have been a very impressive huge structure originally. Book shop nearby and I bought a great book on Carthage for 5 euros. Recommended.",
          "This is a very important historic site, sadly raiders over the centuries have left little to see. A guided tour is a must to know whats what .",
          "Anyone who gives this less that 5* cannot know what they were looking at or where they had been! These are the great Antonine Baths of Carthage! Parts are pretty well preserved, others not so but overall almost as well preserved as the fora in Rome. One downside for some",
          "We unfortunately had a poor tourguide (nothing to do with the ruins themselves), but also couldn't rely on signage, which was completely missing. We didn't know what we were looking at. People were climbing all over the ruins. There didn't seem to be any effort to protect the",
          "I am not a big fan of Roman baths, but as I was in Carthage, I wanted to check the site out. Definitely great place if you are into Roman baths, but not much for me. The site is beautiful, on the seashore.",
          "Great site and a worth the trip! Spectacular! Use caution with \"tour guides\" and taxi drivers. Avoid the I have old Roman coins to sell sob story.",
          "Anything old and historical I love. Definitely worth looking at.if you're travelling alone, be observant so you pick up the mosiacs in some of the baths!",
          "This Roman ruins believed to be the largest ruins outside Roman territories. It is well preserved, interesting history and a worth a visit if you happen to visit Tunisia.",
          "If you can only see one thing, see this! This is best set of ruins. Interesting as well as fun! Great photo ops! Beautiful views!",
          "The ruins were fascinating and situated at a beautifulll spot. The whole ruin site is massive andits very impressive. A place ideal for history lovers! Very well preserved and in a stunning location. A must see",
          "These Roman Baths are sited on the Tunisian coast ( the Antonine baths) and are reasonably well preserved. Another masterpiece of Roman engineering. When the Romans discovered how concrete would stick stones together they were off on a building spree. This baths complex is very",
          "Even if you aren't as in to history as maybe myself or my fiancee, this is a must do on your holiday in Tunisia. Even for the view of the North African coast alone, this is a beautiful site. Yes, most of Carthage is gone because it's been excavated and rebuilt on over the",
          "Antonine Baths are a must see on any visit to Carthage. Most tour companies offer great value trips or I guess you could fly solo? A tour guide (thank you Adel from Thomson / First Choice) will make these places come alive for you. Loads of Carthaginian stuff to see too in this",
          "The astonishing Antonine Baths were the largest Roman baths in Africa and the third largest worldwide. Don't expect to take a dip or even to see any actual baths (as per Bath, UK), but with a little imagination, the ruins comes alive. Visiting off-peak you may find the whole",
          "The Antonine Roman Baths are a fantastily very well preserved Roman remains in a beautiful setting, right by the sea. The plan of the baths was very detailed and graphic. However the site could do with many more information boards--to indicate exacly what you are looking at!!",
          "Wow! They just let you climb all over the ruins like an adventure playground. Amazing experience which our kids loved.",
          "We visited on Capital Sights Tour booked through Thompson. The price was \u00a335 which included enterance fees and a mid day meal which I thought was very resonable. Our guide was very knowledgable, but did not speak very clearly into the microphone some of the time which meant he",
          "Visited this as part of a cruise tour. Spent about 1 hour here. Really helped to have a knowledgeable guide. The site is definitely worth seeing and the highlight was being able to wander among the ruins and take some great photographs. Had to pay 1 euro at entrance to use",
          "I've seen a lot of Roman ruines so far (El Djem, Palmyra in Syria, Baalbek in Lebanon, Rome, Pompei and loads more) but this is an excellent site. The baths are so huge! Also the other objects in the grounds are interesting, from the underground chapel to the christian church.",

          "You have a chance to see (not very much of it) what was never supposed to be seen, the foundations of these Roman baths. It's interesting only if there's someone to tell you what to look at, what's what and how it used to work - a good guide.",
          "To be honest there isn't a massive amount to see, but what there is is impressive. There aren't a lot of signs explaining what you're looking at, so you either need a guide or your own knowledge. When you enter you see the last stages of development of the city (Roman) and you",
          "Romans really knew how to enjoy life! Even today after so many years, remains of Roman baths will give you a slightly idea how they lived in ancient times. Ruins are impressive and you can walk and climb around, or just sit in shade and imagine scenes of life at these times...",

        "wiki": "Sousse or Soussa (Arabic: \u0633\u0648\u0633\u0629\u200e, S\u016bsa; Berber: Susa) is a city in Tunisia, capital of the Sousse Governorate. Located 140 km (87 mi) south of the capital Tunis, the city has 271,428 inhabitants (2014). Sousse is in the central-east of the country, on the Gulf of Hammamet, which is a part of the Mediterranean Sea. Its economy is based on transport equipment, processed food, olive oil, textiles, and tourism. It is home to the Universit\u00e9 de Sousse.\n\n\n== Name ==\nSousse and Soussa are both French spellings of the Arabic name S\u016bsa, which may derive from Berber (cf., e.g., Morocco's Sous River and Region). The present city has also grown to include the ruins of Hadrumetum, which had many names in several languages during antiquity.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Hadrumetum ===\n\nIn the 11th century BC, Tyrians established Hadrumetum as a trading post and waypoint along their trade routes to Italy and the Strait of Gibraltar. Its establishment (at a river mouth about 9.7 km or 6 mi north of old Sousse) preceded Carthage's but, like other western Phoenician colonies, it became part of the Carthaginian Empire following Nebuchadnezzar II's long siege of Tyre in the 580s and 570s BC.\nThe city featured in the Third Sicilian War, the Second and Third Punic Wars (in the latter of which it secured additional territory and special privileges by aiding Rome against what was left of the Carthaginians), and Caesar's Civil War, when it was the scene of Caesar's famously deft recovery: upon tripping while coming ashore, he dealt with the poor omen this threatened to become by grabbing handfuls of dirt and proclaiming \"I have you now, Africa!\" (Latin: Teneo te Africa!) The second city in Roman Africa after Carthage, it became the capital of the province of Byzacena during the Diocletianic Reforms. Its native sons included the jurist Salvius Julianus, the emperor Clodius Albinus, and numerous Christian saints. The Roman and Byzantine catacombs beneath the city are extensive.\nThe Vandals sacked Hadrumetum in 434 but it remained a place of importance within their kingdom; a bishop and proconsul were martyred there during the Vandals' periodic forced conversions of their subjects to Arianism. The Byzantine Empire reconquered the town in 534 during the Vandal War and engaged in a public works program that included new fortifications and churches. The town was sacked during the Umayyad Caliphate's 7th-century conquest of North Africa. According to a 1987 ICOMOS report, Uqba ibn Nafi's siege and capture of the city resulted in its almost complete destruction, such that no monument of Hadrumetum \"subsists in situ\".\n\n\n=== Medieval Susa ===\nMuslim Arab armies rapidly spread Arab culture across what had been a thoroughly Romanized and Christianized landscape. Under the Aghlabids, Susa was established near the ruins of Hadrumetum and served as their main port. Their 827 invasion of Sicily was mainly launched from the town's harbor. After the Byzantine city of Melite (modern Mdina on Malta) was captured by the Aghlabids in 870, marble from its churches was used to build the Ribat. A soaring structure that combined the purposes of a minaret and a watch tower, it remains in outstanding condition and draws visitors from around the world. Its mosque is sometimes accounted the oldest surviving in the region and the town's main mosque, also built during the 9th century, has a similarly fortress-like appearance.\nSusa was briefly occupied by Norman Sicily in the 12th century; it fell to the Ottoman Empire in the 16th; and it was bombarded by a French and Venetian fleet in the 18th.\nMedieval Susa was known for its textile industries, producing silk and flax fabrics called S\u016bs\u012b. Especially renowned were its robes called shuqqas, some of which were mass-produced and sold ready-to-wear throughout the Mediterranean.\n\n\n=== Colonial Sousse ===\nTunisia became a French protectorate in 1881. The French improved the town's harbor during the next two decades. Prior to the First World War, Sousse had about 25,000 inhabitants, including around 10,000 French and roughly 5,000 other Europeans, mostly Italians and Maltese.\n\n\n=== Modern Sousse ===\nSousse has retained the solidly Arabian look and feel it had assumed in the centuries after its initial conquest. Today it is considered one of the best examples of seaward-facing fortifications built by the Arabs. These days, Sousse, with a population of about 200,000, retains a medieval heart of narrow, twisted streets, a kasbah and medina, its ribat fortress and long wall on the Mediterranean. Surrounding it is a modern city of long, straight roads and more widely spaced buildings.\nSousse was the site of the chess interzonal in 1967, made famous when American Grandmaster Bobby Fischer withdrew from the tournament even though he was in first place at the time.On 26 June 2015, a lone gunman later identified as Seifeddine Rezgui Yacoubi opened fire on tourists sunbathing on a beach near the Riu Imperial Marhaba and Soviva hotels, killing 38 and wounding 39, before being shot dead by the police.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSousse is the third largest city in Tunisia after Tunis and Sfax. Although Sousse is associated with olive oil manufacture and has other industries, tourism predominates today. An olive grove covering more than 2,500 km2 (965 sq mi) constitutes one of its main riches since antiquity. The busy port near downtown adds a touch of liveliness to its activity. Sousse also had many oil wells in the area during its colonial period.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nSousse is an important tourist resort. It has a hot semi-arid climate, with the seaside location moderating the climate, making it an all-season resort with hot, dry summers and warm, mild, wet winters. The fine sandy beaches are backed by orchards and olive groves.\nOnly 20 km (12 mi) from Monastir and Monastir Habib Bourguiba International Airport, hotel complexes with a capacity of 40,000 beds extend 20 km (12 mi) from the old city (medina) north along the seafront to Port El Kantaoui. Some 1,200,000 visitors come every year to enjoy its hotels and restaurants, nightclubs, casinos, beaches, and sports facilities.\nSousse is considered to be a popular tourist destination, especially due to its nightlife. Well-known nightclubs include Bora Bora, Living, Rediguana, Platinum, and The Saloon. The top producers and DJs in dance come to play at the various clubs. The season traditionally begins at the start of June and finishes on the first weekend of October with the closing parties.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nSousse is well-connected with the main Tunisian Railways network, having non-electrified lines to Tunis (since 1899), Sfax (since 1911), and Kasserine (since 2004) with diesel multiple unit and locomotive-driven trains. The main Gare Sousse terminus is in the city center, while Gare Kalaa Seghira serves a bypass route.\nSince 2010 the electrified Sahel Metro line goes south to Monastir Habib Bourguiba International Airport, Monastir, and Mahdia. This line has the Sousse - Bab Jadid station as its northern terminus in Sousse's city center, and 4 additional stations in the city.\nIntercity buses and red-strip microbuses (so-called louages) connect Sousse with many cities in Tunisia. Urban transit in Sousse is served by routes of articulated and conventional buses, blue-strip louages, and cheap taxis.\nThe 600 mm (1 ft 11 5\u20448 in) Sousse\u2013Kairouan Decauville railway operated from 1882 to 1996, before it was regauged to 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3\u20448 in) gauge.\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\nA medina, surrounded by its city walls and fortifications, is of historical interest. The medina includes open and covered bazaars (souks). Buildings of historical interest include the ribat castle, the central mosque, and a historical museum in the Casbah with mosaics from the area's many Roman villas. The Carthaginian catacombs can be visited.\nUNESCO declared the medina of Sousse a World Heritage Site in 1988, citing among various things its preservation from modern development.\n\n\n== Statistics ==\nPopulation:\t220,000 inhabitants (2003 estimate)\nAltitude:\t2 m\nHumidity:\t69%\nNumber of hospitals: (private and public) \t15\nAverage Temperatures: (mean temperatures from May to August for the last 30 years)\nMin: 19.7 \u00b0C\nMax: 29.1 \u00b0C\nAverage: 24.4 \u00b0C\nRainfall average: May: 19.3 mm\nJune: 4 mm\nJuly: 1.7 mm\nAugust: 10.3 mm\n\n\n== Climate ==\nK\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot semi-arid (BSh) bordering with hot-summer Mediterranean (Csa).\nThe highest recorded temperature was 48 \u00b0C (118 \u00b0F) on August 28, 2007, while the lowest recorded temperature was 4.5 \u00b0C (40.1 \u00b0F) on December 27, 1993.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nPrimasius of Hadrumetum, Roman bishop and exegete, noted for his Commentary on the Apocalypse\nMohamed Ghannouchi, Prime Minister of Tunisia from 1999 to 2011 and self-proclaimed President of Tunisia\nHamadi Jebali, former Secretary-General of the Ennahda Movement.\nAymen Abdennour, footballer\nMakrem Ben Romdhane, basketball player\nDov Alfon, author and journalist\nOns Jabeur, tennis player\n\n\n== In films ==\nSousse's old city has aspects that made it ideal as a film location. Most famous is Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), where Sousse represents Cairo, however the architectural style of Sousse, white-washed houses with blue details, bear no resemblance to the actual architecture of Cairo.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\nSousse is twinned with:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nA New Classical Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, Mythology, and Geography, New York: Harper & Bros, 1860.\nBadelon, Ernest Charles Fran\u00e7ois (1911), \"Hadrumetum\", Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th ed., Vol. XII, Encyclopaedia Britannica Co., pp. 802\u2013803.\nNorie, J.W.

          "I was crazy enough to brave the Ribat at 2:30 pm at the end of July. It was VERY hot. You should go all the way to the top on narrow winding stairs to get a gorgeous 360-degree panorama of the city.",
          "In old city of sousse near the big mosque it s high tour sourrunded with mandareen trees u have to get tickets to enter",
          "Very interesting, but got fed up with being constantly hounded to buy things. Loads of little narrow streets. Apparently it is far better to go in the evening.",
          "I visited it last year with friends and it was amazing, we had one the best views ever. We could see Sousse from above, all the medina, the port, the sea. It's historical and so beautiful. I recommand you to visit it once you are in the medina of Sousse.",
          "worth a visit 2 dinar to see the local costumes but do not visit if you cannot climb steps I mansged it but it was hard gioing",
          "It is a very historical monument with its rebuilt walls and tall slender tower. However it is not the most interesting inside, being a bit too plain. The rooms are nice and there are some nice decorative touches. I personally enjoyed climbing the tall tower to get the wonderful",
          "A historical monument that is worth the quick visit. You can view most of Sousse from the top and old architecture is quite a marvel",
          "Really excellent, again really good to see the historical information, really is worth going and really good pictures",
          "Considered as a fortress, it is not very impressive. Just stone walls, a series of empty rooms, and a slender high tower. In fact, the tower is the most interesting point of the visit because it offers a very beautiful view of the city. You have to pay a entry fee.",
          "The most beautiful view around the whole Sousse. Prefect and just for 8 DT per person. Very nice #havetosee",
          "Cheap to enter, nice museum in it, interesting but depends on what you want to see. The tower that you can go up that has the staircase that is Anti clockwise is interesting , because it can only be defended by left handed swordsmen. It is also the tower in The Life of Brian",
          "Ribat is amazing to visit, very cheap to get in, very quiet not alot of people, you must go to the top of Ribat the view is amazing. From the top you will see Sousse and Monastir.",
          "Very nice place to visit if you are staying in Sousse. I been to Sousse a lot of time and never visited this place until last year.i do really recommend people to visit this place.",
          "It's an old fort with thick walls and that's basically it - there is nothing inside. You visit it just to get the feel of the old Arabic fortresses built to defend the cities. The best thing is the tower from which you can view the town from above.",
          "A historical place which is nicely kept and teaches a lot of what happened here many centuries ago. Beautiful trees full of oranges in the courtyard outside.",
          "Worth a visit if you have extra time - It\u2019s right in the beginning of the Medina do you can\u2019t miss it Well lit at night -",
          "What a beautiful place to visit whilst in the Medina. The views from the top are just beautiful and the history is amazing.",
          "Nice to wander, lots to buy, polite no thank you is enough to stop the people from asking you into their shops.",
          "We planned a visit to the Medina which is surrounded by a big fortress and in one of its corners there is the ribat with the Tunisian flag on top of it. The municipality is refurbishing it so the time of the visit we couldn't get to the top. Going to the top maybe fearful for",

          "I visited this ribat in Sousse after I checked out the ribat in Monastir. The thing is that, the one in Sousse is smaller and doesn't offer as spectacular view over the surroundings as the ribat in Monastir. My best advise for you if you don't want to be disappointed is to do",

          "Sousse Ribat is situated near the Old city centre. We climbed at the from where the view is really wonderful.",
          "There is little to choose from the various Ribats we visited. There is a tower to climb which affords a good view of the town and harbour. There are toilets available but no sign of a cafe.",

          "Yes this is definitely worth a visit when in Sousse as it gives you a sense of the history of the city through the changes times of differing cultures It is inexpensive go in so give this a try",
          "This is a touristic attraction for a walk around in it covered avenues and side walks. It offers a variety of souvenirs and various shops ,whike some quaters sectorsc are still as is ..for the locals. The shop keepers are welcoming and call out for visitors to step in to",
          "The Ribat of Sousse Ribat is a military building had its name from the Arab word of ribat which means those solders who are looking after the costs and the borders for protection from possible invasion by the enemy. Ribat of Sousse is a magnificent historical construction dating",

          "The town looks like in the time of communism ... When we entered the Medina fear was to go on, because we catch people there, they followed us, not to let peace. I was afraid of the very people! We wanted to be visited Tunisia, because we assume the state is interesting, but",
          "You could get around on foot. Very big old city to see. The traditional life to Tunisians that you could look and enjoy. Fusion of Islamique and roman culture.",
          "The only good thing about the ribat is the view from the top of the tower. The ribat itself has nothing much to see. 7 dinar for the view? Meh.",
          "It was interesting and the view was great. You can see Sousse from up there. The medina is amazing, we walked a lot, we went to the weekly markat, that is a must see",
          "Well worth a look. Great view from the tower. Well kept and interesting to see. Very cheap entry price. Took some great photos as visited during ramadan and were the only two people there. This was the same every tourist attraction we went to. Praise the boring tourists who",
          "A very peaceful (when no tour groups about) place to visit with absolutely stunning views across the city and ocean. Difficult steps to climb, particularly in the tower but well worth it. A great place to chill out and take it all in.",
          "I enjoyed the visit unfortunately it was closed off due to earthquake damage in March 2014. But it was still amazing to see especially if your a monty Python fan ( it's where some of the filming took place)",
          "If you want a few hours away from your hotel in Tunisia visit the centre of sousse. It really is another world walking around the madina and visiting the museum with its task tower where you can get some great photos of the the whole city.",
          "a fantasic walk back into the past, the views over Sousse are amazing and well worth a visit for about 2 hours",
          "Cheap entrance price, extra dina for camera. Nice building, very clean and interesting. Liked the architecture.",
          "Nice to escape the market. We went as a party of four and we were the only people in here. It definitely feels as though this is a work in progress. Although we couldn't actually see any building work going on the place appears smartened up waiting for the next phase which I",
          "I like to look at other cultures whilst on holiday,but as soon as you step outside of your hotel it is continuous hassle.From taxi drivers ,shop keepers ,caf\u00e9 owners they are at you to buy or ener there establishment. You cannot enjoy just looking.",
          "good city view from tower. costs for 7 (about 3,5 euro) dinars for adult. taxi to ribat - about 3-5 dinars",
          "The view from the top of the tower is great! Really interesting, well worth a visit. It cost me and my boyfriend 17 dinar approx \u00a36, for two entry tickets and one to allow us to take photos, a bargain really!",
          "7 Dinar +1 for taking photos,15 in all for both of us, about a fiver . This is an amazing building full of history(and steps, phew) definatly not disabled friendly, but good nonetheless, you can feel the history on you visit and the only downfall is the crazy amount of graffiti",
          "We visited this Ribat as the better one, according to the guide books is in Monastir and this is still closed due to renovation). On entering and paying our 7 dinar each it took us a little while to read all of the information on the plaques on the walls about the building of",
          "Beyond being obviously restored, the amount of graffiti here is a bit shocking... Other reviews are correct - there are some GREAT views over the city - and you can climb to the top of the tower (about a four-story climb - it gets dark, though!) The only English explanations",
          "Small but beautifully restored. Lovely walks around the upper section overlooking the town and especially nice views from the top of the tower. A local craft market was being held on ground level when we visited which improved the experience.",
          "Right at the entrance to the old town (medina) in Sousse, this is worth a visit, as it gives a good view of the town and also down in to the courtyard of the Great Mosque, which non-Muslims cannot visit. In places on the ramparts and on the walls, you must be careful, there are",
          "Interesting ribat(small fort) with lots of nooks and crannies, and a stunning view from the top if the tower of the medina, the town , and the sea.",
          "a great insight into the past, but watch the tower climb, it is only for the sure footed as health and safety would have kittens about this climb.",
          "This was great to explore with the kids - keep a close eye on them as the top is completely open and its a long way down!",
          "There is only one reason to visit the Ribat, and that is for the unrivaled views from the tower. The climb up the tower is quite steep and quite dark in places, I would estimate about 100 steps, so not for the faint hearted. The views of the medina in particular are well worth",
          "Felt as if I was in an old foreign legion fort at one point good view from the tower into the mosque worth the trip from the hotel used the noddy train",
          "The Ribat is one of the oldest buildings in Sousse. You will find it in the NE corner of the medina with a soaring watchtower. It was built in 821 AD and served as both a monastery and fortress. Entry is 7 Dinar and its an extra Dinar to take photos. There is a large prayer hall",
          "We went in a group to Sousse by a small bus. Many went shopping. But we decided to go up to the tower. Only a family with 3 kids were there. We went up and saw the views from up.",
          "Great views from the top of the tower and not very expensive to visit. It was very quiet when we were there (Sept 2014) so lovely and peaceful to walk around.",
          "Whilst on holiday we visited the Ribat in Sousse, it was empty whilst we were there so we could easily take the steep steps to the watch tower, and see the amazing views over the rest of Sousse. The 'castle' is steeped in history, a book, in english is available at the",
          "Quite a surprise to be left free to wander around a beautiful small ancient fortress. 7 dnr entry and 1 dnr to take photos. We stubbed across the Ribat while visiting the Median and we were happy to get away from the intensity of the market to find a great birds eye view of",
          "Interesting and very quiet, a bit of relief from the Sous. only a couple of quid to get in. 50 characters is too much - I could be here all night.",
          "This fort is a well renovated example of a Ribat, it has three levels and a tower. The tower is the highlight of the place, but be aware that it is a steep winding staircase to get to the top. When you are at the top, the hand rails and safety are limited so you will need a head",
          "This cost about \u00a32.50 each ( 7 dinar) to get into and when you get to the top level its a lovely view you can go right to the top of the tower if you want.",
          "Ticket price: 7 TND + 1 TND Photo ticket.. Just a few visitors, no crowd. Go inside the Medina beside the Soula Center and then go right. Easy to find it.",
          "Fun to look around. Only takes about an hour max to take it all in. Would have been nice to have a little more history detailed about the place.",
          "If you get the chance, climb the tower of the Ribat and have a look over the medina. The rest of the building has some good photo locations.",
          "In my opinion, having visited other Ribats such as the one in Monastir, this Ribat is the best preserved and well worth a visit. If you can handle climbing quite a number of steep, stone stairs to the top of the tower, you will be rewarded by an outstanding view of Sousse and",
          "Brilliant piece of history. Great to go to the top of the tower where you could see all over the madina and out to sea.",
          "Went up the Ribat and the views were amazing observing the medina, the mosque in the medina and the sea",
          "this is a fun little trek into and up to the Ribat. It offers a great view of the medina and of the sea. I would definitely recommend this place for a visit.",
          "Loved it but monastir can be very pushy in trying to get you in the shops, just beaware and say no and walk away",
          "This is a small fort in the old town, next to the mosque. If you like forts, you'll love it. If not, you'll love the view from the tower. If you don't care for any of this, don't come here. I rather liked it, both the view and the architecture and the fact that it is in",
          "Quite enjoyed my visit to the Rabat. Not a lot there but we spent an enjoyable hour wandering around and taking photos. Guys at the ticket office were helpful and welcoming.",
          "Well worth a visit ... a basic fortress cum barracks ... limited interpretation but a good place to take the family if you can tell the kids appropriate stories to fill out the visit.",
          "basically it was a big empty building with views over the city from the ramparts, nothing more I can say about it. I believe it is sometimes used to art exhibitions but we didn't see much evidence of that.",
          "The Ribat, in Sousse, opposite the Main Mosque is right in the Centre of Sousse Town and close to the Medina, the main shopping areas, The Soula Centre and Coach and Louages Stations.. It is an exciting, old and beautiful fortress and Tower. The tower is the key site. Only",
          "Our visit to the Ribat didn't take long. The building is nice to look around, but there is little to nothing inside it. A couple of information boards are displayed, but they do not give any atmosphere to the site, and I found them somewhat boring to read. The staircase up the",
          "Very nice ancient building with good history. Not a must see, but if you're in the are make sure you take a visit.",
          "It is worth visiting Sousse's ribat for the views. However, it was very dark in places when climbing the narrow spiral staircase up the tower, so a torch would have been very useful. As there is nothing really to see at ground-level, I would not recommend this for anyone with",
          "We visited Medina on our second day of honeymoon in Sousse. We thought of having a walk along the Medina but came across the Ribat quite accidentally as we sat down on the wall looking over the Ribat below and saw people going in there and figured out that must be the Ribat. The",
          "If you are really bored - you can visit the Ribat. Nice view from the observation tower, but a very narrow staircase.",
          "Quite enjoyed a few hours of this Ribat in town of Sousse. This place cost 7 dinars and again extra one dinar for photos but we felt that Museum Dar Essid has better view when you reached the top of the towers. Small tip! carry a small torch if you wants to climb up the tower",
          "There's not a whole lot to see in my opinion but what you can see makes it definitely worth the while.",
          "very interesting, great views of Monistier , but surrounding area very dirty full of rubbish in streets",
          "We visited the Madina but due to the 'buy this, buy that' or the threat of being robbed by the local pick pockets we decided to visit a local museum near the top (See other review Dar Essid) afterwards we walked down along the wall to the main entrance and came across the Ribat.",
          "beautifully well restored, unfortunately very little english information to advise what you are seeing, for a photographer an amazing vantage point to capture the surroundings!!",
          "This ribat has been extensively restaured and I am not sure that it was done properly. IT looks to me as the use of concrete was a quick and easy option. Nevertheless, you get a great view of the old city (Medina). It is interesting to think also that the sea was just by the",
          "Travelling Tunisia and visiting the 'ribats' isn't like to discovery the extraordinary maharajah castles in India. If you seen one ribat you seen all of them. This ribat is like the others in area.",
          "The historical feeling and the atmosphere was wonderful and the magnificent view from the ramparts was worth the climb",
          "The Ribat of Sousse has a great history, and is a must see when you visit this city. It towers over the medina and from the top you have an amazing view of the city. Great explanations, well aranged, wonderful historical monument!",
          "Great view of Sousse and the medina. Went here on out first day in Sousse when we also visited kasbah and museum - well worth visiting museum for best mosaics.",
          "You can climb to the top of the tower and get a great view of Sousse. Cheap to get in, 5 TND for adults, children free. Not much else there, but good for a short wander.",
          "Historically interesting but nothing \"fancy\", there are a few small pieces in the wall that you can find that has the original mosaic. The tower provides nice view of the city.",
          "Very well kept but there is nothing in it apart from the building gives good views over the souk and up to the main gate in Medina wall",
          "Great view from the top - however if you can go to Monastir (about 30 minutes away by taxi) that is a Ribat worth seeing!",
          "It is the fortified monastery. The Ribat stands right on the Place Farhat Hached, apart from the many other crowded buildings in Sousse. The word \u201cRibat\u201d comes from the same root as the North African name for holy men. Ribats of these times were generally connected to a very",
          "The top of the tower is a great view over the Medina, Kasbah, the port of Sousse and the rest of the city.",
          "Monastir is more quiet, peacefull, people in it are better... or at least they were to me. You can take some excellent photos there, parks are nice and it's cleaner than in Sousse.",
          "Fantastic view into the great mosque and the medina, the climb to to top of the Ribat was quite dark and bit scary but well worth the views, as with everything in tunisia at the moment great value for money.",
          "Nobody watches you - if you wish you can sleep in one of the rooms. The upped deck is good for taking photos of local people unnoticed",
          "Works well for photographs of Sousse, good location and beautiful view. I recommend it if you like good views.",
          "cause youll pay 1TD for it. and deffinitly go climb all the way on the top cause the view is stunning",
          "Good views of Sousse but not for the faint hearted as the steps are a bit of a climb. Good value for money and a great photo opportunity, the Ribat gives you an insight to the size of the Medina.",
          "Amazing view from on top of the Ribat Tower. Make sure you spend the energy and the 5 Dinar to visit and climb. Best view of Sousse.",
          "Excellent market place with everyday Tunisian going about there daily lives. Extremely fresh fish sold in the market,very near the port sousse which is breathtaking toi view.",
          "It was very clean, pretty cheap and had excellent views over the port, medina and a lot of Sousse. Added to that we basically had it to ourselves! Steps are very narrow and dar kin some places though",
          "Fascinating history in a very well preserved and restored building. This old monastry and fortress is certainly worth a visit, for the fantastic view of Sousse from the top of the tower if nothing else!",
          "Location used for Monty Python film. View from the tower is fantastic.",
          "be prepared to bartar well for a bargin there ae plenty to be had",
          "Just inside the main entrance is an explanation of what the building is all about. I loved the fact that there is no 'Health and Safety ' here at all. You can climb up the walls and a very tall tower and there are no barriers or signs telling you not to fall over the edge. There",
          "Approx \u00a32 to visit. Great views but not for people with bad knees as there are steps to climb. Well worth the money.",
          "This was interesting with lots of historical information & pictures displayed around, cave like rooms within the walls & a great view from the upper floor & tower.",
          "Definitely worth a look. Amazing architecture and is right in the middle of the Medina so easy to find and nice to look at. You will probably by now be used to the pushy shop keepers and men trying to get money out of you whatever way they can - my only advice is if you aren't",
          "When we went to see the Ribat, no-one was allowed inside. We walked around the outside and blagged our way in through a side entrance. An Italian film company had taken over the place to make a movie called \"Maria\". The story of the mother of Christ. The whole place was filled",
          "Worth a visit but it's only an empty shell and won't take long. There is a view of the castle some distance away from the top of the tower but otherwise it's satellite dishes",

        "wiki": "Tunis (Arabic: \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633\u200e T\u016bnis) is the capital and largest city of Tunisia. The greater metropolitan area of Tunis, often referred to as \"Grand Tunis\", has about 2,700,000 inhabitants, making it the third-largest city in the Maghreb region (after Casablanca and Algiers) and the sixteenth-largest in the Arab world. \nSituated on a large Mediterranean Sea gulf (the Gulf of Tunis), behind the Lake of Tunis and the port of La Goulette (\u1e24alq il-W\u0101d), the city extends along the coastal plain and the hills that surround it. At its core lies its ancient medina, a World Heritage Site. East of the medina through the Sea Gate (also known as the Bab el Bhar and the Porte de France) begins the modern city, or Ville Nouvelle, traversed by the grand Avenue Habib Bourguiba (often referred to by popular press and travel guides as \"the Tunisian Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\"), where the colonial-era buildings provide a clear contrast to smaller, older structures. Further east by the sea lie the suburbs of Carthage, La Marsa, and Sidi Bou Said. As the capital city of the country, Tunis is the focus of Tunisian political and administrative life and also the centre of the country's commercial and cultural activities. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nTunis is the transcription of the Arabic name \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633 which can be pronounced as \"T\u016bnus\", \"T\u016bnas\", or \"T\u016bnis\". All three variations were mentioned by the Greek-Syrian geographer al-Rumi Yaqout in his Mu'jam al-B\u00fbldan (Dictionary of Countries).\nDifferent explanations exist for the origin of the name Tunis. Some scholars relate it to the Phoenician goddess Tanith ('Tanit or Tanut), as many ancient cities were named after patron deities. Some scholars claim that it originated from Tynes, which was mentioned by Diodorus Siculus and Polybius in the course of descriptions of a location resembling present-day Al-Kasbah; Tunis's old Berber Bourgade.Another possibility is that it was derived from the Berber verbal root ens which means \"to lie down\" or \"to pass the night\". The term Tunis can possibly mean \"camp at night\", \"camp\", or \"stop\", or may have referred to as \"the last stop before Carthage\" by people who were journeying to Carthage by land. There are also some mentions in ancient Roman sources of such names of nearby towns as Tuniza (now El Kala), Thunusuda (now Sidi-Meskin), Thinissut (now Bir Bouregba), and Thunisa (now Ras Jebel). As all of these Berber villages were situated on Roman roads, they undoubtedly served as rest-stations or stops.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Carthage ===\n\nThe historical study of Carthage is problematic. Because its culture and records were destroyed by the Romans at the end of the Third Punic War, very few Carthaginian primary historical sources survive. While there are a few ancient translations of Punic texts into Greek and Latin, as well as inscriptions on monuments and buildings discovered in Northwest Africa, the main sources are Greek and Roman historians, including Livy, Polybius, Appian, Cornelius Nepos, Silius Italicus, Plutarch, Dio Cassius, and Herodotus. These writers belonged to peoples in competition, and often in conflict, with Carthage. Greek cities contended with Carthage over Sicily, and the Romans fought three wars against Carthage. Not surprisingly, their accounts of Carthage are extremely hostile; while there are a few Greek authors who took a favourable view, these works have been lost.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nTunis was originally a Berber settlement. The existence of the town is attested by sources dating from the 4th century BC. Situated on a hill, Tunis served as an excellent point from which the comings and goings of naval and caravan traffic to and from Carthage could be observed. Tunis was one of the first towns in the region to fall under Carthaginian control, and in the centuries that followed Tunis was mentioned in the military histories associated with Carthage. Thus, during Agathocles' expedition, which landed at Cape Bon in 310 BC, Tunis changed hands on various occasions.During the Mercenary War, it is possible that Tunis served as a center for the native population of the area, and that its population was mainly composed of peasants, fishermen, and craftsmen. Compared to the ancient ruins of Carthage, the ruins of ancient Tunis are not as large. According to Strabo, it was destroyed by the Romans in 146 BC during the Third Punic War. Both Tunis and Carthage were destroyed; Tunis, however, was rebuilt first under the rule of Augustus and became an important town under Roman control and the center of a booming agricultural industry. The city is mentioned in the Tabula Peutingeriana as Thuni. In the system of Roman roads for the Roman province of Africa, Tunis had the title of mutatio (\"way station, resting place\"). Tunis, increasingly Romanized, was also eventually Christianized and became the seat of a bishop. However, Tunis remained modestly sized compared to Carthage during this time.\n\n\n=== Early Islamic period ===\n\nWhen the Arab Muslim troops conquered the region at the end of the 7th century, they established themselves at the outskirts of ancient Tunes, and the small town soon became the city of Tunis that could easily be taken for an Arab foundation. The medina of Tunis, the oldest section of the city, dates from this period, during which the region was conquered by the Umayyad emir Hasan ibn al-Nu'man al-Ghasani. The city had the natural advantage of coastal access, via the Mediterranean, to the major ports of southern Europe. Early on, Tunis played a military role; the Arabs recognized the strategic importance of its proximity to the Strait of Sicily. From the beginning of the 8th century Tunis was the chef-lieu of the area: it became the Arabs' naval base in the western Mediterranean Sea, and took on considerable military importance. Under the Aghlabids, the people of Tunis revolted numerous times, but the city benefited from economic improvements and quickly became the second most important in the kingdom. It was briefly the national capital, from the end of the reign of Ibrahim II in 902, until 909 when control over Ifriqiya was lost to the newly founded Fatimid Caliphate.\nLocal opposition to the authorities began to intensify in September 945, when Kharijite insurgents occupied Tunis, resulting in general pillaging. With the rise of the Zirid dynasty Tunis gained importance, but the Sunni population tolerated Shi'ite rule less and less, and carried out massacres against the Shi'ite community. In 1048 the Zirid ruler Al-Muizz ibn Badis rejected his city's obedience to the Fatimids and re-established Sunni rites throughout all of Ifriqiya. This decision infuriated the Shi'ite caliph Al-Mustansir Billah. To punish the Zirids, he unleashed the Banu Hilal Arab tribe on Ifriqiya; a large part of the country was set to the torch, the Zirid capital Kairouan was razed in 1057, and only a few coastal towns, including Tunis and Mahdia, escaped destruction. Exposed to violence from the hostile tribes that settled around the city, the population of Tunis repudiated the authority of the Zirids and swore allegiance to the Hammadid prince El Nacer ibn Alennas, who was based in B\u00e9ja\u00efa, in 1059. The governor appointed by B\u00e9ja\u00efa, having reestablished order in the country, did not hesitate to free himself from the Hammadids to found the Khurasanid dynasty with Tunis as its capital. This small independent kingdom picked up the threads of trade and commerce with other nations, and brought the region back to peace and prosperity.\n\n\n=== New capital of Tunisia ===\nIn 1159, the Almohad 'Abd al-Mu'min took Tunis, overthrew the last Khurasanid leader and installed a new government in the kasbah of Tunis. The Almohad conquest marked the beginning of the dominance of the city in Tunisia. Having previously played a minor role behind Kairouan and Mahdia, Tunis was promoted to the rank of provincial capital.\nIn 1228, Governor Abu Zakariya seized power and, a year later, took the title of Emir and founded the Hafsid dynasty. The city became the capital of a Hafsid kingdom stretching towards Tripoli and Fez. Walls were built to protect the emerging principal town of the kingdom, surrounding the medina, the kasbah and the new suburbs of Tunis. In 1270 the city was taken briefly by Louis IX of France, who was hoping to convert the Hafsid sovereign to Christianity. King Louis easily captured Carthage, but his army soon fell victim to an outbreak of dysentery. Louis himself died before the walls of the capital and the army was forced out.  At the same time, driven by the reconquest of Spain, the first Andalusian Muslims and Jews arrived in Tunis and would become of importance to the economic prosperity of the Hafsid capital and the development of its intellectual life.During the Almohad and Hafsid periods Tunis was one of the richest and grandest cities in the Islamic world, with a population of about 100,000.\nDuring this period, one of the famous travellers to Tunis was Ibn Battuta. In his travel account, when Ibn Battuta and his group arrived in Tunis, the population of the city came out to meet him and the other the members of his party. They all greeted them and were very curious, many were asking questions, however, no one in Tunis personally greeted Ibn Battuta, greatly upsetting him. He felt very lonely and could not hold back the tears coming from his eyes. This went on for a while until one of the pilgrims realized he was upset, he went up and greeted and talked to Ibn until he entered the city. At the time, the Sultan of Tunis was Abu Yahya and during Ibn Battuta's stay, the Festival of the Breaking of the Fast was taking place. The people in the city assembled in large numbers to celebrate the festival, in extravagant and most luxurious outfits. Abu Yahya arrived on horseback, where all of his relatives joined him. After the performance, the people returned to their homes.\n\n\n=== Spanish occupation and Ottoman control ===\n\nThe Ottoman Empire took nominal control of Tunis in 1534 when Hayreddin Barbarossa captured it from the Hafsid Sultan Mulai Hassan, who fled to the court of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. Charles, suffering losses from the corsairs operating out of Djerba, Tunis, and Algiers, agreed to reinstate Mulai Hassan in exchange for his acceptance of Spanish suzerainty. A naval expedition led by Charles himself was dispatched in 1535, and the city was recaptured. The victory against the corsairs is recorded in a tapestry at the Royal Palace of Madrid. The Spanish governor of La Goulette, Luys Peres Varga,  fortified the island of Chikly in the lake of Tunis to strengthen the city's defences between 1546 and 1550. \n\n \nThe Ottoman Ulu\u00e7 Ali Reis, at the head of an army of janissaries and Kabyles, retook Tunis in 1569. However, following the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the Spanish under John of Austria succeeded in retaking the city and re-establishing the Hafsid sovereign in October 1573. Following these conflicts, the city finally fell into Ottoman hands in August 1574. Having become an Ottoman province governed by a Pasha who was appointed by the Sultan based in Constantinople, the country attained a degree of autonomy. After 1591, the Ottoman governors (Beys) were relatively independent, and both piracy and trade continued to flourish. Under the rule of deys and Moorish beys, the capital sprang into new life. Its population grew by additions from various ethnicities, among which were Moorish refugees from Spain, and economic activities diversified. To traditional industry and trade with distant lands was added the activity of the Barbary pirates, then in their golden age. Profits obtained from the trade in Christian slaves allowed the rulers to build sumptuous structures that revived the architectural heritage of the Middle Ages.\n\nIn April 1655 the English admiral Robert Blake was sent to the Mediterranean to extract compensation from states that had been attacking English shipping. Only the Bey of Tunis refused to comply, with the result that Blake's fifteen ships attacked the Bey's arsenal at Porto Farina (Ghar el Melh), destroying nine Algerian ships and two shore batteries, the first time in naval warfare that shore batteries had been eliminated without landing men ashore.\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Tunisia entered into a new period in its history with the advent of the Husainid dynasty. Successive Husainid rulers made great progress in developing the city and its buildings. During this period, the city prospered as a centre of commerce. Taking advantage of divisions within the ruling house, Algerians captured Tunis in 1756 and put the country under supervision. Hammouda Bey faced bombardment by the Venetian fleet, and the city experienced a rebellion in 1811. Under the reign of Hussein Bey II, naval defeats by the British (1826) and French (1827) saw the French become increasingly active in the city and in the economy.Various sources estimate the 19th-century population to have ranged from 90,000 to 110,000 inhabitants. During the later 19th century, Tunis became increasingly populated by Europeans, particularly the French, and immigration dramatically increased the size of the city. This resulted in the first demolition of the old city walls, from 1860, to accommodate growth in the suburbs. The city spilled outside the area of the earlier town and the banks of the lake, and the new districts were modernised with running water (1860), lighting gas (1872), roads, waste collection (1873), and communication with adjacent suburbs and the city centre. The crafts and traditional trades declined somewhat, as the newcomers increased trade with Europe, introducing the first modern industries and new forms of urban life.\n\n\n=== Development under the French protectorate ===\n\nThe creation of the French protectorate in 1881 was a turning point in Tunis's history, leading to rapid redevelopment of the city in the span of two to three decades. The city quickly spread out of its fortifications: it divided into a traditional Arab-populated old city, and a new city populated by immigrants, with a different structure from that of the traditional medina. Tunis also benefited from French construction of a water supply, natural gas and electricity networks, public transport services and other public infrastructure.\nUnder French rule, a substantial number of Europeans settled (like the Tunisian Italians); half of the population was European in origin. The city expanded and created new boulevards and neighborhoods.\nTunis was quiet during the First World War. After the war, the city faced new transformations as the modern portion grew in importance and extended its network of boulevards and streets in all directions. In addition, a series of satellite cities emerged on the urban rim and encroached on the municipality of Tunis proper. In the economic sphere, commercial activities expanded and diversified as modern industries continued to grow, while traditional industry continued to decline.\nDuring World War II, Tunis was held by Axis forces from November 1942 to May 1943. It was their last base in Africa, as they retreated towards Sicily after being surrounded by Allied forces from Algeria to the west and from Libya to the east. \nOn 7 May 1943, at about 15:30 in the afternoon, Tunis fell to troops of British 1st Army and the U.S. 1st Army, which had defeated the German 5th Panzer Army guarding the city. At midday on 20 May 1943, the Allies held a victory parade on Avenue Mar\u00e9chal Galli\u00e9ni, and Avenue Jules Ferry, to signal the end of fighting in North Africa.Having succeeded in driving the Axis powers out of Tunisia, the Allies used Tunis as a base of operations from which to stage amphibious assaults first against the island of Pantelleria, and then Sicily, and finally the mainland of Italy.\n\n\n=== Growth since independence ===\n\nAfter independence in 1956, Tunis consolidated its role as the capital, first with the establishment of a constitution stating that the Chamber of Deputies and the Presidency of the Republic must have their headquarters in Tunis and its suburbs. In a very short time, the colonial city transformed rapidly. As the city has grown and native Tunisians gradually began to replace the extensive European population, conflict between the Arab city and the European city has gradually decreased with the arabization of the population.\nBecause of population pressure and the rate of migration to the capital, the city continued to grow, even with the creation of new districts in the suburbs. Old buildings have gradually been renovated and upgraded and new buildings have come to influence the urban landscape. At the same time, an active policy of industrialization is developing the municipal economy.\nThe Arab League was headquartered in Tunis from 1979 to 1990. The Arab League, which represents 22 Arab nations, transferred its headquarters to Tunis in 1979 because of Egypt's peace with Israel but has been headquartered back in Egypt since 1990.\nThe Palestine Liberation Organization also had its headquarters in Tunis, from 1982 to 2003.\nIn 1985, the PLO's headquarters was bombed by Israeli Air Force F-15s, killing approximately 60 people.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nMany protests took place during the Arab Spring of 2011\u201312.\nOn 18 March 2015, two gunmen attacked the Bardo National Museum and held hostages. Twenty civilians and one policeman were killed in the attack, while around 50 others were injured. Five Japanese, two Colombians, and visitors from Italy, Poland, and Spain were among the dead. Both gunmen were killed by Tunisian police. The incident has been treated as a terrorist attack.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTunis is located in north-eastern Tunisia on the Lake of Tunis, and is connected to the Mediterranean sea's Gulf of Tunis by a canal which terminates at the port of La Goulette/Halq al Wadi. The ancient city of Carthage is located just north of Tunis along the coastal part. The city lies on a similar latitude as the southernmost points of Europe.\nThe city of Tunis is built on a hill slope down to the lake of Tunis. These hills contain places such as Notre-Dame de Tunis, Ras Tabia, La Rabta, La Kasbah, Montfleury and La Manoubia with altitudes just above 50 metres (160 feet). The city is located at the crossroads of a narrow strip of land between Lake Tunis and S\u00e9joumi. The isthmus between them is what geologists call the \"Tunis dome\", which includes hills of limestone and sediments. It forms a natural bridge and since ancient times several major roads linking to Egypt and elsewhere in Tunisia have branched out from it. The roads also connect with Carthage, emphasising its political and economic importance not only in Tunisia but more widely in North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea in ancient times.\nThe Greater Tunis area has an area of 300,000 hectares, 30,000 of which is urbanized, the rest being shared between bodies of water (20,000 hectares of lakes or lagoons) and agricultural or natural land (250,000 hectares). However, urban growth, which is estimated to be increasing by 500 hectares per year, is gradually changing the landscape with urban sprawl.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Suburbs ===\nAfter World War II, suburbs began to rapidly spring up on the outskirts of Tunis. These form a large percentage of the population of the Tunis metropolitan area. It grew from 27% of the total population in 1956, to 37% in 1975 and 50% in 2006.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTunis has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa), characterized by hot and dry, prolonged summers and mild winters with moderate rainfall. The local climate is also affected somewhat by the latitude of the city, the moderating influence of the Mediterranean sea and the terrain of the hills.\nWinter is the wettest season of the year, when more than a third of the annual rainfall falls during this period, raining on average every two or three days.  The sun may still increase the temperature from 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F) in the morning to 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) in the afternoon on average during the winter. Frosts are rare.  In spring, rainfall declines by half.  The sunshine becomes dominant in May when it reaches 10 hours a day on average.  In March temperatures may vary between 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F) and 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), and between 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) and 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) in May. However, it is common for temperatures to soar even as early as April with record temperatures reaching 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F).  In summer, rain is almost completely absent and the sunlight is at a maximum.  The average temperatures in the summer months of June, July, August, and September are very high. Sea breezes may mitigate the heat, but sometimes the sirocco winds reverse the trend.  In autumn, it begins to rain, often with short thunderstorms, which can sometimes cause flash floods or even flood some parts of the city.  The month of November marks a break in the general heat with average temperatures ranging from 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) to 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Capital ===\n\nTunis has been the capital of Tunisia since 1159. Under Articles 43 and 24 of the Constitution of 1959, Tunis and its suburbs host the national institutions: the Presidential Palace, which is known as Carthage Palace, residence of the President of Tunisia, the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Advisors and parliament, the Constitutional Council and the main judicial institutions  and public bodies. The revised Tunisian Constitution of 2014 similarly provides that the National Assembly is to sit in Tunis (article 51) and that the Presidency is based there (article 73).\n\n\n=== Municipality ===\n\n\n==== Institutions ====\n\nFollowing the municipal elections of 6 May 2018, Ennahdha obtained 21 seats out of 60. Nidaa Tounes came second with 17 seats. On 3 July 2018, the head of the Ennahdha list Souad Abderrahim was elected by the council as the new mayor of the capital.\nBefore 2011, unlike other mayors in Tunisia, the mayor of Tunis is appointed by decree of the President of the Republic from among the members of the City Council.\n\n\n==== Budget ====\nThe 2008 budget adopted by the City Council is structured as follows: 61.61 million dinars for operations and 32,516 million dinars for investment. It reflects the improved financial situation of the municipality, the year 2007 was a year registering a surplus in resources that allowed the settlement of debts of the municipality and the strengthening of its credibility with respect its suppliers and public and private partners.\nRevenues are generated by the proceeds of taxes on buildings and vacant lots, fees for the rental of municipal property, income from the operation of the public, advertising, and that the fact that the municipality has capital shares in some companies. On the expenditure side, provision is made for the consolidation of hygiene and cleanliness, the state of the environment and urban design, infrastructure maintenance, rehabilitation and renovation of facilities, and strengthening the logistics and means of work and transport.\n\n\n==== Administrative divisions ====\n\nThe city of Tunis, whose size has increased significantly during the second half of the 20th century, now extends beyond the Tunis Governorate into parts of the governorates of Ben Arous, Ariana and Manouba.\nThe municipality of Tunis is divided into 15 municipal districts:  These include El Bab Bhar, Bab Souika, Cit\u00e9 El Khadra, Jelloud Jebel El Kabaria, El Menzah, El Ouardia, Ettahrir, Ezzouhour, Hra\u00efria, Medina, El Omrane, El Omrane Higher S\u00e9joumi, Sidi El-Bashir and Sidi Hassine.\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nIn the years following independence, the population of the metropolitan area continued to grow: by 21.1% from 1956 to 1966 and by 28.5% from 1966 to 1975 (55.6% between 1956 and 1975). This steady growth was accompanied by changes which affected the nature of the settlement of the capital. Decolonization led to the exodus of some European minorities whose numbers dwindled every year. The gaps created by their departure were filled by Tunisians who emigrated to Tunis from other parts of the country.\nThe population of the city of Tunis exceeds 2,000,000 inhabitants. After independence, the Tunisian government implemented a plan to cope with population growth of the city and country, a system of family planning, to attempt to lower the rate of population growth. However, between 1994 and 2004, the population of the governorate of Tunis grew more than 1.03% per annum. It represents, in the 2004 census, 9.9% of the total population of Tunisia. As in the rest of Tunisia, literacy in the region of Tunis evolved rapidly during the second half of the 20th century and has reached a level slightly higher than the national average. The education level is only exceeded by the neighbouring governorate of Ariana which has many institutions of education.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nProducts include textiles, carpets, and olive oil. Tourism also provides a significant portion of the city's income.\nBecause of the concentration of political authority (headquarters of the central government, presidency, parliament, ministries and central government) and culture (festivals and mainstream media), Tunis is the only nationally ranking metropolis. Tunis is the heartland of the Tunisian economy and is the industrial and economic hub of the country, home to one third of Tunisian companies\u2014including almost all the head offices of companies with more than fifty employees, with the exception of the Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa, headquartered in Gafsa\u2014and produces a third of the national gross domestic product.  Tunis attracts foreign investors (33% of companies, 26% of investments and 27% of employment), excluding several areas due to economic imbalances. According to the Mercer 2017 Cost of Living Rankings, Tunis has the lowest cost of living for expatriates in the world. The urban unemployment rate of university graduates is increasing and the illiteracy rate remains high among the elderly (27% of women and 12% of men). The number of people living below the poverty line, falling at the national level, remains higher in urban areas. In addition, unemployment is high in young people aged 18 to 24, with one in three unemployed as compared to one in six at the national level. In Greater Tunis, the proportion of young unemployed is at 35%.Gulf finance house or GFH has invested $10 billion in order for the construction of tunis financial harbor, that will transform Tunisia as the gateway to Africa from Europe. The project hopes to boost the economy of Tunisia as well as increase the number of tourists visiting Tunisia annually. The project is going through planning.\n\n\n=== Sectors ===\nThe economic structure of Tunis, as well as that of the country, is overwhelmingly tertiary industry.  The city is the largest financial center in the country hosting the headquarters of 65% of financial companies \u2013 while the industrial sectors are gradually declining in importance.  However the secondary industry is still very represented and Tunis hosts 85% of industrial establishments in the four governorates, with a trend towards the spread of specialized industrial zones in the suburbs.\nPrimary industry such as agriculture, however, is active in specialized agricultural areas on the suburbs, particularly in the wine and olive oil industries. The generally flat terrain and the two main rivers in Tunisia, the Medjerda to the north and the Milian to the south, the soils are fertile.  Tunis has several large plains, the most productive are in Ariana and La Soukra (north), the plain of Manouba (west) and the plain of Mornag (south).  In addition, groundwater is easily accessible through the drilling of deep wells, providing water for the different agriculture crops. The soils are heavy and contain limestone in the north but are lighter and sandy containing clay in the south.  There is much diversification in the municipality of Tunis, with Durum grown in Manouba, Olives and olive oil in Ariana and Mornag, wine (Mornag), and fruit, vegetable and legumes are grown in all regions.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Architecture and landscape ==\n\n\n=== Urban landscape ===\n\nThe Medina, built on a gentle hill slope on the way down to the Lake of Tunis, is the historical heart of the city and home to many monuments, including palaces, such as the Dar Ben Abdallah and Dar Hussein, the mausoleum of Tourbet el Bey or many mosques such as the Al-Zaytuna Mosque. Some of the fortifications around it have now largely disappeared, and it is flanked by the two suburbs of Bab Souika to the north and Bab El Jazira to the south. Located near the Bab Souika, the neighborhood of Halfaouine which gained international attention through the film 'Halfaouine Child of the Terraces'.\nBut east of the original nucleus, first with the construction of the French Consulate, the modern city was built gradually with the introduction of the French protectorate at the end of the 19th century, on open land between the city and the lake. The axis to the structure of this part of the city is the Avenue Habib Bourguiba, designed by the French to be a Tunisian form of Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris with its cafes, major hotels, shops and cultural venues. On both sides of the tree lines avenue, north and south, the city was extended in various districts, with the northern end welcoming residential and business districts while the south receives industrial districts and poorer peoples.\nSouth-east of the Avenue Bourguiba the district of La Petite Sicile (Little Sicily) is adjacent to the old port area and takes its name from its original population of workers from Italy. It is now the subject of a redevelopment project including the construction of twin towers. North of the Avenue Bourguiba is the district of La Fayette, which is still home to the Great Synagogue of Tunis and the Habib Thameur Gardens, built on the site of an ancient Jewish cemetery which lay outside the walls. Also to the north is the long Avenue Mohamed V, which leads to the Boulevard of 7 November through the neighborhood of the big banks where there are hotels and Abu Nawas Lake and finally to the Belvedere area around the place Pasteur. This is where the Belvedere Park lies, the largest in the city, and home to a zoo and the Pasteur Institute founded by Adrien Loir in 1893. Continuing to the north are the most exclusive neighborhoods of Mutuelleville which house the French Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-Mend\u00e8s-France, the Sheraton Hotel and some embassies.\nStill further north of the Belvedere Park, behind the Boulevard of 7 November are the neighborhoods of El Menzah and El Manar now reaching the peaks of the hills overlooking the north of the town. They support a range of residential and commercial buildings. To the west of the park lies the district of El Omrane which holds the main Muslim cemetery in the capital and the warehouses of public transport.  Heading east is the Tunis-Carthage International Airport and the neighborhoods of Borgel, giving his name to the existing Jewish and Christian cemeteries in the capital, and the neighbourhood of Montplaisir. Beyond that, several kilometers north-east, on the road to La Marsa,  the Berges du Lac was built on land reclaimed from the north shore of the lake near the airport, which has holds offices of Tunisian and foreign companies, many embassies as well as shops.\nSouthwest of the Medina, on the crest of the hills across the Isthmus of Tunis, is the Montfleury district then on down to the foothills of S\u00e9joumi, the poor neighborhood of Mellassine. Northwest of the latter, north of the National Route 3 leading to the west, is the city of Ezzouhour (formerly El Kharrouba), which spans more than three metres (9.8 feet) and is divided into five sections. It is still surrounded with farmland and vegetables are grown which supply many of the souks in the region.\nThe south of Tunis is made up of disadvantaged neighborhoods, especially due to the strong industry in this part of the metropolis. These include Jebel Jelloud, located in the south-east of Tunis, which concentrates on the heavy industry of cement production, the treatment plant of phosphate s, etc. The main cemetery in Tunis, the Djellaz Cemetery, dominates this part of town, perched on the slopes of a rocky outcrop.\n\n\n=== M\u00e9dina ===\n\nThe medina of Tunis has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979. The Medina contains some 700 monuments, including palaces, mosques, mausoleums, madrasas and fountains dating from the Almohad and the Hafsid periods. These ancient buildings include:\n\nThe Aghlabid Al-Zaytouna Mosque (\"Mosque of the Olive\") built in 723 by Ubayd Allah ibn al-Habhab to celebrate the new capital.\nThe Dar El Bey, or Bey's Palace, comprises architecture and decoration from many different styles and periods and is believed to stand on the remains of a Roman theatre as well as the 10th-century palace of Ziadib-Allah II al Aghlab.With an area of 270 hectares (over 29 hectares for the Kasbah)  and more than 100,000 people, the Medina comprises one-tenth of the population of Tunis. The planning of the Medina of Tunis has the distinction of not grid lines or formal geometric compositions. However, studies were undertaken in the 1930s with the arrival of the first anthropologists who found that the space of the Medina is not random: the houses are based on a socio-cultural code according to the types of complex human relations.\nDomestic architecture (palaces and townhouses), official and civilian (libraries and administrations), religious (mosques and zaou\u00efas) and services (commercial and fondouks) are located in the Medina. The notion of public space is ambiguous in the case of Medina where the streets are seen as an extension of the houses and subject to social tags. The concept of ownership is low however and souks often spill out onto public roads. Today, each district has its culture and rivalries can be strong.\nThe northern end supports the football club of Esperance Sportive de Tunis while at the other end is the rival Club Africain. The Medina also has a social sectorization: with the neighborhood of Tourbet el Bey and the Kasbah district being aristocratic, with a population of judges and politicians, while the streets of Pacha often being military and bourgeois.\nFounded in 698 is the Al-Zaytuna Mosque and the surrounding area which developed throughout the Middle Ages,  dividing Tunis into a main town in two suburbs, in the north (Bab Souika) and the south (Bab El Jazira). The area became the capital of a powerful kingdom during the Hafsid era, and was considered a religious and intellectual home and economic center for the Middle East, Africa and Europe. A great fusion of influences can be seen blending Andalusian styles with eastern influences, and Roman or Byzantine columns, and typical Arab architecture, characterized by the archways.\nThe architectural heritage is also omnipresent in the homes of individuals and small palace officials as well as in the palace of the sovereign of Kasbah. Although some palaces and houses date back to the Middle Ages, a greater number of prestigious houses were built in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries such as Dar Othman (early 17th century), Dar Ben Abdallah (18th century), Dar Hussein, Dar Cherif and other houses. The main palace beys are those of La Marsa, Bardo and Ksar Said. If we add the mosques and oratories (about 200), the madrasahs (El Bachia, Slimania, El Achouria, Bir El Ahjar, Ennakhla, etc..), The zaouias (Mahrez Sidi Sidi Ali Azouz, Sidi Abdel Kader, etc.) and Tourbet El Fellari, Tourbet Aziza Othman and Tourbet El Bey the number of monuments in Tunis approaches 600. Unlike Algiers, Palermo and Naples, its historical heart has never suffered from major natural disasters or urban radical interventions. The main conflicts and potentially destructive human behavior has been experienced in the city occurred relatively recently following the country's independence which it why it made into a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. At the beginning of the 21st century, the Medina is one of the best preserved urban locations in the Arab world.Furthermore, along the boulevards, the contribution of the architectural period 1850\u20131950 can be felt in the buildings, such as the government buildings of the nine ministries and the headquarters of the municipality of Tunis.\n\n\n=== Other landmarks ===\nThe Bardo Museum was originally a 13th-century Hafsid palace, located in the (then) suburbs of Tunis. It contains a major collection of Roman empires and other antiquities of interest from Ancient Greece, Tunisia, and from the Arab period.\nThe ruins of Carthage are nearby, along the coast to the northeast, with many ancient ruins.\n\n\n==== Souks ====\n\nThe souks are a network of covered streets lined with shops and traders and artisans ordered by specialty.  Clothing merchants, perfumers, fruit sellers, booksellers and wool merchants have goods at the souks, while fishmongers, blacksmiths and potters tend to be relegated to the periphery of the markets.\n\nNorth of the Al-Zaytuna Mosque is the Souk El Attarine, built in the early 18th century. It is known for its essences and perfumes. From this souk, there is a street leading to the Souk Ech-Chaouachine (chachia). The main company that operates it is one of the oldest in the country and they are generally descendants of Andalusian immigrants expelled from Spain. Attached to El Attarine are two other souks: the first, which runs along the western coast of the Al-Zaytuna Mosque, is the Souk El Kmach which is noted for its fabrics, and the second, the Souk El Berka, which was built in the 17th century and houses embroiderers and jewelers. Given the valuable items it sells, it is the only souk whose doors are closed and guarded during the night. In the middle there is a square where the former slave market stood until the middle of the 19th century.\nSouk El Berka leads to Souk El Leffa, a souk that sells all kinds of carpets, blankets and other weavings, and extends with the Souk Es Sarragine, built in the early 18th century and specializing in leather. At the periphery are the souks Et Trouk, El Blat, El Blaghgia, El K\u00e9babgia, En Nhas (copper), Es Sabbaghine (dyeing) and El Grana that sell clothing and blankets and was occupied by Jewish merchants.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Walls and gates ====\n\nFrom the early days of its founding, Tunis has been considered an important military base. The Arab geographer El Yacoubi has written that in the 9th century Tunis was surrounded by a wall of brick and clay except the side of the sea where it was stone.  Bab El-Jazeera, perhaps the oldest gate of the south wall, opened onto the southern road. Bab Cartagena gave access to Carthage, important for bringing in construction materials needed for the city. Bab Souika (initially known as Bab El Saqqayin) had a strategic role to keep the roads to Bizerte, B\u00e9ja and Le Kef. Bab Menara (initially known as Bab El Artha) opened onto the medina and on the suburb of El Haoua. As for El Bab Bhar, it allowed access to some funduqs where Christian merchants lived in Tunis.\nWith the development of the capital under the reign of the Hafsids, two emerging suburbs grew outside the walls; Bab El Jazira in the south and Bab Souika to the north. In the early 14th century, Hafsid Darba Ab\u00fb al-Muhammad al-Mustansir Lihy\u00e2n\u00ee ordered the construction of a second chamber including the Medina and two suburbs outside. Six new gates were built including Bab El Khadra, Bab Saadoun, Bab El Allouj (initially called Bab Er-Rehiba), Khalid or Bab Bab Sidi Abdallah Cherif, Bab El Fellah and Bab Alioua. In the Ottoman period, four new gates were established: Bab Laassal, Bab Sidi Abdesselam, Bab El Bab Gorjani and Sidi Kacem. The city retains some of these gates including Bab El Khadra, Bab El Bhar and Bab Jedid but some of the earlier ones have long disappeared.\n\n\n=== Places of worship ===\n\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslim mosques.   There are also Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tunis (Catholic Church), Protestant churches, Evangelical Churches.As in the rest of Tunisia, a very large majority of the population of Tunis (around 99%) is Sunni Muslim.  The capital is home to a large number of mosques in various architectural styles, signs of construction of their respective eras.  The main and oldest of them, is the Al-Zaytuna Mosque, founded in 698 and built in 732 and is in the heart of the Medina. Practicing the Maliki rite as the vast majority of Tunisia's Mosques. It was completely rebuilt in 864 and is a prestigious place of worship, and was long an important place of culture and knowledge with the University of Ez-Zitouna on the premises until the independence of Tunisia.  It still hosts the main ceremonies marking the dates on the Muslim calendar and is regularly attended by the president.\nThe medina contains most of the major mosques in the capital which were built before the advent of the French protectorate.  The mosque in the Kasbah, was founded in 1230.  Practicing the Hanafi rite since 1584, it is recognisable mainly by the dome as well as its minaret, similar to the Koutoubia in Marrakesh and is the highest in the city. Ksar Mosque, also of the Hanafi rite, is located in front of Dar Hussein (Bab Menara) and was built in the 12th century.  The Hammouda Pasha Mosque, built in 1655, is the second mosque built by the Hanafi rite in Tunis. Youssef Dey Mosque operated primarily as public speaking venue before becoming a real mosque in 1631. The Sidi Mahrez Mosque is the largest mosque Hanafi mosque in terms of area but not the tallest.  Built in 1692, it resembles the Ottoman S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul.  The Saheb Ettaba\u00e2 Mosque, built between 1808 and 1814 was the last mosque built by the Tunis Husseinites before the French occupation.The presence of modern churches in Tunis are also testimony to the French presence for half a century.  Tunis is the seat of the Diocese of Tunis, with the seat located at the Cathedral of St Vincent de Paul, The church was built in 1897 on the site of the old Christian cemetery of Saint-Antoine.  This includes a network of Catholic buildings, including the Church of St. Joan of Arc, but also with the Protestant Reformed Church and the Anglican church Saint-Georges.Greeks used to enjoy an important presence in the city since ancient times. Tunis is the headquarters of the Greek Orthodox Holy Archdiocese of Carthage with jurisdiction over Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia. It belongs to the Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa, and its cathedral, small school and other buildings are in Central Tunis.\nIn total, there are three Greek Orthodox and two Russian Orthodox parishes in Tunisia. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria also maintains jurisdiction in Tunisia.\nThe small Orthodox community is centred around the Greek Orthodox Church (1862), managed by the Greek Embassy and the Russian Orthodox Church (1957), reflecting the presence in Tunisia of a small colony of Russian immigrants.Judaism, meanwhile, enjoys a long tradition of presence in the city despite the emigration of a large part of the community after independence.  Among the places of worship are Beit Yaacouv Synagogue and especially the Great Synagogue of Tunis, built at the end of the 1940s to replace the former Great Synagogue which was demolished as part of the Jewish redevelopment area, the Hara.\n\n\n=== Parks and greenery ===\n\nTunis has some large parks, many of which were installed at the end of the 19th century by the authorities of the French protectorate. The largest Park, Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re Park, was founded in 1892 overlooks Lake Tunis. It is the oldest public park in the country and is built in the landscape style common to France.  The park covers an area of more than one hundred hectares across roads that can be explored on foot or by car. It is also home to Tunis Zoo, which houses African fauna, and the Museum of Modern Art.\nHabib Thameur garden in Tunis has a central pond and flower beds. The Gorjani garden, is an English garden located southwest of the city, which notably takes an irregular form, partly due to the steep topography of the land.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nLocated in an old beylical palace (the palace of the Bey of Tunis since the end of the 18th century), the Bardo National Museum (Tunis) is the most important archaeological museum in the Maghreb, and has one of the richest Roman mosaic collections in the world.  Its collections developed rapidly, thanks to numerous archaeological discoveries in the surrounding territory.\nIn 1964 the Dar Ben Abdallah, a palace probably dating back to the 18th century, became the seat of the capital's Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions.  In its exposition halls it holds numerous traditional items, witnesses of the everyday lives of families of the Medina quarter.\nThe Museum of the National Movement is situated in Dar Ma\u00e2kal Az-Za\u00efm, which was the residence of nationalist Habib Bourguiba for the entirety of the fight for independence.  After the advent of independence, a museum was built there to relate the details of the national struggle between 1938 and 1952.\nThe National Military Museum, opened in 1989 in the suburbs west of the city, holds a collection of 23,000 weapons, 13,000 of which date back to the 19th century, and some of which were used by the Tunisian troops during the Crimean War.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nTunis holds some of the most prestigious musical institutions in the country. The Rachidia was founded in 1934 to safeguard Arab music, and in particular to promote Tunisian and malouf music.  The group is made up of 22 members, both instrumental players and choral musicians.The Musical Troupe of the City of Tunis was created in 1954 by Salah El Mahdi. In 1955 he placed his student Mohamed Sa\u00e2da in charge of the ensemble, which at that time included the best artists, and later merged with the ensemble of Radio Tunis.  This group contributed to the rise to stardom of numerous Tunisian singers, including Oulaya.\nThe Association of Arab Orchestra of the City of Tunis began its activities at the end of April 1982, as a workshop linked to the cultural center of the city.  It worked on promoting Arab music, on music education and training, and on cooperation with various partners both in Tunisia and abroad.  The Tunisian Symphony Orchestra, created in 1969 by the Minister of Culture, has also produced monthly concerts at the Municipal Theater and in various cultural spaces in the city.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nTunis is a center of Tunisian culture. The Th\u00e9\u00e2tre municipal de Tunis, opened on 20 November 1902, showcases opera, ballet, symphonic concerts, drama, etc. On the stage of this theater, many performances are regularly given by Tunisian, Arabic and international actors. The National Theatre of Tunisia is an important public enterprise in Tunis, and since 1988 been located in the Khaznadar palace (dating from the middle of the 19th century and situated in the Halfaouine quarter), renamed \"Theater Palace.\" In 1993, it also took possession of the former movie theater Le Paris, with a 350-person seating capacity.  During each \"cultural season\" (from October 1 to 30 June) the theater holds over 80 events.  The Al Hamra theater was the second theater to be opened in Tunis, situated on El Jazira Road.  Al Hamra was one of the most famous theaters in the capital during the 1930s and 1940s.  After being closed for fifteen years, it was turned into a small theater in 1986, and since 2001 has housed the first Arab-African center for theater training and research.  One should also note the El Teatro and \u00c9toile du Nord theater groups.\nOther arts are also represented in the capital. The National Center of the Arts established the puppet theatre in 1976.  The National School of Circus Arts was founded following a meeting between the Director of the National Theater and the Director General of the National Center for Arts of Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne (France) in 1998. In addition, various small theatres and cultural centres are scattered throughout the city and display various artistic performances.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nFilm producers and cinema have long been present in the city of Tunis. The first animated film was shown in Tunis by the Lumiere brothers as early as 1896. The first screenings were held the following year and the first cinema, the Omnia Path\u00e9, opened in October 1908. The first film club opened in Tunis in 1946 and the Globe, in 1965. The Carthage Film Festival is the oldest established film festival in Africa, running biennially until 2014 and annually thereafter.\nIn 1990, Ferid Boughedir shot the notable film Halfaouine Child of the Terraces in Halfaouine district. The films The English Patient (1996) and The Last Days of Pompeii (2003) were also shot in studios in Tunis.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nThe city holds several festivals each year, of which the largest is the International Festival of Carthage which takes place in July and August. Founded in 1964, much of the festival is held in an old amphitheater of Carthage (with a capacity of 7,500 seats), and hosts the performances of singers, musicians, actors, dancers and films on display on outdoor screens.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nTunis and its suburbs have many of the major Tunisian universities including the University of Tunis, Tunisia Private University, University of Ez-Zitouna, the University of Tunis \u2013 El Manar, the University of Carthage and the Manouba University. It therefore has the highest concentration of students in Tunisia, with a student population of 75,597 as of 2006.\n\nThere are also a number of other post-secondary institutions, such as the National School of Engineers of Tunis, the National School of Science, the Graduate School of Communications of Tunis, and the Higher Institute of Technological Studies in Communications of Tunis. In addition, private training institutes include the Open University of Tunis, the Central University Private Business Administration and Technology, the Graduate School of Private Engineering and Technology, and the North African Institute of Economics and Technology.\nAmong the high schools in the capital, the best-known are the Lyc\u00e9e de la Rue du Pacha (founded 1900), Lyc\u00e9e Bab El Khadhra, Lyc\u00e9e de la Rue de Russie, Lyc\u00e9e Bourguiba (formerly Lyc\u00e9e Carnot de Tunis), and the Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui. Until independence, Sadiki College (founded 1875) and Khaldounia (founded 1896) were also among the most recognized. A legacy of the French presence in the country remains, and the city retains many French schools, the most important being the Lyc\u00e9e Pierre Mendes-France at Mutuelleville.\nStudents can pursue language studies at small private schools such as Sidi Bou Said Centre for Languages (Centre Sidi Bou Said de Langues et d'Informatique) in the picturesque Tunis suburb of Sidi Bou Said, next to the Sidi Bou Said TGM station that specializes in Arabic, offering classes in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), classical Arabic, Tunisian Arabic and the various dialects of North Africa, the Gulf and the Levant.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nTunis has some of the most important libraries in Tunisia including the National Library of Tunisia which was first installed in 1924 in the Medina, in a building built in 1810 by Hammouda Bey to serve as barracks for troops and then a jail.  The library moved to its current location on Boulevard 9 April in 1938. The new building contains a reading room, conference room, laboratories, an exhibition gallery, a block of technical and administrative services, a restaurant, a parking and green space areas.\nHoused in a former home of a Hafsid scholar, the library of the Khaldounia was founded in 1896 along with the creation of the educational institution. After independence and following the consolidation of programs of education, the association ceased operations but the library is now linked to the National Library, which provides for its management.Built in the 17th century, the Dar Ben Achour also contains a library. Acquired in the late 1970s by the municipality of Tunis, the house was restored in 1983 into a library.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nTunis is served by the Tunis-Carthage International Airport. The growing metropolitan area is served by an extensive network of public transportation including buses, an above-ground light rail system (le Metro), as well a regional train line (the TGM) that links the city centre to its closest northern suburbs. Multi-lane autoroutes surround the city and serve the increasing number of privately owned cars one encounters in Tunisia.\nThe Tunis area is served by the m\u00e9tro l\u00e9ger (Ar.: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0631\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0641\u064a\u0641 \u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633) and TGM (Tunis-Goulette-Marsa), as well as bus services, and is linked to other places in Tunisia by SNCFT, the national railways. The important transport authorities are the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Transports de Tunis (STT) and the Ministry of Transport (Airports)\n\nThe A1 motorway connects Tunis with Sfax to the south, and the A3 with Oued Zarga and B\u00e9ja to the west, while the A4 is the link with Bizerte.\nThe city has, as of the beginning of the 21st century, a public transportation system developed under the management of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des transports de Tunis (STT). In addition to some 200 bus routes, the first light rail line opened in 1985. The M\u00e9tro l\u00e9ger de Tunis network has extended gradually since then to reach the suburbs. The capital is also linked to its northern suburbs by the railway line that crosses the lake, dividing the lake into two.\nA new mass transit was planned for Greater Tunis in 2009. This was the RTS (rapid rail network), the local equivalent of the Paris RER, which was to carry tens of thousands of travellers from the distant suburbs of Tunis to the centre by using either existing tracks or new tracks yet to be built. The plan was for lines based on certain criteria such as population density and the lack of coverage for a given area. Among the priority lines were: Tunis-Borj C\u00e9dria (23 km) where modernization and electrification are already planned; Tunis-Mohamedia-Fouchana (19.4 km); Tunis-Manouba-Mnihla (19.2 km); Tunis-Ezzouhour-Sidi Hassine S\u00e9joumi (13.9 km). In addition, the TGM will be integrated into the light-rail network and a new line built around Ayn Zaghouan and Bhar Lazrag (8.4 km). Such an operation would require the upgrading of the docks' TGM stations so that they become suitable for light rail trains. Among other projects are a line to the city of Ennasr (8.4 km) and the extension of the Tunis-Ettadhamen to Mnihla (1.7 km). For its part, the south light-rail line was extended in November 2008 to El Mourouj with a length of 6.8 kilometres (4.2 miles). The total length of the network will eventually be in the range of 84 km (52 mi).\n\n\n=== Infrastructure ===\n\nTunis is served by Tunis-Carthage International Airport, located 8 kilometers (5.0 mi) northeast of downtown, which began operating in 1940 under the name of Tunis El Aouina.  The terminal had 4.4 million passengers (35.98% of total airport traffic in the country) in 2006.  In 2007 that increased to 6 million passengers with a rise in tourism to the city.\nAfter independence, in the 1960s, the National Board of Seaports, which supports all ports in the country, modernized the infrastructure of the port of Tunis.  In the 21st Century, the port of Tunis underwent further transformation with a marina as part of the redevelopment district of La Petite Sicile.\nTunis is the starting point from which the main roads and all highways that serve different parts of the country of Tunis originate.  This city has a high density of traffic because vehicle ownership is rising at 7.5% per year.  The capital is home to approximately 40% of the cars in Tunisia, with 700,000 cars on average used in the city per day.  In this context, major road infrastructure (bridges, interchanges, roads, etc..) was initiated in the late 1990s to decongest the main areas of the capital.  The main roads to other Tunisian cities include: Autoroute A1, Tunis-Sfax; Autoroute A3, Tunis-Oued Zarga; and Autoroute A4, Tunis-Bizerte. Also, as part of the major infrastructure project, the city's traffic lights were increased from 5,000 to 7,500.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, a number of sports institutions were established in Tunis, particularly in school and college settings. In 1905 the Muslim Association of Tunisia brought together students from Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui and Sadiki College to organize gymnastics. A regional gymnastics competition was held in Tunis in 1912 with the participation of thousands of French gymnasts. Football made its appearance in the capital on 15 September 1904, followed by the formal creation of the country's first league, the Racing Club Tunis, on 11 May 1905. It took some time to run properly but soon organized meetings between the teams in schools. The first took place on 9 June 1907, between teams from Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui and Lyc\u00e9e Carnot (1\u20131).\nBut football is not the only discipline to emerge. Between 1928 and 1955 the city hosted nine rounds of the Grand Prix of Tunis, where notable drivers such as Marcel Lehoux, Achille Varzi, Tazio Nuvolari and Rudolf Caracciola took part. The Grand Prix of Tunis has re-emerged since 2000. The city has also held the Mediterranean Games twice, in 1967 and 2001, and the international tennis tournament, the Tunis Open, which is included in the ATP Challenger Series. The 2005 World Championship final for men in team handball was played in Tunis.\nIn total the governorate of Tunis registered 24,095 licences for various clubs in the municipal area in 2007. The city further put itself onto the international basketball map as it hosted the FIBA Africa Championship 1965 and the FIBA Africa Championship 1987.\n\nThe Esperance Sportive de Tunis (EST), Club Africain (CA), and Stade Tunisien are the major sports clubs in the city. A symbolic class difference is present between the EST's and the CA's supporters, despite their playing at the same stadium. The EST is supported by the majority of the masses, while the CA, a poorer club, is supported by the others.\nThe first true sports facilities were managed under the French protectorate, as illustrated by the development of the Ksar Said racecourse and construction of the Stade Chedli Zouiten in the neighborhood of Belvedere, which had long been the main stadium in the capital before being supplanted by the Olympic stadium, Stade El Menzah, where EST and CA play their football today. The Olympic stadium and village area was built to accommodate the Mediterranean Games in 1967. A 60,000-seat stadium was also built in Rad\u00e8s for the Mediterranean Games in 2001 at an estimated cost of 170 million dinars, with nearly half of the loans financed by South Korean businessmen. The Olympic village was financed by an investment estimated at 50 million dinars.  In 2008, the government announced the start of construction of a large sports complex that will include several sports academies, a 20,000-seat stadium, and a swimming centre. Known as Tunis Sports City, it will expand around the lake of Tunis, on the road to La Marsa.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nTunis is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Other cooperations ===\n\n\n== Notable inhabitants ==\n\nIbn Khaldun (1332\u20131406), Arab sociologist and scholar\nTahar Haddad (1899\u20131935), promoter of women's emancipation in Tunisia\nAlbert Memmi (1920-2020), French writer and sociologist\nSalah El Mahdi (1925\u20132014), musicologist and composer\nAlberto Pellegrino (1930\u20131996), Italian fencer\nPhillip King (born 1934), British sculptor\nFouad Mebazaa (born 1933), politician, President of Tunisia in 2011\nNicola Pietrangeli (born 1933), Italian tennis player\nPierre Darmon (born 1934), French tennis player\nGeorges Wolinski (1934\u20132015), French illustrator and caricaturist\nRoberto Blanco (born 1937), German pop singer and actor\nYazid Zerhouni (born 1937), Algerian politician\nClaudia Cardinale (born 1938), Italian actress\nFatma Moalla (born 1939), mathematician\nMustapha Ben Jafar (born 1940), Tunisian politician\nAlain Boublil (born 1941), French musical author\nAbdelwahab Meddeb (1946\u20132014), Tunisian-French writer and radio staff\nSerge Adda (1948\u20132004), president of the French TV channel TV5\nSophie Bessis, (born 1947), Franco-Tunisian historian, journalist and researcher\nTarak Ben Ammar (born 1949), film producer\nBertrand Delano\u00eb (born 1950), mayor of Paris\nKarine Chemla (born 1958), historian of mathematics and sinologist\nAbdellatif Kechiche (born 1960), French film director, screenwriter and actor\nChokri El Ouaer (born 1966), Tunisian football goalkeeper\nAmel Karboul (born 1973), Tunisian entrepreneur, business consultant and politician\nMarc Gicquel (born 1977), French tennis player\nKhaled Mouelhi (born 1981), Tunisian footballer\nKarim Saidi (born 1983), Tunisian footballer\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBarbary pirates\nTunisian Community Center\nTunisian Italians\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nJellal Abdelkafi, La m\u00e9dina de Tunis, \u00e9d.

        "wiki": "Tunis (Arabic: \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633\u200e T\u016bnis) is the capital and largest city of Tunisia. The greater metropolitan area of Tunis, often referred to as \"Grand Tunis\", has about 2,700,000 inhabitants, making it the third-largest city in the Maghreb region (after Casablanca and Algiers) and the sixteenth-largest in the Arab world. \nSituated on a large Mediterranean Sea gulf (the Gulf of Tunis), behind the Lake of Tunis and the port of La Goulette (\u1e24alq il-W\u0101d), the city extends along the coastal plain and the hills that surround it. At its core lies its ancient medina, a World Heritage Site. East of the medina through the Sea Gate (also known as the Bab el Bhar and the Porte de France) begins the modern city, or Ville Nouvelle, traversed by the grand Avenue Habib Bourguiba (often referred to by popular press and travel guides as \"the Tunisian Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\"), where the colonial-era buildings provide a clear contrast to smaller, older structures. Further east by the sea lie the suburbs of Carthage, La Marsa, and Sidi Bou Said. As the capital city of the country, Tunis is the focus of Tunisian political and administrative life and also the centre of the country's commercial and cultural activities. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nTunis is the transcription of the Arabic name \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633 which can be pronounced as \"T\u016bnus\", \"T\u016bnas\", or \"T\u016bnis\". All three variations were mentioned by the Greek-Syrian geographer al-Rumi Yaqout in his Mu'jam al-B\u00fbldan (Dictionary of Countries).\nDifferent explanations exist for the origin of the name Tunis. Some scholars relate it to the Phoenician goddess Tanith ('Tanit or Tanut), as many ancient cities were named after patron deities. Some scholars claim that it originated from Tynes, which was mentioned by Diodorus Siculus and Polybius in the course of descriptions of a location resembling present-day Al-Kasbah; Tunis's old Berber Bourgade.Another possibility is that it was derived from the Berber verbal root ens which means \"to lie down\" or \"to pass the night\". The term Tunis can possibly mean \"camp at night\", \"camp\", or \"stop\", or may have referred to as \"the last stop before Carthage\" by people who were journeying to Carthage by land. There are also some mentions in ancient Roman sources of such names of nearby towns as Tuniza (now El Kala), Thunusuda (now Sidi-Meskin), Thinissut (now Bir Bouregba), and Thunisa (now Ras Jebel). As all of these Berber villages were situated on Roman roads, they undoubtedly served as rest-stations or stops.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Carthage ===\n\nThe historical study of Carthage is problematic. Because its culture and records were destroyed by the Romans at the end of the Third Punic War, very few Carthaginian primary historical sources survive. While there are a few ancient translations of Punic texts into Greek and Latin, as well as inscriptions on monuments and buildings discovered in Northwest Africa, the main sources are Greek and Roman historians, including Livy, Polybius, Appian, Cornelius Nepos, Silius Italicus, Plutarch, Dio Cassius, and Herodotus. These writers belonged to peoples in competition, and often in conflict, with Carthage. Greek cities contended with Carthage over Sicily, and the Romans fought three wars against Carthage. Not surprisingly, their accounts of Carthage are extremely hostile; while there are a few Greek authors who took a favourable view, these works have been lost.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nTunis was originally a Berber settlement. The existence of the town is attested by sources dating from the 4th century BC. Situated on a hill, Tunis served as an excellent point from which the comings and goings of naval and caravan traffic to and from Carthage could be observed. Tunis was one of the first towns in the region to fall under Carthaginian control, and in the centuries that followed Tunis was mentioned in the military histories associated with Carthage. Thus, during Agathocles' expedition, which landed at Cape Bon in 310 BC, Tunis changed hands on various occasions.During the Mercenary War, it is possible that Tunis served as a center for the native population of the area, and that its population was mainly composed of peasants, fishermen, and craftsmen. Compared to the ancient ruins of Carthage, the ruins of ancient Tunis are not as large. According to Strabo, it was destroyed by the Romans in 146 BC during the Third Punic War. Both Tunis and Carthage were destroyed; Tunis, however, was rebuilt first under the rule of Augustus and became an important town under Roman control and the center of a booming agricultural industry. The city is mentioned in the Tabula Peutingeriana as Thuni. In the system of Roman roads for the Roman province of Africa, Tunis had the title of mutatio (\"way station, resting place\"). Tunis, increasingly Romanized, was also eventually Christianized and became the seat of a bishop. However, Tunis remained modestly sized compared to Carthage during this time.\n\n\n=== Early Islamic period ===\n\nWhen the Arab Muslim troops conquered the region at the end of the 7th century, they established themselves at the outskirts of ancient Tunes, and the small town soon became the city of Tunis that could easily be taken for an Arab foundation. The medina of Tunis, the oldest section of the city, dates from this period, during which the region was conquered by the Umayyad emir Hasan ibn al-Nu'man al-Ghasani. The city had the natural advantage of coastal access, via the Mediterranean, to the major ports of southern Europe. Early on, Tunis played a military role; the Arabs recognized the strategic importance of its proximity to the Strait of Sicily. From the beginning of the 8th century Tunis was the chef-lieu of the area: it became the Arabs' naval base in the western Mediterranean Sea, and took on considerable military importance. Under the Aghlabids, the people of Tunis revolted numerous times, but the city benefited from economic improvements and quickly became the second most important in the kingdom. It was briefly the national capital, from the end of the reign of Ibrahim II in 902, until 909 when control over Ifriqiya was lost to the newly founded Fatimid Caliphate.\nLocal opposition to the authorities began to intensify in September 945, when Kharijite insurgents occupied Tunis, resulting in general pillaging. With the rise of the Zirid dynasty Tunis gained importance, but the Sunni population tolerated Shi'ite rule less and less, and carried out massacres against the Shi'ite community. In 1048 the Zirid ruler Al-Muizz ibn Badis rejected his city's obedience to the Fatimids and re-established Sunni rites throughout all of Ifriqiya. This decision infuriated the Shi'ite caliph Al-Mustansir Billah. To punish the Zirids, he unleashed the Banu Hilal Arab tribe on Ifriqiya; a large part of the country was set to the torch, the Zirid capital Kairouan was razed in 1057, and only a few coastal towns, including Tunis and Mahdia, escaped destruction. Exposed to violence from the hostile tribes that settled around the city, the population of Tunis repudiated the authority of the Zirids and swore allegiance to the Hammadid prince El Nacer ibn Alennas, who was based in B\u00e9ja\u00efa, in 1059. The governor appointed by B\u00e9ja\u00efa, having reestablished order in the country, did not hesitate to free himself from the Hammadids to found the Khurasanid dynasty with Tunis as its capital. This small independent kingdom picked up the threads of trade and commerce with other nations, and brought the region back to peace and prosperity.\n\n\n=== New capital of Tunisia ===\nIn 1159, the Almohad 'Abd al-Mu'min took Tunis, overthrew the last Khurasanid leader and installed a new government in the kasbah of Tunis. The Almohad conquest marked the beginning of the dominance of the city in Tunisia. Having previously played a minor role behind Kairouan and Mahdia, Tunis was promoted to the rank of provincial capital.\nIn 1228, Governor Abu Zakariya seized power and, a year later, took the title of Emir and founded the Hafsid dynasty. The city became the capital of a Hafsid kingdom stretching towards Tripoli and Fez. Walls were built to protect the emerging principal town of the kingdom, surrounding the medina, the kasbah and the new suburbs of Tunis. In 1270 the city was taken briefly by Louis IX of France, who was hoping to convert the Hafsid sovereign to Christianity. King Louis easily captured Carthage, but his army soon fell victim to an outbreak of dysentery. Louis himself died before the walls of the capital and the army was forced out.  At the same time, driven by the reconquest of Spain, the first Andalusian Muslims and Jews arrived in Tunis and would become of importance to the economic prosperity of the Hafsid capital and the development of its intellectual life.During the Almohad and Hafsid periods Tunis was one of the richest and grandest cities in the Islamic world, with a population of about 100,000.\nDuring this period, one of the famous travellers to Tunis was Ibn Battuta. In his travel account, when Ibn Battuta and his group arrived in Tunis, the population of the city came out to meet him and the other the members of his party. They all greeted them and were very curious, many were asking questions, however, no one in Tunis personally greeted Ibn Battuta, greatly upsetting him. He felt very lonely and could not hold back the tears coming from his eyes. This went on for a while until one of the pilgrims realized he was upset, he went up and greeted and talked to Ibn until he entered the city. At the time, the Sultan of Tunis was Abu Yahya and during Ibn Battuta's stay, the Festival of the Breaking of the Fast was taking place. The people in the city assembled in large numbers to celebrate the festival, in extravagant and most luxurious outfits. Abu Yahya arrived on horseback, where all of his relatives joined him. After the performance, the people returned to their homes.\n\n\n=== Spanish occupation and Ottoman control ===\n\nThe Ottoman Empire took nominal control of Tunis in 1534 when Hayreddin Barbarossa captured it from the Hafsid Sultan Mulai Hassan, who fled to the court of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. Charles, suffering losses from the corsairs operating out of Djerba, Tunis, and Algiers, agreed to reinstate Mulai Hassan in exchange for his acceptance of Spanish suzerainty. A naval expedition led by Charles himself was dispatched in 1535, and the city was recaptured. The victory against the corsairs is recorded in a tapestry at the Royal Palace of Madrid. The Spanish governor of La Goulette, Luys Peres Varga,  fortified the island of Chikly in the lake of Tunis to strengthen the city's defences between 1546 and 1550. \n\n \nThe Ottoman Ulu\u00e7 Ali Reis, at the head of an army of janissaries and Kabyles, retook Tunis in 1569. However, following the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the Spanish under John of Austria succeeded in retaking the city and re-establishing the Hafsid sovereign in October 1573. Following these conflicts, the city finally fell into Ottoman hands in August 1574. Having become an Ottoman province governed by a Pasha who was appointed by the Sultan based in Constantinople, the country attained a degree of autonomy. After 1591, the Ottoman governors (Beys) were relatively independent, and both piracy and trade continued to flourish. Under the rule of deys and Moorish beys, the capital sprang into new life. Its population grew by additions from various ethnicities, among which were Moorish refugees from Spain, and economic activities diversified. To traditional industry and trade with distant lands was added the activity of the Barbary pirates, then in their golden age. Profits obtained from the trade in Christian slaves allowed the rulers to build sumptuous structures that revived the architectural heritage of the Middle Ages.\n\nIn April 1655 the English admiral Robert Blake was sent to the Mediterranean to extract compensation from states that had been attacking English shipping. Only the Bey of Tunis refused to comply, with the result that Blake's fifteen ships attacked the Bey's arsenal at Porto Farina (Ghar el Melh), destroying nine Algerian ships and two shore batteries, the first time in naval warfare that shore batteries had been eliminated without landing men ashore.\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Tunisia entered into a new period in its history with the advent of the Husainid dynasty. Successive Husainid rulers made great progress in developing the city and its buildings. During this period, the city prospered as a centre of commerce. Taking advantage of divisions within the ruling house, Algerians captured Tunis in 1756 and put the country under supervision. Hammouda Bey faced bombardment by the Venetian fleet, and the city experienced a rebellion in 1811. Under the reign of Hussein Bey II, naval defeats by the British (1826) and French (1827) saw the French become increasingly active in the city and in the economy.Various sources estimate the 19th-century population to have ranged from 90,000 to 110,000 inhabitants. During the later 19th century, Tunis became increasingly populated by Europeans, particularly the French, and immigration dramatically increased the size of the city. This resulted in the first demolition of the old city walls, from 1860, to accommodate growth in the suburbs. The city spilled outside the area of the earlier town and the banks of the lake, and the new districts were modernised with running water (1860), lighting gas (1872), roads, waste collection (1873), and communication with adjacent suburbs and the city centre. The crafts and traditional trades declined somewhat, as the newcomers increased trade with Europe, introducing the first modern industries and new forms of urban life.\n\n\n=== Development under the French protectorate ===\n\nThe creation of the French protectorate in 1881 was a turning point in Tunis's history, leading to rapid redevelopment of the city in the span of two to three decades. The city quickly spread out of its fortifications: it divided into a traditional Arab-populated old city, and a new city populated by immigrants, with a different structure from that of the traditional medina. Tunis also benefited from French construction of a water supply, natural gas and electricity networks, public transport services and other public infrastructure.\nUnder French rule, a substantial number of Europeans settled (like the Tunisian Italians); half of the population was European in origin. The city expanded and created new boulevards and neighborhoods.\nTunis was quiet during the First World War. After the war, the city faced new transformations as the modern portion grew in importance and extended its network of boulevards and streets in all directions. In addition, a series of satellite cities emerged on the urban rim and encroached on the municipality of Tunis proper. In the economic sphere, commercial activities expanded and diversified as modern industries continued to grow, while traditional industry continued to decline.\nDuring World War II, Tunis was held by Axis forces from November 1942 to May 1943. It was their last base in Africa, as they retreated towards Sicily after being surrounded by Allied forces from Algeria to the west and from Libya to the east. \nOn 7 May 1943, at about 15:30 in the afternoon, Tunis fell to troops of British 1st Army and the U.S. 1st Army, which had defeated the German 5th Panzer Army guarding the city. At midday on 20 May 1943, the Allies held a victory parade on Avenue Mar\u00e9chal Galli\u00e9ni, and Avenue Jules Ferry, to signal the end of fighting in North Africa.Having succeeded in driving the Axis powers out of Tunisia, the Allies used Tunis as a base of operations from which to stage amphibious assaults first against the island of Pantelleria, and then Sicily, and finally the mainland of Italy.\n\n\n=== Growth since independence ===\n\nAfter independence in 1956, Tunis consolidated its role as the capital, first with the establishment of a constitution stating that the Chamber of Deputies and the Presidency of the Republic must have their headquarters in Tunis and its suburbs. In a very short time, the colonial city transformed rapidly. As the city has grown and native Tunisians gradually began to replace the extensive European population, conflict between the Arab city and the European city has gradually decreased with the arabization of the population.\nBecause of population pressure and the rate of migration to the capital, the city continued to grow, even with the creation of new districts in the suburbs. Old buildings have gradually been renovated and upgraded and new buildings have come to influence the urban landscape. At the same time, an active policy of industrialization is developing the municipal economy.\nThe Arab League was headquartered in Tunis from 1979 to 1990. The Arab League, which represents 22 Arab nations, transferred its headquarters to Tunis in 1979 because of Egypt's peace with Israel but has been headquartered back in Egypt since 1990.\nThe Palestine Liberation Organization also had its headquarters in Tunis, from 1982 to 2003.\nIn 1985, the PLO's headquarters was bombed by Israeli Air Force F-15s, killing approximately 60 people.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nMany protests took place during the Arab Spring of 2011\u201312.\nOn 18 March 2015, two gunmen attacked the Bardo National Museum and held hostages. Twenty civilians and one policeman were killed in the attack, while around 50 others were injured. Five Japanese, two Colombians, and visitors from Italy, Poland, and Spain were among the dead. Both gunmen were killed by Tunisian police. The incident has been treated as a terrorist attack.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTunis is located in north-eastern Tunisia on the Lake of Tunis, and is connected to the Mediterranean sea's Gulf of Tunis by a canal which terminates at the port of La Goulette/Halq al Wadi. The ancient city of Carthage is located just north of Tunis along the coastal part. The city lies on a similar latitude as the southernmost points of Europe.\nThe city of Tunis is built on a hill slope down to the lake of Tunis. These hills contain places such as Notre-Dame de Tunis, Ras Tabia, La Rabta, La Kasbah, Montfleury and La Manoubia with altitudes just above 50 metres (160 feet). The city is located at the crossroads of a narrow strip of land between Lake Tunis and S\u00e9joumi. The isthmus between them is what geologists call the \"Tunis dome\", which includes hills of limestone and sediments. It forms a natural bridge and since ancient times several major roads linking to Egypt and elsewhere in Tunisia have branched out from it. The roads also connect with Carthage, emphasising its political and economic importance not only in Tunisia but more widely in North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea in ancient times.\nThe Greater Tunis area has an area of 300,000 hectares, 30,000 of which is urbanized, the rest being shared between bodies of water (20,000 hectares of lakes or lagoons) and agricultural or natural land (250,000 hectares). However, urban growth, which is estimated to be increasing by 500 hectares per year, is gradually changing the landscape with urban sprawl.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Suburbs ===\nAfter World War II, suburbs began to rapidly spring up on the outskirts of Tunis. These form a large percentage of the population of the Tunis metropolitan area. It grew from 27% of the total population in 1956, to 37% in 1975 and 50% in 2006.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTunis has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa), characterized by hot and dry, prolonged summers and mild winters with moderate rainfall. The local climate is also affected somewhat by the latitude of the city, the moderating influence of the Mediterranean sea and the terrain of the hills.\nWinter is the wettest season of the year, when more than a third of the annual rainfall falls during this period, raining on average every two or three days.  The sun may still increase the temperature from 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F) in the morning to 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) in the afternoon on average during the winter. Frosts are rare.  In spring, rainfall declines by half.  The sunshine becomes dominant in May when it reaches 10 hours a day on average.  In March temperatures may vary between 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F) and 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), and between 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) and 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) in May. However, it is common for temperatures to soar even as early as April with record temperatures reaching 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F).  In summer, rain is almost completely absent and the sunlight is at a maximum.  The average temperatures in the summer months of June, July, August, and September are very high. Sea breezes may mitigate the heat, but sometimes the sirocco winds reverse the trend.  In autumn, it begins to rain, often with short thunderstorms, which can sometimes cause flash floods or even flood some parts of the city.  The month of November marks a break in the general heat with average temperatures ranging from 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) to 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Capital ===\n\nTunis has been the capital of Tunisia since 1159. Under Articles 43 and 24 of the Constitution of 1959, Tunis and its suburbs host the national institutions: the Presidential Palace, which is known as Carthage Palace, residence of the President of Tunisia, the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Advisors and parliament, the Constitutional Council and the main judicial institutions  and public bodies. The revised Tunisian Constitution of 2014 similarly provides that the National Assembly is to sit in Tunis (article 51) and that the Presidency is based there (article 73).\n\n\n=== Municipality ===\n\n\n==== Institutions ====\n\nFollowing the municipal elections of 6 May 2018, Ennahdha obtained 21 seats out of 60. Nidaa Tounes came second with 17 seats. On 3 July 2018, the head of the Ennahdha list Souad Abderrahim was elected by the council as the new mayor of the capital.\nBefore 2011, unlike other mayors in Tunisia, the mayor of Tunis is appointed by decree of the President of the Republic from among the members of the City Council.\n\n\n==== Budget ====\nThe 2008 budget adopted by the City Council is structured as follows: 61.61 million dinars for operations and 32,516 million dinars for investment. It reflects the improved financial situation of the municipality, the year 2007 was a year registering a surplus in resources that allowed the settlement of debts of the municipality and the strengthening of its credibility with respect its suppliers and public and private partners.\nRevenues are generated by the proceeds of taxes on buildings and vacant lots, fees for the rental of municipal property, income from the operation of the public, advertising, and that the fact that the municipality has capital shares in some companies. On the expenditure side, provision is made for the consolidation of hygiene and cleanliness, the state of the environment and urban design, infrastructure maintenance, rehabilitation and renovation of facilities, and strengthening the logistics and means of work and transport.\n\n\n==== Administrative divisions ====\n\nThe city of Tunis, whose size has increased significantly during the second half of the 20th century, now extends beyond the Tunis Governorate into parts of the governorates of Ben Arous, Ariana and Manouba.\nThe municipality of Tunis is divided into 15 municipal districts:  These include El Bab Bhar, Bab Souika, Cit\u00e9 El Khadra, Jelloud Jebel El Kabaria, El Menzah, El Ouardia, Ettahrir, Ezzouhour, Hra\u00efria, Medina, El Omrane, El Omrane Higher S\u00e9joumi, Sidi El-Bashir and Sidi Hassine.\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nIn the years following independence, the population of the metropolitan area continued to grow: by 21.1% from 1956 to 1966 and by 28.5% from 1966 to 1975 (55.6% between 1956 and 1975). This steady growth was accompanied by changes which affected the nature of the settlement of the capital. Decolonization led to the exodus of some European minorities whose numbers dwindled every year. The gaps created by their departure were filled by Tunisians who emigrated to Tunis from other parts of the country.\nThe population of the city of Tunis exceeds 2,000,000 inhabitants. After independence, the Tunisian government implemented a plan to cope with population growth of the city and country, a system of family planning, to attempt to lower the rate of population growth. However, between 1994 and 2004, the population of the governorate of Tunis grew more than 1.03% per annum. It represents, in the 2004 census, 9.9% of the total population of Tunisia. As in the rest of Tunisia, literacy in the region of Tunis evolved rapidly during the second half of the 20th century and has reached a level slightly higher than the national average. The education level is only exceeded by the neighbouring governorate of Ariana which has many institutions of education.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nProducts include textiles, carpets, and olive oil. Tourism also provides a significant portion of the city's income.\nBecause of the concentration of political authority (headquarters of the central government, presidency, parliament, ministries and central government) and culture (festivals and mainstream media), Tunis is the only nationally ranking metropolis. Tunis is the heartland of the Tunisian economy and is the industrial and economic hub of the country, home to one third of Tunisian companies\u2014including almost all the head offices of companies with more than fifty employees, with the exception of the Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa, headquartered in Gafsa\u2014and produces a third of the national gross domestic product.  Tunis attracts foreign investors (33% of companies, 26% of investments and 27% of employment), excluding several areas due to economic imbalances. According to the Mercer 2017 Cost of Living Rankings, Tunis has the lowest cost of living for expatriates in the world. The urban unemployment rate of university graduates is increasing and the illiteracy rate remains high among the elderly (27% of women and 12% of men). The number of people living below the poverty line, falling at the national level, remains higher in urban areas. In addition, unemployment is high in young people aged 18 to 24, with one in three unemployed as compared to one in six at the national level. In Greater Tunis, the proportion of young unemployed is at 35%.Gulf finance house or GFH has invested $10 billion in order for the construction of tunis financial harbor, that will transform Tunisia as the gateway to Africa from Europe. The project hopes to boost the economy of Tunisia as well as increase the number of tourists visiting Tunisia annually. The project is going through planning.\n\n\n=== Sectors ===\nThe economic structure of Tunis, as well as that of the country, is overwhelmingly tertiary industry.  The city is the largest financial center in the country hosting the headquarters of 65% of financial companies \u2013 while the industrial sectors are gradually declining in importance.  However the secondary industry is still very represented and Tunis hosts 85% of industrial establishments in the four governorates, with a trend towards the spread of specialized industrial zones in the suburbs.\nPrimary industry such as agriculture, however, is active in specialized agricultural areas on the suburbs, particularly in the wine and olive oil industries. The generally flat terrain and the two main rivers in Tunisia, the Medjerda to the north and the Milian to the south, the soils are fertile.  Tunis has several large plains, the most productive are in Ariana and La Soukra (north), the plain of Manouba (west) and the plain of Mornag (south).  In addition, groundwater is easily accessible through the drilling of deep wells, providing water for the different agriculture crops. The soils are heavy and contain limestone in the north but are lighter and sandy containing clay in the south.  There is much diversification in the municipality of Tunis, with Durum grown in Manouba, Olives and olive oil in Ariana and Mornag, wine (Mornag), and fruit, vegetable and legumes are grown in all regions.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Architecture and landscape ==\n\n\n=== Urban landscape ===\n\nThe Medina, built on a gentle hill slope on the way down to the Lake of Tunis, is the historical heart of the city and home to many monuments, including palaces, such as the Dar Ben Abdallah and Dar Hussein, the mausoleum of Tourbet el Bey or many mosques such as the Al-Zaytuna Mosque. Some of the fortifications around it have now largely disappeared, and it is flanked by the two suburbs of Bab Souika to the north and Bab El Jazira to the south. Located near the Bab Souika, the neighborhood of Halfaouine which gained international attention through the film 'Halfaouine Child of the Terraces'.\nBut east of the original nucleus, first with the construction of the French Consulate, the modern city was built gradually with the introduction of the French protectorate at the end of the 19th century, on open land between the city and the lake. The axis to the structure of this part of the city is the Avenue Habib Bourguiba, designed by the French to be a Tunisian form of Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris with its cafes, major hotels, shops and cultural venues. On both sides of the tree lines avenue, north and south, the city was extended in various districts, with the northern end welcoming residential and business districts while the south receives industrial districts and poorer peoples.\nSouth-east of the Avenue Bourguiba the district of La Petite Sicile (Little Sicily) is adjacent to the old port area and takes its name from its original population of workers from Italy. It is now the subject of a redevelopment project including the construction of twin towers. North of the Avenue Bourguiba is the district of La Fayette, which is still home to the Great Synagogue of Tunis and the Habib Thameur Gardens, built on the site of an ancient Jewish cemetery which lay outside the walls. Also to the north is the long Avenue Mohamed V, which leads to the Boulevard of 7 November through the neighborhood of the big banks where there are hotels and Abu Nawas Lake and finally to the Belvedere area around the place Pasteur. This is where the Belvedere Park lies, the largest in the city, and home to a zoo and the Pasteur Institute founded by Adrien Loir in 1893. Continuing to the north are the most exclusive neighborhoods of Mutuelleville which house the French Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-Mend\u00e8s-France, the Sheraton Hotel and some embassies.\nStill further north of the Belvedere Park, behind the Boulevard of 7 November are the neighborhoods of El Menzah and El Manar now reaching the peaks of the hills overlooking the north of the town. They support a range of residential and commercial buildings. To the west of the park lies the district of El Omrane which holds the main Muslim cemetery in the capital and the warehouses of public transport.  Heading east is the Tunis-Carthage International Airport and the neighborhoods of Borgel, giving his name to the existing Jewish and Christian cemeteries in the capital, and the neighbourhood of Montplaisir. Beyond that, several kilometers north-east, on the road to La Marsa,  the Berges du Lac was built on land reclaimed from the north shore of the lake near the airport, which has holds offices of Tunisian and foreign companies, many embassies as well as shops.\nSouthwest of the Medina, on the crest of the hills across the Isthmus of Tunis, is the Montfleury district then on down to the foothills of S\u00e9joumi, the poor neighborhood of Mellassine. Northwest of the latter, north of the National Route 3 leading to the west, is the city of Ezzouhour (formerly El Kharrouba), which spans more than three metres (9.8 feet) and is divided into five sections. It is still surrounded with farmland and vegetables are grown which supply many of the souks in the region.\nThe south of Tunis is made up of disadvantaged neighborhoods, especially due to the strong industry in this part of the metropolis. These include Jebel Jelloud, located in the south-east of Tunis, which concentrates on the heavy industry of cement production, the treatment plant of phosphate s, etc. The main cemetery in Tunis, the Djellaz Cemetery, dominates this part of town, perched on the slopes of a rocky outcrop.\n\n\n=== M\u00e9dina ===\n\nThe medina of Tunis has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979. The Medina contains some 700 monuments, including palaces, mosques, mausoleums, madrasas and fountains dating from the Almohad and the Hafsid periods. These ancient buildings include:\n\nThe Aghlabid Al-Zaytouna Mosque (\"Mosque of the Olive\") built in 723 by Ubayd Allah ibn al-Habhab to celebrate the new capital.\nThe Dar El Bey, or Bey's Palace, comprises architecture and decoration from many different styles and periods and is believed to stand on the remains of a Roman theatre as well as the 10th-century palace of Ziadib-Allah II al Aghlab.With an area of 270 hectares (over 29 hectares for the Kasbah)  and more than 100,000 people, the Medina comprises one-tenth of the population of Tunis. The planning of the Medina of Tunis has the distinction of not grid lines or formal geometric compositions. However, studies were undertaken in the 1930s with the arrival of the first anthropologists who found that the space of the Medina is not random: the houses are based on a socio-cultural code according to the types of complex human relations.\nDomestic architecture (palaces and townhouses), official and civilian (libraries and administrations), religious (mosques and zaou\u00efas) and services (commercial and fondouks) are located in the Medina. The notion of public space is ambiguous in the case of Medina where the streets are seen as an extension of the houses and subject to social tags. The concept of ownership is low however and souks often spill out onto public roads. Today, each district has its culture and rivalries can be strong.\nThe northern end supports the football club of Esperance Sportive de Tunis while at the other end is the rival Club Africain. The Medina also has a social sectorization: with the neighborhood of Tourbet el Bey and the Kasbah district being aristocratic, with a population of judges and politicians, while the streets of Pacha often being military and bourgeois.\nFounded in 698 is the Al-Zaytuna Mosque and the surrounding area which developed throughout the Middle Ages,  dividing Tunis into a main town in two suburbs, in the north (Bab Souika) and the south (Bab El Jazira). The area became the capital of a powerful kingdom during the Hafsid era, and was considered a religious and intellectual home and economic center for the Middle East, Africa and Europe. A great fusion of influences can be seen blending Andalusian styles with eastern influences, and Roman or Byzantine columns, and typical Arab architecture, characterized by the archways.\nThe architectural heritage is also omnipresent in the homes of individuals and small palace officials as well as in the palace of the sovereign of Kasbah. Although some palaces and houses date back to the Middle Ages, a greater number of prestigious houses were built in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries such as Dar Othman (early 17th century), Dar Ben Abdallah (18th century), Dar Hussein, Dar Cherif and other houses. The main palace beys are those of La Marsa, Bardo and Ksar Said. If we add the mosques and oratories (about 200), the madrasahs (El Bachia, Slimania, El Achouria, Bir El Ahjar, Ennakhla, etc..), The zaouias (Mahrez Sidi Sidi Ali Azouz, Sidi Abdel Kader, etc.) and Tourbet El Fellari, Tourbet Aziza Othman and Tourbet El Bey the number of monuments in Tunis approaches 600. Unlike Algiers, Palermo and Naples, its historical heart has never suffered from major natural disasters or urban radical interventions. The main conflicts and potentially destructive human behavior has been experienced in the city occurred relatively recently following the country's independence which it why it made into a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. At the beginning of the 21st century, the Medina is one of the best preserved urban locations in the Arab world.Furthermore, along the boulevards, the contribution of the architectural period 1850\u20131950 can be felt in the buildings, such as the government buildings of the nine ministries and the headquarters of the municipality of Tunis.\n\n\n=== Other landmarks ===\nThe Bardo Museum was originally a 13th-century Hafsid palace, located in the (then) suburbs of Tunis. It contains a major collection of Roman empires and other antiquities of interest from Ancient Greece, Tunisia, and from the Arab period.\nThe ruins of Carthage are nearby, along the coast to the northeast, with many ancient ruins.\n\n\n==== Souks ====\n\nThe souks are a network of covered streets lined with shops and traders and artisans ordered by specialty.  Clothing merchants, perfumers, fruit sellers, booksellers and wool merchants have goods at the souks, while fishmongers, blacksmiths and potters tend to be relegated to the periphery of the markets.\n\nNorth of the Al-Zaytuna Mosque is the Souk El Attarine, built in the early 18th century. It is known for its essences and perfumes. From this souk, there is a street leading to the Souk Ech-Chaouachine (chachia). The main company that operates it is one of the oldest in the country and they are generally descendants of Andalusian immigrants expelled from Spain. Attached to El Attarine are two other souks: the first, which runs along the western coast of the Al-Zaytuna Mosque, is the Souk El Kmach which is noted for its fabrics, and the second, the Souk El Berka, which was built in the 17th century and houses embroiderers and jewelers. Given the valuable items it sells, it is the only souk whose doors are closed and guarded during the night. In the middle there is a square where the former slave market stood until the middle of the 19th century.\nSouk El Berka leads to Souk El Leffa, a souk that sells all kinds of carpets, blankets and other weavings, and extends with the Souk Es Sarragine, built in the early 18th century and specializing in leather. At the periphery are the souks Et Trouk, El Blat, El Blaghgia, El K\u00e9babgia, En Nhas (copper), Es Sabbaghine (dyeing) and El Grana that sell clothing and blankets and was occupied by Jewish merchants.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Walls and gates ====\n\nFrom the early days of its founding, Tunis has been considered an important military base. The Arab geographer El Yacoubi has written that in the 9th century Tunis was surrounded by a wall of brick and clay except the side of the sea where it was stone.  Bab El-Jazeera, perhaps the oldest gate of the south wall, opened onto the southern road. Bab Cartagena gave access to Carthage, important for bringing in construction materials needed for the city. Bab Souika (initially known as Bab El Saqqayin) had a strategic role to keep the roads to Bizerte, B\u00e9ja and Le Kef. Bab Menara (initially known as Bab El Artha) opened onto the medina and on the suburb of El Haoua. As for El Bab Bhar, it allowed access to some funduqs where Christian merchants lived in Tunis.\nWith the development of the capital under the reign of the Hafsids, two emerging suburbs grew outside the walls; Bab El Jazira in the south and Bab Souika to the north. In the early 14th century, Hafsid Darba Ab\u00fb al-Muhammad al-Mustansir Lihy\u00e2n\u00ee ordered the construction of a second chamber including the Medina and two suburbs outside. Six new gates were built including Bab El Khadra, Bab Saadoun, Bab El Allouj (initially called Bab Er-Rehiba), Khalid or Bab Bab Sidi Abdallah Cherif, Bab El Fellah and Bab Alioua. In the Ottoman period, four new gates were established: Bab Laassal, Bab Sidi Abdesselam, Bab El Bab Gorjani and Sidi Kacem. The city retains some of these gates including Bab El Khadra, Bab El Bhar and Bab Jedid but some of the earlier ones have long disappeared.\n\n\n=== Places of worship ===\n\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslim mosques.   There are also Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tunis (Catholic Church), Protestant churches, Evangelical Churches.As in the rest of Tunisia, a very large majority of the population of Tunis (around 99%) is Sunni Muslim.  The capital is home to a large number of mosques in various architectural styles, signs of construction of their respective eras.  The main and oldest of them, is the Al-Zaytuna Mosque, founded in 698 and built in 732 and is in the heart of the Medina. Practicing the Maliki rite as the vast majority of Tunisia's Mosques. It was completely rebuilt in 864 and is a prestigious place of worship, and was long an important place of culture and knowledge with the University of Ez-Zitouna on the premises until the independence of Tunisia.  It still hosts the main ceremonies marking the dates on the Muslim calendar and is regularly attended by the president.\nThe medina contains most of the major mosques in the capital which were built before the advent of the French protectorate.  The mosque in the Kasbah, was founded in 1230.  Practicing the Hanafi rite since 1584, it is recognisable mainly by the dome as well as its minaret, similar to the Koutoubia in Marrakesh and is the highest in the city. Ksar Mosque, also of the Hanafi rite, is located in front of Dar Hussein (Bab Menara) and was built in the 12th century.  The Hammouda Pasha Mosque, built in 1655, is the second mosque built by the Hanafi rite in Tunis. Youssef Dey Mosque operated primarily as public speaking venue before becoming a real mosque in 1631. The Sidi Mahrez Mosque is the largest mosque Hanafi mosque in terms of area but not the tallest.  Built in 1692, it resembles the Ottoman S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul.  The Saheb Ettaba\u00e2 Mosque, built between 1808 and 1814 was the last mosque built by the Tunis Husseinites before the French occupation.The presence of modern churches in Tunis are also testimony to the French presence for half a century.  Tunis is the seat of the Diocese of Tunis, with the seat located at the Cathedral of St Vincent de Paul, The church was built in 1897 on the site of the old Christian cemetery of Saint-Antoine.  This includes a network of Catholic buildings, including the Church of St. Joan of Arc, but also with the Protestant Reformed Church and the Anglican church Saint-Georges.Greeks used to enjoy an important presence in the city since ancient times. Tunis is the headquarters of the Greek Orthodox Holy Archdiocese of Carthage with jurisdiction over Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia. It belongs to the Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa, and its cathedral, small school and other buildings are in Central Tunis.\nIn total, there are three Greek Orthodox and two Russian Orthodox parishes in Tunisia. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria also maintains jurisdiction in Tunisia.\nThe small Orthodox community is centred around the Greek Orthodox Church (1862), managed by the Greek Embassy and the Russian Orthodox Church (1957), reflecting the presence in Tunisia of a small colony of Russian immigrants.Judaism, meanwhile, enjoys a long tradition of presence in the city despite the emigration of a large part of the community after independence.  Among the places of worship are Beit Yaacouv Synagogue and especially the Great Synagogue of Tunis, built at the end of the 1940s to replace the former Great Synagogue which was demolished as part of the Jewish redevelopment area, the Hara.\n\n\n=== Parks and greenery ===\n\nTunis has some large parks, many of which were installed at the end of the 19th century by the authorities of the French protectorate. The largest Park, Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re Park, was founded in 1892 overlooks Lake Tunis. It is the oldest public park in the country and is built in the landscape style common to France.  The park covers an area of more than one hundred hectares across roads that can be explored on foot or by car. It is also home to Tunis Zoo, which houses African fauna, and the Museum of Modern Art.\nHabib Thameur garden in Tunis has a central pond and flower beds. The Gorjani garden, is an English garden located southwest of the city, which notably takes an irregular form, partly due to the steep topography of the land.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nLocated in an old beylical palace (the palace of the Bey of Tunis since the end of the 18th century), the Bardo National Museum (Tunis) is the most important archaeological museum in the Maghreb, and has one of the richest Roman mosaic collections in the world.  Its collections developed rapidly, thanks to numerous archaeological discoveries in the surrounding territory.\nIn 1964 the Dar Ben Abdallah, a palace probably dating back to the 18th century, became the seat of the capital's Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions.  In its exposition halls it holds numerous traditional items, witnesses of the everyday lives of families of the Medina quarter.\nThe Museum of the National Movement is situated in Dar Ma\u00e2kal Az-Za\u00efm, which was the residence of nationalist Habib Bourguiba for the entirety of the fight for independence.  After the advent of independence, a museum was built there to relate the details of the national struggle between 1938 and 1952.\nThe National Military Museum, opened in 1989 in the suburbs west of the city, holds a collection of 23,000 weapons, 13,000 of which date back to the 19th century, and some of which were used by the Tunisian troops during the Crimean War.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nTunis holds some of the most prestigious musical institutions in the country. The Rachidia was founded in 1934 to safeguard Arab music, and in particular to promote Tunisian and malouf music.  The group is made up of 22 members, both instrumental players and choral musicians.The Musical Troupe of the City of Tunis was created in 1954 by Salah El Mahdi. In 1955 he placed his student Mohamed Sa\u00e2da in charge of the ensemble, which at that time included the best artists, and later merged with the ensemble of Radio Tunis.  This group contributed to the rise to stardom of numerous Tunisian singers, including Oulaya.\nThe Association of Arab Orchestra of the City of Tunis began its activities at the end of April 1982, as a workshop linked to the cultural center of the city.  It worked on promoting Arab music, on music education and training, and on cooperation with various partners both in Tunisia and abroad.  The Tunisian Symphony Orchestra, created in 1969 by the Minister of Culture, has also produced monthly concerts at the Municipal Theater and in various cultural spaces in the city.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nTunis is a center of Tunisian culture. The Th\u00e9\u00e2tre municipal de Tunis, opened on 20 November 1902, showcases opera, ballet, symphonic concerts, drama, etc. On the stage of this theater, many performances are regularly given by Tunisian, Arabic and international actors. The National Theatre of Tunisia is an important public enterprise in Tunis, and since 1988 been located in the Khaznadar palace (dating from the middle of the 19th century and situated in the Halfaouine quarter), renamed \"Theater Palace.\" In 1993, it also took possession of the former movie theater Le Paris, with a 350-person seating capacity.  During each \"cultural season\" (from October 1 to 30 June) the theater holds over 80 events.  The Al Hamra theater was the second theater to be opened in Tunis, situated on El Jazira Road.  Al Hamra was one of the most famous theaters in the capital during the 1930s and 1940s.  After being closed for fifteen years, it was turned into a small theater in 1986, and since 2001 has housed the first Arab-African center for theater training and research.  One should also note the El Teatro and \u00c9toile du Nord theater groups.\nOther arts are also represented in the capital. The National Center of the Arts established the puppet theatre in 1976.  The National School of Circus Arts was founded following a meeting between the Director of the National Theater and the Director General of the National Center for Arts of Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne (France) in 1998. In addition, various small theatres and cultural centres are scattered throughout the city and display various artistic performances.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nFilm producers and cinema have long been present in the city of Tunis. The first animated film was shown in Tunis by the Lumiere brothers as early as 1896. The first screenings were held the following year and the first cinema, the Omnia Path\u00e9, opened in October 1908. The first film club opened in Tunis in 1946 and the Globe, in 1965. The Carthage Film Festival is the oldest established film festival in Africa, running biennially until 2014 and annually thereafter.\nIn 1990, Ferid Boughedir shot the notable film Halfaouine Child of the Terraces in Halfaouine district. The films The English Patient (1996) and The Last Days of Pompeii (2003) were also shot in studios in Tunis.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nThe city holds several festivals each year, of which the largest is the International Festival of Carthage which takes place in July and August. Founded in 1964, much of the festival is held in an old amphitheater of Carthage (with a capacity of 7,500 seats), and hosts the performances of singers, musicians, actors, dancers and films on display on outdoor screens.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nTunis and its suburbs have many of the major Tunisian universities including the University of Tunis, Tunisia Private University, University of Ez-Zitouna, the University of Tunis \u2013 El Manar, the University of Carthage and the Manouba University. It therefore has the highest concentration of students in Tunisia, with a student population of 75,597 as of 2006.\n\nThere are also a number of other post-secondary institutions, such as the National School of Engineers of Tunis, the National School of Science, the Graduate School of Communications of Tunis, and the Higher Institute of Technological Studies in Communications of Tunis. In addition, private training institutes include the Open University of Tunis, the Central University Private Business Administration and Technology, the Graduate School of Private Engineering and Technology, and the North African Institute of Economics and Technology.\nAmong the high schools in the capital, the best-known are the Lyc\u00e9e de la Rue du Pacha (founded 1900), Lyc\u00e9e Bab El Khadhra, Lyc\u00e9e de la Rue de Russie, Lyc\u00e9e Bourguiba (formerly Lyc\u00e9e Carnot de Tunis), and the Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui. Until independence, Sadiki College (founded 1875) and Khaldounia (founded 1896) were also among the most recognized. A legacy of the French presence in the country remains, and the city retains many French schools, the most important being the Lyc\u00e9e Pierre Mendes-France at Mutuelleville.\nStudents can pursue language studies at small private schools such as Sidi Bou Said Centre for Languages (Centre Sidi Bou Said de Langues et d'Informatique) in the picturesque Tunis suburb of Sidi Bou Said, next to the Sidi Bou Said TGM station that specializes in Arabic, offering classes in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), classical Arabic, Tunisian Arabic and the various dialects of North Africa, the Gulf and the Levant.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nTunis has some of the most important libraries in Tunisia including the National Library of Tunisia which was first installed in 1924 in the Medina, in a building built in 1810 by Hammouda Bey to serve as barracks for troops and then a jail.  The library moved to its current location on Boulevard 9 April in 1938. The new building contains a reading room, conference room, laboratories, an exhibition gallery, a block of technical and administrative services, a restaurant, a parking and green space areas.\nHoused in a former home of a Hafsid scholar, the library of the Khaldounia was founded in 1896 along with the creation of the educational institution. After independence and following the consolidation of programs of education, the association ceased operations but the library is now linked to the National Library, which provides for its management.Built in the 17th century, the Dar Ben Achour also contains a library. Acquired in the late 1970s by the municipality of Tunis, the house was restored in 1983 into a library.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nTunis is served by the Tunis-Carthage International Airport. The growing metropolitan area is served by an extensive network of public transportation including buses, an above-ground light rail system (le Metro), as well a regional train line (the TGM) that links the city centre to its closest northern suburbs. Multi-lane autoroutes surround the city and serve the increasing number of privately owned cars one encounters in Tunisia.\nThe Tunis area is served by the m\u00e9tro l\u00e9ger (Ar.: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0631\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0641\u064a\u0641 \u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633) and TGM (Tunis-Goulette-Marsa), as well as bus services, and is linked to other places in Tunisia by SNCFT, the national railways. The important transport authorities are the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Transports de Tunis (STT) and the Ministry of Transport (Airports)\n\nThe A1 motorway connects Tunis with Sfax to the south, and the A3 with Oued Zarga and B\u00e9ja to the west, while the A4 is the link with Bizerte.\nThe city has, as of the beginning of the 21st century, a public transportation system developed under the management of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des transports de Tunis (STT). In addition to some 200 bus routes, the first light rail line opened in 1985. The M\u00e9tro l\u00e9ger de Tunis network has extended gradually since then to reach the suburbs. The capital is also linked to its northern suburbs by the railway line that crosses the lake, dividing the lake into two.\nA new mass transit was planned for Greater Tunis in 2009. This was the RTS (rapid rail network), the local equivalent of the Paris RER, which was to carry tens of thousands of travellers from the distant suburbs of Tunis to the centre by using either existing tracks or new tracks yet to be built. The plan was for lines based on certain criteria such as population density and the lack of coverage for a given area. Among the priority lines were: Tunis-Borj C\u00e9dria (23 km) where modernization and electrification are already planned; Tunis-Mohamedia-Fouchana (19.4 km); Tunis-Manouba-Mnihla (19.2 km); Tunis-Ezzouhour-Sidi Hassine S\u00e9joumi (13.9 km). In addition, the TGM will be integrated into the light-rail network and a new line built around Ayn Zaghouan and Bhar Lazrag (8.4 km). Such an operation would require the upgrading of the docks' TGM stations so that they become suitable for light rail trains. Among other projects are a line to the city of Ennasr (8.4 km) and the extension of the Tunis-Ettadhamen to Mnihla (1.7 km). For its part, the south light-rail line was extended in November 2008 to El Mourouj with a length of 6.8 kilometres (4.2 miles). The total length of the network will eventually be in the range of 84 km (52 mi).\n\n\n=== Infrastructure ===\n\nTunis is served by Tunis-Carthage International Airport, located 8 kilometers (5.0 mi) northeast of downtown, which began operating in 1940 under the name of Tunis El Aouina.  The terminal had 4.4 million passengers (35.98% of total airport traffic in the country) in 2006.  In 2007 that increased to 6 million passengers with a rise in tourism to the city.\nAfter independence, in the 1960s, the National Board of Seaports, which supports all ports in the country, modernized the infrastructure of the port of Tunis.  In the 21st Century, the port of Tunis underwent further transformation with a marina as part of the redevelopment district of La Petite Sicile.\nTunis is the starting point from which the main roads and all highways that serve different parts of the country of Tunis originate.  This city has a high density of traffic because vehicle ownership is rising at 7.5% per year.  The capital is home to approximately 40% of the cars in Tunisia, with 700,000 cars on average used in the city per day.  In this context, major road infrastructure (bridges, interchanges, roads, etc..) was initiated in the late 1990s to decongest the main areas of the capital.  The main roads to other Tunisian cities include: Autoroute A1, Tunis-Sfax; Autoroute A3, Tunis-Oued Zarga; and Autoroute A4, Tunis-Bizerte. Also, as part of the major infrastructure project, the city's traffic lights were increased from 5,000 to 7,500.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, a number of sports institutions were established in Tunis, particularly in school and college settings. In 1905 the Muslim Association of Tunisia brought together students from Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui and Sadiki College to organize gymnastics. A regional gymnastics competition was held in Tunis in 1912 with the participation of thousands of French gymnasts. Football made its appearance in the capital on 15 September 1904, followed by the formal creation of the country's first league, the Racing Club Tunis, on 11 May 1905. It took some time to run properly but soon organized meetings between the teams in schools. The first took place on 9 June 1907, between teams from Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui and Lyc\u00e9e Carnot (1\u20131).\nBut football is not the only discipline to emerge. Between 1928 and 1955 the city hosted nine rounds of the Grand Prix of Tunis, where notable drivers such as Marcel Lehoux, Achille Varzi, Tazio Nuvolari and Rudolf Caracciola took part. The Grand Prix of Tunis has re-emerged since 2000. The city has also held the Mediterranean Games twice, in 1967 and 2001, and the international tennis tournament, the Tunis Open, which is included in the ATP Challenger Series. The 2005 World Championship final for men in team handball was played in Tunis.\nIn total the governorate of Tunis registered 24,095 licences for various clubs in the municipal area in 2007. The city further put itself onto the international basketball map as it hosted the FIBA Africa Championship 1965 and the FIBA Africa Championship 1987.\n\nThe Esperance Sportive de Tunis (EST), Club Africain (CA), and Stade Tunisien are the major sports clubs in the city. A symbolic class difference is present between the EST's and the CA's supporters, despite their playing at the same stadium. The EST is supported by the majority of the masses, while the CA, a poorer club, is supported by the others.\nThe first true sports facilities were managed under the French protectorate, as illustrated by the development of the Ksar Said racecourse and construction of the Stade Chedli Zouiten in the neighborhood of Belvedere, which had long been the main stadium in the capital before being supplanted by the Olympic stadium, Stade El Menzah, where EST and CA play their football today. The Olympic stadium and village area was built to accommodate the Mediterranean Games in 1967. A 60,000-seat stadium was also built in Rad\u00e8s for the Mediterranean Games in 2001 at an estimated cost of 170 million dinars, with nearly half of the loans financed by South Korean businessmen. The Olympic village was financed by an investment estimated at 50 million dinars.  In 2008, the government announced the start of construction of a large sports complex that will include several sports academies, a 20,000-seat stadium, and a swimming centre. Known as Tunis Sports City, it will expand around the lake of Tunis, on the road to La Marsa.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nTunis is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Other cooperations ===\n\n\n== Notable inhabitants ==\n\nIbn Khaldun (1332\u20131406), Arab sociologist and scholar\nTahar Haddad (1899\u20131935), promoter of women's emancipation in Tunisia\nAlbert Memmi (1920-2020), French writer and sociologist\nSalah El Mahdi (1925\u20132014), musicologist and composer\nAlberto Pellegrino (1930\u20131996), Italian fencer\nPhillip King (born 1934), British sculptor\nFouad Mebazaa (born 1933), politician, President of Tunisia in 2011\nNicola Pietrangeli (born 1933), Italian tennis player\nPierre Darmon (born 1934), French tennis player\nGeorges Wolinski (1934\u20132015), French illustrator and caricaturist\nRoberto Blanco (born 1937), German pop singer and actor\nYazid Zerhouni (born 1937), Algerian politician\nClaudia Cardinale (born 1938), Italian actress\nFatma Moalla (born 1939), mathematician\nMustapha Ben Jafar (born 1940), Tunisian politician\nAlain Boublil (born 1941), French musical author\nAbdelwahab Meddeb (1946\u20132014), Tunisian-French writer and radio staff\nSerge Adda (1948\u20132004), president of the French TV channel TV5\nSophie Bessis, (born 1947), Franco-Tunisian historian, journalist and researcher\nTarak Ben Ammar (born 1949), film producer\nBertrand Delano\u00eb (born 1950), mayor of Paris\nKarine Chemla (born 1958), historian of mathematics and sinologist\nAbdellatif Kechiche (born 1960), French film director, screenwriter and actor\nChokri El Ouaer (born 1966), Tunisian football goalkeeper\nAmel Karboul (born 1973), Tunisian entrepreneur, business consultant and politician\nMarc Gicquel (born 1977), French tennis player\nKhaled Mouelhi (born 1981), Tunisian footballer\nKarim Saidi (born 1983), Tunisian footballer\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBarbary pirates\nTunisian Community Center\nTunisian Italians\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nJellal Abdelkafi, La m\u00e9dina de Tunis, \u00e9d.

        "wiki": "The Cathedral of St. Vincent de Paul (French: Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Vincent-de-Paul de Tunis) is a Roman Catholic church located in Tunis, Tunisia. The cathedral is dedicated to Saint Vincent de Paul, patron saint of charity. It is the episcopal see of the Archdiocese of Tunis and is situated at Place de l'Ind\u00e9pendence in Ville Nouvelle, a crossroads between Avenue Habib Bourguiba and Avenue de France, opposite the French embassy.\n\nThe church, designed by L. Bonnet-Labranche, was built in a mixture of styles, including Moorish revival, Gothic revival, and Neo-Byzantine architectural traditions. Construction began in 1893 and the church was opened at Christmas 1897, albeit without its belltowers owing to a shortage of funds. The reinforced concrete towers were completed in 1910 using the Hennebique technique.Cardinal Charles Lavigerie laid the first stone for a church on 7 November 1881, a little further down Avenue de la Marine (now Avenue Habib Bourguiba). This was a pro-cathedral; the cathedral of the archdiocese (then called Carthage) being the Saint Louis Cathedral. The pro-cathedral was built quickly, but its condition soon deteriorated due to the adverse ground conditions, necessitating the construction of the current cathedral.\nThe number of Roman Catholics in Tunisia fell rapidly following Tunisian independence from France. A modus vivendi reached between the Republic of Tunisia and the Vatican in 1964 resulted in the transfer of selected buildings to the Tunisian state for public use, including the Acropolium of Carthage in Carthage. However, the Cathedral of St. Vincent de Paul remains under the ownership and operation of the Roman Catholic Church in Tunisia.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChapelle Saint-Louis de Carthage\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArchdiocese of Tunis page\nCathedral of St. Vincent de Paul on structurae",

          "As Tunisia once was under French Protectorate Catholic Religion played an important roll in this Muslim country. The cathedral is a very interesting place to visit and for free.",
          "It's interesting to have this catholic church in the city where the majority of the population are muslims. The building looks nice from outside. My 3 star ratings goes to the fact that the church is not quite open for the public. Therefore i hadn't got the chance to look inside.",
          "This cathedral was unfortunately closed each time we strolled by. Simplely the fact of its stature on Ave Habib Bourguiba is impressive and a testament to the tolerance of Tunisians.",

          "It is a nice cathedral. If you have time on your walk to the Medina take 10 mins and walk around. It is not a trip on itself, but worth looking at it if you are already in the neighborhood.",

          "While many of the murals have faded since they were painted in 2014, it is still worth 1-2 hours to explore the alley ways like a scavenger hunt to find the street art. I would recommend going with someone who knows a bit about the neighborhood, the artists, and how the event",

        "wiki": "Al-Zaytuna Mosque, also known as Ez-Zitouna Mosque, and El-Zituna Mosque (Arabic: \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u064a\u062a\u0648\u0646\u0629\u200e, literally meaning the Mosque of Olive), is a major mosque at the center of the Medina of Tunis in Tunis, Tunisia.\nThe mosque is the oldest in the Capital of Tunisia and covers an area of 5,000 square metres (1.2 acres) with nine entrances.\nIt has 160 authentic columns brought originally from the ruins of the old city of Carthage. The mosque is known to host one of the first and greatest universities in the history of Islam. Many Muslim scholars were graduated from the Al-Zaytuna for over a thousand years. From Ibn 'Arafa, one of the greatest scholars of Islam, Imam Maziri, the great traditionalist and jurist to the famous Tunisian poet Aboul-Qacem Echebbi and countless others all taught there.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nOne legend states that it was called \"Mosque of Olive\" because it was built on an ancient place of worship where there was an olive. However the most accepted explanation is that transmitted by the 17th century Tunisian historian Ibn Abi Dinar, who spoke about the presence of the tomb of Santa Olivia at that location. Recent research has shown that indeed this mosque was built on a Christian basilica. With the advent of Islam, the church was converted into a mosque, retaining the dedication, but translating the name into Arabic.\nThe saint is particularly venerated in Tunisia because it is superstitiously thought that if the site and its memory are profaned then a misfortune will happen; this includes a belief that when her relics are recovered Islam will end. This ancillary legend related to the discovery of the saint's relics is widespread in Sicily, however it is connected to other Saints as well.In 1402 king Martin I of Sicily requested the return of Saint Olivia's relics from the Berber Caliph of Ifriqiya Abu Faris Abd al-Aziz II, who refused him. Even today the Tunisians, who still venerate her, believe that the dominion of their religion will fade when the body of the Virgin Olivia will disappear.\n\n\n== History ==\nEz-Zituna was the second mosque to be built in Ifriqiya and the Maghreb region after the Mosque of Uqba in Kairouan. The exact date of building varies according to source. Ibn Khaldun and El-Bakri wrote that it was built in 116 Hijri (731 C.E.) by Ubayd Allah ibn al-Habhab.\nA second source states that the Umayyad Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik ordered the building; however, Ahmed In Abu Diyaf and Ibn Abi Dinar attributed the order to Hasan ibn al-Nu'man who led the conquest of Tunis and Carthage, and used it as a place of prayer. Most scholars agree that the third possibility is the strongest by evidence as it is unlikely that the city of Tunis remained a long time without a mosque, after its conquest in 79 Hijri. Thus the closest date is 84 Hijri (703 CE), and what El-Habhab did was in fact enlarge the mosque and improve its architecture.For almost two centuries (1812 - 2011), the majority of the Grand Imams of the Zitouna mosque were part of the Cherif and Mohsen families, notably including AbdelKebir Cherif, Ahmed Cherif, Mohamed Cherif, Hamda Cherif, Hassan Cherif, Mahmoud Mohsen, Mohamed Mohsen, and Mostafa Mohsen.  The Cherif and Mohsen families are part of the aristocracy \"Tunisoise\" of Tunis Carthage; are descendants of the Islamic prophet, Mohamed; and are a dynasty of religious scholars, sheikhs, imams, and landowners.[1] These families were founded by an ancestor who arrived in Tunis by the XIV-e century.  The descendants of Sheikh Mohsen Cherif changed the line from Cherif to Mohsen, creating the Mohsen branch out of the Cherif line.\n\n\n== Scholarship and the University ==\n\nFor centuries, Qirwan was the early centre of learning and intellectual pursuits in Tunisia and North Africa in General. Starting from the 13th century, Tunis became the capital of Ifriqiya under Almohad and Hafsid rule.\nThis shift in power helped al-Zaytuna to flourish and become one of the major centres of Islamic learning, and Ibn Khaldun, the first social historian in history was one of its products.\nThe flourishing university attracted students and men of learning from all parts of the known world at the time. Along with theology; mainly the Qur'an, the university taught jurisprudence, history, grammar, science and medicine. When it comes to books and libraries, Ez-Zituna libraries were the richest among North African counterparts. It had several collections totalling in the tens of thousands of books. One of its libraries, el-Abdaliyah included a large collection of rare and unique manuscripts. The manuscripts covered almost all subjects and sciences, including grammar, logic, documentations, etiquette of research, cosmology, arithmetic, geometry, minerals, vocational training, etc.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nEz-Zituna mosque followed the design and architecture of previous mosques, mainly the Mosque of Uqba, and was an inspiration for later mosques such as the Great Mosque of Cordoba. The courtyard is accessible via nine lateral doorways and forms a rectangle surrounded by galleries supported by columns made variously of marble, granite or porphyry and which were taken from ancient monuments (primarily from Carthage), as were those in the prayer hall. The square minaret rises from the northwest corner of the courtyard. Built in 1894, the minaret is 43 meters (141 ft) high and imitates the decoration of the Almohad minaret of the Kasbah Mosque with its limestone strap-work on a background of ochre sandstone.\nPresidents Bourguiba and Ben Ali carried out major restoration work and rehabilitation, especially during the 1960s and 1990s. The dome was added by the Zirids around 991. A beautiful structure about 12 metres in height and 4 metres in width, the dome is considered to be one of the most beautiful domes in Tunis. It fuses Fatimid structural and decorative elements from North Africa as well as Cairo, and has designs similar to the Al Anwar Mosque in cairo.\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of the oldest mosques in the world\n\n\n== References ==",

It is located at 24 Tribunal Street.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Lasram's, an aristocratic family of Tunis, descend from a Yemeni tribe settled in Kairouan. It is composed of rich landowners. Most of them were ministers of the Pen (Arabic: \u0648\u0632\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0644\u0645\u200e, French: ministres de la Plume). One of them, Hamouda Lasram, is a rich landowner and a khawaja of the Igawawen tribe (secretary of Berber cavalry regiments).\nIn order to get a large plot and build the palace, he acquired and demolished several neighboring buildings. Its construction lasted from 1812 to 1819.\n\nUntil the independence and the abolition of the habous, his descendants lived in the palace (which was considered inalienable as a habous).\nIn 1964, the municipality of Tunis acquired it. Four years later, in 1968, it is allocated to the Association de sauvegarde de la m\u00e9dina de Tunis.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nDar Lasram, with a surface area of 2250 m2, is a good example of a large traditional Tunisian residence. The ground floor contains the warehouse and the service area, the first floor is reserved to family members while the upper floor is reserved to guests.\nNowadays, the palace is divided between the Association de sauvegarde de la m\u00e9dina and the Tahar Haddad Club.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

          "My daughter and I enjoy coming here, entry fee is 11 dinars each, animals well treated, staff very friendly. Lots of activities, feeding the animals, camel rides, extra cost around 5 dinars. Taking photo with sea lions, shows. Not easy to get to if you not driving but there is",
          "Nice zoo with special animals. You can see white lions, white tiger and white deer. they have see lion show and you can foto with see lion after show for 10TND. Unfortunately they don't have dolphins anymore :( You can feed giraffes, camels, deer etc. and that you must pay",

          "J adore very nice place and a lot of animals rare lion white and whites tigers camels and giraffe i like it and amazing",
          "We visited the park at the beginning of July in scorching temperatures. They have a wide variety of animals which are interesting to look and learn about. However, as I had already read previously there were no obvious signs of water for the predator animals such as the lions,",
          "Went to the zoo on a Tui trip 28/06/18 .I had been 5 years previous so was expecting to see a lot of the same animals.I found the zoo did not have the same atmosphere as before but I imagine that is down to lack of funds caused by lack of tourists for a couple of years. The",
          "A must see if you happen to visit Tunisia. One of the best Zoos I've come across especially for kids as they can come into contact with animals, feeding and touching them. It's a pity that the dolphin show was stopped, but there is still the lion sea show, which is a great fun",
          "I am not a lover of zoo's but this one is quite different, the over head walkways where you are above animal enclosures. The sea lion show was outstanding all in all a great place to visit at reasonable prices",
          "Booked this tour through ?Thomas Cook, just half day, was picked up at 7.10 and taken to Friguia Park. It was bigger than I expected, but the animals all looked well cared for, as we were early, the staff were giving the animals their breakfast, the animals certainly recognised",
          "First of all, ignore all the reviews about the way the animals are treated and no water or shade etc. It\u2019s just lies. And if they never had any water ever, they\u2019d be dead and there would be no zoo. I was looking out for water etc because of these reviews and the only place I",
          "Took my 4 year old grandson Defiantly worth a visit My only real concern is that staff were allowing people of all sizes to sit on the tortoises really upset us..",
          "Very basic but a lot to see and do, loads of picture opportunities and a sealion show. A fair bit of walking.",
          "We call it a zoo. We got a yellow taxi there. The taxi man stays with you. 60 dinar there and back, \u00a320 in English money. We stayed an hour and a half. Entry was 11 dinar each, \u00a33.50 each. It was a hot day. It was so very sad to see all the animals. No shelter and none of the",
          "Went to zoo with my family, we didn\u2019t book through the hotel. Took a taxi and he waited for us while we looked around. There was a fair bit to see, feeding the giraffe was the highlight, only 10 dinars.",
          "This zoo had everythinf including feed the giraffes and also animals well looked after so dont listen to the negative reviews. A must when going to tunisia and also so cheap",
          "I enjoyed the park I was unsure as some reviews previously mentioned about the condition animals are in but my visit I didn\u2019t see any animals in stress or without shelter, there is parts on the enclosure that is shady for animals and the enclosures are big enough for the animals",
          "I advice everyone to visit this zoological park situated between Bouficha and Tunis City...It contains different animals and has a good helthic pathways..It is well maintained. You can intend the sea leon show at 10h, 13h and at 15h...one remark: same animal information panels",

          "Exceptional every animal you would want to see Will definitely go back. Went on a camel ride . Fed the giraffes and bison",
          "After working in a wildlife centre in the UK, going to see these animals was a little hard for me as some of their zoo enclosure designs wasn't the best as some animals didn't have places they could hide from the heat of the sun and the tortoise's didn't have the right",
          "11 dinar fee so do not take packet tour(too expansive), by taxi is more cheap. Beautifull landskape, animals fill free and happy. You can feed some of them. Most charming are kenguru. Dancing sea cat. Playground for babies.",
          "Basic zoo ok ish I suppose keepers take bribes to allow you up close and feed some of the animals Beware if you have small children it was extremely hot with not a lot of shade or shops so load up with what you need before setting off at the shop",
          "I visited here a few months before the tragic beach shooting in Sousse. I arrived at the park in tears, as on the way to the park we drove past a donkey chained by the face to the ground in the most hateful and uncomfortable position I've ever seen, right in the middle of the",
          "This has got to be one of the most enjoyable days that I have ever spent at an outdoor zoo.The park is 4/5 star rating for modern but is so well laid out.There is also camel rides,snacks ,gifts and when I finished my day we went into the Zulu tent and dined all night with fine",
          "We came here in november. Weather was nice. Taxi from our hotel la badira cost 30 dinars each way and 10 dinar for him to wait 3 hrs for us. This is because you will not get a taxi there to come back in. Entry is 10 dinars each. There were hardly no animals. Lions and tigers",
          "This is an impressive and well-maintained park, well laid out and so much to see. We even had a 20 minute Camel ride. We particularly enjoyed seeing the sea lion perform and the Crocodiles, Tigers and Flamingoes. All the animals look happy and well-cared for with plenty of",
          "It is well themed, with a choice of animal species. It is very spacious. There are other kids activities such as face painting and gift shops which you have to pay for separately. Good restaurants with with prices towards the above average tag. Having said that, there is room to",
          "Just returned from our day trip to the patk. Been many times before and it was lovely. Oh dear what has happened there is now no highlight as no dolphin show. Many animals are no longer there. The remaining animals are limited and in poor condition and appear to be malnourished",
          "The prices are a bit exessive but the place is nice and well maintained. Yet it could be better is rest rooms were well positioned for kids.",
          "For family and kids and it's great getaway for the day. Lots to see for little ones and adults too. Improve the information will bust the place.",
          "We went with a taxi to the parc which was ok but you have to ask the driver to stay there as there are no taxis to get back to Hammamet. The parc itself quite nice with really good animal shows. The entry fee is really reasonable, altough u can spend quite a bit of money to take",
          "We visited the zoo it closed on Mondays so before going check with your hotel to find out. The zoo was a good day out you can swim with dolphins but check the times as they have a special block to do this. The good experience was feeding the tamarin monkeys with my daughter if",
          "Loved the animals, we took pictures next to the seal and we got to see white lions. Recommendation: there is very little shade, so take extra care, wear hats and sunscreen.",
          "i feel that most reviews for Friguia Park focus on the park itself which is great as it is a lovely day out for the whole family and people of all ages, though a little difficult for wheelchairs as there are some steep climbs for someone pushing someone. However, it is",
          "Visited her April 2013 and thought it was fun. The sea lion show was really good. One of the better ones I've seen. Lots of animals that seem well kept and happy",
          "One of the most wonderful places I have visited. The dolphins show is fascinating. I took a photo cheering one dolphin outside the pool. We enjoyed the lionsea show. We also took a photo holding one. You can ride camels there. My children played some music with 2 zulu guys and",
          "I loved this zoo! The sea lion show at the beginning of the park was reapply good! It's definitely a family friendly zoo! Also there was preformers dotted around d the zoo! Fabulous",
          "This Sunday I visited Friguia Park (ZOO) with my family it was a good day especially for my children's, they have fan to see the animals (lions, tigers...) and walk around, there are restaurants inside and some African's shops.",
          "Really loved this,the wife has been on safari,but ths is as close as I would want to get to soe of these animals!!!!. WE SPENT ABOUT 3 HOURS WANDERING AROUND,THAT WAS ENOUGH. SOME BEAUTIFUL CREATUREs AND LOVELY STAFF.",
          "Great experience, especially the sight of white tigers. The park is well organized, a place where it's great to make picnics in group. The entry to dolphins is a expensive though. Nice welcoming with African authentic music",
          "It had to have been one of the hottest days when we visited the Friguia Park and i will be honest this did effect some of my enjoyment as being from wet raining England i was in no way used the extreme heat we had this day. However it is brilliant and perfect for everyone",
          "I got a taxi here, it was only about 10 minutes down the road. Most of the African animals, you just walk around the raised walkways - you are perfectly safe. A great day for the family",
          "This was my second time visiting the zoo. We took my daughter here for her 2nd birthday and we all absolutely loved it. We were able to take pictures with the giraffes, lions, kangaroos and zebras. Took a camel ride which only cost 3 dinars. Such a great experience. Staff here",
          "Love this park have been a few times . the giraffes friendly. And all the expected African animals. There are dolphins for an extra charge brilliant",
          "Fantastic place we really enjoyed seeing the animals,the best for me was the lion enclosure. Looking down at them was a different aspect to seeing them at level. Take a hat for the sun, it was very hot when we were there. There are food and refreshments available at reasonable",
          "this is a very big and spacious open zoo, lot of space for every animal, so they are living much better than in european zoo.. big delfinarium, with good show. huge tent - restaurant for 800 people and exhibition stage with great show.",
          "Nice enough park with a good range of animals. Lions and Giraffes are the best. You can get also get a camel ride. The after show is quite good but don't expect to be eating in style. Shared table food but nice enough. The wine is rank.",
          "What an experience!!!!!! Not a massive zoo and certainly not a small one, if you have the chance to go on this excursion then you really should, it may come with an evening live show with food and drink. The show is fab, African dancers and Tunis dancer, the food is basic but",
          "Me and my partner went to the Zulu evening, it was fantastic! Great food and great entertainment! It was worth every penny!! We also went around the park during the day, there have been a few negative comments on here but please disregard these. The animals are well looked after",
          "great day out not expensive and the dolphins are amazing the whole family will love this place and you are able to have photos taken with most of the animals face painting zulu show youll love it the staff are friendly and helpfull too",
          "Loved the park .was very hot .enjoyed feeding the giraffes and zebras .best time to go is early morning. Take lots to drink .",
          "There are some spectacular things about this park, as well as some things I found disappointing. They do have a huge range of animals, some that you can see really up close. The park itself is like a walk through a jungle, it has really been set out well. They also have a sea",
          "We visited the Friguia Park as part of the Zulu Evening sold to us by Thompson. The animal park is well worth a walk around, especially enjoyed the sealion show and the elevated platforms over the big cat enclosures. Animals seem to be well looked after. The Zulu Evening - great",
          "On entrance it's all clean, painted well, toilets straightaway, little food and drink place to buy stuff from, \ufe0fwell signposted and sure it would be easily accessible, sea lion show fab and so talented, can get pictures with sea lion which is wonderful great souvenir, plenty and",
          "lots of animals to see, and if your lucky - to feed! Highly recommended. Very good value for money. Plan to travel independetly though. We saved 50% by getting in a taxi and paying on the door compared to going with thomas cook!!",
          "went on organised trip which included zulu show as well, friguia park is not very big but the animals have large enclosures especially the big cats (lions, tigers, cheetahs) staff make money by charging to feed animals and take photos",
          "We decided to visit the Animal Park for a 2nd time, but without doing the Thomas Cook excursion. We hopped in a taxi, negotiated a rate for the driver to take us on a return journey (50-60 dinar/ \u00a320), paid the entrance fee of 11dinar each (\u00a33.75) & off we went. Total cost-",
          "Although some people seem to have reservations about the way the animals are kept it seemed to me the conditions were as near as possible to being in the wild and far better than any zoo I have been to. Swimming with the dolphins was an amazing experience and a fantastic memory.",
          "We booked this trip with our rep for around \u00a315 each. We spent about three hours there and enjoyed our visit. There were many animals which we have not seen in local zoos back home, including white lions and tigers. The animals seemed fairly looked after. The staff would often",
          "I love this place! sea lion shows, lions, tigers, elephant, zebras and giraffes amongst others. Awesome trip. Try and book the Zulu night if you can, the pic alone after the show is worth it. The Zuma dancing is great, the three course meal included was delicious and i'm quite",
          "Friguia was lovely. There were quite a few animals I haven't seen at other zoos which was cool. If you want to ride a camel in Tunisia this is the place to do it cause it's really cheap and the animals are well looked after. A lot of the animals are sleeping at the start of the",
          "If you want to swim with the dolphins the cheapest place is definitely the Friguia Park . We went here for my birthday to swim with the dolphins and we paid for entrance 11 dinar plus 200 dinar per person.If you want you can get around 200 pics of the swimming for 60 dinar on",
          "I went to friguia park for my birthday this year and i wasn't disappointed. There isnt a wide range of animals but the ones they do have are worth seeing. There are signs in the park saying not to go into the enclosures even if asked to by staff but we were not asked the day we",
          "We spent the whole day at frigua park and have also been there many other times on different holidays as it never gets boring! The range of animals is big with them not being too far away so you can actually see them! Just be careful going in hot months such as August as there",
          "I really enjoyed the dolphin show ,it was extremely hot that day but it was worth it ,had my photo taken with a dolphin made my day ,didn't go to the zoo so cant say anything about that .",
          "Nice day out for my friend and I. Arrived at about 12:30, 11 dinar entry (about \u00a34) spent an hour or so looking at the animals, all seemed well fed and well looked after. Got our picture taken with a sea lion then headed back to the entrance to swim with the Dolphins for 200",
          "I visited with my sister & 4year old niece, after it was recommended by other holiday makers at our resort. We decided to go early to avoid walking around in scorching heat and to avoid the queues we we warned about. Unfortunately for us when we arrived there were several school",
          "what a brilliant place to go, wide range of animals Giraffes Lions Tigers Zebra Monkeys Sea Lions Camals and loads loads more .amazed at how close you can get to the animals and feed some aswell. Sea lion show was brilliant. Clean and tidy park and from what I saw the animals",
          "Very good zoo for the money, animals look like they are very well looked after, the sea lion show was very good and is on a few times a day, make sure you take toilet paper and hand cleaner as the 2 times we have gone the cleaners want a tip for you to use it. Dolphin show",
          "The zoo was generally nice with plenty of animals to see. Criticisms are when you go, the keepers ask you to pay them to get photos taken with the animals which is sometimes dangerous. We paid 20 dinars each to hold a baby lion which was amazing but felt bad after as the cub was",
          "Me and my partner visited the park today organised by Thomas Cook. The animal park itself looked a bit run down but all the animals looked in decent health. As we did an excursion we only got about 2.45 hours to look round so it was abit of a rush. But that's no fault of the",
          "Most of the animals seem to be well looked after here but it doesn't take long to walk around the park itself and you cna see everything in about an hour. You can pay someone 5 dinar to and take close up pics of the animals like the cheetahs and also feed the giraffes and",
          "Put your trainers on as there is a lot of walking but on the plus side some amazing sights. If this is your first time see the dolphin show and if your budget can stretch swim with them too (\u00a360)",
          "We all really enjoyed visiting there!! The animals were amazing and you get to be pretty close up too. When we were there we got to hold a 7 day old white baby tiger!!!! We also ate there and watched the African belly dancing which was a lovely experience. The food was great and",
          "Paid \u00a3100 to visit this park plus Zulu show. On way in watched the seal lion show then you can pay 10 dinar to have a photograph done with the sea lion. I paid for both grandsons (7 and 4) to have their picture taken. We all queued up behind the pen then the photographer only",
          "All in all a good day out! Not a hell of a lot to do as the park is quite small, however when combined with the 3 course meal and zulu dancers (African Dream excursion) you can make a day of it! It costs only 10 dinar (about \u00a33) to feed a giraffe which is a great experience!",
          "Went as a excursion from the Hotel. Cost about \u00a330 for 4 of us, and with that was a Dolphin Show. All the animals seemed happy, and there was lots of room for them. We took a cell ride for \u00a31 each and the guide, took photos and videos of us riding the camel, so that was nice.",
          "From hammamet a taxi cost 10pound...the entrance 12 dinar for the zoo and 20 for the dolphinarium...is a nice experience and the dolphin show is really nice to see...well is not nice that this animals live in a cage..is understandable but they doesn t look too bad as they do I",
          "A very enjoyable 2 hours. The sealion show is a must. It was only one sealion but very enjoyable. I was on an organised trip and arrived at 9 am could not get a coffee. It is mainly African animals.",
          "Im a bit funny about zoo's especially in other countries, but this restored my faith. The park are working with animal preservation and looking to reintroduce certain species to the wild. The animals all looked well fed and cared for and the compounds were all clean. There is",
          "We spent half a day looking around the Animal Park and also the Dolphin show just after 11 am. As it was May it was relatively quiet, there was a local Tunisian school trip there watching the dolpins too which was nice, they seemed to be enjoying it too, watching the dolpins",
          "My husband and I went to Tunisia for our 3rd wedding anniversary. The safari was more like a zoo but it was nice. I feed some animals just make sure you have a tip for them. But the South Africa Zulu dancers wad amazing. I could watch them all day. I would definitely recommend.",
          "Spent 3 hrs in this park animals were in fair conditions pens looked as though the could have done with a very good clean soiled areas and the worst bit was what visitors had chucked in plastic bottles,wrappers ect got some really nice photos better than could get in uk staff",
          "This is a tricky review to write, on one hand I want to say how run down the place is, how sad and disappointed I was for the animals who's 'habitats' were dry baron enclosures, yes they had space, but seemingly little stimulation! How some of the wooden walkways desperately",
          "We arrived around 9.30 and th zoo had only just opened so we could walk round with ease .we had two girls aged 6 & 8 with us and they absolutely loved seeing the animals , and for 10 dins they could feed the giraffes which was fun . All in all a good day out",
          "This is a great place to visit as there are an amazing array of animals to see in a beautiful setting. You can wander around at your leisure and is suitable for any age. Plenty of places to get refreshments and well worth watching the african entertainers. You can get up",
          "put on comfortable shoes and insect repellant when you going its a good walk up and down ,,Its not 1 of the best zoos but its okay for a few hours. you can go on a camel ride the snack booths are a bit expensive for crisps etc",

          "Visited Friguia with my husband quite cheap to get in and yes animals do look abit worn out but are well looked after by the staff. As I have a disability I found it quite easy to walk around the park just a few steep hills. Dolphin and sea lion shows were pretty good aswell.",
          "Came here in 2013 with a group of friends. Apologies for the late review. Didn't use this website as much as I do now. We had a walk around the park & seen some lovely animas. White tigers, giraffes etc.. I hopped the fence to see some guinea pigs as I had one at home I",
          "Had a lovely day here at the zoo not expensive to enter plenty to see the white tigers and white lions are beautiful sea lion show good but could do with some talking about them to go with it. The zoo keepers obviously have a good bond with the animals as one took my camera and",

          "The price of the trip was a lot of money the coach picked us up half an hour late, when we arrived we had to pay extra for the dolphin show, were just in time for the sea lion show which was good but then we had to pretty much run around the rest of the park to make it to the",
          "such a variety of animals, we went late in the day so there wasn't any shows on but still this was the highlight of my holiday. here you can swim with dolphins too sadly I didn't do that but I will when I return to Tunisia. and it only cost 12 dinar ( around 3 pound) for an",
          "Amazing place. Went twice in 2weeks. My daughter loved feeding the animals and coming face to face with a Zebra! Fed the giraffes and deer among others. Very cheap to get in. Zulu afternoon was excellent, even the kids enjoyed it. for those people who have said it is very",
          "this place is terrible. run down, hardly any animals (unless you like sheep and goats - they have a whole area for them...exciting huh?). everything is extra. dolphin show. 20 dinars each. feed the giraffe? 10 dinars each. (actually, feeding the giraffe is great). feed a small",
          "Happy, healthy animals but not many of them! Not enough to keep you busy all day that's for sure. Lots of the optional extras (feeding giraffes for example) were closed. Half day trip Max and filled with what I assume to be groups of school kids... on a Sunday? Their weeks must",
          "Friguia park is a trip endorsed by #FirstChoice and is well presented by the local reps, they present amazing photos of animals, animal feeding and activities taking place within the park. They refer to it as Safari - reality it is a very poor effort of a zoo! Do not be fooled",
          "Me and my partner visited this animal park which was recommended to us by our resort. We are true zoo fanatics so this was a very pleasant surprise. The cost for 2 people to enter the zoo was 22.5 TND which was very reasonable in comparison to UK prices. The reason why it is a",
          "Well let me say firstly the park itself was not what I expected, we went on a particularly hot day which seemed to have affected most of the animals and people... The sea lion show was great, couldn't help feel sorry for the white tigers though one seemed to be in quite a small",
          "Omg this place is so dirty. It smells terribly of urine. Dirtiest toilets i have ever seen in my life. The pathways are really unsafe. The animals look thin, dried up, starving and miserable. It really is painful to see. The zulu entertainment was ok bless them they work hard",
          "Very pleasant .. Zoo keepers will get close to animals and take pics for you for a small fee. Sea lion show is fabulous.",
          "Although the park itself was heaving they have the most amazing animals and you can feed the giraffes and swim the dolphins for about \u00a33. They also offered an AfricanDream meal, the experience was unforgettable, a three course African meal and unlimited wine while the Zulu",
          "The Zoo was lovely loads of animals. Although they all seemed hot and bothered. We got a ticket through our rep at the hotel and it included a 3 course Zulu themed 3 course meal which made my experience in Tunisia feel so African at last. Would totally recommend, especially",

          "We (my husband and 9 yr old daughter) thoroughly enjoyed our day out here. 11 dinar (\u00a33.80 per adult), 6 dinar (\u00a32 for children). You could spend all day there if you wished. Take a picnic with you if you can. Plenty of places to sit, eat and watch the wildlife. Kangaroos,",
          "as part of an excursion with our hotel, we got a trip to Friguia park and evening show. We also had the chance to swim with dolphins, but this was an added extra which you had to purchase on the day, but the experience was wonderful and it wasn't a dad price as the dolphins were",
          "Quick to go round, about 1-2 hours, sea lion show about 15 minutes. Lots of animals running around, great for photos. Avoid the man selling imprinted metal bands near the zebra enclosure. Was generally irritating and just trying to do you out of money. Meal brilliant, South",
          "Liked the zoo & Sealion display & evening excellent meal with entertainment from North & South Africa.",
          "Walked around the park, enjoyed looking at the different animals. our family paid to have a ride on the camels (only cost about \u00a31 each), our first time on one and we really enjoyed it. Although there are signs saying do no cross barriers even if invited by rangers, we risked it",

          "Worth every penny! Got to feed giraffes,Zebras and a Donkey by hand. The animals are well looked after. Got to kiss a sea-lion too and swim with the dolphins. A dream come true really! - not alot of staff at the park so ask the food areas if you wanna feed the giraffes ect",

          "Me and my partner went via taxi (40dinar) return. Was a nice visit out, selection of animals, pleasing themselves nothing forced. It's very cheap as mentioned, so what do some people expect! If you like animals have a venture there :)",
          "Went to the zoo thinking it should be amazing since we're in Africa but it didn't turn out to what I for it would be like. Animals were just chilling doing nothing or hidden away from the public so making it hard to take pictures. I can see why the entry was cheap. Me and my mrs",

          "I visited this zoo on a sunny day, good to walk around and even went on trampolines there. Good to see animals on holiday and booked on an excursion with an African entertainment night with free flowing wine and meal included and lots of fun there too.",
          "Was changed double the rate by the not so helpfull thomson rep to see a load of animals in poor condition and all bones could be seen through skin. Looks more like a animal shelter than a zoo.",

          "Fantastic opportunity to see a wide variety of different animals and at a very reasonable price. Depending on where you are staying look at getting a taxi directly to the venue rather than booking with your representative it works out a LOT cheaper. The entrance fee is only",
          "Nothing has changed. Visited this entertainment package many years ago, and applaud the dancers and hosts for their hospitality, but you do feel a little rushed and perhaps a little part of a carousel! I felt the same way many years ago - it was pile them in and turn it out!",
          "This was a lovely day though we werent too sure we agreed with the way the animals were kept and some looked a little on the thin side :( Had a man try and take my phone off me to take a picture of the cheetah - later saw him in the cheetah cage right in its face with someones",
          "did not know what to expect but had a fantastic time make sure you see the Zulu dancers if you can. take in the experience of the camel ride its good fun",
          "It was a cold day and most of the animals had retreated indoors. The park was very 'tired' and the Zulu Show and meal which we attended was appalling - would not recommend a visit",
          "I must say, this is an underrated attraction. The animals are amazing (where else can you see a desert fox close up?) the dolphinarium is well worth a visit ( luckily I turned up,just I time to see the show - bring swimming gear if you want to swim with them after the show).",
          "This was an amazing place to visit. The only problem we did not have enough time to browse the park. We rode Camels, well two of us rode Camels. I could spend a week wandering around. The Zulu Dancers were wonderful. I don't know where they find the energy. The food and",
          "There is a wide range of animals here, from tigers to guinea pigs but I left feeling a bit sad for the animals. Although most of the areas the animals had were alright more could be done to make them more animal friendly, such as more shade, stimulation and vegetation. Although",

          "This was our second trip to Friguia Park and I can highly recommend it. We got to feed the giraffes and our daughter got kissed by one, lol, we also fed the elephant, the zebra, the wallabies and much more. Definitely worth a visit, but do the morning trip if you can as the",
          "This was the second time I had been to Friguia Park, and to be honest, I felt a little hollow afterwards. I was very impressed the first time I went, but this time it felt a bit run down. The animals didn't seem as content or as well looked after as they did on my first visit.",
          "this was really a dream come true for me swimming with dolphins can really say its a must to do .. there was just the 2 of us in the pool so its really good . and price was good ''' the man took photo so we got the whole cd of us 150 photo so cheap/ staff are really nice.",
          "I have been to Friguia Park with the kids and they enjoyed watching the park's animals especially the wilds one. It was a great sunny day and they were able to go around, play and most importantly discover new animals and also see in real some animals they just hear about such",
          "We visited Friguia Park as part of an excursion.with Thomson, which included an Zulu evening. As my visit was in winter time, a lot of the amenities in the zoo were closed. There was one restaurant open but only served coffee and a lot of the toilets were closed too. Given it",

          "We went on the excursion to the zoo followed by dinner and the Zulu show. The coach picked us up at 1.30pm and was very informative as we travelled the short distance to the zoo. We had two hours to look round the zoo on our own before meeting up for dinner and the Zulu show on",
          "Loved seeing the animals and then onto the show and meal, which I have to say wasn't enough of when other people took so much, dancers were really good but the toilets were disgusting, wouldn't flush and then no water to wash hands",

          "we loved our time here ... the keepers are forever trying to earn extra money by letting you hold baby lions and feeding the giraffes etc which is fine but what was really annoying was the fact you have to pay an extra 20 dinar each to see the dolphins - not good if you have",
          "Visited exactly a week ago on a Thompson organised excursion. The trip cost 89 Dinars per person (about \u00a332). We were collected around 2pm from our hotel and taken to the Zoo. For a foreign zoo the enclosures were very good and the animals all looked in great condition, The",
          "Just returned from Tunisia yesterday and visited Friguia the day before we left. We had a few hours to look around the zoo, which was average, plenty of animals but obviously the standards and enclosures aren't like ours at home. The Zulu evening was brilliant after the free",

          "This my first average review as my family and I are easily pleased but this time we felt that the zoo needs some makeover. Most of the animals looked tired during the time of our visit although my daughter 9 yrs old was very pleased to see some animals only found in Africa. The",
          "Went on the Thomas Cook arranged excursion which included the Zulu show. Enjoyed the zoo the most of any zoo that I have been to mainly because of the way it was laid out by means of a walk way above some of the enclosures. Made for great viewing! The sealion show was only one",
          "We missed out on the organised excursion to the safari park which worked out much better for us! The excursion included a Zulu show and meal but with 3 toddlers, we heard from other hotel guests, that this would not be ideal. So we ended up booking a minibus through the hotel",
          "This is one of the best zoos I've ever been too. The animals seemed very happy in their surroundings & lets be honest they are predominately African animals in Africa! The enclosures are laid out so its better for the animals than the people viewing them so the elephants are",
          "Me and my partner came to friguia park and thought it was brilliant, soo much to see and the animals are all so content and happy. We came here through a 1/2 day Thomas Cook excursion and it was definately worth evert penny, we watched the sea lion show and the dolphin show",
          "Park is very basic, the animals were really bored and fed up, pacing up and down. You can interact with some of the animals which you cannot do in the u k, worth a visit as money does go to the zoo. Zulu show with food good afterwards.",
          "Pleasantly surprised at how well laid out this wildlife park was. We thought we'd see a handful of animals, but there were giraffes, elephants, lions, tigers, camels, to name a few. The enclosures were quite big, the animals had space, and were easily visible and we were able",

          "If you're thinking that you'll be visiting a well-built, clean, and pleasant environment in which to keep animals - something like Longleat or Blair Drummond, then think again! This is a poorly maintained, broken down, dirty and quite depressing location, and to see animals",
          "Liked - giraffe feeding, dolphin show and camel ride - all brilliant features of the park. The tigers were so close and got to hear some roaring going on! The meerkats were seriously cute and I loved the lions! Disliked - the enclosures need some work doing to them. The raccoons",

          "Had a really good time here some of the animals enclosures look abit bare but on a hole they look like they are well looked after which is the main thing. Its important to take some extra dinars for snacks, feed the kangaroos, camel rides, feed the elephants, feed the giraffes,",
          "When we last visited Tunisia in April this atraction was visited by a friend who recommended we visit on our return in July.It was well worth a visit as we combined the visit to the park with an evening with Zulu dancers.For a few extra dinar we were able to feed a giraffe,feed",
          "Loads of animals to see. Keepers will ask you to pay a small price to come in and feed the animals. I couldn't resist and feed the elephants, was worth it. If their bosses catch you, they will throw you out though. Take plenty of suncream and water as all outdoors and it",
          "Went to the park on Thursday 17th July. It's was very hot so advise you take water with you, but you can get drinks and ice creams around the park. And there are different place to stop in the shade with lovely carved seats. The main attraction to me was the lions, tigers, there",

          "Lovely place to visit however not much shade so can become unbearable in the heat both for us and the animals! Lots of animals to see however you end up spending a lot of money in the park due to being expected to constantly tip park keepers, for example one shoved a baby goat",
          "Lovely scenery and the animals are stunning. Plenty to see and refreshment areas at regular points around the park. However there are not many shaded areas so recommend caps/hats and plenty of fluids.",

          "I can still hear the piteous yelps of the cuddly lion cub as it was passed from one person to the next for a fee of ten dinars. The queue snaked around the enclosure for the privilidge despite the protests of the poor little cub. Is this justifiable exploitation in the name of",
          "We visited here during our recent holiday and loved the animal park. We arrived around quarter to 3 but only had 2 hours to look around as we were going to the Zulu evening in the restaurant, so we didn't watch the sea lion show at 3 as we wanted to look around. Apparently it",
          "It was a shame about the weather as it was raining but it was worth getting to cuddle a baby lion cub! Only downfall with it is the man doing was literally taking the cub as soon as he gave it to you shouting \"quick, quick, quick!\" as you took the picture. You get to feed and",
          "We spent a few hours at the park as part of a 3 in 1 trip. I was dubious at first, knowing that not all countries treat animals the same as we do in England. I was very pleasantly surprised. All animals looked happy and well cared for. You can also feed some of the animals at",
          "We took our young family to Friguia park as their first introduction to zoo like attractions. On first impressions I would say that the park could do with a lick of paint and a freshen up. However the variety of animals available to see is quite good and they all look well",

          "The zoo was worth visiting and we seen many rare animals, but the best part was the Zulu entertainment. This was great fun and worth seeing. The food was great and the whole day was well organised. Great time was had by all",

          "We were told to expect a little bit of dodgy-ness before we went on this trip: for a couple of dinar the keepers would pretty much do anything! The only thing that seemed to be allowed was to feed the giraffes as it was advertised - this was the most expensive and the most",
          "Me and my partner visited Friguia park through a Thomas Cook excursion. There is not a great deal to do in Tunisia and we thought it would be nice to break the week up a bit. It was great! For all ages. It is not a huge park. It only takes about 2 hours to see the whole thing.",

          "Me and my partner have been going to Tunisia for so many years .. since 2005 :) .. but found this park online before we went this year ... I must say was so cool and well worth the cost ... we went in a taxi as we could never find our Thomas cook rep at hotel when the times said",

          "We wen't to the park with First Choice on the Zulu trip. We enjoyed our time at the park, especially the Sea Lion show and feeding the Giraffes. We loved how close up you could get to the animals and with the giraffe you can just stand with leaves and they will freely choose to",
          "Me and my boyfriend loved this trip was our favourite part of our holiday. We did the early morning trip as was told for a small tip you would be able to feed the giraffes. But we got more than we bargained for. We managed to feed nearly all the animals tipping each time 1 or 2",

          "Very good place to go for an afternoon out. Cheap entrance price at 10 dinars which is ridiculous compared to uk zoos. Also for an extra 10 dinar you can pay to have some pictures with a sea lion which was a lovely experience. The zoo itself isn't massive and it took us less",
          "We visited here whilst on holiday in Sousse, conducted by Tunisie Voyages on behalf of Thomsons. If you pay approx. 10TD you can feed certain animals. Sadly, the lion and tiger cubs had supposedly been sold to another Zoo so we were not able to hold. Alternatively we fed the",

          "Lots of animals to look at, good value for money. We held a lion cub, fed the giraffes, watched a sea lion show. It cost the equivalent of \u00a314 for travel to and from our hotel and the entry, which we think is great value. The animals are kept in huge enclosures and it didn't",
          "Went here with my girlfriend during our stay in Hammamet. It was organised by the travel company for roughly 50 dinar each (\u00a318) for transport and admittance to the park. The bus trip was reasonable. although Tunisian driving leaves an awful lot to be desired at times! The",

          "Considering the range of animals on show, this is definitely worth the taxi fare (around 30DT in each direction from Hammamet). Entry is only 10DT (\u00a34), which is a steal considering you're able to see a huge range of animals, some of which you'd be unlikely to see too often",
          "I had been very concerned about visiting the zoo due to some of the reviews I read. We booked the excursion through the hotel rep (it wasn't a large chain rep!) and we booked for the Dolphin Show as well. We arrived at the zoo at 8.45 and they didn't open until 9 however they",

          "Mostly a display of Roman mosaics, with a few statues and some steles. Would have been interesting to have a bit more information about Sousse and life as a Roman and later citizens. It would be nice to be able to ascend the walls, though the views are quite good anyway.",
          "Situated within the walls at the top of the medina, 9 dinars to get in and then one dinar if you wish to take photographs. All mosaic pictures and pottery and sculpture displays have informative information plaques in both french and english. Mosaics are very well preserved",
          "Firstly, you will be more than happy with the museum location. It is on the top of Sousse Medina, within the Medina's walls (Sousse Medina was built in 11 century AD) and overlooks the Medina, part of the city and the sea. It houses the second largest collection of mosaics in",
          "Sousse museum located next to the media and its catacombs reach a far way place is known for its mosaics which are unique in the world. The museum is at the heart of the tourist city Sousse Tunisia, the visit is free for students and teachers and is a monument worth visiting",
          "Got there and there was a charge of 9 denars each (roughly \u00a32.50 each) which was fine. V hot day but some Aircon and the displays were very interesting, though far too much writing on some and could have been spread out more! You couldn\u2019t walk along the top of the walls to the",
          "I wish I could have spent more time there. The mosaics were so much better than I had imagined. Not vvery big, but phenomenal collection!",
          "The museum is located right next to Sousse's medina and should be easily accessible from anywhere inside Sousse. I think I was the only one inside the museum whilst I was there with some bored looking museum staff. It has a huge collection of mosaics as well as several articles",
          "I like to see things when I visit a country, and on the excursion I took to Tunis the guide mentioned there were a lot of mosaics, not only at the Bardo but also in Sousse itself. So, the next day I set out to this museum with a friend. It's not too large, so you can do it in",
          "One of the must see things when in Sousse ; There is air conditioning and everything is well labelled and signed. Well worth a visit",
          "This museum is a must see when in Sousse. The interior is modern and air conditioned. It has a large collection of mosaics that is probably second only to the vast collection in the Bardo. There were only a few people visiting when we were there.",
          "A lovely little museum with mosaics of exceptional quality. The marine head of the ocean God is particularly fine with a haunting quality about it. Not to be missed!",
          "This museum is a little gem, well worth a visit, for a small entry fee, they have an amazing collection of Roman artefacts, lots of things to explore, the Roman mosiacs are truly beautiful . It's quite a small museum , two hours will easily be enough time to see and appreciate",
          "Easy to find right off the main road. Entrance was obvious and you can pay extra to take photos (1TND). Nice collection of mosaics and artifacts. Descriptions in Arabic, French and English. You can walk around the grounds and climb stairs although the best views were",
          "It never ceases to surprise me how under visited this great museum is, especially by the locals. Great collection of well displayed Roman Mosaics. I've been four times now and always enjoy it. Combine it with a visit to the Medina as both are at the same side of town.",
          "Very well displayed collection. Virtually empty when our group were there. Excellent toilets, always a plus!",
          "It was a great pleasure to visit this museum, it contains mosaics and archeological items of the punic area , roman, chrestien roman and bisantien ampire...I advise everyone to visit it. If you are a tunisian or you have a tunisian residency card you can get in for free in every",
          "I have see many mosaic collections in Tunisia and this one is probably the best one after Bardo. The whole place is nice, clean and makes it an important place to visit in Sousse and the entire Tunis. See pictures attached! It is up on hill from the sea and the Mdina, you can",
          "This museum worth visiting if you\u2019re in town.we paid 9 Tunisian Dirahm entrance fee .You may also combine your visit with Sousse Medina just few hundred meters from back entrance. The place is well designed architecture .",
          "This is a must see if you are ever in Sousse. I visited this museum when I was a kid about 30 years ago. And boy did it change for the better. The collection of artifacts have improved. The way artifacts are displaced is amazing with mirrors, lights and even seats to admire the",
          "A synchronized museum, with some interesting things to see, inside an old fortress. A much see in Sousse!!",
          "This is a small-medium sized museum located just on the outskirts of the Sousse Medina, accessible via the outside of the Medina (rather than within the walls). The museum is visually extremely impressive, located in a stunning old Sousse fort. The exhibits focus on just",
          "We visited there because we found the review on TripAdvisor that it was worth to visit who loves mosaic. Collection really well but ticket a bit expensive I guess (9 dinar per person). If you are boring to swim on the sea only, you can visit to see.",
          "One of largest collections of Roman mosaics in the world - just beautiful. Even worth seeing this museum paired with the Bardo Museum in Tunis.",
          "Really amazing and well maintained museum and has many great so old statues from the ancient history from more than 2000 years and it is really must be seen during your visit to sousse",
          "Stopped off here on a visit to Sousse. It's not that easy to find. You need to walk through Sousse medina or drive around it to the top of the city. The museum is impressive - very similar to the Bardo - and you can easily spend a good 1-2 hours here. For those concerned",
          "Certainly worth a visit if you like Roman history as the quality of the collection of mosaics is very good and well displayed. Just check the opening times before you go. As is usual in Tunisia, it lacks any guided tours, informative signage or information but don't let that",
          "Lovely place to visit some great facts about the island. Make sure you go with a guided tour. Worth a visit though",
          "Very interesting this was a few years ago just to see how in those days they could build that and it is still standing also well worth going to Jem where the old Roman ruins and still standing and all the things they have dug up and still finding things",
          "This museum houses the majority of Roman ruins found around the Sousse area. It is well worth visiting. It is clean and well-kept.",
          "Sousse for me is the one of nicest city in Tunesia.There is so many things to see and to enjoy.Medina is like open market I bought so many things .French fortresses and mosques are to visit.If someone like arabic spaices is right place to by.Dont walk or stay in the street and",
          "Amazing historical mosaics and pottery finds mostly found in sousse or nearby in Tunisia. leading into the narrow streets of the old medina.",
          "We were so pleasantly surprised by the Sousse Museum. Fabulous mosaics and a baptismal pool that reminds one of the Christian heritage of the area.",
          "The most important and interesting mosaics were those of Medusa and Poseidon. They are must-sees. The museum is housed in a glass shell - very airy and bright. Nice to spend 1-2 hours in.",
          "A must see if you are in Sousse. Like the Bardo museum in Tunis, this place houses mostly mosaics but the Sousse museum is a more manageable size so it can be done even with small children. Some of the mosaics, such as the large Medusa, are in good condition and look fabulous.",
          "At the top of the Medina in Sousse you will find the Museum. Recently refurbished and very smart and clean. Lovely views of the (Punic) walls too. The exhibits are not large, but entirely stunning. The mosaics are almost worth visiting Tunisia just to see!",
          "Very interested place. In old castle. To exhibit paintings and artifacts from ancient roman period to 2-3 centuries. I most exciting expositions from history of first Cristian's. There is stella's from graves people's who's was bury here.",
          "If you love art, culture and history don't miss the opportunity. The museum is located within the fortification of the old city.",
          "Great mosaics, friendly staff that went out of their way for a special needs child, handicapped accessible, clean, well presented, our favourite piece was the baptismal font. Amazing!",
          "Unfortunately, we have not been for some time but still reflect on how spacious, modern, clean and interesting this museum is. Seems a little tucked up the street but easy to find. From entrance to the Medina walk straight up the hill past the buses and following the outside",
          "it's really great how history is preserved through these ancient walls packed with small shops and friendly locals",
          "a lovely museum in the heart of the typical medina of Sousse, rich with the roman collection of mosaic",
          "As long as you don't need to ask a local how to get here - I travelled the length of Sousse medina for times before someone knew where it was and sent me in the right direction. Wonderful exhibits and friendly staff make this a great place to visit. Don't miss it.",
          "I viste this place many time its very beautiful I like it , its a old place and it have a good historyand its a public place and u find what u need there I mean its a very good place that I visited",
          "A bit like Bardo Museum, but not that big. You could get some knowledge of Tunisia in the Carthage time and the arts in that period. Lots of masterpieces to view.",
          "It is a museum with quite a bit of mosaic collections. However, if you have visited Bardo national museum before, this place will be quite boring. I was quite disappointed at the end.",
          "The Sousse Archeological Museum is one of the top two or three most beautiful and high-quality museums that I visited in Tunisia. Reopened in 2012 after extended restorations, the museum displays a fine collection of objects, with primary emphasis given to the magnificent",
          "The castle built by the Aghlabi dynasty is in great shape. The minaret has a magnificent overlook of the old city. Too much history and culture. The castle has been renovated but it maintains its overall look. across from the castle is a new shop which shows a contrast of the",
          "if you are any way intressted in ainchant remains this is for you,this place is a total roman town which arciolegists have slowly uncoverd,and reveadle the most beutefull roman mosaks i have ever seen.",
          "The museum contains the second largest collection of mosaics in the world after Bardo National Museum at the Tunisian capital \u2013 a true treasure trove. Some votive stelae and urns are displayed at the punic room date from the 7th century BC. Until the 2nd century AD, they were",
          "Absolute must visit. There isn't much in terms of artifacts to see, but the building itself and very impressive and the views are spectacular. Easy to access near the beginning of the medina, it was very quiet when I visited. Walk all the steps and keep going up in the tower to",
          "excellent opportunity to discover Sousse through thousands of years. from civilisation to an other and from dynasty to an other the museum is a fantastic opened historical Book .",
          "Nice place, rather interesting. Tickets cost 9 dn for a person. There are a lot of Byzantium mosaics and bowls. A few sculptures",
          "Great place, cheap to get in. Intersting to see the mosaics. Spent around an hour here. AS we went during Ramadan it was very quiet, as were most tourist attractions, which was great. WE only saw two other people there. Ramadan is an excellent time to go to Tunisia. Quiet,",
          "Excellent, very well preserved artifacts. Wonderful collection of mosaics and well presented . Very helpful staff.",
          "Excellent for History & Cultural Buffs.... Located in the Right Hand Side Corner on route to the Medina just past the Mosque..",
          "Really relaxing and scenario atmosphere inside and outside the museum. It also surrounded by residential areas, where you can experience the normal Tunisians lifestyle.",
          "Nice quiet and relaxing atmosphere. Doesn't have the \"workers\" standing around to show you something then asking you for money! I paid the extra few Dinar to take photos and I think it was worth it. A lovely building with some lovely ladies at the entrance who were polite and",
          "A nice museum that consists mostly of mosaics. Some are very impressive and it is well worth the visit. You can work your way around the whole museum in a couple of hours maximum and is a nice place to visit before or after going to the medina for some shopping.",
          "Another excellent maintained archaeological site which offers good info/history and most excellent views from the top of the building. Bring a torch for going up the crooked staircase and a camera for those stunning views. Can be noisy early on when tour groups visit so mid",
          "This is a lovely building in its own right and has many ancient artifacts within its walls. It is part of the walled Medina and is well worth a visit.",
          "If you are into Archaeology you will find this well worth a visit. Makes you think how they put up this stunning castle like building so long ago.",
          "Fantastic museum, the mosiac art is amazing and seeing all the statues and artifacts that are so old makes you feel like your stepping back in history, really enjoyed our visit!",
          "Not exactly the same as Bardo but a good place to go if you are in the area. Mostly mosaics and some relics are displayed but as mentioned, not as extensive as their National Museum.",
          "Really nice mosaic works, like the head of Medussa, Zeus... Very interesting museum inside the kasbah of Sousse. You can climb on a wall to see the city medina.",
          "Taxi costs about 5-6 dinars each way. Mosaics are absolutely amazing and the whole museum is very entertaining.",
          "There isn't loads of exhibits here so don't expect to need much more than 30 minutes. What they have is quite interesting though, particularly if you're interested in Roman Carthage. The highlights are definitely the Medusa and Dionysus mosaics. Sadly, it seems most of Sousse's",
          "The mosaics here are incredible and so well preserved. The staff was happy to talk to us about how they were recovered and maintained. Very impressive and worth a visit.",
          "My holiday was going well and I went to the museum by foot. A spectacular building both inside and out. Their was rather a lot of people around and you didnt get much free time to look around but all was enjoyed. We had to cancel 4 trips due to an incident involving misguided",
          "This is a lovely place to visit, the mosaics are amazing. Well worth a look if you're in sousse. When you pay for your tickets you get a map, on it it says there is a cafe. We spent 20mins looking for it and eventually asked at the entrance, it doesn't exist haha! So take a",
          "The museum is well worth a visit it's well laid out with really helpful staff Plenty to see and really good guide book Go and see it your on holiday",
          "This museum is not well publicised, but is a real jewel in the heart of Sousse. Its a pity that so few tourists know about it or take the time to visit it. We have ben to the Bardo and numerous historical sites during previous visits to Tunisia, but were amazed by the displays.",
          "I have visited the Bardo Museum many years ago and now that this has been refurbished I must say that this is a Must Visit when in Sousse. The Staff don't speak much English which is something that could be improved upon but all the exhibits are illustrated in Arabic/French and",
          "We began our visit with a problem, having paid our 9dinar each admission,there were no descriptive leaflets in English. However all of the wonderful Mosaics which we really marvelled at, were labled in English as were the marble statues. Unfortunately when we wanted some more",
          "If you are staying in Sousse it is well worth a visit. The mosaics are particularly amazing and if you are travelling with kids rather than taking a long bus trip to the Bardo in Tunis this is probably a really good option instead.",
          "I have three criteria for museums - interesting exhibits, allowing photos, and having information in English that makes a subject interesting. This place gets high marks for all three - even as someone that usually sees my eyes glaze over when it comes to history, there's plenty",
          "Loverly mosaics and pleanty of history reasanable entry at 9 Dinars, if you are not interested in this sort of museum",
          "Given the recent attacks the Bardo is now out of consideration. We did however immensely enjoy the Sousse museum which was packed with the most wonderfully detailed mosaics. It took us about 1 1/2hrs to walk around so you do not suffer museum fatigue. Highly recommended. It does",
          "If you are into ancient history, it is a wonderful little museum. Some real treasures and amazing mosaics.",
          "The museum has recently reopened after a major restoration of the building. It is now restored to its former glory with a magnificent display of Roman mosaics, not to be missed. I was rather concerned to the future fate of the brilliant mosaics displayed around a glasses in",
          "We went and were told its closed can you not read ?? It was in Arabic how was I meant to translate that,doors open no one to ask until this man came and said this.....mad place tunisia they want your money but not the tourists ....asked when it would open man said I don't speak",
          "A really great museum. Almost as good as Bardo. A very fine collection of mosaics in a beautiful location",
          "A excellent view of 2nd & 3rd AD mosaics. The 2nd AD are in better condition. Not to say the 3rd AD are not of Interest. This museum is based in an old building but with modern design allowing natural light in to enhance the mosacis. This Museum. Its located north east of the",
          "A very nicely displayed set of mosaics in a newly revamped building in a corner of the medina. Some of the exhibits are really exceptional (both in quality of preservation and design) when compared to the Roman mosaics one might see in many European museums. Entrance fee is",
          "beautiful building. Big ones can go for a walk. The location may be quiet and loud. Not to be missed.",
          "Beautiful building in South west of medina with a nice collection of mosaics with descriptions.You can easily spend an hour to 2 hours",
          "Located at the rear of the huge medina in sousse, the archaelogical museum promises a fascinating glimpse of the past. As a lover of history, i was tempted. I have to say that i was disappointed. Having been to the Bardo museum in Tunis, the one in sousee is very much the poor",
          "It's well worth a visit to see an amazing collection of huge floor and wall mosaics! It's situated in the old Kasbah which is quite an imposing building in Sousse.",
          "Stunning building housing this collection of mosaics. Well worth an hour of your time exploring this building.",
          "Intereasting, the mosaics were excellent. The lifts were not working but this was not a problem for us but for other people it would be.",
          "Wonderful location excellant displays of Mosiac right up their with the Brado in Tunis just smaller. Location of the. 6 th century Bekalta baptismal font stunning Bzantine Mosiac work. Don't miss throughly enjoyed time spent and outstanding renovation work and displays of",
          "it renovating and very interesting, it's not very big, but there is unique archeoligic pices , with mosaics",
          "This museum is located in the Sousse Kasbah, the 11th C fortress which takes up the south west corner of the medina. It contains a wealth of large mosaics from the numerous roman ruins which dot this part of the Tunisian coast. Look for the Triumph of Neptune, and the god",
          "Has been renovated recently, very nice mosaics well conserved and a big number of sculptures but unfortunately the descriptions and explanations are in a small characters.",
          "You'll find Roman history littered around Tunisia. The museum is no exception and they've gathered a fair amount of mosaics in one place! I have to say I'm not terribly interested in mosaics and after the first few I was ready to leave again... the outside area is really nice",
          "It s a beautiful country, but reputation destroyed by the hotel, Tax \u2013 The tourist tax introduced in October 2014. The hotel will not allow us to pay at the hotel. The information states that we can pay this tax at the hotel",
          "Please do visit this is a get little museum full of great roman & Christian relics. A taxi here costs less than \u00a31 & it's well worth it",
          "Wasn't expecting this at all. Totally fantastic pieces of mosaic works. Recommended. A great time to pass a few hours and so calm and tranquil inside too.",
          "The Sousse Museum was great the mosac,s are great so well preserved and the sculptur is to would recomend to all you are able to take picture,s with a ticket bought when you pay to go in.",
          "Very interesting - objects from as far back as 1st Century. There is a really cool baptismal font as well. A welcome cool spot for an hour out of the sun.",
          "This is the most important museum in Sousse and a must-see. There are really great objects there to see. Ancient and interesting and well-preserved. If you're a student, don't forget to bring your International student card. It will be free. Also if you go up the building, it",
          "Well worth a visit little bit pricey but if you like history and want to learn more about the history of Sousse and Tunisia.",
          "The museum is a fantastic place to visit, starting with the striking entrance. Inside you will pay 9 Dinars and an additional 1 Dinar to be allowed to use your camera (why wouldn\u2019t you pay for this?) the main part of the museum is underground in a really well air conditioned",
          "Grat place to learn about the history of this beautiful country. take a guide to explain the history and enjoy",
          "Interesting museum and in the centre of Sousse near the medina. Collection of beautiful mosaics. Combine the visit with a shopping trip.",
          "Depends if you like this sort of thing. Can be quite boring and not all parts of the museum are open to the public.",
          "took awhile to find it, but worth it and it was very interesting. it was an old house as they used to live, there was also a guide in english and all free!",
          "Loved all the original Roman Mosaics,some that you could walk over. The guide did an excellent job of giving us all the history of the Mosaics.",
          "Worth a trip, if only for the ice cold air con! Lots of roman stuff, and very large, near complete mosaics. 9DT per adult, kids free :o)",
          "Our visit to Sousse Archeological Museum was one of the highlights of our holiday.I was last in Sousse 15 years ago and I don't recall this museum being there so visiting it now in it's fine form filled all our cultural needs at a very reasonable entrance fee,though we were",
          "very interesting, so much to explore and imagine i really didnt know there was so much to the country, A must",
          "A very interesting place and well laid out. It's cheap a 2.5 \u20ac. The roman house really comes alive. Please give generously to the guides as they are volunteers.",
          "Fantastic museum. The Roman mosaics are fabulous. The workmanship of the mosaic workers from almost 2000 years ago is simply outstanding. I think the bath that is mentioned in earlier reviews is in fact an early Christian baptismal pool. My personal favourite is the mosaic",
          "they have on display some excellent roman mosaics and a roman bath along with some statues be advised to take pictures in the museum you pay 1 denar",
          "The Sousse Museum is really a treasure with an extensive collection of North African mosaics from the Roman and Byzantine periods. I came to Tunisia specifically to go to this museum, and it did not let me down. The museum is very modern, with labels in Arabic, French, and",
          "Very interesting. mosaics we're very impressive. The guide was very helpful. Went to colossium before the museum also recommended.",

          "There are some great mosaics and there is a fantastic view of the city, but the layout is a bit weird. When you are outside above the gallery space, there are stairwells that lead to offices. We thought the rooms were more galleries but when we got up the stairs, there were",
          "What an amazing place - we took my 8 year old daughter who was mesmerised by the beautiful mosaics. Such a shame that the Thomson hotel rep doesn't tell anyone about it! The museum is clean, informative and air conditioned. On the site which was the original kasbah are wonderful",
          "One of the top attractions there. It was a bid hard to find it, because it is placed in Medina, and if you go there it is very hard to orientate only with a map, need to have gps",
          "Small and well maintained museum with amazing mosaics - so very beautiful. They must have looked so lovely in their original houses\u2026particularly liked the one of the Nilotic scene with the peasants pulling a donkey out of the crocodile's mouth! Some fine tigers too. Very plesant",
          "Beautiful mosaics and a great courtyard. Price is 9TD + 1TD for camera - worth visiting this place for 1 hour and you can do this on your own and don't require any guides at all.",
          "Very informative sign in varies languages on exibits lots to see small charge for camera ticket so could take pictures",
          "Stunning mosaics of every shape and colour imaginable .Our tour guide really brought it to life and tho it was raining the outside villa was lovely and took yopu right back into history",
          "This would be considered excellent in Britain. It had some very good exhibits, well portrayed and all had explanations of what they depicted in English and French. It is not my sort of interest normally, but this is very well worth a visit.",
          "This was rated number one visitor attraction on trip advisor before I went so was on my 'must see' list for my holiday. It did not disappoint. I have a new found fascination with mosaics now. Incredible artistry and excellent information about each piece at the side of it. Staff",
          "Amazing mosaics the like of which I have never seen before. Beautiful muted colours, tiny pieces of mosaic dating from 3rd CE. Brilliantly displayed in modern museum. Some only discovered quite recently. A 'must' if you are in Tunisia!",
          "Fab small museum of mosaics in the medina. Well presented and really interesting. The baptismal pool was amazing as well as the size of some of the mosaics. I quite liked how they had tastefully sketched in the missing bits on some of them to give you an overall idea of how the",
          "A superb collection of mosaics ... excellent pretension of the display ... some superb artefacts with adequate interpretation .",
          "very smart museum built into the old citadel, with an azaming collection of mosaics - and deserted! well worth the walk uphill through the medina.",
          "After the busy-ness of the souk, this is a calm cool place. The mosaics downstairs are really interesting and well-explained, the highlight being an ancient baptismal pool. The garden and courtyard upstairs is tranquil with jasmine and butterflies. Work was still being done",
          "Visited today 10td entrance fee with camera. A must see for anyone interested in history. Only took about an hour to walk around but it was defiantly wort while as it was a very cloudy day.",
          "Absolutely brilliant museum and well worth a visit. This is not a large museum but the quality of the mosaics is breathtaking. If you have any interest in classical histrory you must not miss this",
          "The Museum is a little hard to find as it at the top end of the Medina close to the outer wall but it is well worth it, plus you get to have a good look around the Medina",
          "We went here after going to the medina - it's a nice relief after the heat of the markets. Nice pieces to see and takes about 60min,",
          "The mosaics were beautiful and the Roman collections. Entry fee was very cheap a grat place to spend an hour or two. Watch out it's near the medina and you get the usual scammers hanging around.",
          "Well preserved and beautifully presented mosaics. This is a very modern museum sited in an historic setting.",
          "It was a very interesting place but read up before you go there. Not much help with guide and language. My 4 yr old fell in love with all the roman stories I told him and loved moving around the place imaging gladiators and lions. we got some discount at the entrance because as",
          "Was very impressed with the renovations that have occurred at the museum. It is easy to move around and see the exhibits and very professionally done. They have increased the price a bit, but nothing compared to what you would pay in Europe.",
          "We went to Sousse for our honeymoon and the visit to the museum was certainly one of the best memories to bring back. We did have a bad experience while coming to the place as someone tried to charge us for sitting on a public bench (we told him where to go). Outside the",

        "wiki": "Habib Ben Ali Bourguiba (; Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0628\u064a\u0628 \u0628\u0648\u0631\u0642\u064a\u0628\u0629\u200e, romanized: al-\u1e24ab\u012bb B\u016brq\u012bbah; 3 August 1903 \u2013 6 April 2000) was a Tunisian lawyer, nationalist leader and statesman who led the country from 1956 to 1987 as Prime minister of the Kingdom of Tunisia (1956-57) then as the first President of Tunisia (1957-87). Prior to his presidency, he led the nation to independence from France, ending the 75 year-old protectorate and earning the title of \"Supreme Combatant\".\nBorn in Monastir to a poor family, he attended Sadiki College then Lyc\u00e9e Carnot in Tunis, before obtaining his baccalaureate in 1924. He graduated from the University of Paris in 1927 and returned to Tunis to practice law. In the early 1930s, he became involved in anti-colonial and Tunisian national politics, joining the Destour party and co-founding the Neo Destour in 1934. He rose as a key figure of the independence movement and was repeatedly arrested by the colonial administration. His involvement in the riots of 9 April 1938 resulted in his exile to Marseille during World War II. \nIn 1945, Bourguiba was released and moved to Cairo, Egypt, to seek the support of the Arab League. He returned to the country in 1949 and rose to prominence as the leader of the national movement. Although initially committed to peaceful negotiations with the French government, he had an effective role in the armed unrest that started in 1952 when they proved to be unsuccessful. He was arrested and imprisoned on La Galite Island for two years, before being exiled in France. There, he led negotiations with Prime minister Pierre Mend\u00e8s France and obtained internal autonomy agreements in exchange for the end of the unrest. Bourguiba returned victorious to Tunis on June 1, 1955, but was challenged by Salah Ben Youssef in the party leadership. Ben Youssef and his supporters disagreed with Bourguiba's \"soft\" policies and demanded full independence of the Maghreb. This resulted in a civil war that opposed Bourguibists, who favored a stepwise policy and modernism, and Youssefists, the conservative Arab nationalist supporters of Ben Youssef. The conflict ended with the Sfax Congress of 1955 in favor of Bourguiba. \nFollowing the country's independence in 1956, Bourguiba was appointed prime minister by king Muhammad VIII al-Amin and acted as De facto ruler before proclaiming the Republic, on 25 July 1957. He was elected interim President of Tunisia by parliament until the ratification of the Constitution. During his rule, he implemented a strong education system, worked on developing the economy, supported gender equality and proclaimed a neutral foreign policy, making him an exception among Arab leaders. The main reform that was passed was the Code of Personal Status which settled a modern society. He set a strong presidential system which turned to be a twenty-year one-party state dominated by his own, the Socialist Destourian Party. A cult of personality also developed around him, before he proclaimed himself president for life in 1975, during his fourth 5 year-term. \nThe end of his 30 year-rule was marked by his declining health, a war of succession, and the rise of clientelism and Islamism. On 7 November 1987, he was removed from power by his prime minister, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and kept under house arrest in a residence in Monastir. He remained there to his death and was buried in a mausoleum he had previously built.\n\n\n== 1903\u201330: Early life ==\n\n\n=== Childhood years ===\nBourguiba was born in Monastir, the eighth child and final son of Ali Bourguiba and Fatouma Khefacha. Bourguiba's official birthdate is 3 August 1903, though he stated he was likely born a year earlier, on 3 August 1902, or possibly 1901. Bourguiba's mother gave birth to him when she was 40, which, according to Bourguiba, was a source of great shame for her. His father, who was 53 years old, wondered whether he could raise him properly. Despite financial hardship, Ali Bourguiba gave great importance to the education of his children. He was enrolled in the army by general Ahmed Zarrouk, and spent nineteen years of his life campaigning before retiring. Eager to avoid such a fate for his last child, he decided to ensure Habib obtained his Certificat d'\u00e9tudes primaires, which would dispense him from military service, just like his elder sons. Around the time Bourguiba was born, his father became councilman, and was, therefore, part of the notables of the city. This allowed him to improve both his financial and social situation and permitted him to provide a modern education future for his last son, just like his brother.\n\nHabib Bourguiba grew up among women, as his brother was in Tunis and his father was elderly. He spent his days with his mother, grandmother and sister, A\u00efcha and Nejia, which permitted him to notice the casual household chores of women and their inequality with men. After starting his elementary education in Monastir, his father sent him to Tunis in September 1907, when he was 5, to pursue his studies at the Sadiki primary school. The young boy was profoundly affected by the separation from his mother at that early age. At the time of his arrival, the city was struggling against the protectorate, an early phase of the Tunisian national movement led by Ali Bach Hamba. Meanwhile, Habib settled in the wealthy neighbourhood of Tourbet el Bey in the medina of Tunis, where his brother, M'hamed, rented a lodging on Korchani Street. As the school year began, his brother enrolled him in Sadiki College where the superintendent described him as \"turbulent but studious\".The young Habib spent his vacations in Monastir, aiding others with chores. At the end of the holiday season, he returned to Tunis where, after classes, he used to wander around in the streets. On Thursdays, he watched the bey chair the weekly seals ceremony.  The Jellaz demonstrations of 1911 and the resulting execution of Manoubi Djarjar that followed influenced his nascent political opinions. Bourguiba earned his certificat d'\u00e9tudes primaires in 1913, which greatly satisfied his father. Bourguiba avoided military service, and, like his elders, was admitted as an internal in Sadiki College to pursue his secondary studies freely. His mother died in November 1913, when he was 10 years old.\n\n\n=== Teenage years and secondary studies ===\nWhen World War I started in September 1914, Bourguiba moved out from his brother's house and settled in the dormitories of Sadiki College. Budgetary restrictions, enacted in order to support the war effort, contributed to malnutrition and inadequate supplies. These circumstances led students to protest, and Bourguiba soon came to participate. He admired Habib Jaouahdou, a student who told others about national struggles beyond the walls of high school. Jaouahdou proposed that they welcome Abdelaziz Th\u00e2albi when he returned from exile, Bourguiba being part of the welcoming Sadiki delegation. In addition, the funerals of nationalist leader Bechir Sfar in Jellaz had also impacted him, as he travelled with his father. At school, one of his professors taught him the art of French writing and, indirectly, Arab literature. Despite that, his grades were low; Bourguiba did not pass his Arabic patent in 1917, which would have allowed him to get an administrative function. The headmaster permitted him to restart his sixth and final year of high school, in 1919\u201320. But the winter season and aforementioned malnutrition severely worsened his health, and he was hospitalized following his primary infection. Accordingly, he was obliged to abandon his studies and remain at the hospital.\n\nIn order to heal, Bourguiba spent nearly two years living with older brother Mohamed, medic at the local hospital of Kef who also happened to be a strong modernist and advocating secularism. Mohamed lived with an Italian nurse who welcomed young Habib properly and had an important part in his improvement, by \"filling in his emotional void\", according to Souhayr Belhassen and Sophie Bessis. His journey in there, which lasted 21 months from January 1920, was a major turning point in his life. The inhabitants of the city helped him integrate: He learned how to play cards, discussed military strategies, got interested in Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk and also visited his other brother, Ahmed, in Thala where he learned horse riding. He also participated in theatrical activities. Bourguiba rehearsed with his brother, who had a passion for theater and performed on stage. The foundation of the Destour party while he was in Kef, increased Bourguiba's interest in Tunisian nationalism. He expressed his will to pursue his secondary studies and thus, study law in France, so he could struggle against the colonial power. The family council that was held to discuss this matter was a complete failure, his brothers considering him as \"unsuccessful\" and were not ready to finance his studies. Only his thirty years old single brother, Mahmoud, promised to aid him. With his support, Bourguiba was enrolled in Lyc\u00e9e Carnot of Tunis, in classe de seconde, because he was too weak to study in classe de premi\u00e8re.In high school, Bourguiba achieved high grades in Mathematics with the help of the new teacher that taught him. He obtained excellent results and ended up choosing Philosophy section, after passing the first part of baccalaureate. He also became friends with Tahar Sfar and Bahri Guiga. The group was called the \"Sahelian Trio\". He often went to libraries and showed interest in history even though, sometimes, he skipped classes, mainly on Friday afternoons, to attend Habiba Msika's performance of L'Aiglon. He was soon affected by the inequalities between French and Tunisians. In 1922, when Naceur Bey threatened to abdicate because of resident-general Lucien Saint's maneuvers, public opinion decided to mobilize for this nationalist bey. On 22 April 1922, Bourguiba was part of the protesters to support the monarch. Influenced by that event, he used to participate in debates with his friends and got interested in political and philosophical learning, supporting socialism. In 1923\u201324, his final year was fundamental as he had a tight contest with another French classmate, in order to obtain a scholarship to study in Paris. He also benefited from the support of his brother Mahmoud, who promised to send him 50 francs per month. In 1924, he sat for his baccalaureate and obtained outstanding marks with honours. At the end of exams, Bourguiba embarked on an old boat, Le Oujda, in order to pursue his studies in France and discover the colonial power.\n\n\n=== Higher education in Paris ===\nWhen he arrived in Paris, Bourguiba settled in Saint-S\u00e9verin hotel, near Place Saint-Michel, where he occupied a room located on the sixth floor for 150 francs per month. Having had some hard times, his problems were resolved as he obtained a scholarship of 1800 francs, payable in two installments, and enrolled in Paris law School, in the Sorbonne to attend psychology and literature classes. Aware that he came to France to \"arm himself intellectually against France\", he devoted himself to law and to the discovery of French civilization. Bourguiba often participated in political debates, read newspapers and followed closely the evolution of French politics during the Third Republic. Sensitive to the ideas of Leon Blum, following the Congress of Tours, he was opposed to the Bolsheviks and got interested in Gandhi's process to transform the Indian national Congress in a powerful mass organization. In addition, he showed a great interest in his fellow Tunisian, Mahmoud El Materi.\n\nAfter vacations spent between Mahdia and Monastir, Bourguiba returned to Paris for the start of the 1925\u201326 school year, worried about the nationalist struggle in his country. His conditions improved as he moved in the University Campus in Jourdan boulevard, where he lodged in room number 114. The sponsor, Ta\u00efeb Radhouane, sent him through the association Les Amis de l'\u00e9tudiant, the registration fees to register for Paris Institute of Political Studies, where he started to attend public finance classes. He also obtained a financial aid from his friend and protector, Mounier-Pillet, who was his former teacher in Monastir. The same year, his friends Sfar and Guiga, joined him while he was tutoring a young Sfaxian boy, Mohamed Aloulou, sent by his parents to sit for the baccalaureate exam in Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand. One day of 1925, while tidying his room, Bourguiba found the address of a woman his protector recommended him to meet: Mathilde Lefras, a 35 years old widow whose husband died during the war. He met her for the first time in her apartment, on the first floor of a building in the 20th arrondissement of Paris. She invited him to enter and asked him to tell his story. Touched by his background, she asked to see him once again, and, in the upcoming months, invited him to move in with her. Since then, he gave away his room in the campus and settled with Mathilde. With this new way of life, Bourguiba distanced himself from the other students but also the Tunisian struggle, as a strong repression started back at the country.During the summer of 1926, Bourguiba returned to Monastir but did not show any interest in political issues in his country. His father died in September and he received a telegram from Mathilde, announcing that she was pregnant. This situation and the parenting responsibility that lay ahead, worried him. Thus, he decided to raise the child, despite his friend's advice to abandon the baby and break up with Mathilde. This pregnancy reassured him as he thought he was sterile. But the relationship of the couple worsened to a point that Bourguiba left the house to sleep at his friends' place, back at the campus. On 9 April 1927, Mathilde gave birth to a boy, whom they named Jean Habib. They moved into another apartment in Bagneux, in the Parisian suburbs. Bourguiba, sick at the time, had to prepare for his final exams, which he sat for a month after the birth of his son. He obtained respectively a bachelor's degree in law and the higher degree of political studies from the Paris Institute of Political Studies.\n\n\n=== Early adult life and professional career ===\nIn August 1927, Bourguiba who was 26 at the time, returned to Tunisia, with his girlfriend, his son, Habib Jr. but also a deep knowledge of French politics during the Third Republic. His journey in France had influenced his thinking with the liberal values of the social-radical secular country, shared earlier by his brother Mohamed. Following his comeback in Tunisia, he married Mathilde, while Mahmoud Laribi was his best man and settled in Tunis. At the time, he was not interested in politics but in his professional career, every debuting lawyer having to do a three-year traineeship under the supervision of another experienced lawyer. For nearly a year (October 1927 to October 1928), he worked for Mr. Cirier, who dismissed him after six weeks, then for Mr. Pietra and Scemama, who did not pay him for two months and charged him with writing responsibilities. Bourguiba then resigned to work for Mr. Salah Farhat, chairman of the Destour party, until Mr. Sebault hired him for 600 francs per month, which led Bourguiba to work for him for an additional year than the three mandatory ones.\n\nIn that context of colonial oppression, Bourguiba felt the effects of inequality, mainly after he spent a whole year of unemployment. This inequality led him to discuss these matters with both Tunisian and French friends, who agreed with the necessity to start a reform process aiming to get Tunisia to resemble France, that was, liberal, modern and secular. On 8 January 1929, while replacing his brother who could not attend a conference held by Habiba Menchari, an unveiled woman who advocated gender equality, Bourguiba defended Tunisian personality by opposing Menchari's position to rid women of their veils. Bourguiba responded saying that Tunisia was threatened by forfeiture of personality and that it had to be preserved until the country got emancipated. This statement surprised liberals like the French unionist Joachim Durel. The controversy that followed opposed him to Bourguiba for nearly a month, Bourguiba writing in L'\u00c9tendard tunisien while Durel responded in Tunis socialiste.The year 1930 was the peak of French colonization in North Africa, which led France to celebrate the centenary of the French conquest of Algeria, by organizing a eucharistic congress in Tunisia. On this occasion, millions of Europeans invaded the capital city and went to the Saint-Lucien de Carthage cathedral, disguised as crusaders, which humiliated and revolted the people who protested against what they considered a violation of an Islam land by Christendom. The protesters, strongly repressed, were brought to justice and some of them had Bourguiba for lawyer, as he did not participate in the event. He also remained neutral when Tahar Haddad was dismissed from his duties of notary. He estimated at that moment, that the main goals were political, while other problems of society are secondary, insisting on the Tunisian personality and identity that had to affirm, declaring: \"Let us be what we are before becoming what we will\".\n\n\n== 1930\u201334: Early political career ==\n\nIn the beginning of the 1930s, Habib Bourguiba, feeling the effects of colonial inequalities, decided to join the main political party of the Tunisian national movement, the Destour, alongside his brother M'hamed and his mates Bahri Guiga, Tahar Sfar and Mahmoud El Materi. Revolted by the festivities of the 30th eucharistic congress, held from 7 to 11 May 1930 in Carthage, and which he considered as a \"violation of islamic lands\", the young nationalists found it necessary to get involved. With the upcoming preparations for the 50th anniversary celebration of the protectorate and the scheduled visit of French president Paul Doumer, the young nationalists decided to act. Bourguiba denounced the rejoicing, in the newspaper Le Croissant, ran by his cousin Abdelaziz El Aroui, as a \"humiliating affront to the dignity of the Tunisian people to whom he recalls the loss of freedom and independence\". Therefore, the leaders of the Destour party gathered in emergency at Orient Hotel, in February 1931, where it was decided to found an endorsing committee to the newspaper of Chedly Khairallah, La Voix du Tunisien, which switched from weekly to daily and has among its editors the young nationalist team.\n\nBourguiba multiplied his denunciations of the attempts aiming the Tunisian personality but also the beylical decree system and Europeans' advantages in his numerous articles in L'\u00c9tendard tunisien and La Voix du Tunisien, claiming Tunisian access to all administrative positions. Soon, he described his own definition of the protectorate, challenging its existence, not just its effects like the elder nationalists did, by writing on 23 February 1931 that \"for a healthy strong nation that international competitions and a momentary crisis forced into accepting the tutelage of a stronger state, the contact of a more advanced civilization determines in it a salutary reaction. A true regeneration occurs in it and, through judicious assimilation of the principles and methods of this civilization, it inevitably come to realize in stages its final emancipation\".Thanks to the originality with which Bourguiba, Sfar, Guiga and El Materi addressed the problems, La Voix du Tunisien became a very popular newspaper. Their new reasoning attracted not only the interest of public opinion but also that of French preponderants, powerful businesspersons and great land owners, who had a strong influence on the colonial administration. Opposed to the daring work of the young team, they achieved the censorship of all nationalist papers through the Residence (the colonial government) on 12 May 1931. A few days later, Habib and M'hamed Bourguiba, Bahri Guiga, Salah Farhat and El Materi were all prosecuted. However, they succeeded in obtaining the adjournment of their trial until 9 June 1931. On that day, numerous people came to show their support to the charged team getting their trial to be postponed once again. In response to this decision, Resident-general Fran\u00e7ois Manceron, eager to put an end to the nationalist issue, achieved to outwit discord between Khairallah, the owner of the paper and the young nationalists. A conflict occurred between both parties about the management of La Voix du Tunisien which led to the team eager to take charge of the paper. However, because of the refusal of Khairallah, they decided to resign from the daily paper.Despite the split-up, the two Bourguibas, El Materi, Guiga and Bahri kept in touch and decided to found their own paper thanks to the aid of pharmacist Ali Bouhajeb. Therefore, on 1 November 1932, was published the first edition of L'Action Tunisienne which had as redactional committee the young team joined by Bouhageb and B\u00e9chir M'hedhbi. Thus, Bourguiba devoted his first article to budget. Soon disappointed by the resigned moderation of their elders, the young nationalists unleashed and took the defence of the lower classes. Bourguiba, who saw his popularity increase thanks to his writings, frequented often intellectual circles whom he had just met. He showed both clarity and accuracy in his writings, which revealed a talented polemicist, thanks to his strong legal expertise. Furthermore, he had worked on demonstrating the colonial exploitation mechanism by ascending from effects to causes, while showing a great interest in social phenomenons, inviting the workers and students to organize and thus, defend themselves better against exploitation. In addition, he encouraged the defense and safeguard of the Tunisian personality.\n\nWith the economic crisis deepening and the resigned moderation of the nationalists, Bourguiba and his fellow mates reckoned that a good cause would be necessary enough to rebuild the nationalist movement on new basis by choosing new methods of action. In February 1933, when M'hamed Chenik, banker and chairman of the Tunisian credit union, got into trouble with the Residence, Bourguiba is the only one to defend him., reckoning that this issue could permit him to rally the bourgeois class, considered as collaborator with France, and unify the country around nationalism. Nevertheless, it only ended up with the resignation of Guiga, M'hedhi and Bouhajeb. Thus, Bourguiba abandoned his lawyer work to concentrate on running the journal by his own. But the occasion to express himself soon turned up: The Tunisian naturalization issue, which was a popular case among the nationalists during the 1920s reappeared, in the start of 1933, with protests in Bizerte against the burial of a naturalized in a Muslim cemetery. Bourguiba decided to react and unleash a campaign to support the protests in L'Action Tunisienne which will soon be reprised by numerous nationalist newspapers, denouncing an attempt to Frenchify the \"whole Tunisian people\".The firm stance of Bourguiba led him to acquire a strong popularity among the nationalist circles. Furthermore, the congress held by the Destour which took place on 12 and 13 May 1933 in Tunis, ended in favor of the young team of L'Action tunisienne, elected unanimously in the executive party committee. This strong position among the movement permitted them to influence party decision, eager to unify all the factions among a nationalist front. In the meantime, due to the ongoing naturalist issue in Tunis, the Residence decided the suspension of every nationalist paper on 31 May, including L'Action Tunisienne but also the prohibition of Destour activity. However, the French government convinced that Manceron had acted tardily in taking expected measures, replaced him by Marcel Peyrouton on 29 July 1933. Bourguiba deprived of his freedom of speech in this repression atmosphere and trapped inside the Destour moderate policy, aspired to get his autonomy back.On 8 August, the occasion to express his views arrived when incidents began in Monastir following the burial of a naturalized child by force in a Muslim graveyard. Soon, law enforcement and population started a fight, which led Bourguiba to convince certain Monastirians to choose him as their lawyer. Furthermore, he led them to protest to the bey, on 4 September. The party leadership seeing this as an occasion to get rid of a new form of activism they dislike, decided to reprimand the young nationalist. Bourguiba, who considered the Destour and its leaders as an obstacle to his ambitions, decided to resign from the party on 9 September. Soon enough, he had learned from this experience. This success obtained by popular violent uprising showed the failure of the Destour's methods, consisting mainly of petitions. Only violence of determined groups could lead the Residence to step back and negotiate the solutions; this was his course of action until 1956.\n\n\n== 1934\u201339: Rising nationalist leader ==\n\n\n=== Founding of Neo-Destour and colonial repression ===\n\nAfter he resigned from the executive committee of Destour, Bourguiba was on his own once again. However, his fellow mates of L'Action Tunisienne soon were in conflict with the elders of the party, ending with the exclusion of Guiga, on 17 November 1933 and the resignation of El Materi, M'hamed Bourguiba and Sfar from the executive committee on 7 December 1933. Soon referred to as \"rebels\", they were joined by Bourguiba and decided to undertake a campaign all over the country and explain their political positions to the people. Meanwhile, the elders of the Destour unleashed a propaganda campaign aiming to discredit them. Therefore, the young team visited areas severely affected by the economic crisis, including Ksar Hellal and Moknine where they were reluctantly welcomed. Thanks to Ahmed Ayed, a wealthy and respected Ksar Hellal inhabitant, the occasion to explain themselves was given. On 3 January 1934, they gathered with a part of the Ksar Hellal population in his house to clarify the reasons of their conflict with the Destour and specify their conception of national struggle for emancipation.The speeches and determination to act of this new generation of nationalist was greatly welcomed by the Tunisian population which did not hesitate to criticize the \"neglect of the Destour leadership to defend their interests\". Upon the refusal of the executive committee to organize a special congress aiming to change their political orientations and thanks to the support of the population and notables, the \"secessionists\" decided to hold their own congress in Ksar Hellal on 2 March 1934. During the event, Bourguiba called the representatives to \"choose the men who shall defend in their name the liberation of the country\". The congress ended with the founding of a new political party, the Neo-Destour, presided by El Materi, and Bourguiba was designated chairman.\n\nAfter the party was founded, the Neo-Destour aimed to strengthen its position among the political movements. The young team faced the resident-general, Marcel Peyrouton, who was dedicated to stopping the nationalist protests in an economic crisis atmosphere, which was an opportunity to seduce a larger audience. Thus, they needed to earn a greater place on the political stage, spread their ideology and rally the supporters of a still-strong Destour, and also convince the lower classes that the Neo-Destour was their advocate. The Neo-Destour invited the lower classes to join in a \"a dignity tormented by half a century of protectorate\". Therefore, Bourguiba traveled all around the country and used new methods of communication different from that of the Destour elders. The lower classes, alienated and troubled by economic crisis, were convinced by his speech and joined his cause, bringing their full support to it. Units were created all over the country and a new structure was settled, making the Neo-Destour a more efficient movement than all those before. If the elders addressed the colonial oppressor to express their requests, the \"secessionists\" addressed the people. Even worldwide, the new party succeeded in finding support among French socialists, including philosopher and politician F\u00e9licien Challaye, who endorsed the Neo-Destour.However, in Tunisia, the Neo-Destour had to face the strong opposition of resident-general Peyrouton who, firstly, endorsed the initiative of the \"secessionists\", eyeing it as a mean to weaken the nationalist movement, but soon withdrew his support because of the new successful methods adopted by the young team and their unexpected requests. Indeed, Bourguiba and his fellows from the newly created-party soon showed \"more dangerous\" demands by asking for national sovereignty and the ascending of an independent Tunisia \"accompanied by a treaty guaranteeing France a preponderance both in the political as well as in the economic field compared to other foreign countries\", in an article published in L'Action Tunisienne.All these demands led to a conflict between the French government and the Tunisian nationalist movement. In addition, the party leadership secured the population to be sensitive to their message, thanks to their tours along the country. These tensions led the residence to answer the nationalist requests by serious measures of intimidation. The repression unleashed is furthermore violent: Peyrouton forbade all the newspapers still publishing including Tunis socialiste but also L'Humanit\u00e9 and Le Populaire, on 1 September 1934. On 3 September, the colonial government ordered raids against all nationalist leaders in the country, including both Destours and the Tunisian Communist Party. Bourguiba was arrested and then sent to Kebili, in the south, under military supervision. Meanwhile, the arrests of the mean leaders generated discontent among the population. While Guiga and Sfar tried to pacify them in order to negotiate the release of the imprisoned, Bourguiba and Salah Ben Youssef were for the retention of the unrest. Furthermore, riots occurred along the country, leading the residence to reinforce the repression. Soon, the South gathered a major part of Tunisian political leaders: The two Bourguibas in Tataouine, El Materi in Ben Gardane, Guiga in M\u00e9denine and Sfar in Zarzis.On 3 April 1935, all the deported were transferred in Bordj le Boeuf. Although glad to be all together, they were soon in conflict upon the strategy the party had to choose. While the majority were part of the decay of the uprising and the dismissal of the methods adopted in 1934, Bourguiba was opposed to any concession. \u00b7  Soon he was accused by his fellow detainees to \"lead them to their loss\"; Only Ben Youssef was not against Bourguiba's methods since 1934 but reckoned they needed to be free again at all cost and therefore, attempt to save what can still be. However, the conflict receded due to the hard conditions of detention aiming to coax them.\n\n\n=== From negotiation attempt to confrontation ===\n\nIn the start of 1936, due to the ineffective policy of Peyrouton, the French government proceeded to his replacement with Armand Guillon, designated in March whose mission is to reinstate peace. Therefore, he succeeded in putting an end to two years of colonial repression, promoting dialogue and freeing the nationalist detainees on 23 April. Thus, Bourguiba was sent to Djerba where he was visited by the newly settled resident-general who was ready to negotiate with him, aiming to put an end to the conflicts and pursue a new liberal and humane policy. On 22 May, Bourguiba was freed of all charges and had the permission to regain his home in Tunis, alongside his fellow detainees. Meanwhile, in France, the Popular Front ascended with the settlement of Leon Blum's cabinet in June. This was a great opportunity for the leaders, who had always been close to the socialists. Soon, they met Guillon who promised to restore restricted liberties. Very satisfied by their interview with Guillon, the leaders were convinced that the ascending of the Blum ministry and the arrival of Guillon as head of the colonial government would be the start of flourishing negotiations which would lead to independence, even though they did not state it publicly.On 10 June, the National Council of Neo-Destour gathered to establish a new policy towards this change in the French government. It ended with the endorsement of the new French policy and elaboration upon a series of feasible requests, to which the Neo-Destour expected a quick resolution. At the end of the meeting, Bourguiba was sent to Paris to set forth the platform of the party. In France, he became close to the Tunisian nationalist students such as Habib Thameur, H\u00e9di Nouira and Slimane Ben Slimane. Furthermore, he met under-secretary of state for foreign affairs, Pierre Vi\u00e9not, on 6 July 1936. This publicly stated interview was unpopular among the French colonialists in Tunisia, which led later meetings to be conducted secretly. But French authorities were opposed to the hopes of Tunisian militants, and some of them even thought that it was a mere illusion. When he returned to Tunis, in September, the political atmosphere had changed with the re-establishment of liberties, which permitted the expansion of Neo-Destour and an increase in its members.The resident-general in Tunisia introduced assimilation reforms by the end of 1936. This statement is the start of uprisings by the beginning of 1937. Vi\u00e9not, travelling to Tunisia, reacted by declaring that \"certain private interests of the French of Tunisia do not necessarily confound with those of France\". Meanwhile, Bourguiba went to Paris, and then to Switzerland to attend a lecture about the capitulation held in April in Montreux. There, he met numerous Arab nationalist representatives including Chekib Arslan, Algerian Messali Hadj and Egyptian Nahas Pasha.In June, the resigning Blum Cabinet was replaced by the third Chautemps Cabinet, led by Camille Chautemps. Due to the procrastination of the new cabinet, the nationalists resumed to their fight and were active in making their requests a reality. Therefore, Bourguiba wished that Abdelaziz Th\u00e2albi, founder of the Destour who had just returned from exile, endorsed the Neo-Destour to strengthen its positions. But his wish was not fulfilled for the elder leader had other prospects about the party, desiring to unify the old Destour with the new. Due to his refusal, Bourguiba decided to react by sabotaging Thaalbi's meetings. In Mateur, the fight ended with numerous deaths and injured but Bourguiba succeeded in strengthening his positions and appearing as the unique leader of the nationalist movement, rejecting, once and for all Pan-Arabism and anti-occidentalism. The split up was, therefore, final between both parties. Fearing attacks, the Destourian party gave up public meetings, using newspapers to respond their opponents.\nHowever, Bourguiba chose moderation regarding the relation with France. Meanwhile, within the party, two factions appeared: The first one, moderate, was led by El Materi, Guiga and Sfar, favoring dialogue while the second one, radical, was directed by the young members, including Nouira, Ben Slimane and Thameur, who were supporters of confrontation. At the time, Bourguiba was hesitant to choose between the two factions because he needed the support of the youth to gain domination upon the Neo-Destour, the leadership still being among the founding moderate members. Nevertheless, he soothed the tensions of the young, estimating that a confrontation with France would only have bad consequences and that the dialogue can still be favored. In the start of October, he flew to Paris, aiming to pursue negotiations, but returned without any result. Thus, he realized there was nothing to be awaited from France.\n\nIn this conjecture, was held the second congress of Neo-Destour in Tribunal Street, Tunis, on 29 October 1937. The voting of a motion regarding the relations with France was in the agenda. The congress represented the fight of the two factions which appeared within the last months. In his speech, Bourguiba tried to balance both trends. Upon reducing the influence of the Destour over the nationalist movement, he strongly defended the progressive emancipation policy which he had advocated:\n\nIndependence can happen only according to three formulas :\nA widespread, popular and violent revolution which will put an end to the protectorate ;\nA french military defeat during a war against another country ;\nA pacific stepwise solution, with the help of France and under its supervision.\nThe imbalance in the power forces between the people of Tunisia and those of France eliminates every chance for a popular victory. A French military defeat shall not bring independence because we shall fall under the claws of a new colonialism. Therefore, only the path of a peaceful liberation under the supervision of France, remains.\nThe congress, which finished on 2 November, ended by withdrawing its support to the French government and therefore, the confidence the party had granted it for nearly two years. Bourguiba, who helped numerous young people join the leadership, strengthened his position and authority among the Neo-Destour and ended up victorious.While the party twitched and the newly restored repression had ended with seven death in Bizerte, Bourguiba chose confrontation. On 8 April 1938, an organized demonstration happened peacefully but Bourguiba, convinced that violence was necessary, urged Materi to repeat the demonstrations by saying, \"Since there was no blood, we need to repeat. There must be blood spilled for them to speak of us\". His wish was satisfied the following morning. The riots of 9 April 1938 ended with one dead policemen, 22 protestors and more than 150 injured. \u00b7  The following day, Bourguiba and his mates were arrested and detained at the Civilian Prison of Tunis, where Bourguiba was interrogated. On 12 April, the Neo-Destour was dissolved, but its activism was pursued in secret. On 10 June 1939, Bourguiba and his companions were charged with conspiracy against public order and state security and incitement of civil war. Therefore, he was transferred to the penitentiary of T\u00e9boursouk.\n\n\n== 1939\u201345: World War II ==\nAt the outbreak of World War II, Bourguiba was transferred on board of a destroyer, into the fort of Saint-Nicolas in Marseille on 26 May 1940. There he shared his cell with H\u00e9di Nouira. Convinced that the war would end with the victory of the Allies, he wrote a letter to Habib Thameur, on 10 August 1942, to define his positions: Germany will not win the war and cannot win it. Between the Russian colossi but also the Anglo-Saxons, who hold the seas and whose industrial possibilities are endless, Germany will be crushed as if in the jaws of a irresistible vise [...] The order is given, to you and to the activists, to make contact with Gaulist French to combine our clandestine action [...] Our support must be unconditional. It is a matter of life and death for Tunisia.\n\nHe was transferred to Lyon and imprisoned in Montluc prison on 18 November 1942 then in Fort de Vancia until Klaus Barbie decided to free him and take him to Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne. He was greatly welcomed in Rome, alongside Ben Youssef and Ben Slimane, in January 1943, upon the request of Benito Mussolini who hoped to use Bourguiba to weaken the French resistance in North Africa. The Italian minister for foreign affairs tried to obtain from him a declaration in their favor. At his return's eve, he accepted to deliver a message to the Tunisian people, via Radio Bari, warning them against all the trends. When he returned to Tunis, on 8 April 1943, he guaranteed that his 1942 message was transmitted to all the population and its activists. With his position, he stood out from the collaboration of certain activists with the German occupant, settled in Tunisia in November 1942 and escaped the fate of Moncef Bey, dethroned with the liberation, in May 1943, by general Alphonse Juin, accusing him of collaboration. Bourguiba was freed by the Free French Force on 23 June.\nIn this period, he met Wassila Ben Ammar, his future second wife. Bourguiba, who was closely watched, did not feel like resuming the fight. Therefore, he requested the authorization to perform the pilgrimage of Mecca. This surprising request was refused by the French authorities. He then decided to flee in Egypt and in order to do that, crossed the Libyan borders, disguised as a caravan, on 23 March 1945 and arrived in Cairo in April.\n\n\n== 1945\u201349: Journey in Middle East ==\nBourguiba settled in Cairo, Egypt where he was aided by his former monasterial teacher, Mounier-Pillet, who lived in the Egyptian Capital city. There, Bourguiba met numerous personalities, such as Taha Hussein while participating in many events held in the city. He also met Syrians, who had just obtained their independence from France, and thus stated that \"with the means they dispose, Arab countries should show solidarity with the national liberation struggles of the Maghreb\". Even though his efforts were intensified, Bourguiba knew that nobody would support his cause as long as there was little tension between France and Tunisia. The Arab League was preoccupied mainly by the Palestinian issue, other requests not being their top-priority. Therefore, he charged Ben Youssef to start these Franco-Tunisian tensions so that he could attract the attention of the middle-east.Bourguiba pursued his efforts. Furthermore, he met Abd al-Aziz ibn Saud and tried to sensitize him to support the Tunisian nationalist struggle, but in vain. Due to the postponed promises of the people of Middle-East, Bourguiba decided to create an office of Neo-Destour in Cairo. Therefore, he invited Thameur, Rachid Driss, Ta\u00efeb Slim, H\u00e9di Sa\u00efdi and Hassine Triki, detained by France and freed by Germans during the war, to join him in the Egyptian Capital. They arrived on 9 June 1946, aiding Bourguiba to start the rallying point of the North African community in Cairo. Soon, they were joined by Algerian and Moroccan nationalists. Furthermore, Bourguiba's speech was famous among the Anglo-Saxon media, and Maghrebi nationalism became more efficient in Cairo. Bourguiba was more and more convinced that the key to the nationalist struggle resided within the United States whose interests were same as those of the Maghrebi nationalists. Thus, he was looking forward to go to the states and benefited from the support of Hooker Doolittle, American consul in Alexandria. Firstly, he went to Switzerland, then Belgium, and covertly passed the borders to get to Anvers, abroad the Liberty ship, on 18 November. On 2 December 1946, Bourguiba arrived in New York City while the session of the General Assembly of the United Nations opened.There, Bourguiba took part in numerous receptions and banquets which was for him an occasion to meet American politicians, such as Dean Acheson, under-secretary of State, whom he meets in January 1947. \u00b7  Upon his trip to the United States, Bourguiba concluded that the superpower would support Tunisia in case its case was submitted to the United Nations. He based this idea on the United Nations Charter, signed by France and which stipulated the right of nation to self-determination. Therefore, he met Washington, D.C. officials and gained the attention of American public opinion thanks to the help of Lebanese Cecil Hourana, director of the Arab office of information in New York. Bourguiba, then, was strongly convinced he could bring up the Tunisian case in the international with the help of the five Arab states members of the United Nations.Meanwhile, in Cairo, the Arab League resigned to inscribe the North African case is its agenda. Furthermore, a congress held by the nationalists of Cairo, from 15 to 22 February 1947 about the case of North Africa, ended with the creation of an Maghrebi office, replacing the representation of Neo-Destour. Its essential goals were to reinforce resistance movements inside colonized countries but also abroad, aiming to get the United Nations involved. Habib Thameur was designated as head of this organisation. In March 1947, Bourguiba came back to Cairo and, for nearly a year, tried to convince Arab leaders to introduce the Tunisian Case to the UN. In addition, he endowed Neo-Destour of its second representation in the Arab World, in Damascus, led by Youssef Rouissi, who knew the Syrians well. Nevertheless, progress were slow and Bourguiba's journey in Middle-East ended only with a substantial material assistance on behalf of Saudi Arabia, neither Iraq nor Syria nor Libya wanting to support his cause.Upon the disinterest of the members of Arab League for Maghrebi struggle, while the war in Palestine was the center of all attention and efforts, the union of different nationalist movements seemed to be the better way to get their requests heard. But soon, divisions appeared among Tunisians, Moroccan and Algerians, preventing common agreements. On 31 May 1947, the arrival of Abdelkrim al-Khattabi from exile revived the movement. Under his impulse, the committee of liberation of North Africa was founded on 5 January 1948. The values of the committee were Islam, Pan-arabism and total independence of Maghreb with the refusal of any concessions with the colonizer. Headed by Khattabi, designated president for life, Bourguiba was secretary-general. However, despite the status of the Moroccan leader, the committee was not as successful as the Office of Arab Maghreb. Obsessed by the Palestinian issue, the leaders of the Arab League were refusing to support the Maghrebi issue, whose problems deepened with a financial crisis.\nWhile Khattabi favored an armed struggle, Bourguiba was strongly opposed, defending the autonomy of the Tunisian nationalism, which soon divided the Maghrebi committee. His moderate ideas made him infamous among the other members of the committee, whose numbers were increasing day after day. To discredit Bourguiba, rumors were spread that he received, underhand, funding from many Arab leaders and that he had special relationships with the French embassy in Egypt. During his trip to Libya, in spring 1948, the committee removed him from his duties of secretary-general. Noting that there were too much ideological differences between the Committee and himself, it only contributed in discrediting his relationship with Cairo Tunisians such as Thameur, with whom his relationship was deteriorating. \u00b7 Even in Tunis, his exile in Middle-East, weakened the Tunisian leader: Apart from the ascending of Moncefism, after the removal and exile of Moncef Bey in Pau, the party restructured around Ben Youssef with the help of the newly created Tunisian General Labour Union by Farhat Hached. Even though elected president of the party, during the Congress of Dar Slim, held clandestinely in Tunis in October 1948, he was now assisted by three vice-presidents whose goal was to limit the power of the president: Hedi Chaker in Tunis, Youssef Rouissi in Damascus and Habib Thameur in Cairo. Having one to the Egyptian capital to support the national struggle abroad, Bourguiba found himself, four years later, weakened politically and marginalized among the Maghrebi Committee in Cairo, exiled and isolated from Tunisia. Aware of the importance of the struggle inside the country, he decided to regain Tunis on 8 September 1949.\n\n\n== 1949\u201356: Fighting for independence ==\n\n\n=== Failure of negotiations with France ===\n\nWhen he returned to Tunisia, Bourguiba decided to start a campaign to regain control of the party. From November 1949 to March 1950, Bourguiba visited cities such as Bizerte, Medjez el-Bab and Sfax and saw his popularity increase, thanks to his charisma and oratory skills. Once his goals achieved, he reappeared as the leader of the nationalist movement and therefore, decided to travel to France, ready for negotiations. On 12 April 1950, he landed in Paris to raise the Tunisian issue by mobilizing public opinion, media and politicians. Three days later, he gave a conference in H\u00f4tel Lutetia to introduce the main nationalist requests, which he defined in seven points, stating that \"these reforms destined to lead us towards independence must reinforce and strengthen the spirit of cooperation [...] We believe that we are a country too weak militarily and too strong strategically to dispense with the help of a great power, which we would want to be France\".His speech quickly attracted the opposition of both the \"Preponderants\" and the pan-Arab circles who were strongly against his stepwise policy and his collaboration with France. Therefore, Bourguiba felt that an endorsement from the bey was not only necessary, but vital. Thereby, he sent Ben Youssef and Hamadi Badra, convince Muhammad VIII al-Amin bey to write a letter to Vincent Auriol. On 11 April 1950, the letter was written, reminding the French president of the Tunisian requests sent ten months ago and asking for \"necessary substancial reforms\". At last, the French government reacted, on 10 June, with the designation of Louis Perillier as resident-general, who, according to then-minister for foreign affairs, Robert Schuman, \"shall aim to lead Tunisia towards the full development of its wealth and lead it towards independence, which is the end goal for all territories within the French Union\". However, the word \"independence\" is soon replaced by \"internal autonomy\". Despite that, Bourguiba was eager to support P\u00e9rillier's reform process. Soon, he was satisfacted with his flourishing results of his visit to Paris because the Tunisian case became one of the most debated issues by both public opinion and parliament.In Tunis, P\u00e9rillier, endorsed by Bourguiba, favoured the constitution of a new Tunisian cabinet, led by M'hamed Chenik with neo-destourian participation to mark the liberal turning decided by France. On 17 August 1950, the cabinet was invested counting among its members three ministers from Neo-Destour. \u00b7  However, the French Rally of Tunisia, opposed to any reform, succeeded to pressure both the colonial government in Tunisia and the French authorities in France, to get the negotiations restrained. P\u00e9rillier ended up yield to pressure and stated on 7 October that \"It is time to give a break to reforms\", which did not please the Tunisian government. Reacting the statement, riots started in Enfida and ended with several dead and injured. Even though Bourguiba tried to pacify the atmosphere of tension, his strategy of collaboration with France was contested by the majority of Tunisian leaders who considered it indefensible, mainly after the adoption of deceiving reforms, on 8 February 1951.Upon the blocking of negotiations with France, Bourguiba was convinced that there was nothing to do and decided to travel around the world, aiming to gain support for the Tunisian struggle. From 1950, even though he continued to negotiate with France, Bourguiba was considering the use of arms and violence to get things done. Therefore, he asked for the help of Ahmed Tlili to create a national resistance committee, with ten regional leaders responsible for the formation of armed groups and arms depot. During his visit to Pakistan, he did not exclude the use of popular mobilization to obtain independence. If he was introducing himself as an exiled militant back in his journey to Middle-East, he was now a leader of a major party among the Tunisian government. This new status permitted him to meet officials of all the countries he had visited: He met with Indian Prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru in New Delhi and the Indonesian president Sukarno. During his interviews, he urged his interlocuters to introduce the Tunisian issue to the United Nation, recalling his failed attempt to introduce it back in the September 1951 session.\n\nSince his last meeting with Ahmed Ben Bella, in January 1950, Bourguiba was more and more convinced that an armed struggle was inevitable. Thus, in Cairo, he charged a group of people called Les Onze Noirs to train people, fundraise and gather weapons. Disappointed in the support promise of Egyptian and Saudi authorities, Bourguiba traveled to Milan, where the congress of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions opened in July 1951. Thanks to Farhat Hached, Bourguiba obtained an invitation to take part in the event. There, he was invited by American unionists of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) to their gathering, which took place in San Francisco in September 1951. Between July and September, he travelled to London then Stockholm. His journey in the United States ended in mid-October before he flew to Spain, Marocco, Rome and Turkey. There, he admired the work of Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk in building a secular modern state. He then wrote to his son: \"I have put a lot of thought into it. We can get to the same results, even better by less drastic means, which reflect more widely than the soul of the people\".While Bourguiba proceeded with his world tour, the situation in Tunisia worsened: The promised reforms were blocked and the negotiations continued in Paris. On 31 October, as Great Vizir acting in the name of the bey, Chenik delivered officially to Schuman a memorandum summarizing the essential Tunisian requests regarding the intern autonomy. On 15 December, Bourguiba landed in Paris where he heard the answer of Schuman: The statement of 15 December, affirmed the principle of co-sovereignty and the \"final nature of the bound that links Tunisia to France\". \u00b7  \u00b7  As for Bourguiba, it was then sure that endless and resultless negotiations were over. He stated to the AFP that \"A page of Tunisian history is turned. Schuman's response opens a repression and resistance era, with its inevitable procession of mourning, tears and resentment [...] Exasperated, disappointed, out of patience, the Tunisian people will show the entire world that they are mature enough for freedom\". Finally, he addressed the United States saying that \"Their freedom [the Tunisian people] is a necessary condition for the defense of the free world in the Mediterranean sea and everywhere else to secure peace\".\n\n\n=== Armed struggle ===\n\nWhile the Tunisian delegation got back to Tunis upon the blocking of negotiations, Bourguiba remained in Paris where he judged essential to make contacts in this confrontation era. His goals consisted in obtaining funds and arms for the armed struggle but also convince the rest of the world to introduce the Tunisian issue in the United Nations. However, due to the refusal of his request by numerous diplomats, he decided to provoke the complaint and force the fight. Upon his return to Tunisia, on 2 January 1952, he hurried to meet the bey and Grand Vizier Chenik, who he urged to introduce the request to the United Nations Security Council, faking that he obtained the support of the American delegate if Tunisia complained. If they were hesitating at first, they soon gave way to Bourguiba. Meanwhile, the nationalist leader travelled all around the country to inform the people of this issue. His speeches became more and more violent and ended with his statement in Bizerte, on 13 January, where he denounced the cabinet if a delegation did not fly immediately to the U.N. The request was signed on 11 January in Chenik's house by all the ministers of the cabinet, in the presence of Bourguiba, Hached and Tahar Ben Ammar. On 13 January, Salah Ben Youssef and Hamadi Badra flew to Paris, where they intended to desposit the complaint.France did not appreciate the move and reacted with the nomination of Jean de Hauteclocque as new resident-general. Known for his radical hard way, he decided to prohibit the congress of Neo-Destour that should have been held on 18 January and proceeded with the arrest of activists, such as Bourguiba. \u00b7  The congress, which was held clandestinely, favored the continuation of the popular unrest. \u00b7  The following repression soon started a greater unrest. Meanwhile, Bourguiba was transferred to Tabarka where he kept a surprising flexibility and freedom of movement. He soon understood De Hautecloque's maneuvers as his desire for Bourguiba to exile himself in nearby Algeria. He was even interviewed by Tunis Soir and was visited by H\u00e9di Nouira and Farhat Hached.Following the uprising in Tunisia, Afro-Asian country members of the UN finally answered the request of Ben Youssef and Badra, introducing the Tunisian case to the Security Council, on 4 February 1952. As for Bourguiba, \"it depends on France to make this appeal moot by loyally accepting the principle of internal autonomy of Tunisia\". But on 26 March, upon the strong refusal of the bey to discharge Chenik's cabinet, De Hauteclocque placed Chenik, El Materi, Mohamed Salah Mzali and Mohamed Ben Salem under house arrest in Kebili while Bourguiba was sent to Remada. \u00b7  A new cabinet, led by Slaheddine Baccouche took over.\nAiming to weaken the nationalist movement, De Hautecloque separated Bourguiba and his exile companions. Therefore, he was sent on the island of La Galite, on 21 May 1952. Settled in an old abandoned fort, he had health problems, caused by humidity and age. In France, the opponents to a Tunisian compromise discredited Bourguiba whom they accuse of preparing the armed struggle while negotiating with their government, in an article of Figaro published on 5 June. Meanwhile, the bey remained alone against the resident-general, resisting the pressures to approve reforms, judged \"minimal\" by the nationalists, which delighted Bourguiba. In the country, despite the unity of the people, De Hauteclocque pressured the adoption of reforms. Therefore, many assassinations took place: Farhat Hached is murdered on 5 December 1952 by La Main rouge. Bourguiba, deprived of posts and newspapers called for the intensification of the resistance.In these conditions, the French government decided to replace De Hauteclocque with Pierre Voizard as resident-general, on 23 September 1953. Trying to appease the uprising, he lifted the curfew and newspaper censorship but also freed nationalist leaders. Furthermore, he replaced Baccouche with Mzali and promised new reforms which soon seduced the Tunisian people. Nevertheless, Bourguiba remained detained in La Galite Island with, however, a softening of imprisonment conditions. If the reforms legislated the principle of co-sovereignty, Bourguiba judged these measures to be outdated. But he was worried of the cleverness of Voizard, whose methods seemed to be more dangerous than the brutality of De Hauteclocque. This obvious liberalism seduced numerous Tunisians tired of this violence climate which had imposed itself for too long but divided the Neo-Destour between those who supported the policy of the new resident-general and those who didn't. The differences among the party deepened more and more upon Voizard's plans. Both Bourguiba and Ben Youssef remained strongly opposed to the collaboration between the bey and the residence. After a period of hesitation about what to do with the reform project, the Neo-Destour gave orders to resume actions of resistance. Therefore, the Fellaghas decided to resume the attacks in the countryside.\n\nVoizard attempted to bring back peace by pardoning half the 900 Tunisian convicted on 15 May and decided to put an end to the two-year exile of Bourguiba in La Galite. On 20 May 1954, he was transferred to Groix Island but remained strongly firm on his positions, stating that \"the solution to the Tunisian problem was simple [...] The first step was to give Tunisia its internal autonomy, the economic, strategic, cultural rights of France in these fields being respected. Now, this a real confrontation\". \u00b7  But these measures changed nothing: As the delegates of the French Rally of Tunisia requested in Paris that Bourguiba must be \"unable to resume a campaign of agitation\", the Grand Vizier Mzali was almost killed in a failed assassination attempt. Despite the repression he instituted, Voizard lost control of the situation and faced the rage of certain Tunisians opposed to colonists. On 17 June, Mzali resigned from office without any successor left to take charge. This resignation did not leave an available interlocutor to negotiate with the newly invested cabinet of Pierre Mend\u00e8s France on 18 June, six weeks after the defeat of French forces in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. The new head of government stated upon his designation that he will not \"tolerate any hesitation or reluctance in implementing the promises made to people who had confidence in France that had promised to put them in condition to manage their own affairs\".\n\n\n=== Internal autonomy agreements ===\nOn 21 July, Bourguiba was transferred into The Ch\u00e2teau de La Fert\u00e9 in Amilly (110 kilometers from Paris) on the orders of Mend\u00e8s France to preparing the upcoming negotiations. On 31 July, the new French prime minister travelled to Tunis and gave his famous speech in which he stated that the French government unilaterally recognizes the internal autonomy of Tunisia. Meanwhile, Bourguiba received representatives of Neo-Destour in Paris, under the supervision of the Direction centrale des renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9raux. In Tunis, a new cabinet led by Tahar Ben Ammar was formed to negotiate with the French authorities. Four members of Neo-Destour were made ministers.\nOn 18 August, the negotiations started. Bourguiba was given the right to settle in the hotel where the Tunisian delegation lodged. Thus, he received detailed reports of the delegation talks while he gave them instructions. However, the situation in the country worsened with the pursuing of the armed struggle. Likewise, the first day of negotiations started with a serious clash between military and rebels. Everybody was convinced that only a watchword from the Neo-Destour would convince the fellaghas to stop the fight. Nevertheless, the party was ripped between those who wanted the unrest to remain and those who wanted it to stop. Bourguiba wanted the fight to be over to fasten the negotiations for the internal autonomy. He had among the party numerous supporters of the stepwise policy of his. But many were those who wanted immediate independence. In this context, he appeared to be the only one to have the necessary authority to resolve the problem.Mend\u00e8s France, convinced that the current troubled situation threatened his colonial policy, was eager to meet Bourguiba. Therefore, he was transferred to Chantilly, in October, where he was from that moment lodged. The interview between both men remained secret and ended with Bourguiba's promise to end the unrest in the country. Nevertheless, the beginning of the armed civil uprising in Algeria on 1 November 1954, did not improve the current situation. Indeed, the rage of French politicians, who accused the Tunisian fellaghas to collaborate with the Algerian rebels, slowed the negotiations. The situation worsened on 11 November, when the French government, addressed an ultimatum to the Tunisian government, announcing that the talks would stop until the unrest in Tunisia was over.On 14 November, under the pressure of Bourguiba, the Nation Council of Neo-Destour, invited both French and Tunisian government to \"find a solution to the fellaghas issue guaranteeing in an explicit way their backup, their personal freedom and that of their families\". On 20 November, an agreement was concluded. It said firstly that \"the Tunisian government solemnly invite the fellaghas to deliver their weapons to the French and Tunisian authorities\" and secondly that \"the resident-general of France and the Tunisian government vouch that under the agreement between them, the fellaghas shall not be disturbed or prosecuted and that measures be taken to facilitate their rehabilitation to normal life and that of their families\". Furthermore, Bourguiba intervened a second time to reassure the resistance leaders of his confidence in Mend\u00e8s France and reiterated his guarantee of their security. After two years of unrest, the discussions can finally resume.Nevertheless, the negotiations for the internal autonomy were not unanimous: On 31 December 1954, while in Geneva, Ben Youssef, who wanted immediate independence, denounced the discussions and challenged the stepwise policy adopted by Bourguiba. Knowing that his statement would attract many favorable activists, mostly after the fall of the Mend\u00e8s France cabinet on 6 February 1955, causing panic among the moderate faction of the party. Nevertheless, their fears were at ease with the arrival of Edgar Faure as head of the French government on 23 February. Faure assured his commitment to pursue the negotiations started by his predecessor. With Faure's promise, it was necessary for the Neo-Destour to bring the two leaders closer and therefore, set forth a strong united nationalist front to France. However, Ben Youssef did not agree with the talks, denouncing any negotiation that would not lead immediately to the independence of the whole Maghrebi people, supported in his position by the Algerians.On 21 April 1954, an interview between Faure and Bourguiba aimed to conclude the agreements for the internal autonomy. Hearing the news while participating in the Bandung Conference, Ben Youssef rejected the agreements which he judged contrary to the principle of internal autonomy and indicated to a journalist that he \"did not want to be Bourguiba's subordinate anymore\". As for him, the Tunisian people must be opposed to the conventions and demand immediate independence without any restrictions. Despite attempts to conciliate both leaders, the break between the two men was final. Bourguiba, however, tried to ease tensions and persuade Ben Youssef to get back to Tunisia, but in vain, the secretary-general of the party eager to remain in Cairo, until further notice.\n\nOn 1 June 1955, Bourguiba returned triumphant to Tunisia on board of the Ville d'Alger boat. Getting back from Marseille, he accosted in La Goulette. On his own, he advanced to the bridge, waving his arm raising a large white tissue to greet the crowd. \"We were hundreds of millions coming to cheer him, interminably in a huge frenzy\", testified his former minister Tahar Belkhodja. On 3 June, the internal autonomy conventions were signed by Ben Ammar and Faure, Mongi Slim and the French minister for Tunisian and Moroccan affairs, Pierre July. \u00b7 .After the ratification of the conventions, on 3 June, the consultations aiming to form the first cabinet of the internal autonomy started. However, Bourguiba was not sensed to lead it. Beside the fact that it was too soon for France to have the \"Supreme Commander\" at the head of the Tunisian government, he stated that power did not attract him and judged it to be still early to hold an office within the state. Therefore, it was Tahar Ben Ammar who was chosen once again to lead the government. Likewise, the Neo-Destour prevails. It was the first time since 1881, that the Tunisian cabinet did not include a French member. While giving speeches all around the country, Bourguiba insisted on this fundamental fact, demonstrating that the conventions gave a large autonomy to the Tunisian people in management of its affairs. Defending his strategy, he must not leave the field open to the maximalism of Ben Youssef, supported by the Communists and the Destour.\n\n\n=== Fratricidal struggles ===\n\nOn 13 September, Ben Youssef returned to the country from Cairo. Trying to bring back peace and convince Ben Youssef to reconsider his positions, Bourguiba went to the airport welcoming his \"old friend\". But his efforts were in vain and peace was short: Ben Youssef did not wait too long to criticize the modernism of the \"supreme commander\" who trampled the Arab-Muslim values and invited Bourguiba's opponents to resume the armed struggle to free the whole Maghreb. \u00b7  Reacting to Ben Youssef's statements, the French High Commissioner judged them to be outre while the Neo-Destour Leadership impeached Ben Youssef of all his charges, during a meeting convened by Bourguiba. The exclusion was voted but the seriousness of the situation led them to keep the decision secret until further notice. It was finally made public on 13 October, surprising many activists who judged the decision to be too important to be taken by a mere meeting. Many factions, supportive of Ben Youssef, were opposed to the decision and declared Ben Youssef to be their rightful leader. \u00b7 On 15 October, Ben Youssef reacted to the leadership's decision in a meeting organized in Tunis: He declared the party leaders illegal and took the direction of a \"general Secretariat\" which he proclaimed being the only legitimate leadership of the Neo-Destour. The pan-Arab scholars of Ez-Zitouna, feeling marginalized by the occidental trend of the party, showed a great support for the conservative trend who had just being created. The country started to twitch once again. Ben Youssef multiplied his tours around the country facing the sabotage attempts of Bourguiba's followers. However, cells supportive of Ben Youssef were creating everywhere, while many Neo-Destourian activists remained in an expectant hush, waiting to see who of the two leaders will have the last word. Therefore, Bourguiba started an information campaign which was successful, especially in Kairouan, who was seduced by the leader's charisma and decided to rally his cause.In this context, a congress was held in November 1955 to choose which of the two leaders would have the last word. Though Ben Youssef decided not to attend, Bourguiba ended up winner of the debate and optained the endorsement of the delegates. Therefore, his opponent was expelled from the party and the internal autonomy conventions were approved. Outraged by the congress aftermath, Ben Youssef organized numerous meetings to demonstrate his influence. Inside the country, he gained the support of fellaghas who reprised the uprest. Bourguibist cells and French settlers were attacked. As for the fellaghas, it was necessary to get immediate independence, even with weaponry and put an end to Bourguiba's power. The 1 June united Tunisia was definitely torn apart: Those who rallied Bourguiba and those who opposed him and joined Ben Youssef.This troubled situation generated an era of civil war. Killings, arbitrary detention, torture in illegal private prisons, fellagas who took up arms against the Tunisian forces, abduction by militias and attacks by local adversaries caused dozens of dead and many injured. Due to this situation, French authorities decided to speed up the implementation of the autonomy agreements by transferring the law enforcement responsibility to the Tunisian government starting from 28 November. This decision did not please Ben Youssef who feared the jeopardizes of minister of the interior Mongi Slim. To thwart the decisions of the Congress of Sfax, he called for holding a second congress as soon as possible. However, he faced opposition from the Tunisian government. Soon, Ben Youssef was charged for inciting rebellion. Slim informed Ben Youssef that he were to be arrested by Tunisian policemen, which led him to flee out of the country. Clandestinly, he went to Tripoli, Libya, by crossing the Libyan-Tunisian borders on 28 January 1956. \u00b7  The following morning, three newspapers endorsing him were seized and 115 persons were arrested all around the country. The government decided to create a special criminal court, known as the High court to judge the rebels. Meanwhile, Ben Youssef insisted on his followers to resume the fight. The regional context was in his favor because the Maghreb ablazed for the liberation struggle and nationalists were quickly disappointed by the conventions of internal autonomy that left only a few limited powers to Tunisians.Convinced that he must act, Bourguiba flew to Paris in February 1956 aiming to persuade the reluctant French authorities to start negotiations for total independence. On 20 March 1956, around 5:40 pm  in the Quai d'Orsay, the French minister of foreign affairs, Christian Pineau stated that \"France solemnly recognizes the independence of Tunisia\" and signed the Independence protocol along with Tahar Ben Ammar. \u00b7  \u00b7  The clauses put an end to Bardo Treaty. However, France kept its military base of Bizerte for many years. On 22 March, Bourguiba returned to Tunisia as the great winner and stated that \"After a transition period, all french forces must evacuate Tunisia, including Bizerte\".\n\n\n== 1956\u201357: Prime minister of the Kingdom of Tunisia ==\n\nFollowing independence, proclaimed on 20 March 1956, a National Constituent Assembly was elected, on 25 March, in order to write a constitution. Therefore, Bourguiba ran to represent the constituents of Monastir, as the Neo-Destour candidate. On 8 April, the assembly held its opening session, chaired by M'hamed Chenik while Al-Amine bey attended the ceremony. The same day, Bourguiba was elected as Speaker of the National Constituent Assembly and gave a speech, summarizing his ambitions for the country: We cannot forget that we are Arabs, that we are rooted in the Islamic civilization, as much as we cannot neglect the fact of living in the second part of the 20th century. We want to take part in the march of civilization and take a place deep into our time.\nWith this new start, Tahar Ben Ammar's mission as head of government had ended and therefore, he delivered his resignation to al-Amine bey. Therefore, the Neo-Destour nominated Bourguiba to be their candidate for the office, on 9 April. Bourguiba accepted and was officially invited by the bey, three days after his election as head of the assembly, to form a cabinet. On 15 April, Bourguiba introduced his cabinet including one deputy prime minister, Bahi Ladgham, two state ministers, eleven ministers and two secretaries of state. Furthermore, Bourguiba combined the offices of Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defense. Therefore, he became the 20th Head of government of Tunisia and the second of the Kingdom of Tunisia. He expressed, once officially inaugurated as Prime minister, his will to \"enforce sovereignty bases by perfecting the means inside the country and abroad, put this sovereignty only under the service of Tunisian's interests, implementing a bold and judicious policy to free national economy from the chains of immobilism and unemployment.\"As Prime minister, Bourguiba worked to secure total independence. Upon his nomination, the police switched from French management to Tunisian command, as he nominated Isma\u00efl Zouiten to be chief of police and the first Tunisian to hold this office. Meanwhile, French gendarmerie was replaced by the National Guard, on 3 October 1956. Bourguiba also reorganized Tunisia's administrative divisions, creating a modern structure made of 14 governorates, divided in delegations and managed by appointed governors. Bourguiba also pursued negotiations with France in order to have full control over diplomacy, as France still had a say over foreign policy until an agreement was found. Despite that, Bourguiba created a Tunisian minister of Foreign affairs on 3 May and invited other countries to establish embassies and diplomatic relations. Therefore, he appointed 4 ambassadors in Arab countries and approved the United States and Turkey's decision to start a diplomatic mission in Tunisia. Under pressure, France agreed with the opening of respective embassies and signed an agreement with the Tunisian government on 16 May. On 12 November, Tunisia became an official United Nations member.Bourguiba also discussed defense issues with France, arguing that French military ought to evacuate the country. On 30 June, the Tunisian Armed Forces were founded, despite the remaining presence of French militaries. Bourguiba requested progressive evacuation upon the negotiations that started in July 1956. France did not seem to share his opinion as they wanted to suppress Algerian rebels using Tunisia's military bases. After huge disagreements between both governments, the visit of Maurice Faure, French secretary of state for foreign affairs, ended up with the decision to regroup French forces in Bizerte within less than two years and the conclusion of a Franco-Tunisian military alliance. Nevertheless, Bourguiba refused to negotiate while the territory was still occupied and demanded the French forces to regroup in Bizerte immediately, arguing that the protectorate was over. Therefore, he travelled to the United Kingdom and the United States urging for their support.During his premiership, Bourguiba started numerous reforms aiming to modernize Tunisian society and change their mentalities. On 31 May 1956, he abolished beylical privileges, which made royal princes and princesses equal to other citizens and punishable by law. The same day, he suppressed the property legislation of habous, deeply rooted in Islamic traditions. He also ended Ez-Zitouna Mosque's education purposes by creating Ez-Zitouna University, which taught Islamic knowledge under the supervision of the ministry of Education. Likewise, Koranic schools were, from that moment on, under governmental oversight, the ministry preparing a detailed program and managing them. Furthermore, free education was proclaimed and teachers trained. Bourguiba also started a gender equality campaign, advocating for women rights including: universal education for girls equally with boys, women admission to employment under the same conditions as men, free consent to marriage and veil removal. Even though, conservatives were strongly opposed to his reforms, the campaign ended to be a huge success. On 13 August 1956, Bourguiba enacted the Code of Personal Status, a major legislation that reorganized families. Therefore, repudiation was replaced with divorce while woman had to consent to their marriages, suppression paternal agreement. In addition, Polygyny was prohibited and equality between fathers and mothers but also between children was part of the law. Bourguiba also reformed the judicial system, suppressing religious courts and initiating governmental ones.On the second anniversary of his return to Tunisia, on 1 June 1957, Bourguiba wanted to proclaim a Republic system, but the French-Tunisian relation crisis because of the suspension of the financial aid from France, adjourned the event. However, on 22 July, the Neo-Destour leadership invited the Constituent Assembly members to gather in a special meeting, on 25 July. The sitting started at 9:23 pm  in the throne room of Bardo Palace, chaired by Jallouli Fares. In the afternoon, the Republic was proclaimed, abolishing a 252 years old monarchy. The bey's wealth was, therefore, seized by the government and was used to pay debts. With this changing of regime, Bourguiba was designated acting President of Tunisia until a constitution is adopted. Thus, Bourguiba's cabinet was dissolved and a new one was appointed, abolishing the office of Prime minister.\n\n\n== 1957\u201387: Presidency ==\n\n\n=== 1957\u201362: Founder of Modern Tunisia ===\n\nOn 8 February 1958, the French army bombed the border village of Sakiet Sidi Youssef. Casualties were high with 72 dead and numerous injured. The very evening, Bourguiba declared the \"evacuation battle\" of Bizerte open. Thus, he proclaimed entry ban of every French warship into Tunisian waters, on 12 February. He also presented the National Constituent Assembly with a bill repealing the 1942 convention specifying that \"Bizerte was not part of Tunisian territory but was a french harbor\". The bill was successfully adopted on 14 February.\nThanks to diplomatic pressure, he obtained from France total evacuation of Tunisian territory except for Bizerte. Three years later, following a deadly crisis in Bizerte, negotiations ended with the French evacuation of Tunisian lands, on 15 October 1963.\nOn 1 June 1959, the constitution was officially adopted. Thus, it was signed by President Bourguiba, during a ceremony held in Bardo. Furthermore, he addressed the nation to recall presciently Caliphs era: Everything depended on the personal abilities and moral qualities of leaders. The only limits to their power derived from the requirements of religion. That was for qualification. For tenure length, they were ruling for life. Only death put an end to their term. They could age, become unable to assume power and fall under the influence of surrounding courtiers and creatures. It was a dead end, with no way out. The quarry was organized.\nUnlike his Arab counterparts, Bourguiba based his priorities on education and health, to the detriment of arming and defense. Therefore, he established a modern education system, appointing famous writer Mahmoud Messadi as his minister of education. Thus, he put an end to Koranic and westernized double teaching curriculum. Schools were therefore, public and free. Bourguiba also abolished the dual system of justice, ended the influence of religious on the judiciary and established civil courts. \u00b7 \n\nIn February 1961, he invited his fellow citizens not to fast during Ramadan in order to struggle against underdevelopment and set the basis of a new modern state. In March 1964, made the point by drinking openly on television, a glass of orange juice, during the day. \u00b7  His non-respect of fasting and his speech on prophet Muhammad, published by a Lebanese newspaper, started sharp criticism in the Muslim World and even further, led Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz to accuse him of apostasy in 1974.On 20 December 1962, the government announced the discovery of a conspiracy aiming to overthrow President Bourguiba and assassinate him. It was later discovered that the plot had been prepared by military and some civilians faithful to Ben Youssef. The conspiracy was discovered when a remorseful officer told Bahi Ladgham, Bourguiba's second, about the plan, denounced the plot and gave names. He explained that tanks had to march from L'Aouina barrack to the Carthage Palace.\nAmong the culprits were Mahmoud El Materi's nephew, Moncef El Materi, and the President's Aide-de-camp. During trials, one of the charged under-officer stated that he shall never forgive Bourguiba for \"sacrificing them during Bizerte battle\". Sentenced to death by the military court, eleven culprits were hanged. Furthermore, the Communist party of Tunisia and La Tribune du progr\u00e8s magazine, close to that party, were banned.\n\n\n=== 1960s: Socialist experiment and Arab diplomacy issues ===\n\nAhmed Ben Salah, rising star of the government and supporter of a socialist economic policy, was protected from other Tunisois (people originating from Tunis) ministers attacks by Bourguiba who fully endorsed him: \"I am personally responsible for the plan that I put under my authority. Henceforth, this plan will be the party's work\". On 17 November 1961, Ben Salah was appointed in the party leadership, despite his failure in the Central committee elections during the Congress of Sousse in 1959.\nBourguiba's remarriage with Wassila Ben Ammar, on 12 April 1962, was a missed occasion for the Tunisois to limit Ben Salah's encroachment. This happened on 6 February 1963, Bourguiba proclaimed that the battle against underdevelopment was \"a struggle for human dignity and the glory of fatherland [...] In these circumstances, the restriction of freedoms and privileges of private property is needed when it comes to make it more productive use and more profitable for the community\". In June, during a visit to Sfax, he stated: As for those who set themselves up as defenders of individual liberty, private sector and free business, we say that the plan serves the interests of all. In our situation, only collective action is effective.\nTherefore, he targeted trade sector: All traditional circuits were broken and replaced by a centralized network of state offices and cooperatives. He specifically aimed the trade provided by Djerbiens in which Ben Salah saw a conservative caste. On 28 April 1964, Bourguiba demanded the start of negotiations on agricultural lands detained by foreigns. In response, on 2 May, France notified the suspension of its financial aid. Bourguiba, therefore, decided to enact the nationalization of lands, on 12 May. However, peasantry did not want to integrate such a system. Indeed, bureaucracy weakened governmental ideology: While certain unities remained in Barren vegetation, other ended up acquiring more workers than necessary.\nOn 30 September, the first five-year plan ended up with 25% devaluation of the dinar. During the congress of Bizerte, the collectivist strategy was, nevertheless, confirmed with the establishment of the coexistence of three economic sectors (public, private and cooperative). The Neo-Destour was therefore, renamed as Socialist Destourian Party (SDP) and a central committee was formed including ministers, governors, regional party officers and some high officials. Based on communist party model. Thus, the leadership was no more elected but chosen by the president among the central committee. At the end of congress, to seize control of the Tunisian General Labour Union (TGLU), unique labor union of the country, the SDP decided to create, in all businesses, its own professional cells to compete with the labor ones. The presidential party, therefore, achieved its predominance over the country.\nIn July 1965, following an accident on a ship connecting Sfax to Kerkennah Islands, the TGLU chairman, Habib Achour was arrested and replaced at the head of the labour union. Since then, the State-party system and the Bourguiba-Ben Salah conjunction \"Plunged Tunisia into a headlong rush and whirlpool outbid that overshadowed elementary realities.\" Therefore, the first troubles started on 15 December in Msaken: The people protested against the obligation the 147 small farmers had to integrate new cooperatives of fruit trees, that would replace their 80000 olive trees. Following the events, the government proceeded to arrest of ten protesters and the disbandment of party cells that supported farmers.\n\nDuring this period, Bourguiba distinguished himself from his Arab counterparts in foreign policy. Twenty years before Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate, he favored the normalization of relations with the State of Israel. During his visit to Middle-East, defying Gamal Abdel Nasser, he recalled in a speech he gave in Jericho, on 3 March 1965 that \"the policy of all or nothing had only led Palestine to defeat\". \u00b7  He also proposed the United Nations the creation of a Federation between the Arab states of the region and Israel. In May of that same year, supported by public opinion, he broke off with the Arab League.\n\nOn 14 March, Bourguiba had a heart attack. Thenceforth, everyone thought he could die at any moment, and, since that very day, Bourguiba would think about his succession. On 5 June, the eruption of the Six-Day War started riots in Tunis: the American Cultural Center, the Great Synagogue and shopping avenue of London were looted and burned. On 25 January 1969, ordered to give in to the cooperative all their lands and orchards, Ouerdanin inhabitants revolted and opposed themselves to tractors. The uprising ended up with two deaths and dozens of injured, as the law enforcement forces fired. All around the country, troubles erupted for the same reasons: the refusal of an authoritary collectivization. On 3 August, Ben Salah presented Bourguiba with a decree-law bill about the generalization of the cooperative system in agriculture. But Bourguiba, advised by his minister not to sign the bill, refused to do so. The next day, he announced: We have reached the limits of the cooperative system. It is valid to a degree beyond which the balance is broken.\nOn 8 September, a statement announcing the sacking of Ben Salah was made public by the presidency. On 8 June 1970, Bourguiba told the Tunisian people about the failure of this experiment saying: Constitutionally the first and only responsible, is me, Habib Bourguiba. It is because I am human, therefore subject to error, that I was wrong, I say in all modesty. I apologize for the people and especially the activists who suffered [...] I know they are convinced of my good faith [...] but I was abused by a man who wielded lies with diabolical address.\nOn 16 August, making a speech in Monastir, he denounced a \"a vast conspiracy which aimed to establish fascism by revolutionary means\".\n\n\n=== 1970s: Blocked reforms and health problems ===\nBourguiba henceforth, urged the adoption of reforms aiming to restructure both the State organization and the SDP one. Therefore, the party leadership switched from a political office to a high committee. Nevertheless, in the start of August, he announced his will to focus on a social and economic agenda, insisting on justice for the victims of collectivism and thus, put political issues aside.\n\nThe socialist era being over, the government was in the hands of liberal Hedi Nouira, appointed prime minister in 1970. In January 1971, before leaving for treatment in the United States, Bourguiba signed a decree, delegating his powers to Nouira, which consolidated the Achour-Nouira alliance, opposed to Minister of the Interior, Ahmed Mestiri. During the Congress of Monastir that started on 19 June, Bourguiba, returning after six months of treatment abroad, designated three successive \"heirs\": \"It is with confidence that I foresee the day when my journey in this world comes to an end, Nouira shall succeed me as later will do Mestiri then Masmoudi\". But the congress adopted a turning that seemed not to please the President. After Mestiri's attempt to seize control of the party, Bourguiba suspended him, along with his allies and declared finished the works of the Central Committee: \"It is more than clear that, while I am still of this world, I will be maintained at the head of State\".\nIn May 1973, Bourguiba met with Algerian President Houari Boumediene in Kef. This one told him: \"The beginning is the union between Algeria and Tunisia. We will do it methodically but firmly [...] we will proceed in stages\". Bourguiba, surprised by the proposition, suggested: \"Algeria can yield Constantine to restore a better geographical balance between the two countries\". During an interview with the Egyptian weekly El Moussaouar, on 20 September, Bourguiba made a statement, sharing his thoughts about any further union project: The creation of the United States of North Africa including Tunisia, Libya, Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania, would be in stages, slowly and carefully, and take all the time it would take: 10 years or 100 years [...] The capital of the federation should be Kairouan, the spiritual capital of the Muslims for centuries and thus symbolize the return to the past glory of the Islamic world [...]\nIn January 1974, Bourguiba met with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in Jerba. This meeting introduced him the idea of a possible union between Libya and Tunisia. At the end of the interview, the Tunisian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mohamed Masmoudi, stated: \"The two countries will form a single republic, the Arab Islamic Republic, with a single constitution, one flag, one president, one army and the same executive, legislative and judicial. A referendum will be organized on January 18, 1974\". At the airport, Bourguiba declared to journalists: This day was historic, devoting half a century of struggle marked by the constitution of the Islamic Arab Republic, which is bound to have considerable weight in view of the experiences, executives and wealth at its disposal. We express the hope that Algeria, Mauritania and Morocco will join Libya and Tunisia [...] We decided to organize a referendum as soon as possible, expected to be on January 18, 1974. However, if the procedure regarding the referendum requires a delay, it could take place on March 20, Independence Day [...] This is what I wanted to proclaim to all the peoples of North Africa. It is our hope to see the people of the Mashreq follow our example to form a powerful and robust community.\n\nHowever, due to opposition inside the country and abroad, Bourguiba was forced to abandon the project, claiming the unconstitutionality of the referendum. It was in that context that the new congress of SPD, held in Monastir on 12 September, decided to amend the constitution in order to institute life presidency for Habib Bourguiba, who obtained this title from the National Assembly on 18 March 1975. The constitutional revision added a paragraph to Article 39 specifying that \"exceptionally and in consideration of the eminent services of \"Supreme Commander\" Habib Bourguiba to the Tunisian people that he freed from the yoke of colonialism and which he turned into a united independent modern nation, enjoying the fullness of sovereignty, the National Assembly proclaimed President Habib Bourguiba president for life\". In April 1976, another constitutional amendment confirmed the Prime Minister as a constitutional successor to the President. During autumn, Bourguiba suffered from a depression which periodically affected him for five years. Locked in the Carthage palace, he hardly had visits.Economically, the government still managed nearly 80% of the country's economy, which involved it in almost all social conflicts. Indeed, businesses were the place of permanent conflict between the syndicalist cells of the TGLU and the professional cell of SPD.\nIn 1978, Bourguiba was obliged to denounce the Camp David Accords under the pressure of his partners, which had a part in Tunisia welcoming the headquarters of the Arab League then those of the Palestine Liberation Organization.\nDespite its crisis, the 1970s was a period of economic revival, after the failure of socialism. Under Nouira, the government adopted an economy liberalization policy. Nevertheless, on 26 January 1978, Black Thursday occurred. Following the TGLU invitation to organize a general strike, thousands of protesters, mainly Tunisian youths, gathered near the medina, trading streets of downtown and bourgeois neighbourhoods of Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re and Mutuelleville. Violently, they destroyed showcases and set public buildings on fire. At noon, President Bourguiba gave the army orders to get involved and put an end to the uprising. The troubles ended with tens of dead, or even hundreds, according to some sources. In the afternoon, Bourguiba declared state of emergency and a curfew which lasted nearly three months. Twenty months after Black Thursday was held the next congress of SPD, opened on 5 September 1979. True to its ongoing strategy not to reopen wounds, Bourguiba gave the order to move on. In his opening speech, invoking the national interest, he called \"all Tunisians, despite their differences of opinion and guidance, to support state building, the instrument of national revival, security and stability\". In this climate of apparent unity, the congress was held in ambiguity because the gap had widened between the president and the hawks rejecting openness and a multi-party system in the name of national unity. In this context, congress voted a resolution to exclude Achour, chairman of the TGLU from SPD along with numerous resigning ministers. The congress also tried to impose Nouira by electing him as chairman of the party. After Bourguiba's speech, these decisions were not published but were announced only one on the National Radio.\n\n\n=== 1980s: Succession of crises and fall from power ===\n\nIn that context, the 1980s started in Tunisia with a deep crisis. Clientelism began to grow more and more until it disabled economic and social development. The situation worsened with Bourguiba's age, his declining health and his incapacity to manage state issues. Thus, it favored the ascending of an entourage who battled to succeed him, starting a succession war. The country, in that period, knew a serious political and social crisis, which worsened with the declining of economy and the paralysis of the state machinery, spreading uneasiness, despair and loss of confidence. However, during the SPD congress of April 1981, Bourguiba made a historical speech in favor of political pluralism: The degree of maturity reached by Tunisian people, young people's aspirations and the interest there is to involve all Tunisians in taking decisions, whatever their views are, whether they are inside or outside the party, invites us to say that we see no objection to the emerging of political or social national organizations.\nHowever, this turning failed because of the internal electoral confrontation in the capital city, during parliamentary elections, and, despite the Prime minister, Mohamed Mzali's efforts. Therefore, the war of succession worsened. In this context, Wassila Bourguiba, interviewed by Jeune Afrique, on 28 February 1982, stated that \"With the current version of the constitution, continuity is artificial and the risk of popular rejection is not excluded. The Tunisian people respects Bourguiba but true continuity will only happen when Bourguiba's work is pursued by a democratically-elected president.\" Habib Achour, interviewed by the same magazine on 11 August, declared: \"I am for the review of the Constitution so that all candidates who wish can run for office freely\". Bourguiba carried out his promises with the legalization of two new political parties, on 19 November 1983: The Movement of Socialist Democrats and the Popular Unity Party, former allies of Ben Salah.\nA fall in the price of oil towards the end of 1983 reduced the revenue of the Tunisian state, which was already struggling to meet rising expenses. President Bourguiba agreed to seek a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF loan was conditional on government spending cuts and other reforms. The government announced an end to food subsidies on 29 December 1983, causing an immediate rise in the price of bread and flour. The Tunisian bread riots started that day in the semi-desert region of Nefzaoua in the south, and on 3 January 1984 a state of emergency was declared after the unrest had spread to Tunis and Sfax.\nBy the time the protests ended on 5 January 1984 more than 150 of the rioters had been killed. President Bourguiba announced on 6 January 1984 that the increase in the price of bread and flour had been cancelled.This spectacular turn of events raised the enthusiasm of the country. Paul Balta wrote in Le Monde on 10 January: \"The inhabitants of the red belts of Tunis and other large cities, often below the poverty line, joining the rebellion of disadvantaged populations inside the country, have expressed anger more violently and in greater numbers than the events of January 26, 1978. As for Mohamed Charfi, \"It is a society crisis\", he said on January 27. \"Social changes were not accompanied by political changes [...] thus, the breakdown between permanent social changes and political frost is the origin of the regime crisis\". In addition, Mohamed Toumi declared: \"Those that official statements call the unemployed, idle, hostile elements, that is to say victims of bad development [...] are in organic break with everything that makes up the establishment, government and legal opposition mingled\".On 1 October 1985, Israel launched an attack against the Palestine Liberation Organization headquarters near Tunis. The Tunisian Armed Forces were unable to prevent the total destruction of the base. Although most of the dead were PLO members, there were casualties among Tunisian civilian bystanders. As a result, Bourguiba significantly downscaled relations with the United States.\n\nDomestically, Prime minister Mzali emptied Bourguiba's entourage. In July 1985, he replaced Allala Laouiti, loyal mate of the President, with Mansour Skhiri. He also succeeded in sending away from Carthage, Bourguiba Jr., advisor to the President sacked by his father on January 7, 1986. Aiming to put an end to the serious economic crisis, Bourguiba replaced Mzali and appointed, on July 8, 1986, Rachid Sfar to be his new Prime minister. These unfinishing crises favored the ascending of Islamism and strengthened Bourguiba's paranoia. Thus, he found in general Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, appointed minister of the Interior in 1986, the support against Islamism. Therefore, he raised him to the rank of Prime minister in October 1987.\nBourguiba had been in ill health from the 1970s onward.  As the 1980s wore on, his behavior grew more erratic. He fired the general manager of a major newspaper only 24 hours after appointing him. He also fired the head of the country's United Nations delegation only a few days after appointing him, and forgot about a decree he had signed to appoint new ministers. Matters came to a head in November 1987, when he ordered new trials for 15 Islamists and demanded that 12 of them be hanged by the next weekend. This latest order convinced several opponents and supporters of Bourguiba that he was no longer acting or thinking rationally; one human rights activist said that if the orders had been carried out, it would have meant civil war.  After several doctors attending to Bourguiba issued a report declaring that Bourguiba was mentally incapable of carrying out his duties, Prime Minister Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, who had been appointed to the post only a month earlier, removed Bourguiba from office, organizing a medical coup d'\u00e9tat, then assumed the presidency himself. Starting in a liberal secular atmosphere, Bourguiba's presidency or \"reign\" ended in a climate of economic and financial crisis.\n\n\n== 1987\u20132000: Later life ==\n\nTo avoid his reinstatement by opponents, Bourguiba was evacuated from Carthage Palace, a few days after 7 November 1987, to be transferred into a house in Mornag then, to Monastir, on 22 October 1988 where he enjoyed medical assistance. He stated being well treated by the new regime. Suffering from numerous health problems, including slurred speech and attention, Bourguiba went through serious diseases during the 1990s. He was, sometimes, visited by foreigners and President Ben Ali.\nOn 5 March 2000, Bourguiba was rushed to the Tunis military hospital, following a pneumonitis. His condition deemed critical, he underwent thoracentesis ICU. His health improved, he left hospital on 13 March to get back to his house in Monastir. He died there at officially 96 years old, on 6 April 2000 at 9:50 pm . \u00b7  \u00b7  President Ben Ali, therefore, proclaimed seven days of national mourning while Algeria announced three days of national mourning. Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika stated that Bourguiba was \"One of the Maghreb most influential personalities of the 20th century, which Africa and the entire world can boast\". Meanwhile, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, paid a tribute to \"the man of peace\" and to \"the architect of the Organization of African Unity\".At the end of the afternoon, his body was wrapped in a white shroud, as the tradition wanted it, and carried by Chabiba members, the youth organization of the Democratic Constitutional Rally, wearing redcoats. It was deposited in the middle of the familial house, covered with the Tunisian national flag and surrounded by Chabiba members. His son, Habib Jr., his daughter-in-law and his adoptive daughter Hajer received condolences of Monastir City and Governorate's officials. Bourguiba was buried on 8 April, in the afternoon, in his mausoleum. After a short ceremony at the Hanafi Mosque of Bourguiba, his body was transported on a gun carriage, coated with the national flag and carried by a military vehicle framed by detachments of the Tunisian army. Among the foreign guests were French President Jacques Chirac, Algerian Bouteflika, Palestinian Yasser Arafat and Egyptian Hosni Mubarak. After the burial, President Ben Ali pronounced a eulogy in which he paid a tribute to the \"Loyal and devoted fight\" of Bourguiba for Tunisia.The funeral conditions were, however, submitted to the criticism of international media that insisted on the brevity of the ceremony, the few foreign guests and the absence of TV broadcast which transmitted animal ceremonies during the funeral procession.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nHabib Bourguiba led his country to independence, then founded the second civil Republic in the Arab World after that of Lebanon. He then participated in the building of a Nation-State by \"Tunizifying\" his country. Besides, before independence, the country was not named Tunisia, but the Regency of Tunisia.\nAs for former minister Mohamed Charfi, subsequent transformations of the Tunisian society brought by the action of Bourguiba are numerous: urbanization, education, transition to another family model and women's liberation. He also insisted on the part Bourguiba had in reforming the country, alongside other great personalities in Tunisia history, such as Kheireddine Pacha and Tahar Haddad. \"If underdevelopment were a sickness, then Bourguiba was able to make the right diagnosis and implement effective remedies\". However, others question the extent of success in this battle for development and the role Bourguiba had in this evolution.\n\n\n=== Bourguibism ===\n\nBourguiba had developed his own doctrine that he called \"Bourguibism\" but which is similar to pragmatism. It was founded on the political and economic realism which is based on the belief that \"no field of life on earth should escape the human power of reason\". It also contained elements of populist and corporatist discourse, support for the welfare state, and until the Tunisian Revolution, its followers generally followed a statist outlook.\nConsidered in several respects a local variant of Kemalism, it consists of the assertion of the Tunisian national identity, incorporating the fight against the Ottomans and the French, of liberalism, a nationalized and controlled Islam and total independence towards the politics of other nearby Arab nations. Step-by-step policy is a major part of Bourguiba's doctrine. Bourguiba thought in this manner mainly because the actions were based on what he considered real possibilities, not aspirations, unlike \"the all or nothing\" policy, advocated and supported by some.In reality, it permitted Bourguiba to enjoy a freedom of action that led him to political opportunism, allowing him to impose not only breakthrough changes but also spectacular turnabouts.\n\n\n=== Social reforms ===\nThe Bourguiba government's reforms included female emancipation, public education, family planning, a modern, state-run healthcare system, a campaign to improve literacy, administrative, financial and economic organization, suppression of religious property endowments, known as Waqf, and building the country's infrastructure.\n\nIn his social agenda, Bourguiba advocated for women's rights. Thus, he enacted the Code of Personal Status, ratified on 13 August 1956, a few months after he had taken office, as Prime minister of the Kingdom of Tunisia. Inspired by the views of Tahar Haddad, who was a Women's rights defender, Bourguiba based this law on his ideas, emancipating women, despite the then-conservative public opinion. Bourguiba understood the opposition he would face but decided to act, before even building the Republic. Nevertheless, he was supported by some religious personalities, such as Mohamed Fadhel Ben Achour, who defended Bourguiba's reform, stating that the CPS are possible interpretations of Islam. However, others did not share these views and said that the CPS was violating Islamic norms. The Personal Status Code would, then, constitute the fundamental legacy of Habib Bourguiba, to the point of becoming a sort of consensus block that the Islamists themselves would not challenge publicly anymore. Nevertheless, he succeeded in setting important legal precedents by prohibiting polygamy, expanding women's access to divorce, and raising the age at which girls could marry to 17 years old, expanding women's rights.\nEstablishing a parallel with Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, Mohamed Charfi advocated that Bourguiba wanted to reform society \"within Islam\" and not against it. This transforming society and its modernization was accompanied by an explanation consisting of a modulated action, according to which public Bourguiba addressed. This reformer dimension is nevertheless questioned by author H\u00e9l\u00e9 B\u00e9ji, who draws attention to the transgressive nature of many of Bourguiba's gestures, particularly in women's status. Furthermore, Jean Daniel mentioned a conversation between Bourguiba and Jacques Berque about Islam. For Bourguiba, religion, associated to the Destourian party, had historically favored the colonization of Tunisia. On the other hand, Charfi opposed this idea, stating that the undeniable break carried out by Bourguiba occurred more with traditional society than with Islam, as such.\nBourguiba was very critical of the veil, on various occasions referring to it as \"that odious rag\".During the time Bourguiba was president, education was a high priority, as he reformed the total educative system and permitted its development. State budget in education did not cease to increase year after year to reach 32% in 1976. Private schools were maintained but submitted to government regulations. In 1958, the Arabic teaching of Ez-Zitouna University was unified into a bilingual educative system. Since 1956, Bourguiba started to build the foundations of higher education in Tunisia, including the creation of universities and specialized institutes.\n\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\n\nRegarding his foreign policy, Jean Lacouture indicated that Bourguiba's relations with France should not make us forget that he also maintained relations, even problematic, with the East. Lacouture testified on Bourguiba's anger when he was proposed \"co-sovereignty\", back in 1955. It was the struggle for his country's independence, that sparked misunderstandings with the Arab League countries, but which will be, on the other hand, better understood by the United States with whom Bourguiba established bonds of trust. As for him, unlike other leaders in the Arab world, the non-alignment is not synonymous with anti-Americanism.Furthermore, strong supporter of Francophonie alongside L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor and Hamani Diori, he became its active ambassador especially during his tour in Africa, back in 1965. As for him, French language and francophonie competed to build an opened modern Tunisia.\n\n\n=== One-party state ===\nBourguiba, who advocated independence insisting on the maturity of the Tunisian people, ended up judging that his country was not prepared for democracy and political pluralism and even proclaimed himself president for life. As for him, \"the people were not yet mature enough for democracy\" which was evaded in the name of the unity his project was involving. Consequently, once the bases of a modern state were built, Bourguiba chose gradually a \"paternalistic authoritarian\" regime. This culminated in the Neo Destour being formally declared the only legally permitted party in 1963.Consequently, political democracy in the Western sense was more or less nonexistent. The constitution vested Bourguiba with sweeping\u2014almost dictatorial\u2014powers.  Bourguiba himself admitted this when a journalist asked him about Tunisia's political system. Bourguiba replied, \"The system? What system? I am the system.\" In this context, Bourguiba's party became an \"alibi in an ideological desert\".\n\n\n=== Power of one ===\nIt is important to specify that, during his conquest and exercise of power, he systematically rejected all his allies who became rivals: Abdelaziz Th\u00e2albi and Mohieddine Klibi, who represented the bourgeoise faction of Destour; Salah Ben Youssef, supported by Nasser, that he assassinated in 1961. Tahar Ben Ammar who ratified the independence protocol ; Ahmed Mestiri, who represented the liberal faction among his party ; Mahmoud El Materi, the first president of Neo-Destour, who was discredited many times and, losing confidence in Bourguiba, decided to retire.\nYet Bourguiba himself made the diagnosis of the dangers of political archaism that threatened the country. On 8 June 1970, after noting that \"experience [reveals] that the concentration of power in the hands of an only one person, as devoted as he is, has risks\", he described the great lines of the institutional reform he considered, back then. It will focus, he announced, on \"amendments [that] will make the cabinet responsible to the President of the Republic but also to the National Assembly which emerged from popular vote. So it shall be lawful for the assembly to impeach a minister or a cabinet by a vote against it [...]. Other modifications of the constitution will ease the responsibilities undertaken so far by the president and only by himself [...] After fifteen years of exercise of power, it is time to revise the Constitution and establish some collaboration between the head of State, the national Assembly and the people\". But the spirit of this reform did not meet these commitments, only the spirit of Article 39 (establishing the life presidency) would prevail.\nThe end of his reign was marked by a war of succession, the weakening of the left and the emergence of the Islamist movement and patrimonialism.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nIn 1925, while he was a student in Paris, Habib Bourguiba met Mathilde Lorrain with whom he settled. During summer vacations back in Tunis, he learned that she was pregnant: Habib Bourguiba Jr., his only child, was born on 9 April 1927 in Paris. The couple married in August of the same year, after their return to Tunisia. After independence, Mathilde obtained Tunisian citizenship, converted to Islam and adopted the name of Moufida. On 21 July 1961, they ended up divorcing.On 12 April 1962, Bourguiba married Wassila Ben Ammar, a woman from a family of Tunis bourgeoisie he had known for 18 years. Together, they adopted a girl named Hajer. Wassila took a larger part in politics over the deteriorating health of her husband, which would give her the title of Majda (Venerable). Their divorce, on 11 August 1986, with a mere statement and without any respected legal proceedings, largely contributed in the fall of the regime.\n\n\n== Honours and Decorations ==\n\n\n=== Tunisian national honours ===\n :\nGrand Master & Grand Collar of the Order of Independence (automatic upon taking presidential office)\nGrand Master & Grand Collar of the Order of the Republic (automatic upon taking presidential office)\nGrand Master & Grand Cordon of the National Order of Merit (automatic upon taking presidential office)\nGrand Cordon of Nichan Iftikar (1956)\n\n\n=== Foreign honors ===\n Denmark : Knight of the Order of the Elephant (1963)\n Egypt : Collar of the Order of the Nile (1965)\n Ethiopia : Grand Cross of the Order of the Star of Ethiopia (1963)\n Ghana : Companion of the Order of the Star of Ghana (1966)\n Netherlands : Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Orange-Nassau (1966)\n Iran : Collar of the Order of Pahlavi (1969)\n Italy : Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (25 May 1962)\n Ivory Coast : Grand Cross of the National Order of the Ivory Coast (1966)\n Jordan : Collar of the Order of Al-Hussein bin Ali (1973)\n KSA : Collar of the Order of Abdulaziz Al Saud (1975)\n Liberia : Grand Croce of the Order of the Pioneers of Liberia (1966)\n Libya : Collar of the Order of Idris I\n Malaysia : Grand Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (1969)\n Mauritania : Grand Cordon of the Order of National Merit of Mauritania (1966)\n Morocco : Collar of the Order of Muhammad\n Morocco : Grand Cordon of the Order of Ouissam Alaouite (1956)\n Niger : Grand Cross of the Order of the Niger (1966)\n Oman : Special Class of the Order of Oman (1973)\n Senegal : Grand Cross of the National Order of the Lion (1966)\n Spain : Collar of the Order of Civil Merit (24 May 1968)\n Spain : Knight of the Collar of the Order of Isabella the Catholic (16 November 1983)\n Sweden : Knight of the Royal Order of the Seraphim (22 May 1963)\n Turkey : Collar of the Order of the State of Republic of Turkey (1960)\n United Arab Emirates : Collar of the Order of the Federation (1973)\n United Kingdom : Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (1980)\n Yugoslavia : Yugoslav Great Star (1965)\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nHonorary Degree from Cheikh Anta Diop University\nHonorary Degree from Cairo University\nHonorary Degree from Lebanese University\nNelson Mandela Supreme Fighter Prize\n\n\n== Publications ==\nLe Destour et la France, ed.

          "I went to see the medina of Monastir and as there's not much to see anyway, I decided to pop into this place. Turned out it's a much more curious place than I can judge from the reviews here. Indeed, the place looks majestic from the outside and a bit Soviet-style inside, mixed",

          "The place itself has a very nice position, near the Ribat and an old cemetery near the sea. I personally disliked the long paved entrance way, it is too opulent and overwhelming in comparison with the size and attractivity of the Mausoleum itself. Since I was alone, the",

          "The building is beautiful from the walk up to the gates to inside the Mausoleum. The most interesting part for me was the photos of Bourghiba with all the leaders of the Middle East including Anwar Sadat but it was those that have gone down in history as monsters like Sadam",

          "So exquisite, we only had enough time to take pictures from outside though. Must check this out if you're in Tunisia",
          "I think since this is a free attraction it would be remiss not to go whilst in Monastir. There is a very touching memorial to Bourghiba in the form of personal photos and possessions. The building and it's materials are noteworthy too for their beauty. The signage here is all",

          "Tunisians value Bourghiba's memory very much and it is clearly seen in this mausoleum. I probably would not go from another town to see it, as I am not the biggest fan of historical objects, however if you are staying in Monastir it is a must to see. Entry is free of charge.",
          "Everything about Bourghiba Mausoleum is Grand and Glam! Worth visiting! Architecturally excelling and fitting memorial. Marble has been used well and with great deal of thought given to the whole structure. Imposing minarets give a grand feel to the whole visit here. Entry is",

          "A guide will introduce himself & start showing you around if you agree to this or not & of course then expects a nice tip. If you like tipping in general then Tunisia is for you. Tip Tip Horay !",
          "Although lacking historical refinement it displays adulation, not in a very clumsy way. It is worth stopping in Monastir for and allows for understanding of the relation and elevation of the historical leader.",
          "Free entrance to Habib Bourguiba's Mausoleum so if in Monastir it is a must see. I found it touching to see his personal effects , clothing ,desk on display. He liberated the Tunisien women by giving them the right to vote , abolished bigamy , & underage marriages & is a hero to",

          "The Bourghiba Mausoleum is at the end of a long avenue which cuts through the main cemetery in Monastir. Lined with trees, marble paving and well tended gardens its surrounding are very impressive. The domed mausoleum at the end, makes for some great photographs. I left it too",
          "I visited the Mausoleum with a First Choice excursion. Had it not been part of the tour, I possibly would not have considered visiting here. However, it is definitely worth a visit. I'd never heard of Bourguiba until the day we visited and our tour guide explained that he was",

          "Amazing outside grounds but you really must go inside. The chandeliers, the rooms and the decor is unbelievable. We paid a couple of Dinar to a guide in there and he took us all over the three Mausoleum parts - Bourghiba's, his wife's and his family's.",
          "While visiting The Mausoleum, which was a gorgeous place, we discovered a small women's refuge, where Muslim woman can retreat, prey and meet other women, while visiting the landmark nearby. It was truly amazing to get a direct look into their culture and habits. They were",

          "Popped into the mausoleum on a whistle-stop trip into Monastir. It is a pretty building with impressive architectural features and an amazing chandelier. Most of the information in the building is in Arabic or French, so it is worth taking a phone/tablet to find out more",

          "Really nice looking mausoleum. Makes me wonder how many current politicians did half of what President Bourghiba did. A must - see for those interested in history of Tunisia, not just the sunbathing :)",
          "beautiful, free, great architecture, definately worth a look. hardly any hassle from local sales people. dont be sucked in to the guy near the cemetry, as he will talk your leg off with 3 facts only for money",
          "Wonderful grounds and building here. We ventured out early so it was very quiet when we visited. There's something very calming and beautiful about this place. Definitely worth a walk around, even just to take a picture.",

          "This is a great place to visit when in the Monastir area. A beautiful building housing the interned former Tunisian President. The stunning chandelier and roof domes are worth the visit alone. Free entry but lots of local English speaking guides who are happy to tell you about",

          "Such a beautiful peaceful monument clean and tidy and no hassle from traders, able to wonder round safely",
          "Good to learn at little of the history but not any commentary other than in Arabic. Good photo op outside of the building, but did not really think it was worth a specific visit. El-Jem much more spectacular and interesting.",

          "Really enjoyed my visit. Beautiful photos taken by me and my group! Do let a guide take you round we tipped 10 dinar (\u00a34) for a group of 4 and well worth it for the information given, enabled us to ask questions and have group photos taken.",
          "A beautiful resting place of president Bourguiba, the ground's and tower's are really a sight to behold, Well worth a vist, From Sousse it's only 1 dinar on the metro to Monastir",

          "I'm not sure why this place has such high reviews. It was beautiful, and somewhat interesting, but there was nothing spectacular to mention. The entrance is off to the side, and there are a few historical items on the side. The staff are unfriendly and unhelpful, and let in a",

          "They have activities for the kids in the courtyard. It is nice to go upstairs and take pictures against the gold mosaics.",
          "Definately a must-see, but I think it is weird for someone to build such a big grave for himself. Besides that, it is a beautiful monument! What I like about it is that the square for the actual monument is some kind of parc: children are playing, people are hanging out. There",
          "While shopping in Monastir we thought why not. its a nice place to visit, its free and not out of the way, only two mins walk from shopping center. a great place to do a bit of sight seeing.",
          "It's imposing from outside but nothing special to see inside if u r not keen on tunisian president's life.",
          "Worth a passing visit if you are close by. Attractive approach and impressive architecture. The local cemetery for the locals makes a nice contrast to the egotistical mausoleum ,especially if you have some insight into the teachings of Islam.",
          "This is a beautiful mausoleum to the Boughiba family (First president after the independance). It is a really pretty place, but note that all the inofrmation about Boughiba is in arabic only. Therefore it was very difficult to understand Boughiba's life and achievements for",
          "We were taken on a free trip which also included a visit to a carpet factory and leather shop. The Mausoleum is a beautiful building and gives visitors a good insight to the history of the country.",
          "This Mausoleum is absolutely beautiful, both on the inside and the outside. The outside is majestic, and the inside is well arraged with Bourghiba's desk, photographs, clothing, and of couse, his tomb. Well worth the visit, a must see if you go to Monastir!",
          "this is where the presidents casket is, and his clothing and personall things are in glass cases, also photos, beautiful in marble & lovely floor tiles has to be seen",
          "It is really spectacular and really big ,...at least on the outside! It is the joule of Monastir!the architecture of this building is really interesting and from the outside it gives you the idea that is really big inside but it is not! It has personal items of Bourghiba, photos",
          "For many years I have stood at the gates of this mausoleum. I remember a young tunisian saying we are such a poor country how can we afford this. After Bourghiba died the gates were opened. What extravagance for just one man. How could such a poor country afford this",
          "i like to experince the history/culture when i go away our guide was very knowledgable and pasionate about the history which wa snice",
          "We really liked the trip back home. If you read the reviews for September 2012, you will get the whole picture of what this awful place is like. There were no lights on when we were shown to our room, and this was after filling in silly forms that we were told to do, or we will",

          "When we arrived it was not open but when we asked a guy insiide the gates what time it opened, he ushered us in and gave us a private tour of this beautiful place. We were respectful and he was obviously very proud of the memorial built for this much loved leader. Very",
          "There were guys, who took my camera and took photos of the mausoleum.. i didnt like that, but it was worth seeing.",
          "Very good, definately worth a look, it gives you a feel for the history of the country. It's just a shame that on the walk up to the builiding there is graffiti on some of the stone work, Monastir really could benefit from a good tidy up.",
          "Was good to see but was spoiled by having to pay to get out!!!!!!!!!! The guide was not happy with amount we had to tip him and was looking for more.",
          "Guided tour for our party was all in French and he took photos with our cameras and charged us before letting us leave. Beautiful building would recommend a visit but ditch the guide if he decides you are having him!",
          "Watch out for would be guides, they are on your shoulder in a flash, give you a little info, then put their hand out.",
          "the mausoleum itself was a beautiful building. our guide showed us around, took photo's for us and turned on the HUGE chandelier telling us all about the man it was built for. they had recreated his office and adorned it with photo's. very interesting man who I will need to find",

          "We went on the \"Friendly Train\" from our hotel to Monastir and visited Bourghiba's Masoleum - a short trip but well worth going. It was a beautiful place, people were very friendly and the train driver stayed close by - very reassuring.",

A medina is typically walled, with many narrow and maze-like streets. The word \"medina\" (Arabic: \u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629\u200e mad\u012bnah) itself simply means \"city\" or \"town\" in modern-day Arabic.  It is cognate with the Aramaic-Hebrew word (also \"medina\") referring to a city or populated area.\n\n\n== Description ==\nMedina quarters often contain historical fountains, palaces, mosques, and sometimes churches.\nBecause of the very narrow streets, medinas are generally free from car traffic, and in some cases even motorcycle and bicycle traffic. The streets can be less than a metre wide. This makes them unique among highly populated urban centres.

          "Medina means the old town. It\u2019s a rectangular area of approximately 220x170m, surrounded by tall stone walls. In this area, on one side is the fortress (kasbah). Behind the walls is hidden a labyrinth formed by narrow cobblestoned streets and traditional houses, painted in white",
          "Visited this place with my three children (none which are teens btw, but no option for that here). The Medina is stressful, to say the least. Although we were told what to expect by our Thomas Cook rep, nothing prepared us for what it's really like on the ground. The",
          "Pretty place. But don't be fooled by locals saying 'hi. I recognise you from the hotel. I am the chef' etc coz it's lies! Lol All the shops sell the same things. So once you've seen one you have seen them all. And they are on you like flies on a crusty kebab. Didn't stay",
          "All the shops sell the same stuff If you visit one you visited all of them The people who run the shops are extremely rude When they say come in my shop and you say no they start calling you names and swear at you We felt threatened a few times",
          "We came down here twice to see if we could buy gifts for family and friends back home. We had this suggested by our hotel staff and as it was a 5 minutes drive away, thought it was a good idea. The first time we left early due to the heat so went back down. The minute we",
          "Know what you want beforehand. Keep your eyes down and do not be stopped until reaching your destination. Visit La Maisonette de Chehrazed...best quality Linen and Cotton. Made to measure Kaftans.",
          "We visited and left very quickly. As you would expect, loads of cheap cheesy souvenirs and tenacious shop keepers trying to lure you in there small shops to try to sell knock off designer stuff. Tallented salesmen with a good ability to lie in your face. If you say you are",
          "Excellent walk and miles better than new Hammamet must visit area would highly recommend it for more traditional Tunisia",
          "Medina is good ro visit to taste a bit of tunisia. The narrow streets make you feel as a proper explorer. There is a top view where you can see the nice view of the sea and on otjer side view of medina. Inside medina there is a museum with open top with nice view. The museum is",
          "Visited recently with my partner. It is a lovely place to see but the constant harassment from shop owners would put me off visiting again. Started from the minute we got out our cab. To be fair they are trying to earn a living but is so off putting I didn't buy anything. Then",
          "We visited the Medina to get a taste of local culture and to do a bit of shopping. The harassment we received as soon as we stepped into the Medina until we exited was unbelievable! At one point I was grabbed by my arm by a local who refused to let go until my partner gave him a",
          "Very nice place to visit, locals are told not to hassle tourists , taxis are very cheap but agree a price first",
          "It is worth to visit Old Medina of Hammamet for a shopping or just to soak up in the unique atmosphere of the place. Old narrow streets, open doors of the houses, delicious aromas of Tunisian dishes, colorful shops and welcoming Tunisian sellers. I would recommend a Jalal's",
          "It's like every other medina I've been to but smaller scale. We went at the end of April and we were really harassed by shop keepers and restaurant staff. One of them even said \" this year tourist is not good\" just coz we didn't go to his place to eat :) everybody tried to speak",
          "Certain shopkeepers should be removed, got tired of hearing cheaper than Asda or come and have a Gander. If you went in you couldn't get out without li ING their palms, advice is ignore and walk past to the wonderful Fort, cracking views, 16dt or less than a fiver, well worth a",
          "Great resort and hotel in Hammamet. Animator Lama was very friendly and we have lot of fun with her.",
          "Beautiful city and beautiful beach great to walk and watch sunset. Lots of restaurants and caf\u00e9s with reasonable prices",
          "Very pretty area lots of character. There are shops inside the residential part of the medina but a firm no thank you is enough",
          "We went to see the medina .On the way a man came up to us and said \"don't you recognise me I'm a waiter at your hotel ,it's my day off and I've come to see my family ,do you want to go to the medina? I will show you .My brothers has sh in medina he will give you very good price",
          "Just like others experienced earlier: You are being taken into shops without your consent. Everyone tries to sell some garbage. Also quite a few people are trying to convince you, that they are working in your hotel and they want to show you around. They do not show you nothing",
          "where ever you are staying in hammamet if you need trip out contact 216 23 670 627. 216 95 857 707. If you take the number to reception and they will ring him for you",
          "I have to say I was really expecting to be harassed based on some of the reviews but they were all simply lovely, the medina was quiet and lovely and very pretty and obviously vendors were DESPERATE for a sale but they were never forceful, and I felt soo bad for them as on the",
          "Although it was November when we went, we had fine weather for all of our time there. We went for 2weeks and went all inclusive.",
          "Had a wander around here, plenty of shops and places to eat, be prepared to be hassled to come and look in every shop",
          "Hammamet is interesting and the fort provides a great view across the town - but the medina is hard work - it is impossible to browse without being hassled. I am blonde so stick out like a sore thumb. People are not aggressive and you can say no but it does get a little",
          "Nice old walled area full of shops selling most stuff especially stuffed camel's, etc. We had a fresh delicious fruit juice in a first floor terrace cafe overlooking the beach.. 5 dinar for 2..about \u00a31.25. Everywhere is very cheap compared to what we are used to in Spain,",
          "Was fab step back in time contrary to a previous review the castle isn't being renovated in actual fact props for a Turkish historical film are being made We loved it",
          "Lovely day out went on a wee train with the Mario and another animation team member dressed as super man and Mario was dressed as super Mario had a great day out with them",
          "Apart from the castle, which was being renovated and a very small medina the old town had little to offer. We only had lunch which was very reasonable but nothing to write home about. As three girls we didn\u2019t feel very safe. We have visited Morocco twice and felt safer in the",
          "the medina is worth a visit but be warned that the prices here are dearer because they put the cost upbecause of all the tourists. Lovely cafes around the medina but again the prices are higher.",
          "You have to bargain with the shop keepers and they love it (I like it also). Yellow cab everywhere, but you have to ask them first how much, otherwhise you pay too much.",
          "Great cafes overlooking the ocean and the 200 year old fort. A fishing village with character, narrow winding streets with tall white washed houses with shops selling souvenirs. Do be aware that you can barter with shop keepers, but this isn\u2019t for everyone. When you have enjoyed",
          "Not very good and not that many shops. We got ripped of for what I can only call tack. Was intimidated in this guys shop and felt we had to part with cash to get out of shop. Not for me",
          "we went by taxi and was excited as been several times before , unfortunatly as it was early in the year nothing much was open , we missed the buzz of the haggling etc",
          "If you just say 'No thank you' every time they hassle you, they do get the idea that you just want to have a look around.",
          "Nice place to browse for an hour lots of cheap bargains but you will get hassled just a polite no thanks will do. Trinkets are extremely cheap eggs fridge magnets 25p. Leather goods look good but only pay 33% of asking price.",
          "Visiting the Medina of Hammamat is great idea especially during summer, ohhhhhh.. its full of people , tourists and local. they have a long beach and plenty hotels, restaurants , Bars, clubs, water games activities, its one of the best places to visit, however in Winter is get",
          "Recently returned from Tunisia went to Medina lot of people trying to tell you they work hotel where your staying to get you to buy stuff from shops in Medina bee aware they are fake no fixed price just want to charge extreme prices for stuff turn band round when out of hotel",
          "Came to browse the medina. The medina walls are worth a good walk around. There are plenty of souk shops but mostly souvenir based rather than specific items. Was also the worst souk for hassle although may have been due to more quietness than others we visited.",
          "The old market of Hammamet gives you a taste of what the real thing might have looked and felt like, but with a heavy coating of tourism. Shopkeepers trying to get you to visit their place and spend your money at every corner (and in between). Just nod and laugh and walk past,",
          "Went to Hammamet today and made a very quick return to our hotel within about 10minutes. We were greeted at the entrance to the Medina, as warned, by salesmen who claimed to work at our hotel. Not a problem, walked by saying \u201cno thank you\u201d but we were then chased by a man who",
          "as soon as we got out of taxi was approached by our BREAKFAST chef, by time we had finished we had at least 15 breakfast chefs offering us best breakfast. Good if you haggle, but tooooo pushy",
          "nice to discover but very small. rooftop cafes are best and least hassle. ignore those trying to show you the lookout tower; they will pester!",
          "Loved the winding alleys and soaked in lots of atmosphere, not so crushed as the Sousse Medina. Treat yourself to coffee or breakfast on the corner restaurant and enjoy the Turkish atmosphere",
          "If you are lucky enough to get you to the right Medina, bargains can be had but haggle hard as they will not respect you and take advantage....See a bargain but haggle and do not be affraid to walk away...Only pay what you think it is worth... The halve it..lol",
          "Get out of your hotel and walk around the Medina of Hammamet day or evening. It has a lovely view over the sea and bay, a small art gallery, restaurants and a cafe for mint tea where you can sit and look at the view in peace. The Medina walls are 15th century and really worth",
          "If you like a nice harbour and looking at lovely boat this is the place to look took us about 45 mins to go round could have easily been longer but was ever so windy and cold will hope to see it again",
          "The place is gorgeous. Beautiful, renovated alleys, houses, doors... Yes, the shop owners are desperate for tourist money, so they will bug you. But just nicely say \"no thank you\" and walk away. Going early in the morning is way better.",
          "Again taxi from hotel just under \u00a33. Each way Good value. Good to. See the contrast between the new town and the old.. modern shops and marina. Good to see. Adventure park for the kids",
          "Nice character - again small narrow places. Did get pulled into a shop and ended up buy things. I had to half the original price quoted. Bought some plates and stuff they are usually 3 dirham each got sold for a bit higher. But I liked them so no complaints. It was good to",
          "I guess I am used to the larger Medina\u2019s in other cities in the Arab world. Walkable in about 1 hour. Shopkeepers are a bit pushy-just say no nicely and keep walking. Found a lovely artist that I chatted with for about an hour and bought a small piece. I will write separate",
          "A great experience with so much colour and lots of holiday gifts. The vendors were quite persistent but not aggressive.",
          "What a nightmare of a place to visit. If the shop keepers would leave you alone it would be a wonderful experience. However we went in December and there were not many tourists about so the shop keepers were desperate to get you in their shops, trying to drag you into their",
          "Go for a walk around but be careful. They approach you and harass you to go to their establishment. The prices are very high inside. You can get better deals elsewhere. Good for taking photos due to the historic background.",
          "There are several entrances or Bab's into the old Medina in Hammamet . Once inside the walls you will be asked to enter the shops \" to bring luck as you are the first visitor of the day\". If you are interested in the leather goods they are selling then do not be afraid to go in",
          "The Medina is a warren of labyrinth streets, a lot of white walls and mosaic tiles. There are many shops catering to tourists and the shopkeepers advertizing their goods, trying to get you into their shops, We visited the old town first. I would of likely bought some bits if I",
          "This whole visit lasted all of 10 minutes if that - we were penned in and surrounded by three or four shop owners within seconds of setting foot into the Medina. It got very annoying and overwhelming very quickly - almost to the point of being intimidating, so we made a sharp",
          "Very Nice place but expect to be hassled when I'm the market! Had a look around the old dirt was good with nice views!",
          "Not a patch on Sousse, it's a modern medina and without any atmosphere. We wouldn't return. Hammamet itself hasn't got much to offer except for the castle.",
          "nice place to go beach was very beautifull people are nice very help they speak little english arabic and frech they second languarge",
          "Didn\u2019t stay long too in your face and we\u2019ve been to Marrakesh twice! Couldn\u2019t see anything as being pressured so much from so many so just left",
          "Th\u00e9 M\u00e9dina is like a trap. Every 5 mn, you're told to come in the shops, \"only to see, please, with no stress\". The only way to escape is by saying you know the country, it's not the 1st time you come. But french people are particularly caught by sellers because of money and",
          "This place is really pretty to walk around in! The pebble roads, the small shops, coffee and sheesha spots all nice, but the not so nice are the people working here!!! They harass you to come to their shops, I understand they are trying to make a living but when you say \u2018no",
          "It's a nice place but you can't look anywhere without someone constantly pestering you to go look and buy",
          "Lovely shopping area not many tourists about this time of year was very quiet and relaxing beautiful place very clean",
          "We had walk around and did some shopping very beautiful place full colour you do get harassed by the shop owners to buy buy and everything asda prices lol but we say no if didn't want anything.but we still had a great day",
          "Beautiful town went in souk sat had coffee in a lovely friendly cafe had wander around beach was a lovely morning spent in old medina",
          "I , as a half Tunisian and Englishmen ...... I hated the place . It's gorgeous but thank Allah that my arms are securely fixed in their sockets . Advice? ..... Go with a good escape plan ..... Or new Nikes",
          "All the other reviews about the shopkeepers insisting you come into their shop, how aggressive they can become when you say no etc, pressuring you into buying is correct. It spoiled my enjoyment of what seemed like a nice place so much so I ended up going back to my hotel sooner",
          "Have just come from the bazaar/medina. Walking towards we were approached by a guy pretending he worked in the hotel. He was very friendly spoke excellent English and said he\u2019d take us to a good shop there. It was allegedly \u201chappy hour\u201d where everything is half price and don\u2019t",
          "The old medina was very nice with narrow streets. We walked there and the shop owner started insisting on us to enter their shop to have a look. They were very rude and if you don't accept their price they get angry!!",
          "The narrow streets were nice but found the shop owners rude and pestering. One even shouted at us \"don't come back\" after we haggled and didn't take his price. They lie about prices to attract you in. We did find one shop owner who was very calm and ended up buying from him.",
          "The Medina is a nice collection of shops that will appeal to many. Stall owners very keen to get you in to their stalls. Probably worth two visits the first to look at the stalls and the second to buy.",
          "A small very interesting Medina bargaining is a must but you get results, leather goods can be a good buy",
          "Walking around you get harassed and hassled , sometimes aggressively. On one occasion I told the store keeper I was not interested and he became quite aggressive and started talking in Arabic at me .",
          "A must for a first visit to Hammamet - good bargains but haggling is great fun and you get a bargain",
          "What an awful experience. After living in Turkey i am quite used to the Hassle, but this is completely another level. The guys are more aggressive and angry. AVOID",
          "You might enjoy a bit of haggling elswhere, but not here. We were virtually held prisoner until we bought something. Other shopkeepers grab you and pull you into their shops, selling the same fake clothing as the one next to it. Get most indignant if you decline their invitation",
          "The medina is a warren of narrow streets, white walls and mosaic tiles abound. There are a lot of shops catering to tourists and the shopkeepers can be quite forceful in trying to get you into their shop, with promises of no hassle and cheap prices they find it hard to accept",
          "We visited the old Medina first but unfortunately didn\u2019t even get to properly look at anything as the staff were so pushy and didn\u2019t give you space to breath. I would of likely bought some bits if I was given the chance to look without other things thrusted in my face. If people",
          "Wonderful traditional great atmosphere nothing too much weather lovely historic and beautiful scenery beaches",
          "I now visited both the new and old Medinas in Hammamet. There is a marked difference between the two with the new Medina being pleasant if somewhat sterile. There are far few shops and more touristy things to see even a cinema. There is a small museum which is wirth a visit as",
          "Taxis are reasonably cheap when you bargain with the taxi driver. From Steigenberger hotel to the old medina it usually cost us 6 dinar, to hammamet Yasmine 6 dinar and to Nabil 15 dinar. We found this to be cheaper than using the taxi meter. The old medina has a good souk,",
          "We went for 2 trips 2 the medina x we had an amazing authentic meal in a restaurant,which was just inside the medina, our table overlooked the sea, it was just beautiful x then an interesting trip around the medina buying all sorts of goodies and gifts x haggling for what we",
          "Not the biggest place to visit, but good if you had kids as there s a small park for them. Upstairs you will find some shops, get your bartering head on, bargains to be had for those willing to find them!",
          "Not old Medina. Was construction in 2000. But for rest and tourists shopping very good. Absolutely security and police services. So many souvenirs, not expensive cafes and restaurants, sea meals. I think you can visit that place.",
          "This place is a rip off that is full of clever conmen. I paid what I thought was 90 dinars for 2 teeshirts and a watch (which doesn't work). The merchant entered 900 dinars (\u00a3257) which I only found out when I went onto internet banking. Very pressurised selling techniques. Not",
          "Got a taxi down here from our hotel as a afternoons activity. The square of shops recommended by our rep was very intimidating, we were the only tourists down there so every shopkeeper wanted to talk to us and show us their shop. Some will stand in your way and say they work in",
          "a great place to go and do some haggling, its like a rabbit warren in there but if haggling is your scene then go for it, above the shopping is the fort, well worth a wander too, the whole area is an experience, beware of pickpockets tho , and be firm but pleasant....",
          "We ran the gauntlet of the aggressive rude shop holders to get in the ruins of the old fort 7dts entry each. You can climb up along the old walls and take in the scenery. There is a Tunisian coffee shop at the top. Once again beware of the man saying he is a chef in your hotel",
          "nice place to stay couple of days in beach and distractions many place to visit &enjoyed the climate in summer",
          "Old style medina, narrow streets,shops everywhere with enthusiastic salesmen. Choice of gifts/souvenirs ok (certainly better than Nabael medina). Everything mass produced and therefore every shop looked the same (pottery, leather etc...) Haggle hard. start at about 40% of their",
          "We visited the old medina whilst staying in Yasmine Hammamet. We found the people to be a lot nicer and more friendly compared to the new medina. It cost us 10 dinar getting there and 20 dinar getting back as there was more traffic. A lovely experience, stick to fixed price",
          "We enjoyed visiting and taking pictures inside and outside the city walls. We managed not to get hassled too much by the traders, and even found a nice shop to pick up some souvenirs. It was fun to explore the old streets with the blue and white theme, and we stopped in a cafe",
          "Got a taxi from Hammamet to new medina about 20 Denar there and same back . Better shopping but still hard sell in shops but you soon learn to say no or just ignore them Shops are a bit far apart but you carnt have everything ,over all not bad had a nice day out",
          "A lot of com men to watch out for . Very daunting u can loose ur way or be taken foe a ride but very nice",
          "It's beautiful and has amazing views and cafes but please be away to get you to buy or into their shops or stalls all workers will say they are a chef at your hotel they are there on their day off then say they will take you to their brothers shop thankfully we didn't fall for",
          "Really enjoyed my day out with my son! We walked a lot and had lovely food there... we went inside all the areas! Everyone was very friendly and attentive! Eventually we went to have some food and it was lovely too!",
          "after dinners we use to walk in medina lots of shops and coffee shops to chill in evening and lots of other things going around horse rides",
          "A must-see in Hammamet. Many small shops, old crafts, various suenirs, leather goods, etc The sellers can be a bit tedious, but bargaining is also the part of enjoying the shopping",
          "I got back from Hammamet just over a week ago and here's my experience; I stayed at Royhal Nozha hotel and the staff are really really sound but the foods pretty poor ! once you take a right there's a row of shops and they hound the hell outta you but (it's NOTHING compared to",
          "Took a private taxi here, walked around was \"hastled\" to buy goods in a very friendly way. Little bit of haggling. Enjoyed the whole experience",
          "I am used to being hassled when abroad and shopping. This place i could not handle it. It was ever so quiet. We bought some souvenirs for family and we asked the shop keeper would he provide stands with it which he agreed to. It took him half hour to find the stands from other",
          "lots of shops all selling the same beware they charge you so much once in the shop, lots of items are fake or of very poor quality",
          "I can only reiterate what other people have said, if you enter by the shops in the Medina you will be hassled and constantly stopped by shop keepers for you to enter their stores. The older part of the Medina is lovely to wander about and the lack of stores means its nice to",
          "We went into the Medina once, never again. If you do go into town, by all means visit the many stalls that sit outside the Medina. If you do go inside, be prepared to be hassled, grabbed and bundled into some stall or other. If your bearings are not great, you may even get lost",
          "I lived in Medina of Hammamet for two years many lovely restaurants all around the area good service many coffee shops and many shops to visit. Prices to compare with U.K. are really cheap and I\u2019m talking about gas electricity food transport beers and wine. Medina people are",
          "The Medina at hammamet is very nice good food inside the the medina its self. we were there in Ramadan so not alot was open.",
          "It\u2019s nice to see and walk around but it is all a little run down. Don\u2019t expect too much. There are restaurants nearby as is the Kasbah. Worth a visit nevertheless",
          "This bazar is much smaller than some I\u2019ve been to and there aren\u2019t really that many bargains. You have your usual fridge magnet and pottery sections (pottery is beautifully painted!) and there\u2019s a couple shops selling polo shirts but barely any trainers. Some converse but",
          "Came here with my partner on 1st June 2018 I loved it here . The hotel wad great , room clean , service was excellent . Lots to do for days out .people very friendly . The food was good but could of had bit more variety. The entertainment team were fantastic bunch of lads that",
          "Hammamet Medina great shopping and haggling experience ..a beautiful coffee bar and shisha hippy cafe overlooking the bay the beach is good for swimming safe bathing for the kids you can get burgers and also traditional Traditional Tunisian cooking here a great place to spend",
          "We went to the market in the ruins, we only stayed 10 minutes and brought nothing. It was the scariest thing I have ever been too. The shop keepers tried to grab us to go into their shops when refused they hissed at us and were abusive. They shouted after us - Really sad as",
          "I love Tunisia and came here few times, but this visit put me in shock ,I came at the beginning of high season like always do and I was shocked , it has changed so much . It is absolutely empty, only few tourists like us . Also was shocked with prices , sea food platter was 120d",
          "Stay on the outside to take your photos. There are loads of shops on the inside but with that comes the hasstle of the owners trying to push you into their shop and buy things. One after another, it\u2019s so draining and got to me. It made me ill for two days. They are all over the",
          "Medina is fine for cheap souvenirs. Haggle for best prices and bargains. WE visited all the shops in the Medina and its okay for a morning out of the hotel",

          "Nice walk, lots of shops but not for he faint of heart as locals very keen for your business, stand your ground if you say no mean no, pleasant but firm is the way to go, but if you are interested in shopping always make sure you pay no more than 1/3 of their original asking",
          "It was certainly an experience lol.A lot of hassle.But if your prepare yourself for it you will get some great bargains.Always barter they expect it & go at least under half of their price e.g. I wanted flip flops & a tunisien doll 200 dinar (joke) I bartered & stood my ground",
          "It\u2019s a nice area with lots of shops around, I\u2019d recommend it if you wanted to relax on the beach and maybe have a barbecue but other than that there isn\u2019t much else to do",
          "no security issues at all, however be aware of crafty touts who suggest they are from your hotel or no of the mosque having a special viewing for westerners...the latter we were caught with, being Christian i just wanted to look at what went on and how !. the alleys in this",
          "I love this particular medina because of it's distinct white walls, narrow alleys and its location on the edge of the Mediterranean. You can visit the fort and get a spectacular view of Hammamet or sit in one of the cafes and look out over the sea.",
          "Beautiful Places, a lot of different food and friendly people. It is a wonderful place it has its bad places and bad people just like the rest of the world. Be careful with some salesman trying to push you inside their stores or offering to explain about the Medina. If you",
          "Like a maze. We wandered around for ages. Lots of stalls, but again no hard sell and they were happy for us to wander at our leisure.",
          "Is you enjoy shopping and haggling then this is for you. It can be a very busy place at times but overall very good if you like shopping. You can get majority of your souvenirs from here from plates to drums to name bracelets. The is a lot of shops here so I would recommend",
          "This would be an easy 5 stars if it wasn't for the hassle from the vendors! It was insane. Every few steps we got accosted. We escaped out of the soul quarter into the old part where shops are few and far between and it was immediately more peaceful. A lovely walk in the narrow",

          "close to where we were staying Delfino but not much to do and not alot of shops as in nabeul. we went there by taxi costing 12 dinars.",
          "The medina is a bustling market inside of the castle. Very unexpected but a very good find. You can barter with prices as much as possible. This place was quite quiet but can only imagine that it will be great when tourists return. Felt so safe when walking around.",
          "More than the Medina, you can go to the place to find the houses where celebrities used to live and bars they used to go Fellini, Hemingway, Claudia Cardinale and more celebrities used to stroll around. So it's an honor to walk in the same places they were.",
          "what a lovely place to visit you can having some thing to eat or you can just walk around the medina and take in all the senery.",

          "Someone will ask for the time outside and tell u they work at the hotel and show a local shop who is open for 2 days only. It\u2019s all crap. Barter to at least 75% off. Say no and walk away they always call u back. Don\u2019t feel cheeky if they can con u they absolutely will. The o e",

          "Very quiet at the moment but we'll worth a visit still in winter in February so shops are very few but still a lot to look at",

          "A compact medina that can be explored in a few hours without getting lost; and while shops overall sell the same products, there are some wonderful photo opportunities of narrow souqs with white-washed walls and blue doors. When we visited, there were only few tourists around",
          "Nice Medina located just next to the sea. You can feel tourism has taken over normal life. Still nice to walk around but be aware of touts that always want to take it to their shop. Countless contradictory signs indicating medina, mosque and exit are found inside the medina...",

          "We enjoyed going to old medina in Hammamet every time. It's very nice place to buy souvenirs (luckily we bought 5 magnets for 2 dinar), walk around, take pics with jasmine flowers, go to old walls. There is nice square with fountain. Be careful of guys which says \"I am a cook",
          "Medina is small but quite entertaining. There is a lot to do from smoking water pipe\"shisha\" to watching the snake charmer. Bazaar prices aren't that bad and sellers aren't pushy.",
          "This has been newly built on the site of the ancient Medina. Unfortunately it it full of the same tourist souvenirs in almost every boutique. There are one or two places selling hand knotted rugs, which are really lovely, but you do have to be strong to resist the pull of the",

          "Lots to do and see with markets , shops , street food and caf\u00e9s. The place is like a maze and was fun to walk around and haggling trying to get a bargain. It also reminded me of old medinas in Marrakech and Malta. A must do in Hammamet",
          "Great for a good stroll and for staying in (it has a hotel) Great conference center that can hold 1200+ people (been there for international conferences) Very good architecture and setup - friendly staff and shops - excellent security",
          "We took a day trip here and the local stalls set up are impressive. You have I barter but I left that to my boyfriend. The surrounding area is a bit run down but it was nice to see the culture.",
          "It shows you what the country you are visiting is all about. It's a place full of smells, sounds, food and gifts. The best part was haggling with locals to get things for the price you want. A must go for all.",
          "So different than anything we know in North America, I love getting lost in the maze of tini streets and beautiful doors of the Medina (Old City). You can only imagine what is behind those beautiful doors. I do not care much for the shops but if you go there, bargain! You must !",

          "Very nice medina clean and easy to get to transport taxi or bus which is always there bus runs every 10 mins but nicer to walk breath in the sea air and relax at restaurant tea with nut absolutely amazing I like the medina a lot of history as well if u like that sort of thing",

          "The place itself is beautiful, the only problem is that if you go alone or in couple, you'll be approached by a lot of people during your walk, they will say to you that they work in your hotel, just because they check our bracelets and etc. I felt like a celebrity there, so",
          "Clean and peaceful. People are freindly and enjoyed the scenes. The town hall can do better for the optimum cleanliness of the streets.",
          "Very nice small medina. The sellers there are a bit pushy like everywhere but that is just the way it works there. You can bargain for good price, however some shops have fiksed price and mostly very rude sellers with very empty shops..now I know why. They all have the same",
          "This place is fake touristy Medina, I walked there and the shop owners started insisting on us to enter their shops to have a look. Cheap quality products and very high prices. JUST AVOID!!",
          "I liked the visit at night time, was overcrowded but great place to pick up presents and souvenirs, you've get to work out the price negotiation, Restaurants & coffee shops are great.",
          "Sometimes we walk in medina and look at things and maybe take a coffee. It's more expensive to buy things there then in shops.",

          "I have been at the Medina, in the heart oh Hammamet. Very small streets, full of any kind of shops and markets, very crowded. It's impossible to stay on your own 'cause the merchants try to sell you everything, all the time. If you want to buy something you have to contract the",
          "Lovely friendly safe place to visit Quaint market with quirky sellers trying to get you to buy their wares, if you don't barter they think you are stupid, walk away and the prices drop drastically but remember they rely on the tourists to survive and an extra 50p is nothing to",
          "Its nice place to discover Tunisian taradition and nature of hammamet I recommend for family and how searching for simple life",
          "Unlike the Medina in Sousse, this one is (I understand) a purpose built place that looks like and feels like film set. Nevertheless it is quite big and offers a good choice of Souvenir and Clothing shops, with the owners far less \"insistent\" than those you'll find on the",

          "Do not go. I have been to the medina in Tunis and believe me the medina of Hammamet is only for tourist. Everything is very expensive and you will experience a fake medina with strong hassling. If you want to discover a real medina life, go to Tunis.",
          "Been here for an IEEE conference, i love the place. Many coffee shops and restaurants nearby so you don't head far to eat something. For those looking for a place to take photos you got a replica of all Tunisia. Kids are lucky too, the medina includes ChartageLand, a fabulous",
          "We loved the sense of history and culture at this medina but the hassle factor is huge and gets to you eventually.",
          "Enjoyed a really good break in the Medina, it is a real shame that the UK wont let people travel to Tunisia, as I would definately go back. It is a bit touristy, but that meant I felt safe and it was relatively clean",
          "place is very very busy , the shop owers try to get you in to thier shops telling stories. Beware of the people that come up and say they work in your hotel jus to get you into a shop",
          "Okay and clean very pushy sales people here so be careful, they all say no hassle no hassle and do exactly that, if they say 200 u got to get it for 60 that's the rule there, also beware of the man that approaches and says \"remember me\" u say no then he proceeds to explain how",

          "Everything that you have ever wanted,( or didn't want), under one roof, though be prepared to haggle for it. Don't feel embarrassed, it's a way of life here, and don't think that you have to take an item, walk away they usually call you back and drop the price",
          "The picturesque medina makes the center of the city, and north and south of the city hotels are frequented by tourists within the framework of cheap package holidays. More luxurious hotels are now located ten kilometers to the south, within the complex of Yasmine Hammamet.",

          "The town is mixed. There is a city center with small shops and restaurants. There is also a beach road which I though was nice from hammamet towards nabeul, the town north of hammamet. The drive by on a sunny pleasant day was superb. Nabuel had beautiful ceramics and a nice old",
          "We just were there after the terrible terrorist attack and all the Tunisian peapole feelt ashamed about it...They was very kind and helpful. I am definitely go back to visit all the places where we have been. ..Hopefully next season other Turist not going to be affected by this",

          "We enjoyed our walk around the medina but failed to make it to the castle ramparts because the steps were too steep for my wife who has a knee problem. We got lost in the maze of narrow streets and could not find an alternative route. We could see the people walking around above",
          "Went here once on my holiday to Tunisia in June and i wouldn't go back i found the people here annoying and rude they don't take NO for an answer they claim to be the chef at your hotel to make you buy stuff i felt pressured into buying stuff, i was scared they may do something",

          "superb place to hang out in the evenings. Great places to eat and drink or simply enjoy watching people walking by. Lots of clubs and restaurants at good prices too! Shopping there can be expensive if not with a local to help you haggle. Definitely a place worth visiting over",
          "Worth the visit. Me and my husband visited this place only to find some bargains but when we walked around, went inside the Medina, it was not only bargains but you can also pay very little to go into the castle where you can see a good view of the place.",
          "Very interesting visit and with a super guide. Bit uncomfortable being 'shooed' into shops all the time but not threatening",
          "Lovely place for a nice stroll. Beware of the hagglers though they are plentyful along the Medina. There are lots of shops along the way with a lovely harabour at the end.",
          "This city is even better than south of Italy cities. Absolutely worth visiting. I have visited Hammamet during Spring and summer. I have found it be very beautiful and relaxing.",
          "great place to visit, remember to haggle, all in good spirits. Nice place to sit and eat and drink, prices reasonable and great service. I have spent many a relaxing hour sitting having a drink and watching the world go by here.",
          "I went here with my husband and his cousin. We are all 28 years old. For shopping hammamet media was was a lovely place to shop. As with everywhere in Tunisia, the shop keepers go wild as soon as they spot a tourist - dragging you in and trying to convince you that you are",
          "If you go to Hammamet you would likely be interested in shopping at Medina. There are many shops which sell traditional bags, shoes, souvenirs, decorations... It is possible to negotiate the prices with the buyers as they could be expensive.",
          "nice Medina and worth haggling to get the price down, not to much hassle from the shop staff but all good friendly banter.",
          "There are two medinas...the new one and the old. The new one is of modern shopping centers. A lovely place to be in order to view Tunisia's modern shopping without hassling and haggling and negotiations. The old medina is where you have the souqs. It is for hard bargaining, but",
          "Spent the day out at the Madina lovely sights plenty of shops great prices and plenty of restaurants too overall a great day out when staying at hammamet.",
          "This place is very old. Now, if you do not like being hassled by people on the phone or if you easily get sick and tired of hearing the same phrase over and over again, this place is really not for you. However, if you are clever with your money, like bartering and find",
          "Not my favourite experience would not recommend shopping , lots of hassle and intimidation and couldn't find anything descent to eat or drink , wouldn't return to this part of hammamet",
          "Lots of gifts to buy you have to be firm with the sellers no means no I liked all the various stalls I disliked the constant hassle from the vendors",
          "Nice sea front cafe. Wonderful views of the beautiful sea. The coffee was beautiful but you really need sugar to cut through the strength. Ships ha wonderful!",
          "Lots of places to eat and drink from coffee to wine and beer there are two night clubs and of course shopping found a great coffee shop at the top of the stairs with music and dance every night",
          "lovely friendly people nice gifts to buy not so busy like some of the medinas prices are very good and the shopkeepers are very nice",
          "I visited this place during May and I agree with other people that you can feel lost here because there is many entrances and exits, so you don't know from which side you went inside and where you should go out. I am working like tourist guide and I found way how to discover",
          "walked only in the day to marina not well lit by night. did not find any bars selling drinks mainly ice-cream.",

          "I enjoyed it but I would have been lost in the crowd if I was not there with my Algerian Husband ... They don't want to speak English at all ... If they could they won't ... I would recommend this to anyone as an experience but make sure you are not alone and most of all can",
          "Pity you can't just walk and browse , without all the hassle , they would get more sales if they just left you to look",
          "Good experience but if you are not used to arabic countries you may not feel weel.They are trying to sell everything everywhere.Remember to divide their price by 4 and then start ;)",
          "Small winding cobbled streets where you get hassled every step, if only they realised the hassle stops you looking and buying their products.",
          "The medina is an old fort changed into some small businesses, some homes and some cafe/restaurants. For me sitting having a drink right next to the sea is a real highlight. It is not overpriced which you can tell by the number of Tunisians relaxing there. For shopping I love it",
          "A very interesting place to visit, as it is wonderful fort with an amazing view over Hammamet bay. Awesome to sit and view over either in the day or late evening. Inside the medina, there are lots of shops which are all very much alike. A lot of the shopkeepers do give you",
          "We visited this on the hottest day of the year. Even the locals were complaining. The shops are nice if you are into soveniers and the like but the shopkeepers can pester.",
          "Lovely place but very quiet and got targeted by all the shop owners and restaurant people. We really felt like the 'only brits in the village!'",

          "Go to the Medina for a couple of hours and you will have a great time but ladies.. No bum skimming shorts or boobs out tops.Muslim country remember, you are a visitor here so save it for the beach please. Walk around the outside of the medina sea on your right and you will come",
          "I left all shops exhausted and with a headache, the staff would not let you browse without continuously bothering you. The only shops that were ok were the ones with prices on items.",
          "We had a local guide pick us up from our hotel, we got a tour of Medina, watched rugs being made, a must wow they are amazing quality go to the shop with the goverment flag flying outside, middle entrance opp' the war memorial, met our guides family & yes his cousins' shop was",

          "This is the old medina located inside stone walls, near the urban center of Hammamet. You can see the local museum and shop all the souvenirs you like. But always negociate the price as they always ask too too much for anything. For all the ones that like or want to by",
          "We went to the medina and had a great laugh with the locals. Yes they do try to get you in their shops and sell you things but stand your ground. If you want to buy something and you have a price in mind start haggling a lot lower than what you want to pay.",
          "it was an experience got co ursed into one shop thought I would never get out it was a laugh but turned out an expensive one ,by god he was a talker ,bought a few things ,then he said his brothers shop was next door ,seems he had 8 brothers all ,with shops next door ,his dad",
          "Too many pushy vendors at the entrance - Typical of any of the Medinas in Tunisia - sell, sell, sell - same old tourist tat. We been to Tunisia before knew what to expect but here they were overly pushy.",
          "If they stopped pestering you sand allowed you to decide if you want to go into shop they would probably get more business",
          "You cannot step a foot without being constantly hassled and even with haggling the prices are still expensive, it is much cheaper and easier visiting the set price supermarkets for all holiday trinkets, gifts etc..",
          "I have to say after visiting the medina in hammamet after a 20 year absence, I was disappointed, not the attraction it was all those years ago, not as I remembered or indeed wanted to show to my children, such a shame as it has lost its true spirit and now just seems about",
          "The medina really is quite beautiful and it's great to see all the history of Tunisia. You can buy all of your souvenirs and spices etc here around all teh small twists and turns of the narrow streets. HOWEVER - be prepared to be invited in to every shop you pass which can get a",
          "Not overwhelmed by the shops in the medina although the views from the roof top restaurant were perfect and well worth the trip.",
          "A great place to visit, you can imagine it in olden times with a real buzz with tiny alleyways selling everything, today the sellers can be a little pushy but only trying to make a living much of it in good humour & batering is a way of life,",
          "Beautiful piece of history . Was shown around by a guide from the travel operator who was happy to answer questions and explain things. Really enjoyable",
          "Beautiful place, lots of narrow streets to explore. Fantastiv view out towards the sea and a great beach. Locals are extremely pushy and you need to firm and say no. My partner got alot of hassle because of her blue eyes and they tried to pull her into there shops, however a",
          "Visited the Medina twice. Plenty of bargains there but be prepared to haggle. Usually whatever price they ask for, it'll usually end up just a quarter of the initial asking price. The stall owners can be a little pushy, but just decided what you are prepared to pay for the",

          "Walked up the beach from our hotel to the medina. Nice pleasant stroll of around 25 mins. Once in the medina you felt all eyes were you on . Mainly small market stalls offering usual fake designer belts bags t-shirts etc. If you pick something up they will start bartering with",
          "Of course, you must bargain for anything which I don't necessarily enjoy, but I'm good at walking away. So many sense: sights, sounds, smells. Soak in the culture. Enjoy it and have a limit as to how much you will spend.",

          "Worth a visit but expect to be hassled. As long as you're firm that \"no\" means \"no\" and walk away then you'll be ok. The Medina is very quiet and I felt sorry for the shopkeepers as they must be really struggling but the constant hassle actually makes it less likely that people",
          "You are basically there to be parted from your money. We were got in the 1st shop we ventured into & left with just enough for the taxi back to hotel ! Big mistake - going as just a couple, going on a Friday ( their religious day ) & off season , we didn't see another person",
          "Don't believe it when they tell you its a hassle free experience as soon as you enter they are on you and if you don't make it obvious that you are not interested in buying fake designer goods they stick to you , and the smell in there is like a poorly run public toilet !!",
          "it is a shopping experience ,and they do try to get you to buy but we found a firm no thank you worked ,if you want hassle free shopping go to the bigger shops JOYS for example nobody came near us ,we had to ask for help in there .so if you go to medias it is a market place",
          "A small medina, some interesting items - mostly 'genuine fake' items of 'designer' clothing, bags and shoes. Very pushy shop keepers, which wasn't helped by the lack of tourists so you were homed in on! We spent about an hour and a half in the medina which was enough.",
          "We were on a prearranged trip with Thomas Cook to visit both the Medina in Hammamet and also in Yasmin Hammamet. Not worth the money as we were escorted around the medina to all the tour guides mates and then left to fend for ourselves. The shop keepers are extremely pushy and",

          "Came across this while exploring the area on my stay. I'm a female and went on my own so the men can be very pushy. Learn to haggle though and you'll get a good bargain. Start low and work your way up to meet near the middle. And if you're not happy with the price and they",
          "Really loved this part of the city, it's cool labyrinths,stone walls and signature doors. You can buy some nice souvenirs there or just chat with the locals and cool down in its shady acades. There are a couple of nicesea facing restaurants where you can have a freshly squeezed",

          "I visited the medina in September and November. In sept it was busy with tourists which created a lively atmosphere. In nov it was quiet which meant we got more attention from sellers. Generally sellers are friendly but obviously want you to buy from them. Some can be pushy but",

          "Relaxed area with open spaces dotted with good class restaurants, cafes and Casino. There are shops which sell usual souvenirs which are not that over-priced. The atmosphere is extremely peaceful.",
          "Not everyone's cup of tea, although I enjoyed it. You are hassled from the second you walk in to the second you leave with people trying to get you into their shop. Firm no's will see you through but it is not for the weak. However, there are loads of shops, lots of bargains",
          "Definitely preferred hammamet Yasmin Maybe I went at the wrong time ie late afternoon It is interesting so many families live in the medina but staff chasing you down the street to get you into the shop was a pain Also more expensive in this area in comparison to yasmin",
          "you are invited to look around the stalls/shops with the promise of no hassle to buy. I would hate to think what it would be like if they did hassle you then. they also say everything is fixed price. it is until you start to walk out then the bargaining commences.",

          "We visited the Medina from Jasmine Hammamet and travelled by taxi (10d each way). It was quiet and quaint and the hassle from the shop keepers was not too bad. The museum is worth a visit.",

          "Nice walk to Medina and local area Enjoyed walking there my husband went jogging here and to the next beach Nice place for pictures",
          "Tunisia's version of Blackpool I'm afraid. Full of not so cheap tat, in the words of one of the shop owners \"Everything we sell is a genuine fake\" !!! Most of the owners employ an aggressive selling manner which does not go down well with the majority of visitors. If you tell",
          "Not the best. After a few days once you see one tunisian shop, you have seen them all. Feb half term for us and mainly closed but will be bustling over the summer with the first floor full of restaurants to choose from. You WILL get hassled at every corner so be on your toes",

          "The Madina has lots of lovely Tunisian made items and also loads of fake shoes, bags etc. You will be pestered to buy constantly and if you ignore them they mutter under their breath at you. It can be a frightening experience if you are a female on your own. If you do happen",
          "We visited the madina twice whilst there! It was well worth it! It was quiter this time of year than the summer months! Worth a visit as it was nice and a few bargains to be had !",
          "a wonderful place to browse and have a drink,haircut or a shave!. you will get pestered but that's Tunisia. just smile and say no thank you or nothing at all. please do not be frightened of the Tunisian people they are wonderful people and very friendly. i have never seen any",

          "As we went out of season their was very little tourism so the shopkeepers were understandably desperate to make a living. They were also very annoying using what they thought were English phrases that we could relate to, e.g. \"come and have a butchers\" or \"cheaper than Asda\".",
          "I didn't want to buy anything in the first place. We got the usual hassle but that's to be expected. Just hated every second we were in there and couldn't get out quick enough. My fault for wanting to have a look in the first place.",
          "It is true that you get hassled, especially if it's off season and tourists are less plentiful. But I find this is true in most of souqs I had been to in the Middle East. It can be daunting at first, but really you just have to ignore the sellers trying to get you in their",
          "At the time of our visit there were very few tourists so we were bombarded by shop keepers who appeared desperate for a sale. I don't mind haggling but this was a bit over the top, the fixed price shops I found were a better option with very reasonable prices.",
          "I was disappointed but the medina in Hammamet. Unfortunately the sellers/shop keepers just don't give you a chance to stop and browse. As soon as you stop - you get hassled to buy. Everyone tries to get you to look in their shop - but most of the shops sell the same things",
          "Expect to be hassled, just keep walking if you're not interested in something. They just love to haggle so start off at a ridiculously low figure and don't pay more than a third of what you would normally pay. Don't be tempted to fork out the extra dinar they cajole you for",

          "A great place to look around, and plenty of character, however the unwanted characters are those on the streets that will not leave you alone. I'd say a female travelling alone would be very intimidated by some of them, where as I was a bit more abrupt and then they left me",
          "Had to be careful to avoid scammers taking you to areas that were of no interest and then demanding a tip.",
          "Went to visit several times during our holiday lots of lovely shops and cafes a cinema plenty to do shop keepers can be quite persistent but just say no they get the message on the end but definitely worth a visit",
          "Visiting here was like being transferred into a different lifetime. It is like a maze and great fun to walk through with all of the shop owners trying to sell their wares. There are also some really interesting wall murals throughout the walkways.",
          "It's a nice place if you have an hour or two to kill but it's nothing special. There are little shops (run by locals or at least they say so) which are highly overpriced and sell nothing but crap. Everything could be found cheaper outside this place. If you, despite everything,",
          "I went here for about 2 hours, the medina is quite small however they do have a market. This is more for locals rather then tourists however prepare to haggle. There is a supermarket here and a few nice resturants so worth a nice walk.",
          "This is the place to taste the flavour of local shopping, but be prepared to haggle and always remember to say NO and walk away if you don't want to buy.",
          "Beware the locals lie a lot. I had fun haggling with the locals over a cup of tea, but the local guiding us there actually lied that he is working in our hotel. Overpaying is a certainty not a possibility. Asking prices are as much as a 100 times the actual price, so be sure to",
          "This is a place to see but avoid being fooled by the conmen and shops. They spin you the yarn that they are staff from your hotel and that you should come and see their shops.......PLEASE DON'T BE FOOLED!!! They rope you in and offer you hospitality and offer you amazing",
          "like i said beware of conmen and dont forget to haggle. the place is full of conmen and you must be very wise.",
          "As described by the rep as Disney Medina which is the only thing he did know. Ok to pass some time , but usual nonsense as expected in any of the shops , good fun though and ok if you are not intimidated and able to handle their many ways of getting your cash.",
          "felt a bit intimidated with the shop owners if they left you alone to browse perhaps you would buy something",
          "This is very nice and incredibly intresting place. Small streets, nice little shops. You should visit also a small market and spices market. Houses are white and blue. So nice.",
          "A truly lovely place, although the sellers hassle you all the time. Start low with your price then come up. Plenty of leather good at good prices.",
          "fort wasnice to see, pity the locals havent learned that no means no they are only putting most visitors of be prepared to haggle prices on everything",
          "We caught the local bus into Hammaret and got off near the Medina Fort to look around the small shops actually situated within the walls of the fort. We walked around this little area for about 1 hour and the number of little shops in such a small area was amazing . The owners",
          "A lovely place and quite quiet on the day we visited. No real hassle from any of the shop keepers and some nice looking places to enjoy a glass of tea and the scenery.",
          "Did not have a great experience here has some shop keepers very rude if you did not buy from them. Would only go if a group of you and definitely haggle the prices down. Sold all the same things in the shops, lots of real fake clothes bags etc.",
          "Visited late November and it was almost deserted, so we were easy targets for every salesman in sight! Got a bit hair raising at times, but we finally found a chap who had a softer sell and we bought quite a few bits from him. We agreed that with a bit less hassle we would",
          "its like all the sellers went to the same business school using the same sale tactics and same stuff everywhere. If you like camel stuff, plates and wooden carvings this is for you. Haggle alot! Some sellers get aggresive with you when they cant sell to you.",
          "Nice area to pick up a few gifts.Good photo opportunity.Nice restaurants inside where you can also enjoy shisha.A theme park for children is also inside and a cinema.",
          "Wet there on trip and picked up some bargains, don`t be afraid to haggle(once we overcame our initial fear, had great fun).There are two alleys as you approach,take the left, more geared up for tourists!",
          "The shops were well stocked with goodies but the hassle to come to my shop was of putting I don't think they understand no thanks. Even if you had bags full of purchases you still got hassle.",
          "Do not bother going to this place nothing but con merchants trying to sell you rubbish and even the flower seller giving you a flower as a present and then asking for payment, just give it back and tell him to take a hike",
          "not a lot to see here really but, there are shops if we had gone a little further along, also being November not much going on sure to better in the summer. we walked here along the beach. about half an hour",
          "It is ok quite when there so they all concentrated on us. Nice stuff if onlybthey did not push as much",
          "Went to the new Medina in Hammamet on an overcast, showery day. I am fully aware of the haggling and pressure selling of the shop keepers, but it was way too much, to the point at which my partner felt uncomfortable, and thought we'd be robbed or something similar. I can look",
          "The medina is very interesting and we would have loved to have wandered through it. Unfortunately the store owners had other ideas and although we have been all around the world we did find these ones desperate. But you can't buy in all the shops. After making our purchases",
          "The market stalls were lovely and colourful and you wasn't hassled much to look at things on stalls and in shops",
          "This place should be seen by anyone who travel to Hammamet. It has got a souk style decor and atmosphere. Quite small but it does remind us the souk in Marrakech, kind of mini grand bazzar in Istanbul and the trade style of Damascus gate in Jerusalem. As experienced travellers",
          "Marine wasn't too bad, a lot of fishes to see, they had 2 Pirate ships, in cafes they don't serve beer, all around dirty and smelly. Don't even think to go in the shops, so much hassle, and they style is quiet poor.",
          "Had a good walk round the markets. Sat and had a cold drink watching the world go by, wasn't as much there as I thought maybe going by write up. Wouldn't go again. A visit is worth it though.",
          "I bought 2 so called leather belts for about \u00a316 after heavy haggling (about half the price wanted) only to discover on one belt one of the holes wasn't punched out properly. When i removed the bit from the hole i discovered that it was made of leather on the outside where they",
          "I dont advise anyone to go to the Medina unless they want to be hassled from start to finish a nightmare watch out for the Tunisian wearing a hat with flowers on he will ask you if you want to take a photo and will then ask you for money and won't take less than 5 dinars we had",
          "As soon as I got out of the taxi I was met by, once again, a chef from the hotel haha, best to cover up your wrist band if all inc. I would have enjoyed it much more if I was with the family but did this trip on my own so does get annoying after a while, entered medina to get to",
          "We went here by taxi. The medina is compact and easily negotiated. Practice saying NO firmly and often and you'll enjoy the experience. If you decide to buy, you need to haggle and start from about a third to a quarter of the asking price. It's best if you decide before you",
          "just a a medina should be...some lovely narrow passages and beautiful housed....pictures need to be taken here.... go to Barberousse.....you'll see it above the enterance of the medina....views of the bay...excellent fench cuisine.....delightful.",
          "nice place but be aware they are very very pushy and want you to go in there stalls very hard to leave without hassle just be firm and say NO make sure you know exchange rate as they try to confuse you between sterling and dinar",
          "We were a large group of mainly lads (20's) and found the medina welcoming and exciting without being overbearing or too much hassle. I could see that a smaller group (or sad to say... those with more female travellers) may be a bit more intimidated with the narrow maze-like",
          "Went for a trip to the medina with Mr Moustache from our hotel. So informative. He grew up there and our afternoon out as very interesting. You will visit a carpet factory, but they aren't as pushy as some others. Loved he colours and seeing the locals. Brilliant.",
          "This medians it has old shop and has expo plus it has shops and coffee shop Tunisa way to services tea with mint which the only place find there .",
          "I liked everything. The area is full of touristic shops, restaurants, handicraft, and even better quality shops than other areas.",
          "where do i start got out of the taxi and a man was trying to sell me drugs. the area itself was okay we went to a restaurant on the sea front and enjoyed the view i would highly recommend that when the sum goes down",
          "Tacky souvenirs and trinkets....AVOID!!! Tacky souvenirs and trinkets....AVOID!!! Tacky souvenirs and trinkets....AVOID!!!",
          "The Old Medina was really nice and had loads of great places to eat with excellent views with the rustic Middle Ages narrow cobbled streets, felt much better than Dubai. If you want the flashy new malls with designer goods - you can always head down to the new Medina, but there",
          "I know its hard to do but don't go into the first shop and buy have a look around before you start haggling. We got caught out with this when buying some throws at the end of the medina (right by the sea) there is a lovely shop 'The Brother's Shop' which does an excellent range",
          "There are two medinas one in yasmine hammamet and one in the old town, the marina in the old town is hairy there are people begging and trying to take you on little tours of the medina. The shop keepers will not take no for an answer, keep your cool and rise above it, this is",
          "Lots of places to eat and drink. Plenty for the children to do. It is free to enter,only pay for what you want to do. Good day or night.",
          "Visited the medina which was interesting, very clean, lots of traders and restaurants. I do think the old medinas are a lot more interesting with the old folk who have been selling goods for years.",
          "Plenty of shops but you do feet hassled and pestered to go inside and they don't give up easily! Don't forget to haggle.",
          "Shops, restaurants and attractions. Very commercial and a bit money grabbing. Steakhouse restaurant does a decent steak at reasonable cost but service is not good.",
          "aggressive in your face shop keepers spoil the medina - no wonder it was quiet when we went - their behaviour towards visitors is probably scaring people away",
          "They will rip you off, great place to go see local life and eat great food. Open through most of the night and has this amazing place called Piano bar.",
          "not much to see or buy. more variety in the fixed price stores around the medina. stall holders are aggressive and rude.",
          "Nice respite from the resort areas to see a bit of the real Tunisia in the area. Haggle everywhere and enjoy a nice shisha and Turkish coffee here.",
          "Nice place with good Tunisian products and souvenirs However, you should always negotiate price. We got great souvenirs and a really beautiful mirror from there",
          "All the shops are the same, and it is not cheap. You must haggle to get anything reasonable. Leather goods are the best",
          "The medina is very quaint and interesting to see. We went into the museum but nothing was in English and it was very dark so probably couldn't read it any way but the view from the top was impressive. The shop keepers are a little more aggressive and tried to body block me a",
          "Constantly being harassed by shop keepers to buy items is not my way of shopping. Doesn't work for me. However, one can pick up a bargain here and there.",
          "As these things go, this medina (walled town, but usually this means a maze of small shops) was quaint and not so jam-packed with shops that it made it too claustrophobic or overwhelming. Yes, the locals are desperate for you to buy and yes, it can be very irritating, but",
          "I loved the shopping and the medina is spotless, however when you are going round the Tunisians are very pushy and try pulling you into their shops. I would not go in and around it myself being a woman",
          "Don't like to be dragged into 'shops' leave me and I might purchase. Couldn't enjoy the surrounding scenes because of the hassle.",
          "Great fun negotiating on price & you can really drive a bargain but be prepared ro be hassled - nothing scarey but you need to be ok with constantly being approached - if you say no they leave you alone & most are really nice & funny",
          "Just hassle to walk in the street towards the Medina from shop owners trying to sell their items, if you refused they swore at you, not nice experience, felt very intimidating.",
          "At the entrance to the Medina, you are greeted by an adult and baby camel, and a local saying I English \"look baby camel, sweet, lovely, pay for picture\" don't be tempted! Things don't get much better once in the Medina. The shop owners will try all sorts to get you to look",
          "We found the smaller local shops easier and cheaper especially if you are prepared to haggle which they love",
          "We had some great bargains and the local are really friendly, they made us a drink and asked us to take a seat and make ourselves comfy, lovely leather goods, jackets, bags etc",

          "Loved the bargains but would have loved to be able to look without being hassled, just try to ignore them, stand your ground or walk away lol",
          "We visited in September, on a Sunday afternoon. We only walked around a small part of the Medina, it is quite run down and unappealing in the inside - looks much nicer on the outside! We were approached / talked to by the stall holders vying to sell their wares. If you like",
          "prepare yourself to be hassled a lot but it is worth it. learn to say LA it means no. stay firm and they will leave you alone. at every corner there's a somebody trying to make business so they will be annoying but be firm and tell them not disturb you after a while they back",
          "Went to the medina a couple of times near the end of September and you just get harassed from start to finish. The medina was pretty quite so I suppose they are just desperate for your custom. There are the odd few shops in the middle that are fixed prices so at least you can",
          "There is lots to look at, though it is definately a bartering culture so be prepared! My husband got a hair cut in the street here, very bizarre but I have to say they did a great job!",
          "Good selection of local bars and shops. The shop keepers can be very persistent even when you firmly say no.",

        "wiki": "On 18 March 2015, three militants attacked the Bardo National Museum in the Tunisian capital city of Tunis, and took hostages. Twenty-one people, mostly European tourists, were killed at the scene, and an additional victim died ten days later. Around fifty others were injured. Two of the gunmen, Tunisian citizens Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaoui, were killed by police, and the third attacker is currently at large. Police treated the event as a terrorist attack.The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attack, and threatened to commit further attacks. However, the Tunisian government blamed a local splinter group of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, called the Okba Ibn Nafaa Brigade, for the attack. A police raid killed nine members ten days later.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSince the removal from power of longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in the 2011 Tunisian Revolution, the country has faced occasional attacks from Islamist militants, mainly in remote areas. Tourism has been important to the nation's economy since its transition to democracy.\n\n\n== Attack ==\nThe morning of the attack, the cruise ships MSC Splendida and Costa Fascinosa docked at the Port of La Goulette. Some of the passengers on board the ships had decided to go to the Bardo Museum. At the time of the attack, more than 200 tourists were present in the vicinity.The attack began at around 12:30 p.m. At that time, security guards protecting the museum and the nearby Parliament building were absent on a coffee break. The tourists were attacked as they were getting off a bus to enter the Bardo Museum compound. As scores of visitors ran toward the museum to avoid the shooting, the attackers pursued them and took them hostage inside. The siege lasted three hours, ending when security forces breached the building and killed two of the attackers. One policeman was fatally shot during the rescue operation.Tunisian security forces escorted dozens of tourists up nearby steps and away from the danger, as armed agents pointed guns toward an adjacent building. Many tourists ran in panic to safety, including at least one couple carrying two children.During the attack, members of Parliament were discussing counter-terrorist legislation when they were ordered to evacuate the building due to the sound of gunfire. They were later forced to lie down on the ground as security forces commenced the rescue operation of hostages.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nAccording to analyst Rita Katz of the SITE Intelligence Group, holders of Twitter accounts associated with ISIL were overjoyed at the attack, urging Tunisians to \"follow their brothers\". The day following the attack, the Islamic State group issued a statement claiming responsibility for the incident and promising further attacks. Meanwhile, a Twitter account linked to the Islamic State published a photograph of one of the Italian victims; the image, showing Francesco Caldara, has a red cross drawn on it and the words: \"Crusader Crushed.\"Anti-terrorism protests began in central Tunis after the attack, with crowds reportedly chanting, \"Tunisia is free, terrorism out.\" On 24 March, nearly a week after the attack, the museum held a ceremonial reopening. Simultaneously, thousands of Tunisians and tourists staged a march in Tunis to show their solidarity with the slain victims.On 29 March, tens of thousands of demonstrators, along with French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, and several other world leaders, marched in Tunis under the slogan The World Is Bardo (Le Monde est Bardo) to protest terrorism.\n\n\n=== Victims ===\nWhen the attack ended, nineteen foreign tourists, including four Italians, three French nationals, three Japanese, three Polish nationals, two Spaniards, two Colombians (including one with dual Australian citizenship), one Russian, and one British national were found to have been killed. A Tunisian police officer, and two perpetrators were also reported dead. On 28 March, an injured French woman, Huguette Dupeu, died of her wounds at a hospital.Over 50 other people were injured, many of them foreign tourists. MSC Crociere S.A. reported that nine of its guests had been killed, and twelve were injured; six visitors, all from MSC Splendida, including two Spaniards, one Belgian, one British national, one French national, and one Japanese were killed. The cruise company said that it would not schedule any further visits to the Port of La Goulette in 2015, choosing Malta as a replacement.\n\n\n== Perpetrators ==\nYassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaoui, both Tunisian citizens, were identified by Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid as the two slain gunmen a day after the attack. Prior to the attack, Labidi lived in the Tunis neighborhood of Ibn Khaldoun, while Khachnaoui was from Kasserine. Labidi moved after the Jasmine Revolution to Sfax for work, and lived there until his death. He worked as a deliveryman for a local business prior to the attack. While Labidi was known to intelligence services, neither of the two men had previously been positively linked to known Tunisian terrorist organisations.An operation looking for up to three suspected accomplices was launched immediately following the attack. On the following day, nine people were arrested, four for direct links to the cell which carried out the shooting and five for having indirect links to it. Their roles in the attack have not yet been clarified. On 21 March, the number of people arrested reached over twenty, with ten accused of having direct links to the museum attack. On 26 March, authorities arrested twenty-three members of a terror cell linked to the attack.According to BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, an al-Qaeda operative claimed the men had spent two months training with militants in Derna, Libya. On 20 March, Tunisian Security Minister Rafik Chelly announced that Labidi and Khachnaoui had received weapons training in Libya from an unspecified group prior to carrying out the attack. According to authorities, they managed to slip past the border to Libya undetected in December.On 22 March, Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi said a third gunman was involved in the attack, and is at large.On 28 March, Tunisian police killed Lokman Abu Sakhra, an Algerian suspected of planning the attack, along with eight other armed men during a raid in the southern Gafsa region. They were allegedly major members of the Okba Ibn Nafaa Brigade, a splinter group of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Interior Ministry spokesman Mohamed Ali Aroui said, \"[T]he nine were among the most dangerous terrorists in Tunisia.\" Sakhra was said to be the leader of the group. The Tunisian government said the Okba Ibn Nafaa Brigade was responsible for the attack, despite claims of responsibility made by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.On 20 May, 22-year-old Moroccan illegal immigrant Abdelmajid Touil was arrested in Italy on allegations that he aided the attackers.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n\n=== Domestic ===\n\nTunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi announced via Facebook that he would address the nation later that day. In his address, he called the attack a \"huge disaster\" and called for Tunisia to prevent such an attack in the future, further saying that the country was in a \"war against terrorism\". He also pledged for the quick passage of an anti-terrorism law. Prime Minister Habib Essid issued a statement on the \"cowardly\" attack and called for unity, later chairing an emergency cabinet meeting. Essebsi also praised Akil, a one-and-a-half-year-old German Shepherd police dog who was killed in the raid, saying, \"It's a victim we don't talk about but it's a heavy loss.\" On the day following the attack, Essebsi ordered the deployment of Tunisian troops to the country's major cities as a security precaution.\n\n\n=== International ===\nAustralian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop called the incident a \"terrorist attack on a fledgling democracy\", and Prime Minister Tony Abbott sent his condolences to the family of an Australian killed in the attack. British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond described the killings as a \"cowardly terrorist attack\", whilst Prime Minister David Cameron described the incident as \"appalling and brutal\". Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos lamented the death of the two Colombians killed in the attack and expressed his solidarity with their families; the foreign ministry added a statement. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls condemned the attack. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi condemned the attack and emphasized that Italy is close to the Tunisian government. President Sergio Mattarella condemned the attack as \"a fact of unprecedented violence\". The Japanese government condemned the attack as \"despicable\", while Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe, in addition to his own condemnation, stated that Tokyo was working to collect further information. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Spain condemned the attack in a press release.Condolences and outrage were expressed by other states, including the Holy See, Mexico, the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, Singapore, Syria, Turkey, and the United States.\n\n\n== Memorials ==\nOn 4 March 2019, a memorial to the British victim, and those of the 2015 Sousse attacks, called Infinite Wave, was unveiled in Cannon Hill Park, Birmingham, England, by Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of terrorist incidents, 2015\nList of terrorist incidents in Tunisia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nTurmoil in Libya Strengthening Extremism in Tunisia.

          "- not far to travel - an interesting place to visit - good guides but very hot, take water with you to drink! (l was there in august)",

          "The guide was great and very informative, great to see how a home worked years ago. The museum was very interesting with some real gems in. The Crocodile farm is at the back of the museum and was worth a visit, we went for feeding time and enjoyed the spectacle.",
          "Try to get there during the feeding time, 5pm. You might find yourself feeding the crocos. There are different sections for baby crocos, teens and adults. Next to the farm you can visit typical Djerba houses and see some artisans working. Interesting, but artificial. There are",
          "Good trip. The turtles are quite good to see fighting each other. Feeding time is a 5pm we had a guide which told us to wait in front of the greenhouse which gave us a great view of feeding. They got one of our tour party involved in feeding trowing the food in, not much to do",
          "This is a must do, the guides are very good and want to make you feel welcome. The best time to visit is when they feed the Crocs, which is at 5 pm, to get the best viewpoint stand in front of the greenhouse. If you want some hassle free shopping then there is a small shopping",
          "Loved this visit we did, my advice would be to go at around 4.15pm - feeding time is daily at 5pm and you want a front row view for that!",
          "It was really great experience! The crocks are put in a situation close to their natural and it's a good way to see their real behavior and life-style from a safe place. Much better than a zoo and cheaper and safer than a safari trip in Africa! This is a video from my experience",
          "When I was told to visit this crocodile park I thought, \"okay whatever\". But eventually we went there and I was really positively surprised how well designed and neatly kept this park is. And it is rather big (just like the crocodiles in the pools). If you have the chance talk",
          "Do not miss feeding time ceremony with drums. You can see also baby crocs if you have a bit of luck.",
          "You will see crocodiles :) There is nothing more you can do here so go on. You can even touch small baby crocodiles.",
          "I guess there is only a short amount of time you can look at crocodiles as they are not particularly animated but it was nice to visit to watch the feeding at 5 pm and also to realize that you would not like to go swimming with these creatures! Combine in the ticket price ~ \u00a35",
          "this was a very good place to visit with the 2 museum's also but please do not go until mid afternoon as feeding times are 5 pm",
          "My partner and I and a few other Brits from our Hotel whent for an afternoon out here, we all loved it. The Keepers even let us feed the Crocks. They even tried to explain in there best English the work that this place does all I can say to anyone going to Djerba that this is",
          "Be under no illusion as to what this is, it is as it says a farm, so the crocodiles are bred to be killed for food, etc. But they all seemed in good condition and watching feeding time, happens wed, fri or sun about 4pm, was entertaining.",
          "please note when visting the reps do not tell you best days to visit .if you want to see feeding the days to go are wednesdays and fridays",
          "Good little half day outing - price good (about \u00a37 per adult) interesting - never seen so many crocs!!!! Kids were amazed! Good wander about. Nice little museum and area showing traditional Djerba crafts. Very clean - little caf\u00e9 too.",
          "Great many crocs of all sizes in pools with waterfalls etc. was not informed that feeding is only Mon/Weds/Fri afternoon.",
          "well worth a visit to see approximately 400 crocodiles, that were originally brought to Tunisia from The Nile when they were a year old. Be there for 4pm to watch them be fed...fascinating!",
          "Really amazing place, I have never seen so many crocodiles at once. The place was also clean and they animals looked healthy.",

          "There are 3 areas to vist at this location, the Crocodiles, a museam and an area of traditional Djerba buuldings. There are situated in a modern Tourist zone (very near the lighthouse if you can't find it on the map). The whole complex is buuild toa high standard and is clean",
          "We visited this farm during our vacation and it was amazing. There is also a museum of Tunsian art and a mock village with representations of the various tunisian trades. The ticket covers all three and there is a 2DT surcharge for taking photos. The farm itself has an area",
          "All round most enjoyable. If you want to see them fed make sure you go over by what looks like a massive green house.",
          "We visited the crocodile farm whilst on holiday in Djerba, it was fascinating to see all the crocodiles just lazing around, a good time to visit is at 5pm when they feed them, you can stand anywhere as they feed them all around the park. The museum was interesting of how they",
          "Excellent loved the Djerba Explore as well as the crocs. Go for feeding at 5pm everyday, Refreshment prices reasonable. It doesn't matter where you stamd round the big pool as they throw the meat in from both sides",
          "A small but very good attraction, lots of crocodiles basking in the sun and you get to see crocodile eggs, baby crocodiles and then he bigger ones too. Staff were excellent, chatty pleasant and very informative. Shady spots to sit and watch the crocodiles and a small shaded cafe",
          "when we where traveling to Djerba, we visited the Crocodile farm, and I was amazed.. such a great place, and such humble people and guides there.. there was a LOT of crocodiles, and they where laying all around in the exhibitions... it was a great day out!",
          "Nice to visit the crocks and see them for real, but all they did was lay there in the sun and not move! Try going at feeding times to fulfill your visit.",
          "Excellent way to spend a few hours. Even better if u manage to go at feeding times. A few shops on the way in/out to buy a few very cheap gifts.",
          "Not a bad trip for 15D plus the 2D for photography about 400 crocs and one tortoise can get around with in half an hour.",
          "A handfull of ponds with lots of crocs and some tortoises. Can go round it in less than half an hour. Only costs 15 TD so not bad as this is also for the museam and village.",
          "This is a late review but we went to Djerba Explore last July 2012. My son (12 year old) really likes crocodiles. We went twice once in the morning and the second time we went at feeding time. We went around the museum (a nice place to cool down from the heat) and outside there",
          "I never saw this big farm, it was nice and funny. I love there the small caf\u00e9 and small shops. I miss the mint tea with bumt almonds...the best!!! :-*",
          "Just a short and cheap taxi ride from the Iberostar hotel where we stayed, vey interesting to walk round both the crocodile area and the museum, there is also an area which has been built to show old Djerba but this seems a little false. Feeding time is about 5 pm but if you go"

        "wiki": "Tunis (Arabic: \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633\u200e T\u016bnis) is the capital and largest city of Tunisia. The greater metropolitan area of Tunis, often referred to as \"Grand Tunis\", has about 2,700,000 inhabitants, making it the third-largest city in the Maghreb region (after Casablanca and Algiers) and the sixteenth-largest in the Arab world. \nSituated on a large Mediterranean Sea gulf (the Gulf of Tunis), behind the Lake of Tunis and the port of La Goulette (\u1e24alq il-W\u0101d), the city extends along the coastal plain and the hills that surround it. At its core lies its ancient medina, a World Heritage Site. East of the medina through the Sea Gate (also known as the Bab el Bhar and the Porte de France) begins the modern city, or Ville Nouvelle, traversed by the grand Avenue Habib Bourguiba (often referred to by popular press and travel guides as \"the Tunisian Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\"), where the colonial-era buildings provide a clear contrast to smaller, older structures. Further east by the sea lie the suburbs of Carthage, La Marsa, and Sidi Bou Said. As the capital city of the country, Tunis is the focus of Tunisian political and administrative life and also the centre of the country's commercial and cultural activities. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nTunis is the transcription of the Arabic name \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633 which can be pronounced as \"T\u016bnus\", \"T\u016bnas\", or \"T\u016bnis\". All three variations were mentioned by the Greek-Syrian geographer al-Rumi Yaqout in his Mu'jam al-B\u00fbldan (Dictionary of Countries).\nDifferent explanations exist for the origin of the name Tunis. Some scholars relate it to the Phoenician goddess Tanith ('Tanit or Tanut), as many ancient cities were named after patron deities. Some scholars claim that it originated from Tynes, which was mentioned by Diodorus Siculus and Polybius in the course of descriptions of a location resembling present-day Al-Kasbah; Tunis's old Berber Bourgade.Another possibility is that it was derived from the Berber verbal root ens which means \"to lie down\" or \"to pass the night\". The term Tunis can possibly mean \"camp at night\", \"camp\", or \"stop\", or may have referred to as \"the last stop before Carthage\" by people who were journeying to Carthage by land. There are also some mentions in ancient Roman sources of such names of nearby towns as Tuniza (now El Kala), Thunusuda (now Sidi-Meskin), Thinissut (now Bir Bouregba), and Thunisa (now Ras Jebel). As all of these Berber villages were situated on Roman roads, they undoubtedly served as rest-stations or stops.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Carthage ===\n\nThe historical study of Carthage is problematic. Because its culture and records were destroyed by the Romans at the end of the Third Punic War, very few Carthaginian primary historical sources survive. While there are a few ancient translations of Punic texts into Greek and Latin, as well as inscriptions on monuments and buildings discovered in Northwest Africa, the main sources are Greek and Roman historians, including Livy, Polybius, Appian, Cornelius Nepos, Silius Italicus, Plutarch, Dio Cassius, and Herodotus. These writers belonged to peoples in competition, and often in conflict, with Carthage. Greek cities contended with Carthage over Sicily, and the Romans fought three wars against Carthage. Not surprisingly, their accounts of Carthage are extremely hostile; while there are a few Greek authors who took a favourable view, these works have been lost.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nTunis was originally a Berber settlement. The existence of the town is attested by sources dating from the 4th century BC. Situated on a hill, Tunis served as an excellent point from which the comings and goings of naval and caravan traffic to and from Carthage could be observed. Tunis was one of the first towns in the region to fall under Carthaginian control, and in the centuries that followed Tunis was mentioned in the military histories associated with Carthage. Thus, during Agathocles' expedition, which landed at Cape Bon in 310 BC, Tunis changed hands on various occasions.During the Mercenary War, it is possible that Tunis served as a center for the native population of the area, and that its population was mainly composed of peasants, fishermen, and craftsmen. Compared to the ancient ruins of Carthage, the ruins of ancient Tunis are not as large. According to Strabo, it was destroyed by the Romans in 146 BC during the Third Punic War. Both Tunis and Carthage were destroyed; Tunis, however, was rebuilt first under the rule of Augustus and became an important town under Roman control and the center of a booming agricultural industry. The city is mentioned in the Tabula Peutingeriana as Thuni. In the system of Roman roads for the Roman province of Africa, Tunis had the title of mutatio (\"way station, resting place\"). Tunis, increasingly Romanized, was also eventually Christianized and became the seat of a bishop. However, Tunis remained modestly sized compared to Carthage during this time.\n\n\n=== Early Islamic period ===\n\nWhen the Arab Muslim troops conquered the region at the end of the 7th century, they established themselves at the outskirts of ancient Tunes, and the small town soon became the city of Tunis that could easily be taken for an Arab foundation. The medina of Tunis, the oldest section of the city, dates from this period, during which the region was conquered by the Umayyad emir Hasan ibn al-Nu'man al-Ghasani. The city had the natural advantage of coastal access, via the Mediterranean, to the major ports of southern Europe. Early on, Tunis played a military role; the Arabs recognized the strategic importance of its proximity to the Strait of Sicily. From the beginning of the 8th century Tunis was the chef-lieu of the area: it became the Arabs' naval base in the western Mediterranean Sea, and took on considerable military importance. Under the Aghlabids, the people of Tunis revolted numerous times, but the city benefited from economic improvements and quickly became the second most important in the kingdom. It was briefly the national capital, from the end of the reign of Ibrahim II in 902, until 909 when control over Ifriqiya was lost to the newly founded Fatimid Caliphate.\nLocal opposition to the authorities began to intensify in September 945, when Kharijite insurgents occupied Tunis, resulting in general pillaging. With the rise of the Zirid dynasty Tunis gained importance, but the Sunni population tolerated Shi'ite rule less and less, and carried out massacres against the Shi'ite community. In 1048 the Zirid ruler Al-Muizz ibn Badis rejected his city's obedience to the Fatimids and re-established Sunni rites throughout all of Ifriqiya. This decision infuriated the Shi'ite caliph Al-Mustansir Billah. To punish the Zirids, he unleashed the Banu Hilal Arab tribe on Ifriqiya; a large part of the country was set to the torch, the Zirid capital Kairouan was razed in 1057, and only a few coastal towns, including Tunis and Mahdia, escaped destruction. Exposed to violence from the hostile tribes that settled around the city, the population of Tunis repudiated the authority of the Zirids and swore allegiance to the Hammadid prince El Nacer ibn Alennas, who was based in B\u00e9ja\u00efa, in 1059. The governor appointed by B\u00e9ja\u00efa, having reestablished order in the country, did not hesitate to free himself from the Hammadids to found the Khurasanid dynasty with Tunis as its capital. This small independent kingdom picked up the threads of trade and commerce with other nations, and brought the region back to peace and prosperity.\n\n\n=== New capital of Tunisia ===\nIn 1159, the Almohad 'Abd al-Mu'min took Tunis, overthrew the last Khurasanid leader and installed a new government in the kasbah of Tunis. The Almohad conquest marked the beginning of the dominance of the city in Tunisia. Having previously played a minor role behind Kairouan and Mahdia, Tunis was promoted to the rank of provincial capital.\nIn 1228, Governor Abu Zakariya seized power and, a year later, took the title of Emir and founded the Hafsid dynasty. The city became the capital of a Hafsid kingdom stretching towards Tripoli and Fez. Walls were built to protect the emerging principal town of the kingdom, surrounding the medina, the kasbah and the new suburbs of Tunis. In 1270 the city was taken briefly by Louis IX of France, who was hoping to convert the Hafsid sovereign to Christianity. King Louis easily captured Carthage, but his army soon fell victim to an outbreak of dysentery. Louis himself died before the walls of the capital and the army was forced out.  At the same time, driven by the reconquest of Spain, the first Andalusian Muslims and Jews arrived in Tunis and would become of importance to the economic prosperity of the Hafsid capital and the development of its intellectual life.During the Almohad and Hafsid periods Tunis was one of the richest and grandest cities in the Islamic world, with a population of about 100,000.\nDuring this period, one of the famous travellers to Tunis was Ibn Battuta. In his travel account, when Ibn Battuta and his group arrived in Tunis, the population of the city came out to meet him and the other the members of his party. They all greeted them and were very curious, many were asking questions, however, no one in Tunis personally greeted Ibn Battuta, greatly upsetting him. He felt very lonely and could not hold back the tears coming from his eyes. This went on for a while until one of the pilgrims realized he was upset, he went up and greeted and talked to Ibn until he entered the city. At the time, the Sultan of Tunis was Abu Yahya and during Ibn Battuta's stay, the Festival of the Breaking of the Fast was taking place. The people in the city assembled in large numbers to celebrate the festival, in extravagant and most luxurious outfits. Abu Yahya arrived on horseback, where all of his relatives joined him. After the performance, the people returned to their homes.\n\n\n=== Spanish occupation and Ottoman control ===\n\nThe Ottoman Empire took nominal control of Tunis in 1534 when Hayreddin Barbarossa captured it from the Hafsid Sultan Mulai Hassan, who fled to the court of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. Charles, suffering losses from the corsairs operating out of Djerba, Tunis, and Algiers, agreed to reinstate Mulai Hassan in exchange for his acceptance of Spanish suzerainty. A naval expedition led by Charles himself was dispatched in 1535, and the city was recaptured. The victory against the corsairs is recorded in a tapestry at the Royal Palace of Madrid. The Spanish governor of La Goulette, Luys Peres Varga,  fortified the island of Chikly in the lake of Tunis to strengthen the city's defences between 1546 and 1550. \n\n \nThe Ottoman Ulu\u00e7 Ali Reis, at the head of an army of janissaries and Kabyles, retook Tunis in 1569. However, following the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the Spanish under John of Austria succeeded in retaking the city and re-establishing the Hafsid sovereign in October 1573. Following these conflicts, the city finally fell into Ottoman hands in August 1574. Having become an Ottoman province governed by a Pasha who was appointed by the Sultan based in Constantinople, the country attained a degree of autonomy. After 1591, the Ottoman governors (Beys) were relatively independent, and both piracy and trade continued to flourish. Under the rule of deys and Moorish beys, the capital sprang into new life. Its population grew by additions from various ethnicities, among which were Moorish refugees from Spain, and economic activities diversified. To traditional industry and trade with distant lands was added the activity of the Barbary pirates, then in their golden age. Profits obtained from the trade in Christian slaves allowed the rulers to build sumptuous structures that revived the architectural heritage of the Middle Ages.\n\nIn April 1655 the English admiral Robert Blake was sent to the Mediterranean to extract compensation from states that had been attacking English shipping. Only the Bey of Tunis refused to comply, with the result that Blake's fifteen ships attacked the Bey's arsenal at Porto Farina (Ghar el Melh), destroying nine Algerian ships and two shore batteries, the first time in naval warfare that shore batteries had been eliminated without landing men ashore.\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Tunisia entered into a new period in its history with the advent of the Husainid dynasty. Successive Husainid rulers made great progress in developing the city and its buildings. During this period, the city prospered as a centre of commerce. Taking advantage of divisions within the ruling house, Algerians captured Tunis in 1756 and put the country under supervision. Hammouda Bey faced bombardment by the Venetian fleet, and the city experienced a rebellion in 1811. Under the reign of Hussein Bey II, naval defeats by the British (1826) and French (1827) saw the French become increasingly active in the city and in the economy.Various sources estimate the 19th-century population to have ranged from 90,000 to 110,000 inhabitants. During the later 19th century, Tunis became increasingly populated by Europeans, particularly the French, and immigration dramatically increased the size of the city. This resulted in the first demolition of the old city walls, from 1860, to accommodate growth in the suburbs. The city spilled outside the area of the earlier town and the banks of the lake, and the new districts were modernised with running water (1860), lighting gas (1872), roads, waste collection (1873), and communication with adjacent suburbs and the city centre. The crafts and traditional trades declined somewhat, as the newcomers increased trade with Europe, introducing the first modern industries and new forms of urban life.\n\n\n=== Development under the French protectorate ===\n\nThe creation of the French protectorate in 1881 was a turning point in Tunis's history, leading to rapid redevelopment of the city in the span of two to three decades. The city quickly spread out of its fortifications: it divided into a traditional Arab-populated old city, and a new city populated by immigrants, with a different structure from that of the traditional medina. Tunis also benefited from French construction of a water supply, natural gas and electricity networks, public transport services and other public infrastructure.\nUnder French rule, a substantial number of Europeans settled (like the Tunisian Italians); half of the population was European in origin. The city expanded and created new boulevards and neighborhoods.\nTunis was quiet during the First World War. After the war, the city faced new transformations as the modern portion grew in importance and extended its network of boulevards and streets in all directions. In addition, a series of satellite cities emerged on the urban rim and encroached on the municipality of Tunis proper. In the economic sphere, commercial activities expanded and diversified as modern industries continued to grow, while traditional industry continued to decline.\nDuring World War II, Tunis was held by Axis forces from November 1942 to May 1943. It was their last base in Africa, as they retreated towards Sicily after being surrounded by Allied forces from Algeria to the west and from Libya to the east. \nOn 7 May 1943, at about 15:30 in the afternoon, Tunis fell to troops of British 1st Army and the U.S. 1st Army, which had defeated the German 5th Panzer Army guarding the city. At midday on 20 May 1943, the Allies held a victory parade on Avenue Mar\u00e9chal Galli\u00e9ni, and Avenue Jules Ferry, to signal the end of fighting in North Africa.Having succeeded in driving the Axis powers out of Tunisia, the Allies used Tunis as a base of operations from which to stage amphibious assaults first against the island of Pantelleria, and then Sicily, and finally the mainland of Italy.\n\n\n=== Growth since independence ===\n\nAfter independence in 1956, Tunis consolidated its role as the capital, first with the establishment of a constitution stating that the Chamber of Deputies and the Presidency of the Republic must have their headquarters in Tunis and its suburbs. In a very short time, the colonial city transformed rapidly. As the city has grown and native Tunisians gradually began to replace the extensive European population, conflict between the Arab city and the European city has gradually decreased with the arabization of the population.\nBecause of population pressure and the rate of migration to the capital, the city continued to grow, even with the creation of new districts in the suburbs. Old buildings have gradually been renovated and upgraded and new buildings have come to influence the urban landscape. At the same time, an active policy of industrialization is developing the municipal economy.\nThe Arab League was headquartered in Tunis from 1979 to 1990. The Arab League, which represents 22 Arab nations, transferred its headquarters to Tunis in 1979 because of Egypt's peace with Israel but has been headquartered back in Egypt since 1990.\nThe Palestine Liberation Organization also had its headquarters in Tunis, from 1982 to 2003.\nIn 1985, the PLO's headquarters was bombed by Israeli Air Force F-15s, killing approximately 60 people.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nMany protests took place during the Arab Spring of 2011\u201312.\nOn 18 March 2015, two gunmen attacked the Bardo National Museum and held hostages. Twenty civilians and one policeman were killed in the attack, while around 50 others were injured. Five Japanese, two Colombians, and visitors from Italy, Poland, and Spain were among the dead. Both gunmen were killed by Tunisian police. The incident has been treated as a terrorist attack.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTunis is located in north-eastern Tunisia on the Lake of Tunis, and is connected to the Mediterranean sea's Gulf of Tunis by a canal which terminates at the port of La Goulette/Halq al Wadi. The ancient city of Carthage is located just north of Tunis along the coastal part. The city lies on a similar latitude as the southernmost points of Europe.\nThe city of Tunis is built on a hill slope down to the lake of Tunis. These hills contain places such as Notre-Dame de Tunis, Ras Tabia, La Rabta, La Kasbah, Montfleury and La Manoubia with altitudes just above 50 metres (160 feet). The city is located at the crossroads of a narrow strip of land between Lake Tunis and S\u00e9joumi. The isthmus between them is what geologists call the \"Tunis dome\", which includes hills of limestone and sediments. It forms a natural bridge and since ancient times several major roads linking to Egypt and elsewhere in Tunisia have branched out from it. The roads also connect with Carthage, emphasising its political and economic importance not only in Tunisia but more widely in North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea in ancient times.\nThe Greater Tunis area has an area of 300,000 hectares, 30,000 of which is urbanized, the rest being shared between bodies of water (20,000 hectares of lakes or lagoons) and agricultural or natural land (250,000 hectares). However, urban growth, which is estimated to be increasing by 500 hectares per year, is gradually changing the landscape with urban sprawl.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Suburbs ===\nAfter World War II, suburbs began to rapidly spring up on the outskirts of Tunis. These form a large percentage of the population of the Tunis metropolitan area. It grew from 27% of the total population in 1956, to 37% in 1975 and 50% in 2006.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTunis has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa), characterized by hot and dry, prolonged summers and mild winters with moderate rainfall. The local climate is also affected somewhat by the latitude of the city, the moderating influence of the Mediterranean sea and the terrain of the hills.\nWinter is the wettest season of the year, when more than a third of the annual rainfall falls during this period, raining on average every two or three days.  The sun may still increase the temperature from 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F) in the morning to 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) in the afternoon on average during the winter. Frosts are rare.  In spring, rainfall declines by half.  The sunshine becomes dominant in May when it reaches 10 hours a day on average.  In March temperatures may vary between 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F) and 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), and between 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) and 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) in May. However, it is common for temperatures to soar even as early as April with record temperatures reaching 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F).  In summer, rain is almost completely absent and the sunlight is at a maximum.  The average temperatures in the summer months of June, July, August, and September are very high. Sea breezes may mitigate the heat, but sometimes the sirocco winds reverse the trend.  In autumn, it begins to rain, often with short thunderstorms, which can sometimes cause flash floods or even flood some parts of the city.  The month of November marks a break in the general heat with average temperatures ranging from 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) to 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Capital ===\n\nTunis has been the capital of Tunisia since 1159. Under Articles 43 and 24 of the Constitution of 1959, Tunis and its suburbs host the national institutions: the Presidential Palace, which is known as Carthage Palace, residence of the President of Tunisia, the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Advisors and parliament, the Constitutional Council and the main judicial institutions  and public bodies. The revised Tunisian Constitution of 2014 similarly provides that the National Assembly is to sit in Tunis (article 51) and that the Presidency is based there (article 73).\n\n\n=== Municipality ===\n\n\n==== Institutions ====\n\nFollowing the municipal elections of 6 May 2018, Ennahdha obtained 21 seats out of 60. Nidaa Tounes came second with 17 seats. On 3 July 2018, the head of the Ennahdha list Souad Abderrahim was elected by the council as the new mayor of the capital.\nBefore 2011, unlike other mayors in Tunisia, the mayor of Tunis is appointed by decree of the President of the Republic from among the members of the City Council.\n\n\n==== Budget ====\nThe 2008 budget adopted by the City Council is structured as follows: 61.61 million dinars for operations and 32,516 million dinars for investment. It reflects the improved financial situation of the municipality, the year 2007 was a year registering a surplus in resources that allowed the settlement of debts of the municipality and the strengthening of its credibility with respect its suppliers and public and private partners.\nRevenues are generated by the proceeds of taxes on buildings and vacant lots, fees for the rental of municipal property, income from the operation of the public, advertising, and that the fact that the municipality has capital shares in some companies. On the expenditure side, provision is made for the consolidation of hygiene and cleanliness, the state of the environment and urban design, infrastructure maintenance, rehabilitation and renovation of facilities, and strengthening the logistics and means of work and transport.\n\n\n==== Administrative divisions ====\n\nThe city of Tunis, whose size has increased significantly during the second half of the 20th century, now extends beyond the Tunis Governorate into parts of the governorates of Ben Arous, Ariana and Manouba.\nThe municipality of Tunis is divided into 15 municipal districts:  These include El Bab Bhar, Bab Souika, Cit\u00e9 El Khadra, Jelloud Jebel El Kabaria, El Menzah, El Ouardia, Ettahrir, Ezzouhour, Hra\u00efria, Medina, El Omrane, El Omrane Higher S\u00e9joumi, Sidi El-Bashir and Sidi Hassine.\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nIn the years following independence, the population of the metropolitan area continued to grow: by 21.1% from 1956 to 1966 and by 28.5% from 1966 to 1975 (55.6% between 1956 and 1975). This steady growth was accompanied by changes which affected the nature of the settlement of the capital. Decolonization led to the exodus of some European minorities whose numbers dwindled every year. The gaps created by their departure were filled by Tunisians who emigrated to Tunis from other parts of the country.\nThe population of the city of Tunis exceeds 2,000,000 inhabitants. After independence, the Tunisian government implemented a plan to cope with population growth of the city and country, a system of family planning, to attempt to lower the rate of population growth. However, between 1994 and 2004, the population of the governorate of Tunis grew more than 1.03% per annum. It represents, in the 2004 census, 9.9% of the total population of Tunisia. As in the rest of Tunisia, literacy in the region of Tunis evolved rapidly during the second half of the 20th century and has reached a level slightly higher than the national average. The education level is only exceeded by the neighbouring governorate of Ariana which has many institutions of education.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nProducts include textiles, carpets, and olive oil. Tourism also provides a significant portion of the city's income.\nBecause of the concentration of political authority (headquarters of the central government, presidency, parliament, ministries and central government) and culture (festivals and mainstream media), Tunis is the only nationally ranking metropolis. Tunis is the heartland of the Tunisian economy and is the industrial and economic hub of the country, home to one third of Tunisian companies\u2014including almost all the head offices of companies with more than fifty employees, with the exception of the Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa, headquartered in Gafsa\u2014and produces a third of the national gross domestic product.  Tunis attracts foreign investors (33% of companies, 26% of investments and 27% of employment), excluding several areas due to economic imbalances. According to the Mercer 2017 Cost of Living Rankings, Tunis has the lowest cost of living for expatriates in the world. The urban unemployment rate of university graduates is increasing and the illiteracy rate remains high among the elderly (27% of women and 12% of men). The number of people living below the poverty line, falling at the national level, remains higher in urban areas. In addition, unemployment is high in young people aged 18 to 24, with one in three unemployed as compared to one in six at the national level. In Greater Tunis, the proportion of young unemployed is at 35%.Gulf finance house or GFH has invested $10 billion in order for the construction of tunis financial harbor, that will transform Tunisia as the gateway to Africa from Europe. The project hopes to boost the economy of Tunisia as well as increase the number of tourists visiting Tunisia annually. The project is going through planning.\n\n\n=== Sectors ===\nThe economic structure of Tunis, as well as that of the country, is overwhelmingly tertiary industry.  The city is the largest financial center in the country hosting the headquarters of 65% of financial companies \u2013 while the industrial sectors are gradually declining in importance.  However the secondary industry is still very represented and Tunis hosts 85% of industrial establishments in the four governorates, with a trend towards the spread of specialized industrial zones in the suburbs.\nPrimary industry such as agriculture, however, is active in specialized agricultural areas on the suburbs, particularly in the wine and olive oil industries. The generally flat terrain and the two main rivers in Tunisia, the Medjerda to the north and the Milian to the south, the soils are fertile.  Tunis has several large plains, the most productive are in Ariana and La Soukra (north), the plain of Manouba (west) and the plain of Mornag (south).  In addition, groundwater is easily accessible through the drilling of deep wells, providing water for the different agriculture crops. The soils are heavy and contain limestone in the north but are lighter and sandy containing clay in the south.  There is much diversification in the municipality of Tunis, with Durum grown in Manouba, Olives and olive oil in Ariana and Mornag, wine (Mornag), and fruit, vegetable and legumes are grown in all regions.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Architecture and landscape ==\n\n\n=== Urban landscape ===\n\nThe Medina, built on a gentle hill slope on the way down to the Lake of Tunis, is the historical heart of the city and home to many monuments, including palaces, such as the Dar Ben Abdallah and Dar Hussein, the mausoleum of Tourbet el Bey or many mosques such as the Al-Zaytuna Mosque. Some of the fortifications around it have now largely disappeared, and it is flanked by the two suburbs of Bab Souika to the north and Bab El Jazira to the south. Located near the Bab Souika, the neighborhood of Halfaouine which gained international attention through the film 'Halfaouine Child of the Terraces'.\nBut east of the original nucleus, first with the construction of the French Consulate, the modern city was built gradually with the introduction of the French protectorate at the end of the 19th century, on open land between the city and the lake. The axis to the structure of this part of the city is the Avenue Habib Bourguiba, designed by the French to be a Tunisian form of Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris with its cafes, major hotels, shops and cultural venues. On both sides of the tree lines avenue, north and south, the city was extended in various districts, with the northern end welcoming residential and business districts while the south receives industrial districts and poorer peoples.\nSouth-east of the Avenue Bourguiba the district of La Petite Sicile (Little Sicily) is adjacent to the old port area and takes its name from its original population of workers from Italy. It is now the subject of a redevelopment project including the construction of twin towers. North of the Avenue Bourguiba is the district of La Fayette, which is still home to the Great Synagogue of Tunis and the Habib Thameur Gardens, built on the site of an ancient Jewish cemetery which lay outside the walls. Also to the north is the long Avenue Mohamed V, which leads to the Boulevard of 7 November through the neighborhood of the big banks where there are hotels and Abu Nawas Lake and finally to the Belvedere area around the place Pasteur. This is where the Belvedere Park lies, the largest in the city, and home to a zoo and the Pasteur Institute founded by Adrien Loir in 1893. Continuing to the north are the most exclusive neighborhoods of Mutuelleville which house the French Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-Mend\u00e8s-France, the Sheraton Hotel and some embassies.\nStill further north of the Belvedere Park, behind the Boulevard of 7 November are the neighborhoods of El Menzah and El Manar now reaching the peaks of the hills overlooking the north of the town. They support a range of residential and commercial buildings. To the west of the park lies the district of El Omrane which holds the main Muslim cemetery in the capital and the warehouses of public transport.  Heading east is the Tunis-Carthage International Airport and the neighborhoods of Borgel, giving his name to the existing Jewish and Christian cemeteries in the capital, and the neighbourhood of Montplaisir. Beyond that, several kilometers north-east, on the road to La Marsa,  the Berges du Lac was built on land reclaimed from the north shore of the lake near the airport, which has holds offices of Tunisian and foreign companies, many embassies as well as shops.\nSouthwest of the Medina, on the crest of the hills across the Isthmus of Tunis, is the Montfleury district then on down to the foothills of S\u00e9joumi, the poor neighborhood of Mellassine. Northwest of the latter, north of the National Route 3 leading to the west, is the city of Ezzouhour (formerly El Kharrouba), which spans more than three metres (9.8 feet) and is divided into five sections. It is still surrounded with farmland and vegetables are grown which supply many of the souks in the region.\nThe south of Tunis is made up of disadvantaged neighborhoods, especially due to the strong industry in this part of the metropolis. These include Jebel Jelloud, located in the south-east of Tunis, which concentrates on the heavy industry of cement production, the treatment plant of phosphate s, etc. The main cemetery in Tunis, the Djellaz Cemetery, dominates this part of town, perched on the slopes of a rocky outcrop.\n\n\n=== M\u00e9dina ===\n\nThe medina of Tunis has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979. The Medina contains some 700 monuments, including palaces, mosques, mausoleums, madrasas and fountains dating from the Almohad and the Hafsid periods. These ancient buildings include:\n\nThe Aghlabid Al-Zaytouna Mosque (\"Mosque of the Olive\") built in 723 by Ubayd Allah ibn al-Habhab to celebrate the new capital.\nThe Dar El Bey, or Bey's Palace, comprises architecture and decoration from many different styles and periods and is believed to stand on the remains of a Roman theatre as well as the 10th-century palace of Ziadib-Allah II al Aghlab.With an area of 270 hectares (over 29 hectares for the Kasbah)  and more than 100,000 people, the Medina comprises one-tenth of the population of Tunis. The planning of the Medina of Tunis has the distinction of not grid lines or formal geometric compositions. However, studies were undertaken in the 1930s with the arrival of the first anthropologists who found that the space of the Medina is not random: the houses are based on a socio-cultural code according to the types of complex human relations.\nDomestic architecture (palaces and townhouses), official and civilian (libraries and administrations), religious (mosques and zaou\u00efas) and services (commercial and fondouks) are located in the Medina. The notion of public space is ambiguous in the case of Medina where the streets are seen as an extension of the houses and subject to social tags. The concept of ownership is low however and souks often spill out onto public roads. Today, each district has its culture and rivalries can be strong.\nThe northern end supports the football club of Esperance Sportive de Tunis while at the other end is the rival Club Africain. The Medina also has a social sectorization: with the neighborhood of Tourbet el Bey and the Kasbah district being aristocratic, with a population of judges and politicians, while the streets of Pacha often being military and bourgeois.\nFounded in 698 is the Al-Zaytuna Mosque and the surrounding area which developed throughout the Middle Ages,  dividing Tunis into a main town in two suburbs, in the north (Bab Souika) and the south (Bab El Jazira). The area became the capital of a powerful kingdom during the Hafsid era, and was considered a religious and intellectual home and economic center for the Middle East, Africa and Europe. A great fusion of influences can be seen blending Andalusian styles with eastern influences, and Roman or Byzantine columns, and typical Arab architecture, characterized by the archways.\nThe architectural heritage is also omnipresent in the homes of individuals and small palace officials as well as in the palace of the sovereign of Kasbah. Although some palaces and houses date back to the Middle Ages, a greater number of prestigious houses were built in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries such as Dar Othman (early 17th century), Dar Ben Abdallah (18th century), Dar Hussein, Dar Cherif and other houses. The main palace beys are those of La Marsa, Bardo and Ksar Said. If we add the mosques and oratories (about 200), the madrasahs (El Bachia, Slimania, El Achouria, Bir El Ahjar, Ennakhla, etc..), The zaouias (Mahrez Sidi Sidi Ali Azouz, Sidi Abdel Kader, etc.) and Tourbet El Fellari, Tourbet Aziza Othman and Tourbet El Bey the number of monuments in Tunis approaches 600. Unlike Algiers, Palermo and Naples, its historical heart has never suffered from major natural disasters or urban radical interventions. The main conflicts and potentially destructive human behavior has been experienced in the city occurred relatively recently following the country's independence which it why it made into a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. At the beginning of the 21st century, the Medina is one of the best preserved urban locations in the Arab world.Furthermore, along the boulevards, the contribution of the architectural period 1850\u20131950 can be felt in the buildings, such as the government buildings of the nine ministries and the headquarters of the municipality of Tunis.\n\n\n=== Other landmarks ===\nThe Bardo Museum was originally a 13th-century Hafsid palace, located in the (then) suburbs of Tunis. It contains a major collection of Roman empires and other antiquities of interest from Ancient Greece, Tunisia, and from the Arab period.\nThe ruins of Carthage are nearby, along the coast to the northeast, with many ancient ruins.\n\n\n==== Souks ====\n\nThe souks are a network of covered streets lined with shops and traders and artisans ordered by specialty.  Clothing merchants, perfumers, fruit sellers, booksellers and wool merchants have goods at the souks, while fishmongers, blacksmiths and potters tend to be relegated to the periphery of the markets.\n\nNorth of the Al-Zaytuna Mosque is the Souk El Attarine, built in the early 18th century. It is known for its essences and perfumes. From this souk, there is a street leading to the Souk Ech-Chaouachine (chachia). The main company that operates it is one of the oldest in the country and they are generally descendants of Andalusian immigrants expelled from Spain. Attached to El Attarine are two other souks: the first, which runs along the western coast of the Al-Zaytuna Mosque, is the Souk El Kmach which is noted for its fabrics, and the second, the Souk El Berka, which was built in the 17th century and houses embroiderers and jewelers. Given the valuable items it sells, it is the only souk whose doors are closed and guarded during the night. In the middle there is a square where the former slave market stood until the middle of the 19th century.\nSouk El Berka leads to Souk El Leffa, a souk that sells all kinds of carpets, blankets and other weavings, and extends with the Souk Es Sarragine, built in the early 18th century and specializing in leather. At the periphery are the souks Et Trouk, El Blat, El Blaghgia, El K\u00e9babgia, En Nhas (copper), Es Sabbaghine (dyeing) and El Grana that sell clothing and blankets and was occupied by Jewish merchants.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Walls and gates ====\n\nFrom the early days of its founding, Tunis has been considered an important military base. The Arab geographer El Yacoubi has written that in the 9th century Tunis was surrounded by a wall of brick and clay except the side of the sea where it was stone.  Bab El-Jazeera, perhaps the oldest gate of the south wall, opened onto the southern road. Bab Cartagena gave access to Carthage, important for bringing in construction materials needed for the city. Bab Souika (initially known as Bab El Saqqayin) had a strategic role to keep the roads to Bizerte, B\u00e9ja and Le Kef. Bab Menara (initially known as Bab El Artha) opened onto the medina and on the suburb of El Haoua. As for El Bab Bhar, it allowed access to some funduqs where Christian merchants lived in Tunis.\nWith the development of the capital under the reign of the Hafsids, two emerging suburbs grew outside the walls; Bab El Jazira in the south and Bab Souika to the north. In the early 14th century, Hafsid Darba Ab\u00fb al-Muhammad al-Mustansir Lihy\u00e2n\u00ee ordered the construction of a second chamber including the Medina and two suburbs outside. Six new gates were built including Bab El Khadra, Bab Saadoun, Bab El Allouj (initially called Bab Er-Rehiba), Khalid or Bab Bab Sidi Abdallah Cherif, Bab El Fellah and Bab Alioua. In the Ottoman period, four new gates were established: Bab Laassal, Bab Sidi Abdesselam, Bab El Bab Gorjani and Sidi Kacem. The city retains some of these gates including Bab El Khadra, Bab El Bhar and Bab Jedid but some of the earlier ones have long disappeared.\n\n\n=== Places of worship ===\n\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslim mosques.   There are also Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tunis (Catholic Church), Protestant churches, Evangelical Churches.As in the rest of Tunisia, a very large majority of the population of Tunis (around 99%) is Sunni Muslim.  The capital is home to a large number of mosques in various architectural styles, signs of construction of their respective eras.  The main and oldest of them, is the Al-Zaytuna Mosque, founded in 698 and built in 732 and is in the heart of the Medina. Practicing the Maliki rite as the vast majority of Tunisia's Mosques. It was completely rebuilt in 864 and is a prestigious place of worship, and was long an important place of culture and knowledge with the University of Ez-Zitouna on the premises until the independence of Tunisia.  It still hosts the main ceremonies marking the dates on the Muslim calendar and is regularly attended by the president.\nThe medina contains most of the major mosques in the capital which were built before the advent of the French protectorate.  The mosque in the Kasbah, was founded in 1230.  Practicing the Hanafi rite since 1584, it is recognisable mainly by the dome as well as its minaret, similar to the Koutoubia in Marrakesh and is the highest in the city. Ksar Mosque, also of the Hanafi rite, is located in front of Dar Hussein (Bab Menara) and was built in the 12th century.  The Hammouda Pasha Mosque, built in 1655, is the second mosque built by the Hanafi rite in Tunis. Youssef Dey Mosque operated primarily as public speaking venue before becoming a real mosque in 1631. The Sidi Mahrez Mosque is the largest mosque Hanafi mosque in terms of area but not the tallest.  Built in 1692, it resembles the Ottoman S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul.  The Saheb Ettaba\u00e2 Mosque, built between 1808 and 1814 was the last mosque built by the Tunis Husseinites before the French occupation.The presence of modern churches in Tunis are also testimony to the French presence for half a century.  Tunis is the seat of the Diocese of Tunis, with the seat located at the Cathedral of St Vincent de Paul, The church was built in 1897 on the site of the old Christian cemetery of Saint-Antoine.  This includes a network of Catholic buildings, including the Church of St. Joan of Arc, but also with the Protestant Reformed Church and the Anglican church Saint-Georges.Greeks used to enjoy an important presence in the city since ancient times. Tunis is the headquarters of the Greek Orthodox Holy Archdiocese of Carthage with jurisdiction over Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia. It belongs to the Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa, and its cathedral, small school and other buildings are in Central Tunis.\nIn total, there are three Greek Orthodox and two Russian Orthodox parishes in Tunisia. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria also maintains jurisdiction in Tunisia.\nThe small Orthodox community is centred around the Greek Orthodox Church (1862), managed by the Greek Embassy and the Russian Orthodox Church (1957), reflecting the presence in Tunisia of a small colony of Russian immigrants.Judaism, meanwhile, enjoys a long tradition of presence in the city despite the emigration of a large part of the community after independence.  Among the places of worship are Beit Yaacouv Synagogue and especially the Great Synagogue of Tunis, built at the end of the 1940s to replace the former Great Synagogue which was demolished as part of the Jewish redevelopment area, the Hara.\n\n\n=== Parks and greenery ===\n\nTunis has some large parks, many of which were installed at the end of the 19th century by the authorities of the French protectorate. The largest Park, Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re Park, was founded in 1892 overlooks Lake Tunis. It is the oldest public park in the country and is built in the landscape style common to France.  The park covers an area of more than one hundred hectares across roads that can be explored on foot or by car. It is also home to Tunis Zoo, which houses African fauna, and the Museum of Modern Art.\nHabib Thameur garden in Tunis has a central pond and flower beds. The Gorjani garden, is an English garden located southwest of the city, which notably takes an irregular form, partly due to the steep topography of the land.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nLocated in an old beylical palace (the palace of the Bey of Tunis since the end of the 18th century), the Bardo National Museum (Tunis) is the most important archaeological museum in the Maghreb, and has one of the richest Roman mosaic collections in the world.  Its collections developed rapidly, thanks to numerous archaeological discoveries in the surrounding territory.\nIn 1964 the Dar Ben Abdallah, a palace probably dating back to the 18th century, became the seat of the capital's Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions.  In its exposition halls it holds numerous traditional items, witnesses of the everyday lives of families of the Medina quarter.\nThe Museum of the National Movement is situated in Dar Ma\u00e2kal Az-Za\u00efm, which was the residence of nationalist Habib Bourguiba for the entirety of the fight for independence.  After the advent of independence, a museum was built there to relate the details of the national struggle between 1938 and 1952.\nThe National Military Museum, opened in 1989 in the suburbs west of the city, holds a collection of 23,000 weapons, 13,000 of which date back to the 19th century, and some of which were used by the Tunisian troops during the Crimean War.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nTunis holds some of the most prestigious musical institutions in the country. The Rachidia was founded in 1934 to safeguard Arab music, and in particular to promote Tunisian and malouf music.  The group is made up of 22 members, both instrumental players and choral musicians.The Musical Troupe of the City of Tunis was created in 1954 by Salah El Mahdi. In 1955 he placed his student Mohamed Sa\u00e2da in charge of the ensemble, which at that time included the best artists, and later merged with the ensemble of Radio Tunis.  This group contributed to the rise to stardom of numerous Tunisian singers, including Oulaya.\nThe Association of Arab Orchestra of the City of Tunis began its activities at the end of April 1982, as a workshop linked to the cultural center of the city.  It worked on promoting Arab music, on music education and training, and on cooperation with various partners both in Tunisia and abroad.  The Tunisian Symphony Orchestra, created in 1969 by the Minister of Culture, has also produced monthly concerts at the Municipal Theater and in various cultural spaces in the city.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nTunis is a center of Tunisian culture. The Th\u00e9\u00e2tre municipal de Tunis, opened on 20 November 1902, showcases opera, ballet, symphonic concerts, drama, etc. On the stage of this theater, many performances are regularly given by Tunisian, Arabic and international actors. The National Theatre of Tunisia is an important public enterprise in Tunis, and since 1988 been located in the Khaznadar palace (dating from the middle of the 19th century and situated in the Halfaouine quarter), renamed \"Theater Palace.\" In 1993, it also took possession of the former movie theater Le Paris, with a 350-person seating capacity.  During each \"cultural season\" (from October 1 to 30 June) the theater holds over 80 events.  The Al Hamra theater was the second theater to be opened in Tunis, situated on El Jazira Road.  Al Hamra was one of the most famous theaters in the capital during the 1930s and 1940s.  After being closed for fifteen years, it was turned into a small theater in 1986, and since 2001 has housed the first Arab-African center for theater training and research.  One should also note the El Teatro and \u00c9toile du Nord theater groups.\nOther arts are also represented in the capital. The National Center of the Arts established the puppet theatre in 1976.  The National School of Circus Arts was founded following a meeting between the Director of the National Theater and the Director General of the National Center for Arts of Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne (France) in 1998. In addition, various small theatres and cultural centres are scattered throughout the city and display various artistic performances.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nFilm producers and cinema have long been present in the city of Tunis. The first animated film was shown in Tunis by the Lumiere brothers as early as 1896. The first screenings were held the following year and the first cinema, the Omnia Path\u00e9, opened in October 1908. The first film club opened in Tunis in 1946 and the Globe, in 1965. The Carthage Film Festival is the oldest established film festival in Africa, running biennially until 2014 and annually thereafter.\nIn 1990, Ferid Boughedir shot the notable film Halfaouine Child of the Terraces in Halfaouine district. The films The English Patient (1996) and The Last Days of Pompeii (2003) were also shot in studios in Tunis.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nThe city holds several festivals each year, of which the largest is the International Festival of Carthage which takes place in July and August. Founded in 1964, much of the festival is held in an old amphitheater of Carthage (with a capacity of 7,500 seats), and hosts the performances of singers, musicians, actors, dancers and films on display on outdoor screens.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nTunis and its suburbs have many of the major Tunisian universities including the University of Tunis, Tunisia Private University, University of Ez-Zitouna, the University of Tunis \u2013 El Manar, the University of Carthage and the Manouba University. It therefore has the highest concentration of students in Tunisia, with a student population of 75,597 as of 2006.\n\nThere are also a number of other post-secondary institutions, such as the National School of Engineers of Tunis, the National School of Science, the Graduate School of Communications of Tunis, and the Higher Institute of Technological Studies in Communications of Tunis. In addition, private training institutes include the Open University of Tunis, the Central University Private Business Administration and Technology, the Graduate School of Private Engineering and Technology, and the North African Institute of Economics and Technology.\nAmong the high schools in the capital, the best-known are the Lyc\u00e9e de la Rue du Pacha (founded 1900), Lyc\u00e9e Bab El Khadhra, Lyc\u00e9e de la Rue de Russie, Lyc\u00e9e Bourguiba (formerly Lyc\u00e9e Carnot de Tunis), and the Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui. Until independence, Sadiki College (founded 1875) and Khaldounia (founded 1896) were also among the most recognized. A legacy of the French presence in the country remains, and the city retains many French schools, the most important being the Lyc\u00e9e Pierre Mendes-France at Mutuelleville.\nStudents can pursue language studies at small private schools such as Sidi Bou Said Centre for Languages (Centre Sidi Bou Said de Langues et d'Informatique) in the picturesque Tunis suburb of Sidi Bou Said, next to the Sidi Bou Said TGM station that specializes in Arabic, offering classes in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), classical Arabic, Tunisian Arabic and the various dialects of North Africa, the Gulf and the Levant.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nTunis has some of the most important libraries in Tunisia including the National Library of Tunisia which was first installed in 1924 in the Medina, in a building built in 1810 by Hammouda Bey to serve as barracks for troops and then a jail.  The library moved to its current location on Boulevard 9 April in 1938. The new building contains a reading room, conference room, laboratories, an exhibition gallery, a block of technical and administrative services, a restaurant, a parking and green space areas.\nHoused in a former home of a Hafsid scholar, the library of the Khaldounia was founded in 1896 along with the creation of the educational institution. After independence and following the consolidation of programs of education, the association ceased operations but the library is now linked to the National Library, which provides for its management.Built in the 17th century, the Dar Ben Achour also contains a library. Acquired in the late 1970s by the municipality of Tunis, the house was restored in 1983 into a library.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nTunis is served by the Tunis-Carthage International Airport. The growing metropolitan area is served by an extensive network of public transportation including buses, an above-ground light rail system (le Metro), as well a regional train line (the TGM) that links the city centre to its closest northern suburbs. Multi-lane autoroutes surround the city and serve the increasing number of privately owned cars one encounters in Tunisia.\nThe Tunis area is served by the m\u00e9tro l\u00e9ger (Ar.: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0631\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0641\u064a\u0641 \u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633) and TGM (Tunis-Goulette-Marsa), as well as bus services, and is linked to other places in Tunisia by SNCFT, the national railways. The important transport authorities are the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Transports de Tunis (STT) and the Ministry of Transport (Airports)\n\nThe A1 motorway connects Tunis with Sfax to the south, and the A3 with Oued Zarga and B\u00e9ja to the west, while the A4 is the link with Bizerte.\nThe city has, as of the beginning of the 21st century, a public transportation system developed under the management of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des transports de Tunis (STT). In addition to some 200 bus routes, the first light rail line opened in 1985. The M\u00e9tro l\u00e9ger de Tunis network has extended gradually since then to reach the suburbs. The capital is also linked to its northern suburbs by the railway line that crosses the lake, dividing the lake into two.\nA new mass transit was planned for Greater Tunis in 2009. This was the RTS (rapid rail network), the local equivalent of the Paris RER, which was to carry tens of thousands of travellers from the distant suburbs of Tunis to the centre by using either existing tracks or new tracks yet to be built. The plan was for lines based on certain criteria such as population density and the lack of coverage for a given area. Among the priority lines were: Tunis-Borj C\u00e9dria (23 km) where modernization and electrification are already planned; Tunis-Mohamedia-Fouchana (19.4 km); Tunis-Manouba-Mnihla (19.2 km); Tunis-Ezzouhour-Sidi Hassine S\u00e9joumi (13.9 km). In addition, the TGM will be integrated into the light-rail network and a new line built around Ayn Zaghouan and Bhar Lazrag (8.4 km). Such an operation would require the upgrading of the docks' TGM stations so that they become suitable for light rail trains. Among other projects are a line to the city of Ennasr (8.4 km) and the extension of the Tunis-Ettadhamen to Mnihla (1.7 km). For its part, the south light-rail line was extended in November 2008 to El Mourouj with a length of 6.8 kilometres (4.2 miles). The total length of the network will eventually be in the range of 84 km (52 mi).\n\n\n=== Infrastructure ===\n\nTunis is served by Tunis-Carthage International Airport, located 8 kilometers (5.0 mi) northeast of downtown, which began operating in 1940 under the name of Tunis El Aouina.  The terminal had 4.4 million passengers (35.98% of total airport traffic in the country) in 2006.  In 2007 that increased to 6 million passengers with a rise in tourism to the city.\nAfter independence, in the 1960s, the National Board of Seaports, which supports all ports in the country, modernized the infrastructure of the port of Tunis.  In the 21st Century, the port of Tunis underwent further transformation with a marina as part of the redevelopment district of La Petite Sicile.\nTunis is the starting point from which the main roads and all highways that serve different parts of the country of Tunis originate.  This city has a high density of traffic because vehicle ownership is rising at 7.5% per year.  The capital is home to approximately 40% of the cars in Tunisia, with 700,000 cars on average used in the city per day.  In this context, major road infrastructure (bridges, interchanges, roads, etc..) was initiated in the late 1990s to decongest the main areas of the capital.  The main roads to other Tunisian cities include: Autoroute A1, Tunis-Sfax; Autoroute A3, Tunis-Oued Zarga; and Autoroute A4, Tunis-Bizerte. Also, as part of the major infrastructure project, the city's traffic lights were increased from 5,000 to 7,500.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, a number of sports institutions were established in Tunis, particularly in school and college settings. In 1905 the Muslim Association of Tunisia brought together students from Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui and Sadiki College to organize gymnastics. A regional gymnastics competition was held in Tunis in 1912 with the participation of thousands of French gymnasts. Football made its appearance in the capital on 15 September 1904, followed by the formal creation of the country's first league, the Racing Club Tunis, on 11 May 1905. It took some time to run properly but soon organized meetings between the teams in schools. The first took place on 9 June 1907, between teams from Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui and Lyc\u00e9e Carnot (1\u20131).\nBut football is not the only discipline to emerge. Between 1928 and 1955 the city hosted nine rounds of the Grand Prix of Tunis, where notable drivers such as Marcel Lehoux, Achille Varzi, Tazio Nuvolari and Rudolf Caracciola took part. The Grand Prix of Tunis has re-emerged since 2000. The city has also held the Mediterranean Games twice, in 1967 and 2001, and the international tennis tournament, the Tunis Open, which is included in the ATP Challenger Series. The 2005 World Championship final for men in team handball was played in Tunis.\nIn total the governorate of Tunis registered 24,095 licences for various clubs in the municipal area in 2007. The city further put itself onto the international basketball map as it hosted the FIBA Africa Championship 1965 and the FIBA Africa Championship 1987.\n\nThe Esperance Sportive de Tunis (EST), Club Africain (CA), and Stade Tunisien are the major sports clubs in the city. A symbolic class difference is present between the EST's and the CA's supporters, despite their playing at the same stadium. The EST is supported by the majority of the masses, while the CA, a poorer club, is supported by the others.\nThe first true sports facilities were managed under the French protectorate, as illustrated by the development of the Ksar Said racecourse and construction of the Stade Chedli Zouiten in the neighborhood of Belvedere, which had long been the main stadium in the capital before being supplanted by the Olympic stadium, Stade El Menzah, where EST and CA play their football today. The Olympic stadium and village area was built to accommodate the Mediterranean Games in 1967. A 60,000-seat stadium was also built in Rad\u00e8s for the Mediterranean Games in 2001 at an estimated cost of 170 million dinars, with nearly half of the loans financed by South Korean businessmen. The Olympic village was financed by an investment estimated at 50 million dinars.  In 2008, the government announced the start of construction of a large sports complex that will include several sports academies, a 20,000-seat stadium, and a swimming centre. Known as Tunis Sports City, it will expand around the lake of Tunis, on the road to La Marsa.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nTunis is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Other cooperations ===\n\n\n== Notable inhabitants ==\n\nIbn Khaldun (1332\u20131406), Arab sociologist and scholar\nTahar Haddad (1899\u20131935), promoter of women's emancipation in Tunisia\nAlbert Memmi (1920-2020), French writer and sociologist\nSalah El Mahdi (1925\u20132014), musicologist and composer\nAlberto Pellegrino (1930\u20131996), Italian fencer\nPhillip King (born 1934), British sculptor\nFouad Mebazaa (born 1933), politician, President of Tunisia in 2011\nNicola Pietrangeli (born 1933), Italian tennis player\nPierre Darmon (born 1934), French tennis player\nGeorges Wolinski (1934\u20132015), French illustrator and caricaturist\nRoberto Blanco (born 1937), German pop singer and actor\nYazid Zerhouni (born 1937), Algerian politician\nClaudia Cardinale (born 1938), Italian actress\nFatma Moalla (born 1939), mathematician\nMustapha Ben Jafar (born 1940), Tunisian politician\nAlain Boublil (born 1941), French musical author\nAbdelwahab Meddeb (1946\u20132014), Tunisian-French writer and radio staff\nSerge Adda (1948\u20132004), president of the French TV channel TV5\nSophie Bessis, (born 1947), Franco-Tunisian historian, journalist and researcher\nTarak Ben Ammar (born 1949), film producer\nBertrand Delano\u00eb (born 1950), mayor of Paris\nKarine Chemla (born 1958), historian of mathematics and sinologist\nAbdellatif Kechiche (born 1960), French film director, screenwriter and actor\nChokri El Ouaer (born 1966), Tunisian football goalkeeper\nAmel Karboul (born 1973), Tunisian entrepreneur, business consultant and politician\nMarc Gicquel (born 1977), French tennis player\nKhaled Mouelhi (born 1981), Tunisian footballer\nKarim Saidi (born 1983), Tunisian footballer\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBarbary pirates\nTunisian Community Center\nTunisian Italians\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nJellal Abdelkafi, La m\u00e9dina de Tunis, \u00e9d.

        "wiki": "The Amphitheatre of El Jem is an oval amphitheatre in the modern-day city of El Djem, Tunisia, formerly Thysdrus in the Roman province of Africa. It is listed by UNESCO since 1979 as a World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe amphitheatre was built around 238 AD in Thysdrus, located in the Roman province of Africa Proconsularis in present-day El Djem, Tunisia. It is one of the best preserved Roman stone ruins in the world, and is unique in Africa. As other amphitheatres in the Roman Empire, it was built for spectator events, and it is one of the biggest amphitheatres in the world. The estimated capacity is 35,000, and the sizes of the big and the small axes are respectively 148 metres (486 ft) and 122 metres (400 ft). The amphitheatre is built of stone blocks, located on a flat ground, and is exceptionally well conserved.The amphitheatre of El Jem is the third amphitheatre built on the same place. The belief is that it was constructed by the local proconsul Gordian, who became the emperor as Gordian III. In the Middle Ages, it served as a fortress, and the population sought shelter here during the attacks of Vandals in 430 and Arabs in 647. In 1695, during the Revolutions of Tunis, Mohamed Bey El Mouradi made an opening in one of the walls to stop the resistance of the followers of his brother Ali Bey al-Muradi who gathered inside the amphitheater.It is believed that the amphiteatre was used as a saltpetre manufacture in the end of the 18th and in the 19th century. Around 1850, the breach in the wall was enlarged by Ahmad I ibn Mustafa to approximately 30 metres (98 ft). In the second half of the 19th century, the structure was used for shops, dwellings, and grain storage.\n\n\n== References in popular culture ==\nIt was featured in films such as Monty Python's Life of Brian and the television series Long Way Down.\nAmerican sportswear company Nike used this location in 1996 to shoot a television commercial titled \"Good vs Evil\", which depicts a gladiatorial-style soccer game set in a Roman amphitheatre. Football players from around the world, including Eric Cantona, Ronaldo, Paolo Maldini, Lu\u00eds Figo, Patrick Kluivert and Jorge Campos defend \"the beautiful game\" against a team of unsportsmanlike demonic warriors, which ends with Cantona receiving the ball from Ronaldo, pulling up his shirt collar as was his trademark, and delivering the final line, \"Au Revoir\", before striking the ball which punches right through the demon goalkeeper.The fourth episode of The Amazing Race 1 concluded at the amphitheatre.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Roman amphitheatres\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

          "As it seems to have been completely renovated with modern concrete, and you can't enter the underground spaces (such as for example in Merida, Spain), it's only worth a ten minute look-see.",
          "It is a great place to visit. Do not plan on spending much time there (45 minutes at most), but the time you do spend will be worth it. I recommend reading the story of Perpetua and Felicitas while standing in the ruins. They were two Christian martyrs with an inspirational",
          "The only well-preserved objective in the archaeological site of Carthage. Performances are still taking place here nowadays. Free access, at least I wasn\u2019t ask by anyone to buy a ticket, although there were a number of locals who were walking there with various chores. You",
          "Repeated this visit here as only went last year. This is a small entertainment theatre (was then and is now!) and visitors still sit more or less where others would have sat a couple of thousand years ago which in itself is amazing",
          "Entrance is included as part of the 12tnd ticket for all 8 of the main sites. Not a lot to see here, just an amphitheatre. Ok for a quick five minutes on the way to the Roman villas.",
          "This is a great Roman amphitheatre in Carthage and one can imagine e how it must have looked when it was used at the height of the Roman Empire Saying this though it could be so much better and has been commercialised for modern concerts which I believe spoils it considerably",
          "Definitely not the no. 1 attraction in Carthage, but the entrance is included in the 10-dinar Carthage UNESCO ticket and it is worth to see it, even though it is now more modern than ancient. From the top row very nice views can be had. Good place to sit in the sun on colder",
          "The theatre is still used for performances so clearly has been renovated and there doesn\u2019t seem to be much of the original structure remaining. I have seen much bigger and better elsewhere.",

          "It was smaller than I expected, but looked like it could hold 500 to 1000 people seated. There was some sort of performance stage set up with lighting and scaffolding while I was there, and the gates were wide open, so I have no idea if this was free entry or not. I just walked",
          "Unfortunately none of the seating remains but you can see the arena and some of the cells where slaves and animals were kept.",
          "Rather small than the one in El Djem. I think it's the second worth site to visit after the Carthigian Ruins. We spent a mere half an hour to take photos.",
          "Do not waste your time on the Roman Amphitheater. Is not Roman anymore. Is Tunisian, all rebuilt in modern concrete, used for shows and it is in a deplorable state. Above all, it is the farthest up, you have to walk a long way up on the hill to it and back to the trains stop. I",
          "This may be one of the largest theatres of the ancient world but it has been so modernized and converted into a concert venue that it has lost all the charm of antiquity. Fortunately we went here first before the Byrsa Hill, Carthage Museum and Antonine Baths, all included in",
          "This is worth a look although El Gem is far better. I saw it at night in a concert in the summer and that was so atmospheric but when we went in the day it was so solitary and looked totally different. There is free parking and toilets.",
          "This visit is for sure not so magnificent as other Roman or Byzantine theaters, but it is still worth visiting to get a sense of the ancient Roman culture. Entrance price covered by ticket to museum, villas etc. Climb up to the top and have someone stand in the middle of the",
          "I was equallly impresssed with cathedrale as I was with surrounding that was built over 800 years BC and is one of the oldest inhabited areas in the region. It is definetelly wort seing. View from the top of the hill is amazing.",

          "There are many historic sites within the Carthage (pronounced Cart-arge) precinct, and there is a recommended walking route, but I had limited time so used a driver to see as many as I could. I'm lead to believe that the Roman theatre is a place all Arabian singers want to",
          "It's worth going here if you are in the area. As it is used for concerts and festivals it's well-restored and has a slightly modern feel, but is still impressive. It's also included in the ticket that lets you visit all main attractions in Carthage.",
          "The arena took in > 3,000 spectators. Gladiators (special training) fought against wild animals. Guards watch over major tourist attractions. It's tucked away in a Grove of trees, and a pullover off a major street. You don't need to enter the arena to appreciate it. Peek",

          "I was surprised to see that the place was not well kept. During my visit, everything reminded me of the festival held in this place as it seems to be the only focus and interest. Moreover the place closes by five pm and we could easily get in by tipping the guard. Weird",
          "I think the coolest thing about the Roman Theater is that it's STILL BEING USED TODAY for concerts--each summer there's a festival that brings big acts from all over the world. Recently, Akon and Lauryn Hill performed there! The actual theater itself isn't REMARKABLE, but it's",
          "A must see for anyone interested in roman ruins. It's in very good condition and definitely worth a visit . It will surprise you how well the sound travels from the stage to the nose bleeds",

          "Beautiful amphi theatre in impeccable condition. there is construction works going on, but the place is in great condition, looking very serene. It is close to Marsa and Gammarth and sidi Bou said to get to.",
          "The Carthage Site were just about dilapidated structures from ancient times. Located within 10 miles of Tunis, they are convenient to see if in Tunis/Tunisia for a day or two. The sites have guides that come up to you then explain what the site is about. Beware these touts will",
          "It was built in the early second century , leaning on the slope of the hill.There are able to seat about 5000 spectators. The view from the top is beautiful. Don't miss it to reach to the top. The site have been viewed for musical entertainment nowadays. The opening hours is",
          "called here while visiting Tunis, had an amazing time visiting the whole of the museum, area it was a great day out, something we shared with around 9 of our friends and family. I would definitely go again.",
          "Had a personal guide and his name was Fadi arranged by The Residence Tunis - and recommend him. Learnt so much - too me to see this and the Roman Baths in Carthage - a great half day tour. So interesting.",
          "You'll need a map or you better have some knowledge of Arabic or French, because otherwise it is quite complicated to find the place. The roman theatre is not well preserved, you'll find plenty of vegetation around the terraces and, as it is still in use, some miscellanea",
          "Beautiful Roman theatre, remarkably well reserved and very clean. Easy to get to. Not crowded at all.",
          "How many things we build today are likely to be in use in 2,000 years? That's one of the interesting things about this amphitheater. Not only did they get the construction and engineering right 2,000 years ago well enough for it to survive, but they also apparently",
          "We visited Tunis as part of a Cruise Holiday and it is certainly worth touring Tunis , however a word of caution is that you should get an organised tour as you are likely to be hassled a lot by Hawkers at every attraction , we visited Carthage and experienced the roman ruins",
          "This is an original Roman amphitheater that is still used today for many performances. There has been a little work on it to modify with electricity and a more modern stage but the original stone wall is still on the stage and is used as part of the stage. All of the seats and",
          "This is one of those places that was probably a major attraction under the old regime and clearly has been used for shows or concerts. Unfortunately, it hasn't been maintained very well (redone in parts with concrete, piles of garbage hidden in old holes and doorways, etc.),",
          "if you happen to be in Tunis in the Summer time, it is the main venue of concerts and operas and musicals, I have been there for several concerts, mostly french Singers like Patricia Kaas and others... it is beautiful, but not impressive as others Romanian theaters.",
          "This is a largely reconstructed Roman theatre, and what you see on travel programmes. It is not an amphitheatre like I expected. That is 2km away, and a little disappointing. But on my own, in October, I stood below the stage and recited some Shakespeare and felt great.",
          "This is a important historic site, but sadly due to centuries of raiders, there is very little left to see. A guided tour is a must, to know whats what.",
          "Terrible. As this theatre - according to my information - is very much reconstructed, I don't think it has much historical value at all.",
          "The roman theatre of Carthage has a great historical value. It is one of the historical sites not to miss when you visit Carthage, the northern suburb of Tunis. If you take the sub-urb train line from city center (Tunis Marine Train station, at the end of Habib BOURGUIBA Main",
          "While impressive (as roman amphitheaters normally are) this one is reconstructed and is overshadowed by the modern A/V equipment. There is also no historical information. If you are walking from the museum to the villas it is worth a stop, but nothing to go out of your way for",
          "The site is interesting but not well presented. It would help if more information was made available for tourists. The toilets are disgusting.",
          "we visited this as part of a day trip and would have liked longer to explore this more the site is very good with lots of areas to see and little nooks and cranny's to explore in the site this shows a good example of a roman site and has lots of the site remaining to get an",
          "This Roman theatre is used for outdoor performances, but the best time to go is when it's quiet. Off-peak you might even have the place for yourself. Definitely worth a visit and it's included in the normal Carthage ticket.",

        "wiki": "Tunis (Arabic: \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633\u200e T\u016bnis) is the capital and largest city of Tunisia. The greater metropolitan area of Tunis, often referred to as \"Grand Tunis\", has about 2,700,000 inhabitants, making it the third-largest city in the Maghreb region (after Casablanca and Algiers) and the sixteenth-largest in the Arab world. \nSituated on a large Mediterranean Sea gulf (the Gulf of Tunis), behind the Lake of Tunis and the port of La Goulette (\u1e24alq il-W\u0101d), the city extends along the coastal plain and the hills that surround it. At its core lies its ancient medina, a World Heritage Site. East of the medina through the Sea Gate (also known as the Bab el Bhar and the Porte de France) begins the modern city, or Ville Nouvelle, traversed by the grand Avenue Habib Bourguiba (often referred to by popular press and travel guides as \"the Tunisian Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\"), where the colonial-era buildings provide a clear contrast to smaller, older structures. Further east by the sea lie the suburbs of Carthage, La Marsa, and Sidi Bou Said. As the capital city of the country, Tunis is the focus of Tunisian political and administrative life and also the centre of the country's commercial and cultural activities. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nTunis is the transcription of the Arabic name \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633 which can be pronounced as \"T\u016bnus\", \"T\u016bnas\", or \"T\u016bnis\". All three variations were mentioned by the Greek-Syrian geographer al-Rumi Yaqout in his Mu'jam al-B\u00fbldan (Dictionary of Countries).\nDifferent explanations exist for the origin of the name Tunis. Some scholars relate it to the Phoenician goddess Tanith ('Tanit or Tanut), as many ancient cities were named after patron deities. Some scholars claim that it originated from Tynes, which was mentioned by Diodorus Siculus and Polybius in the course of descriptions of a location resembling present-day Al-Kasbah; Tunis's old Berber Bourgade.Another possibility is that it was derived from the Berber verbal root ens which means \"to lie down\" or \"to pass the night\". The term Tunis can possibly mean \"camp at night\", \"camp\", or \"stop\", or may have referred to as \"the last stop before Carthage\" by people who were journeying to Carthage by land. There are also some mentions in ancient Roman sources of such names of nearby towns as Tuniza (now El Kala), Thunusuda (now Sidi-Meskin), Thinissut (now Bir Bouregba), and Thunisa (now Ras Jebel). As all of these Berber villages were situated on Roman roads, they undoubtedly served as rest-stations or stops.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Carthage ===\n\nThe historical study of Carthage is problematic. Because its culture and records were destroyed by the Romans at the end of the Third Punic War, very few Carthaginian primary historical sources survive. While there are a few ancient translations of Punic texts into Greek and Latin, as well as inscriptions on monuments and buildings discovered in Northwest Africa, the main sources are Greek and Roman historians, including Livy, Polybius, Appian, Cornelius Nepos, Silius Italicus, Plutarch, Dio Cassius, and Herodotus. These writers belonged to peoples in competition, and often in conflict, with Carthage. Greek cities contended with Carthage over Sicily, and the Romans fought three wars against Carthage. Not surprisingly, their accounts of Carthage are extremely hostile; while there are a few Greek authors who took a favourable view, these works have been lost.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nTunis was originally a Berber settlement. The existence of the town is attested by sources dating from the 4th century BC. Situated on a hill, Tunis served as an excellent point from which the comings and goings of naval and caravan traffic to and from Carthage could be observed. Tunis was one of the first towns in the region to fall under Carthaginian control, and in the centuries that followed Tunis was mentioned in the military histories associated with Carthage. Thus, during Agathocles' expedition, which landed at Cape Bon in 310 BC, Tunis changed hands on various occasions.During the Mercenary War, it is possible that Tunis served as a center for the native population of the area, and that its population was mainly composed of peasants, fishermen, and craftsmen. Compared to the ancient ruins of Carthage, the ruins of ancient Tunis are not as large. According to Strabo, it was destroyed by the Romans in 146 BC during the Third Punic War. Both Tunis and Carthage were destroyed; Tunis, however, was rebuilt first under the rule of Augustus and became an important town under Roman control and the center of a booming agricultural industry. The city is mentioned in the Tabula Peutingeriana as Thuni. In the system of Roman roads for the Roman province of Africa, Tunis had the title of mutatio (\"way station, resting place\"). Tunis, increasingly Romanized, was also eventually Christianized and became the seat of a bishop. However, Tunis remained modestly sized compared to Carthage during this time.\n\n\n=== Early Islamic period ===\n\nWhen the Arab Muslim troops conquered the region at the end of the 7th century, they established themselves at the outskirts of ancient Tunes, and the small town soon became the city of Tunis that could easily be taken for an Arab foundation. The medina of Tunis, the oldest section of the city, dates from this period, during which the region was conquered by the Umayyad emir Hasan ibn al-Nu'man al-Ghasani. The city had the natural advantage of coastal access, via the Mediterranean, to the major ports of southern Europe. Early on, Tunis played a military role; the Arabs recognized the strategic importance of its proximity to the Strait of Sicily. From the beginning of the 8th century Tunis was the chef-lieu of the area: it became the Arabs' naval base in the western Mediterranean Sea, and took on considerable military importance. Under the Aghlabids, the people of Tunis revolted numerous times, but the city benefited from economic improvements and quickly became the second most important in the kingdom. It was briefly the national capital, from the end of the reign of Ibrahim II in 902, until 909 when control over Ifriqiya was lost to the newly founded Fatimid Caliphate.\nLocal opposition to the authorities began to intensify in September 945, when Kharijite insurgents occupied Tunis, resulting in general pillaging. With the rise of the Zirid dynasty Tunis gained importance, but the Sunni population tolerated Shi'ite rule less and less, and carried out massacres against the Shi'ite community. In 1048 the Zirid ruler Al-Muizz ibn Badis rejected his city's obedience to the Fatimids and re-established Sunni rites throughout all of Ifriqiya. This decision infuriated the Shi'ite caliph Al-Mustansir Billah. To punish the Zirids, he unleashed the Banu Hilal Arab tribe on Ifriqiya; a large part of the country was set to the torch, the Zirid capital Kairouan was razed in 1057, and only a few coastal towns, including Tunis and Mahdia, escaped destruction. Exposed to violence from the hostile tribes that settled around the city, the population of Tunis repudiated the authority of the Zirids and swore allegiance to the Hammadid prince El Nacer ibn Alennas, who was based in B\u00e9ja\u00efa, in 1059. The governor appointed by B\u00e9ja\u00efa, having reestablished order in the country, did not hesitate to free himself from the Hammadids to found the Khurasanid dynasty with Tunis as its capital. This small independent kingdom picked up the threads of trade and commerce with other nations, and brought the region back to peace and prosperity.\n\n\n=== New capital of Tunisia ===\nIn 1159, the Almohad 'Abd al-Mu'min took Tunis, overthrew the last Khurasanid leader and installed a new government in the kasbah of Tunis. The Almohad conquest marked the beginning of the dominance of the city in Tunisia. Having previously played a minor role behind Kairouan and Mahdia, Tunis was promoted to the rank of provincial capital.\nIn 1228, Governor Abu Zakariya seized power and, a year later, took the title of Emir and founded the Hafsid dynasty. The city became the capital of a Hafsid kingdom stretching towards Tripoli and Fez. Walls were built to protect the emerging principal town of the kingdom, surrounding the medina, the kasbah and the new suburbs of Tunis. In 1270 the city was taken briefly by Louis IX of France, who was hoping to convert the Hafsid sovereign to Christianity. King Louis easily captured Carthage, but his army soon fell victim to an outbreak of dysentery. Louis himself died before the walls of the capital and the army was forced out.  At the same time, driven by the reconquest of Spain, the first Andalusian Muslims and Jews arrived in Tunis and would become of importance to the economic prosperity of the Hafsid capital and the development of its intellectual life.During the Almohad and Hafsid periods Tunis was one of the richest and grandest cities in the Islamic world, with a population of about 100,000.\nDuring this period, one of the famous travellers to Tunis was Ibn Battuta. In his travel account, when Ibn Battuta and his group arrived in Tunis, the population of the city came out to meet him and the other the members of his party. They all greeted them and were very curious, many were asking questions, however, no one in Tunis personally greeted Ibn Battuta, greatly upsetting him. He felt very lonely and could not hold back the tears coming from his eyes. This went on for a while until one of the pilgrims realized he was upset, he went up and greeted and talked to Ibn until he entered the city. At the time, the Sultan of Tunis was Abu Yahya and during Ibn Battuta's stay, the Festival of the Breaking of the Fast was taking place. The people in the city assembled in large numbers to celebrate the festival, in extravagant and most luxurious outfits. Abu Yahya arrived on horseback, where all of his relatives joined him. After the performance, the people returned to their homes.\n\n\n=== Spanish occupation and Ottoman control ===\n\nThe Ottoman Empire took nominal control of Tunis in 1534 when Hayreddin Barbarossa captured it from the Hafsid Sultan Mulai Hassan, who fled to the court of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. Charles, suffering losses from the corsairs operating out of Djerba, Tunis, and Algiers, agreed to reinstate Mulai Hassan in exchange for his acceptance of Spanish suzerainty. A naval expedition led by Charles himself was dispatched in 1535, and the city was recaptured. The victory against the corsairs is recorded in a tapestry at the Royal Palace of Madrid. The Spanish governor of La Goulette, Luys Peres Varga,  fortified the island of Chikly in the lake of Tunis to strengthen the city's defences between 1546 and 1550. \n\n \nThe Ottoman Ulu\u00e7 Ali Reis, at the head of an army of janissaries and Kabyles, retook Tunis in 1569. However, following the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the Spanish under John of Austria succeeded in retaking the city and re-establishing the Hafsid sovereign in October 1573. Following these conflicts, the city finally fell into Ottoman hands in August 1574. Having become an Ottoman province governed by a Pasha who was appointed by the Sultan based in Constantinople, the country attained a degree of autonomy. After 1591, the Ottoman governors (Beys) were relatively independent, and both piracy and trade continued to flourish. Under the rule of deys and Moorish beys, the capital sprang into new life. Its population grew by additions from various ethnicities, among which were Moorish refugees from Spain, and economic activities diversified. To traditional industry and trade with distant lands was added the activity of the Barbary pirates, then in their golden age. Profits obtained from the trade in Christian slaves allowed the rulers to build sumptuous structures that revived the architectural heritage of the Middle Ages.\n\nIn April 1655 the English admiral Robert Blake was sent to the Mediterranean to extract compensation from states that had been attacking English shipping. Only the Bey of Tunis refused to comply, with the result that Blake's fifteen ships attacked the Bey's arsenal at Porto Farina (Ghar el Melh), destroying nine Algerian ships and two shore batteries, the first time in naval warfare that shore batteries had been eliminated without landing men ashore.\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Tunisia entered into a new period in its history with the advent of the Husainid dynasty. Successive Husainid rulers made great progress in developing the city and its buildings. During this period, the city prospered as a centre of commerce. Taking advantage of divisions within the ruling house, Algerians captured Tunis in 1756 and put the country under supervision. Hammouda Bey faced bombardment by the Venetian fleet, and the city experienced a rebellion in 1811. Under the reign of Hussein Bey II, naval defeats by the British (1826) and French (1827) saw the French become increasingly active in the city and in the economy.Various sources estimate the 19th-century population to have ranged from 90,000 to 110,000 inhabitants. During the later 19th century, Tunis became increasingly populated by Europeans, particularly the French, and immigration dramatically increased the size of the city. This resulted in the first demolition of the old city walls, from 1860, to accommodate growth in the suburbs. The city spilled outside the area of the earlier town and the banks of the lake, and the new districts were modernised with running water (1860), lighting gas (1872), roads, waste collection (1873), and communication with adjacent suburbs and the city centre. The crafts and traditional trades declined somewhat, as the newcomers increased trade with Europe, introducing the first modern industries and new forms of urban life.\n\n\n=== Development under the French protectorate ===\n\nThe creation of the French protectorate in 1881 was a turning point in Tunis's history, leading to rapid redevelopment of the city in the span of two to three decades. The city quickly spread out of its fortifications: it divided into a traditional Arab-populated old city, and a new city populated by immigrants, with a different structure from that of the traditional medina. Tunis also benefited from French construction of a water supply, natural gas and electricity networks, public transport services and other public infrastructure.\nUnder French rule, a substantial number of Europeans settled (like the Tunisian Italians); half of the population was European in origin. The city expanded and created new boulevards and neighborhoods.\nTunis was quiet during the First World War. After the war, the city faced new transformations as the modern portion grew in importance and extended its network of boulevards and streets in all directions. In addition, a series of satellite cities emerged on the urban rim and encroached on the municipality of Tunis proper. In the economic sphere, commercial activities expanded and diversified as modern industries continued to grow, while traditional industry continued to decline.\nDuring World War II, Tunis was held by Axis forces from November 1942 to May 1943. It was their last base in Africa, as they retreated towards Sicily after being surrounded by Allied forces from Algeria to the west and from Libya to the east. \nOn 7 May 1943, at about 15:30 in the afternoon, Tunis fell to troops of British 1st Army and the U.S. 1st Army, which had defeated the German 5th Panzer Army guarding the city. At midday on 20 May 1943, the Allies held a victory parade on Avenue Mar\u00e9chal Galli\u00e9ni, and Avenue Jules Ferry, to signal the end of fighting in North Africa.Having succeeded in driving the Axis powers out of Tunisia, the Allies used Tunis as a base of operations from which to stage amphibious assaults first against the island of Pantelleria, and then Sicily, and finally the mainland of Italy.\n\n\n=== Growth since independence ===\n\nAfter independence in 1956, Tunis consolidated its role as the capital, first with the establishment of a constitution stating that the Chamber of Deputies and the Presidency of the Republic must have their headquarters in Tunis and its suburbs. In a very short time, the colonial city transformed rapidly. As the city has grown and native Tunisians gradually began to replace the extensive European population, conflict between the Arab city and the European city has gradually decreased with the arabization of the population.\nBecause of population pressure and the rate of migration to the capital, the city continued to grow, even with the creation of new districts in the suburbs. Old buildings have gradually been renovated and upgraded and new buildings have come to influence the urban landscape. At the same time, an active policy of industrialization is developing the municipal economy.\nThe Arab League was headquartered in Tunis from 1979 to 1990. The Arab League, which represents 22 Arab nations, transferred its headquarters to Tunis in 1979 because of Egypt's peace with Israel but has been headquartered back in Egypt since 1990.\nThe Palestine Liberation Organization also had its headquarters in Tunis, from 1982 to 2003.\nIn 1985, the PLO's headquarters was bombed by Israeli Air Force F-15s, killing approximately 60 people.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nMany protests took place during the Arab Spring of 2011\u201312.\nOn 18 March 2015, two gunmen attacked the Bardo National Museum and held hostages. Twenty civilians and one policeman were killed in the attack, while around 50 others were injured. Five Japanese, two Colombians, and visitors from Italy, Poland, and Spain were among the dead. Both gunmen were killed by Tunisian police. The incident has been treated as a terrorist attack.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTunis is located in north-eastern Tunisia on the Lake of Tunis, and is connected to the Mediterranean sea's Gulf of Tunis by a canal which terminates at the port of La Goulette/Halq al Wadi. The ancient city of Carthage is located just north of Tunis along the coastal part. The city lies on a similar latitude as the southernmost points of Europe.\nThe city of Tunis is built on a hill slope down to the lake of Tunis. These hills contain places such as Notre-Dame de Tunis, Ras Tabia, La Rabta, La Kasbah, Montfleury and La Manoubia with altitudes just above 50 metres (160 feet). The city is located at the crossroads of a narrow strip of land between Lake Tunis and S\u00e9joumi. The isthmus between them is what geologists call the \"Tunis dome\", which includes hills of limestone and sediments. It forms a natural bridge and since ancient times several major roads linking to Egypt and elsewhere in Tunisia have branched out from it. The roads also connect with Carthage, emphasising its political and economic importance not only in Tunisia but more widely in North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea in ancient times.\nThe Greater Tunis area has an area of 300,000 hectares, 30,000 of which is urbanized, the rest being shared between bodies of water (20,000 hectares of lakes or lagoons) and agricultural or natural land (250,000 hectares). However, urban growth, which is estimated to be increasing by 500 hectares per year, is gradually changing the landscape with urban sprawl.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Suburbs ===\nAfter World War II, suburbs began to rapidly spring up on the outskirts of Tunis. These form a large percentage of the population of the Tunis metropolitan area. It grew from 27% of the total population in 1956, to 37% in 1975 and 50% in 2006.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTunis has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa), characterized by hot and dry, prolonged summers and mild winters with moderate rainfall. The local climate is also affected somewhat by the latitude of the city, the moderating influence of the Mediterranean sea and the terrain of the hills.\nWinter is the wettest season of the year, when more than a third of the annual rainfall falls during this period, raining on average every two or three days.  The sun may still increase the temperature from 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F) in the morning to 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) in the afternoon on average during the winter. Frosts are rare.  In spring, rainfall declines by half.  The sunshine becomes dominant in May when it reaches 10 hours a day on average.  In March temperatures may vary between 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F) and 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), and between 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) and 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) in May. However, it is common for temperatures to soar even as early as April with record temperatures reaching 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F).  In summer, rain is almost completely absent and the sunlight is at a maximum.  The average temperatures in the summer months of June, July, August, and September are very high. Sea breezes may mitigate the heat, but sometimes the sirocco winds reverse the trend.  In autumn, it begins to rain, often with short thunderstorms, which can sometimes cause flash floods or even flood some parts of the city.  The month of November marks a break in the general heat with average temperatures ranging from 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) to 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Capital ===\n\nTunis has been the capital of Tunisia since 1159. Under Articles 43 and 24 of the Constitution of 1959, Tunis and its suburbs host the national institutions: the Presidential Palace, which is known as Carthage Palace, residence of the President of Tunisia, the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Advisors and parliament, the Constitutional Council and the main judicial institutions  and public bodies. The revised Tunisian Constitution of 2014 similarly provides that the National Assembly is to sit in Tunis (article 51) and that the Presidency is based there (article 73).\n\n\n=== Municipality ===\n\n\n==== Institutions ====\n\nFollowing the municipal elections of 6 May 2018, Ennahdha obtained 21 seats out of 60. Nidaa Tounes came second with 17 seats. On 3 July 2018, the head of the Ennahdha list Souad Abderrahim was elected by the council as the new mayor of the capital.\nBefore 2011, unlike other mayors in Tunisia, the mayor of Tunis is appointed by decree of the President of the Republic from among the members of the City Council.\n\n\n==== Budget ====\nThe 2008 budget adopted by the City Council is structured as follows: 61.61 million dinars for operations and 32,516 million dinars for investment. It reflects the improved financial situation of the municipality, the year 2007 was a year registering a surplus in resources that allowed the settlement of debts of the municipality and the strengthening of its credibility with respect its suppliers and public and private partners.\nRevenues are generated by the proceeds of taxes on buildings and vacant lots, fees for the rental of municipal property, income from the operation of the public, advertising, and that the fact that the municipality has capital shares in some companies. On the expenditure side, provision is made for the consolidation of hygiene and cleanliness, the state of the environment and urban design, infrastructure maintenance, rehabilitation and renovation of facilities, and strengthening the logistics and means of work and transport.\n\n\n==== Administrative divisions ====\n\nThe city of Tunis, whose size has increased significantly during the second half of the 20th century, now extends beyond the Tunis Governorate into parts of the governorates of Ben Arous, Ariana and Manouba.\nThe municipality of Tunis is divided into 15 municipal districts:  These include El Bab Bhar, Bab Souika, Cit\u00e9 El Khadra, Jelloud Jebel El Kabaria, El Menzah, El Ouardia, Ettahrir, Ezzouhour, Hra\u00efria, Medina, El Omrane, El Omrane Higher S\u00e9joumi, Sidi El-Bashir and Sidi Hassine.\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nIn the years following independence, the population of the metropolitan area continued to grow: by 21.1% from 1956 to 1966 and by 28.5% from 1966 to 1975 (55.6% between 1956 and 1975). This steady growth was accompanied by changes which affected the nature of the settlement of the capital. Decolonization led to the exodus of some European minorities whose numbers dwindled every year. The gaps created by their departure were filled by Tunisians who emigrated to Tunis from other parts of the country.\nThe population of the city of Tunis exceeds 2,000,000 inhabitants. After independence, the Tunisian government implemented a plan to cope with population growth of the city and country, a system of family planning, to attempt to lower the rate of population growth. However, between 1994 and 2004, the population of the governorate of Tunis grew more than 1.03% per annum. It represents, in the 2004 census, 9.9% of the total population of Tunisia. As in the rest of Tunisia, literacy in the region of Tunis evolved rapidly during the second half of the 20th century and has reached a level slightly higher than the national average. The education level is only exceeded by the neighbouring governorate of Ariana which has many institutions of education.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nProducts include textiles, carpets, and olive oil. Tourism also provides a significant portion of the city's income.\nBecause of the concentration of political authority (headquarters of the central government, presidency, parliament, ministries and central government) and culture (festivals and mainstream media), Tunis is the only nationally ranking metropolis. Tunis is the heartland of the Tunisian economy and is the industrial and economic hub of the country, home to one third of Tunisian companies\u2014including almost all the head offices of companies with more than fifty employees, with the exception of the Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa, headquartered in Gafsa\u2014and produces a third of the national gross domestic product.  Tunis attracts foreign investors (33% of companies, 26% of investments and 27% of employment), excluding several areas due to economic imbalances. According to the Mercer 2017 Cost of Living Rankings, Tunis has the lowest cost of living for expatriates in the world. The urban unemployment rate of university graduates is increasing and the illiteracy rate remains high among the elderly (27% of women and 12% of men). The number of people living below the poverty line, falling at the national level, remains higher in urban areas. In addition, unemployment is high in young people aged 18 to 24, with one in three unemployed as compared to one in six at the national level. In Greater Tunis, the proportion of young unemployed is at 35%.Gulf finance house or GFH has invested $10 billion in order for the construction of tunis financial harbor, that will transform Tunisia as the gateway to Africa from Europe. The project hopes to boost the economy of Tunisia as well as increase the number of tourists visiting Tunisia annually. The project is going through planning.\n\n\n=== Sectors ===\nThe economic structure of Tunis, as well as that of the country, is overwhelmingly tertiary industry.  The city is the largest financial center in the country hosting the headquarters of 65% of financial companies \u2013 while the industrial sectors are gradually declining in importance.  However the secondary industry is still very represented and Tunis hosts 85% of industrial establishments in the four governorates, with a trend towards the spread of specialized industrial zones in the suburbs.\nPrimary industry such as agriculture, however, is active in specialized agricultural areas on the suburbs, particularly in the wine and olive oil industries. The generally flat terrain and the two main rivers in Tunisia, the Medjerda to the north and the Milian to the south, the soils are fertile.  Tunis has several large plains, the most productive are in Ariana and La Soukra (north), the plain of Manouba (west) and the plain of Mornag (south).  In addition, groundwater is easily accessible through the drilling of deep wells, providing water for the different agriculture crops. The soils are heavy and contain limestone in the north but are lighter and sandy containing clay in the south.  There is much diversification in the municipality of Tunis, with Durum grown in Manouba, Olives and olive oil in Ariana and Mornag, wine (Mornag), and fruit, vegetable and legumes are grown in all regions.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Architecture and landscape ==\n\n\n=== Urban landscape ===\n\nThe Medina, built on a gentle hill slope on the way down to the Lake of Tunis, is the historical heart of the city and home to many monuments, including palaces, such as the Dar Ben Abdallah and Dar Hussein, the mausoleum of Tourbet el Bey or many mosques such as the Al-Zaytuna Mosque. Some of the fortifications around it have now largely disappeared, and it is flanked by the two suburbs of Bab Souika to the north and Bab El Jazira to the south. Located near the Bab Souika, the neighborhood of Halfaouine which gained international attention through the film 'Halfaouine Child of the Terraces'.\nBut east of the original nucleus, first with the construction of the French Consulate, the modern city was built gradually with the introduction of the French protectorate at the end of the 19th century, on open land between the city and the lake. The axis to the structure of this part of the city is the Avenue Habib Bourguiba, designed by the French to be a Tunisian form of Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris with its cafes, major hotels, shops and cultural venues. On both sides of the tree lines avenue, north and south, the city was extended in various districts, with the northern end welcoming residential and business districts while the south receives industrial districts and poorer peoples.\nSouth-east of the Avenue Bourguiba the district of La Petite Sicile (Little Sicily) is adjacent to the old port area and takes its name from its original population of workers from Italy. It is now the subject of a redevelopment project including the construction of twin towers. North of the Avenue Bourguiba is the district of La Fayette, which is still home to the Great Synagogue of Tunis and the Habib Thameur Gardens, built on the site of an ancient Jewish cemetery which lay outside the walls. Also to the north is the long Avenue Mohamed V, which leads to the Boulevard of 7 November through the neighborhood of the big banks where there are hotels and Abu Nawas Lake and finally to the Belvedere area around the place Pasteur. This is where the Belvedere Park lies, the largest in the city, and home to a zoo and the Pasteur Institute founded by Adrien Loir in 1893. Continuing to the north are the most exclusive neighborhoods of Mutuelleville which house the French Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-Mend\u00e8s-France, the Sheraton Hotel and some embassies.\nStill further north of the Belvedere Park, behind the Boulevard of 7 November are the neighborhoods of El Menzah and El Manar now reaching the peaks of the hills overlooking the north of the town. They support a range of residential and commercial buildings. To the west of the park lies the district of El Omrane which holds the main Muslim cemetery in the capital and the warehouses of public transport.  Heading east is the Tunis-Carthage International Airport and the neighborhoods of Borgel, giving his name to the existing Jewish and Christian cemeteries in the capital, and the neighbourhood of Montplaisir. Beyond that, several kilometers north-east, on the road to La Marsa,  the Berges du Lac was built on land reclaimed from the north shore of the lake near the airport, which has holds offices of Tunisian and foreign companies, many embassies as well as shops.\nSouthwest of the Medina, on the crest of the hills across the Isthmus of Tunis, is the Montfleury district then on down to the foothills of S\u00e9joumi, the poor neighborhood of Mellassine. Northwest of the latter, north of the National Route 3 leading to the west, is the city of Ezzouhour (formerly El Kharrouba), which spans more than three metres (9.8 feet) and is divided into five sections. It is still surrounded with farmland and vegetables are grown which supply many of the souks in the region.\nThe south of Tunis is made up of disadvantaged neighborhoods, especially due to the strong industry in this part of the metropolis. These include Jebel Jelloud, located in the south-east of Tunis, which concentrates on the heavy industry of cement production, the treatment plant of phosphate s, etc. The main cemetery in Tunis, the Djellaz Cemetery, dominates this part of town, perched on the slopes of a rocky outcrop.\n\n\n=== M\u00e9dina ===\n\nThe medina of Tunis has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979. The Medina contains some 700 monuments, including palaces, mosques, mausoleums, madrasas and fountains dating from the Almohad and the Hafsid periods. These ancient buildings include:\n\nThe Aghlabid Al-Zaytouna Mosque (\"Mosque of the Olive\") built in 723 by Ubayd Allah ibn al-Habhab to celebrate the new capital.\nThe Dar El Bey, or Bey's Palace, comprises architecture and decoration from many different styles and periods and is believed to stand on the remains of a Roman theatre as well as the 10th-century palace of Ziadib-Allah II al Aghlab.With an area of 270 hectares (over 29 hectares for the Kasbah)  and more than 100,000 people, the Medina comprises one-tenth of the population of Tunis. The planning of the Medina of Tunis has the distinction of not grid lines or formal geometric compositions. However, studies were undertaken in the 1930s with the arrival of the first anthropologists who found that the space of the Medina is not random: the houses are based on a socio-cultural code according to the types of complex human relations.\nDomestic architecture (palaces and townhouses), official and civilian (libraries and administrations), religious (mosques and zaou\u00efas) and services (commercial and fondouks) are located in the Medina. The notion of public space is ambiguous in the case of Medina where the streets are seen as an extension of the houses and subject to social tags. The concept of ownership is low however and souks often spill out onto public roads. Today, each district has its culture and rivalries can be strong.\nThe northern end supports the football club of Esperance Sportive de Tunis while at the other end is the rival Club Africain. The Medina also has a social sectorization: with the neighborhood of Tourbet el Bey and the Kasbah district being aristocratic, with a population of judges and politicians, while the streets of Pacha often being military and bourgeois.\nFounded in 698 is the Al-Zaytuna Mosque and the surrounding area which developed throughout the Middle Ages,  dividing Tunis into a main town in two suburbs, in the north (Bab Souika) and the south (Bab El Jazira). The area became the capital of a powerful kingdom during the Hafsid era, and was considered a religious and intellectual home and economic center for the Middle East, Africa and Europe. A great fusion of influences can be seen blending Andalusian styles with eastern influences, and Roman or Byzantine columns, and typical Arab architecture, characterized by the archways.\nThe architectural heritage is also omnipresent in the homes of individuals and small palace officials as well as in the palace of the sovereign of Kasbah. Although some palaces and houses date back to the Middle Ages, a greater number of prestigious houses were built in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries such as Dar Othman (early 17th century), Dar Ben Abdallah (18th century), Dar Hussein, Dar Cherif and other houses. The main palace beys are those of La Marsa, Bardo and Ksar Said. If we add the mosques and oratories (about 200), the madrasahs (El Bachia, Slimania, El Achouria, Bir El Ahjar, Ennakhla, etc..), The zaouias (Mahrez Sidi Sidi Ali Azouz, Sidi Abdel Kader, etc.) and Tourbet El Fellari, Tourbet Aziza Othman and Tourbet El Bey the number of monuments in Tunis approaches 600. Unlike Algiers, Palermo and Naples, its historical heart has never suffered from major natural disasters or urban radical interventions. The main conflicts and potentially destructive human behavior has been experienced in the city occurred relatively recently following the country's independence which it why it made into a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. At the beginning of the 21st century, the Medina is one of the best preserved urban locations in the Arab world.Furthermore, along the boulevards, the contribution of the architectural period 1850\u20131950 can be felt in the buildings, such as the government buildings of the nine ministries and the headquarters of the municipality of Tunis.\n\n\n=== Other landmarks ===\nThe Bardo Museum was originally a 13th-century Hafsid palace, located in the (then) suburbs of Tunis. It contains a major collection of Roman empires and other antiquities of interest from Ancient Greece, Tunisia, and from the Arab period.\nThe ruins of Carthage are nearby, along the coast to the northeast, with many ancient ruins.\n\n\n==== Souks ====\n\nThe souks are a network of covered streets lined with shops and traders and artisans ordered by specialty.  Clothing merchants, perfumers, fruit sellers, booksellers and wool merchants have goods at the souks, while fishmongers, blacksmiths and potters tend to be relegated to the periphery of the markets.\n\nNorth of the Al-Zaytuna Mosque is the Souk El Attarine, built in the early 18th century. It is known for its essences and perfumes. From this souk, there is a street leading to the Souk Ech-Chaouachine (chachia). The main company that operates it is one of the oldest in the country and they are generally descendants of Andalusian immigrants expelled from Spain. Attached to El Attarine are two other souks: the first, which runs along the western coast of the Al-Zaytuna Mosque, is the Souk El Kmach which is noted for its fabrics, and the second, the Souk El Berka, which was built in the 17th century and houses embroiderers and jewelers. Given the valuable items it sells, it is the only souk whose doors are closed and guarded during the night. In the middle there is a square where the former slave market stood until the middle of the 19th century.\nSouk El Berka leads to Souk El Leffa, a souk that sells all kinds of carpets, blankets and other weavings, and extends with the Souk Es Sarragine, built in the early 18th century and specializing in leather. At the periphery are the souks Et Trouk, El Blat, El Blaghgia, El K\u00e9babgia, En Nhas (copper), Es Sabbaghine (dyeing) and El Grana that sell clothing and blankets and was occupied by Jewish merchants.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Walls and gates ====\n\nFrom the early days of its founding, Tunis has been considered an important military base. The Arab geographer El Yacoubi has written that in the 9th century Tunis was surrounded by a wall of brick and clay except the side of the sea where it was stone.  Bab El-Jazeera, perhaps the oldest gate of the south wall, opened onto the southern road. Bab Cartagena gave access to Carthage, important for bringing in construction materials needed for the city. Bab Souika (initially known as Bab El Saqqayin) had a strategic role to keep the roads to Bizerte, B\u00e9ja and Le Kef. Bab Menara (initially known as Bab El Artha) opened onto the medina and on the suburb of El Haoua. As for El Bab Bhar, it allowed access to some funduqs where Christian merchants lived in Tunis.\nWith the development of the capital under the reign of the Hafsids, two emerging suburbs grew outside the walls; Bab El Jazira in the south and Bab Souika to the north. In the early 14th century, Hafsid Darba Ab\u00fb al-Muhammad al-Mustansir Lihy\u00e2n\u00ee ordered the construction of a second chamber including the Medina and two suburbs outside. Six new gates were built including Bab El Khadra, Bab Saadoun, Bab El Allouj (initially called Bab Er-Rehiba), Khalid or Bab Bab Sidi Abdallah Cherif, Bab El Fellah and Bab Alioua. In the Ottoman period, four new gates were established: Bab Laassal, Bab Sidi Abdesselam, Bab El Bab Gorjani and Sidi Kacem. The city retains some of these gates including Bab El Khadra, Bab El Bhar and Bab Jedid but some of the earlier ones have long disappeared.\n\n\n=== Places of worship ===\n\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslim mosques.   There are also Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tunis (Catholic Church), Protestant churches, Evangelical Churches.As in the rest of Tunisia, a very large majority of the population of Tunis (around 99%) is Sunni Muslim.  The capital is home to a large number of mosques in various architectural styles, signs of construction of their respective eras.  The main and oldest of them, is the Al-Zaytuna Mosque, founded in 698 and built in 732 and is in the heart of the Medina. Practicing the Maliki rite as the vast majority of Tunisia's Mosques. It was completely rebuilt in 864 and is a prestigious place of worship, and was long an important place of culture and knowledge with the University of Ez-Zitouna on the premises until the independence of Tunisia.  It still hosts the main ceremonies marking the dates on the Muslim calendar and is regularly attended by the president.\nThe medina contains most of the major mosques in the capital which were built before the advent of the French protectorate.  The mosque in the Kasbah, was founded in 1230.  Practicing the Hanafi rite since 1584, it is recognisable mainly by the dome as well as its minaret, similar to the Koutoubia in Marrakesh and is the highest in the city. Ksar Mosque, also of the Hanafi rite, is located in front of Dar Hussein (Bab Menara) and was built in the 12th century.  The Hammouda Pasha Mosque, built in 1655, is the second mosque built by the Hanafi rite in Tunis. Youssef Dey Mosque operated primarily as public speaking venue before becoming a real mosque in 1631. The Sidi Mahrez Mosque is the largest mosque Hanafi mosque in terms of area but not the tallest.  Built in 1692, it resembles the Ottoman S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul.  The Saheb Ettaba\u00e2 Mosque, built between 1808 and 1814 was the last mosque built by the Tunis Husseinites before the French occupation.The presence of modern churches in Tunis are also testimony to the French presence for half a century.  Tunis is the seat of the Diocese of Tunis, with the seat located at the Cathedral of St Vincent de Paul, The church was built in 1897 on the site of the old Christian cemetery of Saint-Antoine.  This includes a network of Catholic buildings, including the Church of St. Joan of Arc, but also with the Protestant Reformed Church and the Anglican church Saint-Georges.Greeks used to enjoy an important presence in the city since ancient times. Tunis is the headquarters of the Greek Orthodox Holy Archdiocese of Carthage with jurisdiction over Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia. It belongs to the Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa, and its cathedral, small school and other buildings are in Central Tunis.\nIn total, there are three Greek Orthodox and two Russian Orthodox parishes in Tunisia. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria also maintains jurisdiction in Tunisia.\nThe small Orthodox community is centred around the Greek Orthodox Church (1862), managed by the Greek Embassy and the Russian Orthodox Church (1957), reflecting the presence in Tunisia of a small colony of Russian immigrants.Judaism, meanwhile, enjoys a long tradition of presence in the city despite the emigration of a large part of the community after independence.  Among the places of worship are Beit Yaacouv Synagogue and especially the Great Synagogue of Tunis, built at the end of the 1940s to replace the former Great Synagogue which was demolished as part of the Jewish redevelopment area, the Hara.\n\n\n=== Parks and greenery ===\n\nTunis has some large parks, many of which were installed at the end of the 19th century by the authorities of the French protectorate. The largest Park, Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re Park, was founded in 1892 overlooks Lake Tunis. It is the oldest public park in the country and is built in the landscape style common to France.  The park covers an area of more than one hundred hectares across roads that can be explored on foot or by car. It is also home to Tunis Zoo, which houses African fauna, and the Museum of Modern Art.\nHabib Thameur garden in Tunis has a central pond and flower beds. The Gorjani garden, is an English garden located southwest of the city, which notably takes an irregular form, partly due to the steep topography of the land.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nLocated in an old beylical palace (the palace of the Bey of Tunis since the end of the 18th century), the Bardo National Museum (Tunis) is the most important archaeological museum in the Maghreb, and has one of the richest Roman mosaic collections in the world.  Its collections developed rapidly, thanks to numerous archaeological discoveries in the surrounding territory.\nIn 1964 the Dar Ben Abdallah, a palace probably dating back to the 18th century, became the seat of the capital's Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions.  In its exposition halls it holds numerous traditional items, witnesses of the everyday lives of families of the Medina quarter.\nThe Museum of the National Movement is situated in Dar Ma\u00e2kal Az-Za\u00efm, which was the residence of nationalist Habib Bourguiba for the entirety of the fight for independence.  After the advent of independence, a museum was built there to relate the details of the national struggle between 1938 and 1952.\nThe National Military Museum, opened in 1989 in the suburbs west of the city, holds a collection of 23,000 weapons, 13,000 of which date back to the 19th century, and some of which were used by the Tunisian troops during the Crimean War.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nTunis holds some of the most prestigious musical institutions in the country. The Rachidia was founded in 1934 to safeguard Arab music, and in particular to promote Tunisian and malouf music.  The group is made up of 22 members, both instrumental players and choral musicians.The Musical Troupe of the City of Tunis was created in 1954 by Salah El Mahdi. In 1955 he placed his student Mohamed Sa\u00e2da in charge of the ensemble, which at that time included the best artists, and later merged with the ensemble of Radio Tunis.  This group contributed to the rise to stardom of numerous Tunisian singers, including Oulaya.\nThe Association of Arab Orchestra of the City of Tunis began its activities at the end of April 1982, as a workshop linked to the cultural center of the city.  It worked on promoting Arab music, on music education and training, and on cooperation with various partners both in Tunisia and abroad.  The Tunisian Symphony Orchestra, created in 1969 by the Minister of Culture, has also produced monthly concerts at the Municipal Theater and in various cultural spaces in the city.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nTunis is a center of Tunisian culture. The Th\u00e9\u00e2tre municipal de Tunis, opened on 20 November 1902, showcases opera, ballet, symphonic concerts, drama, etc. On the stage of this theater, many performances are regularly given by Tunisian, Arabic and international actors. The National Theatre of Tunisia is an important public enterprise in Tunis, and since 1988 been located in the Khaznadar palace (dating from the middle of the 19th century and situated in the Halfaouine quarter), renamed \"Theater Palace.\" In 1993, it also took possession of the former movie theater Le Paris, with a 350-person seating capacity.  During each \"cultural season\" (from October 1 to 30 June) the theater holds over 80 events.  The Al Hamra theater was the second theater to be opened in Tunis, situated on El Jazira Road.  Al Hamra was one of the most famous theaters in the capital during the 1930s and 1940s.  After being closed for fifteen years, it was turned into a small theater in 1986, and since 2001 has housed the first Arab-African center for theater training and research.  One should also note the El Teatro and \u00c9toile du Nord theater groups.\nOther arts are also represented in the capital. The National Center of the Arts established the puppet theatre in 1976.  The National School of Circus Arts was founded following a meeting between the Director of the National Theater and the Director General of the National Center for Arts of Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne (France) in 1998. In addition, various small theatres and cultural centres are scattered throughout the city and display various artistic performances.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nFilm producers and cinema have long been present in the city of Tunis. The first animated film was shown in Tunis by the Lumiere brothers as early as 1896. The first screenings were held the following year and the first cinema, the Omnia Path\u00e9, opened in October 1908. The first film club opened in Tunis in 1946 and the Globe, in 1965. The Carthage Film Festival is the oldest established film festival in Africa, running biennially until 2014 and annually thereafter.\nIn 1990, Ferid Boughedir shot the notable film Halfaouine Child of the Terraces in Halfaouine district. The films The English Patient (1996) and The Last Days of Pompeii (2003) were also shot in studios in Tunis.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nThe city holds several festivals each year, of which the largest is the International Festival of Carthage which takes place in July and August. Founded in 1964, much of the festival is held in an old amphitheater of Carthage (with a capacity of 7,500 seats), and hosts the performances of singers, musicians, actors, dancers and films on display on outdoor screens.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nTunis and its suburbs have many of the major Tunisian universities including the University of Tunis, Tunisia Private University, University of Ez-Zitouna, the University of Tunis \u2013 El Manar, the University of Carthage and the Manouba University. It therefore has the highest concentration of students in Tunisia, with a student population of 75,597 as of 2006.\n\nThere are also a number of other post-secondary institutions, such as the National School of Engineers of Tunis, the National School of Science, the Graduate School of Communications of Tunis, and the Higher Institute of Technological Studies in Communications of Tunis. In addition, private training institutes include the Open University of Tunis, the Central University Private Business Administration and Technology, the Graduate School of Private Engineering and Technology, and the North African Institute of Economics and Technology.\nAmong the high schools in the capital, the best-known are the Lyc\u00e9e de la Rue du Pacha (founded 1900), Lyc\u00e9e Bab El Khadhra, Lyc\u00e9e de la Rue de Russie, Lyc\u00e9e Bourguiba (formerly Lyc\u00e9e Carnot de Tunis), and the Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui. Until independence, Sadiki College (founded 1875) and Khaldounia (founded 1896) were also among the most recognized. A legacy of the French presence in the country remains, and the city retains many French schools, the most important being the Lyc\u00e9e Pierre Mendes-France at Mutuelleville.\nStudents can pursue language studies at small private schools such as Sidi Bou Said Centre for Languages (Centre Sidi Bou Said de Langues et d'Informatique) in the picturesque Tunis suburb of Sidi Bou Said, next to the Sidi Bou Said TGM station that specializes in Arabic, offering classes in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), classical Arabic, Tunisian Arabic and the various dialects of North Africa, the Gulf and the Levant.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nTunis has some of the most important libraries in Tunisia including the National Library of Tunisia which was first installed in 1924 in the Medina, in a building built in 1810 by Hammouda Bey to serve as barracks for troops and then a jail.  The library moved to its current location on Boulevard 9 April in 1938. The new building contains a reading room, conference room, laboratories, an exhibition gallery, a block of technical and administrative services, a restaurant, a parking and green space areas.\nHoused in a former home of a Hafsid scholar, the library of the Khaldounia was founded in 1896 along with the creation of the educational institution. After independence and following the consolidation of programs of education, the association ceased operations but the library is now linked to the National Library, which provides for its management.Built in the 17th century, the Dar Ben Achour also contains a library. Acquired in the late 1970s by the municipality of Tunis, the house was restored in 1983 into a library.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nTunis is served by the Tunis-Carthage International Airport. The growing metropolitan area is served by an extensive network of public transportation including buses, an above-ground light rail system (le Metro), as well a regional train line (the TGM) that links the city centre to its closest northern suburbs. Multi-lane autoroutes surround the city and serve the increasing number of privately owned cars one encounters in Tunisia.\nThe Tunis area is served by the m\u00e9tro l\u00e9ger (Ar.: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0631\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0641\u064a\u0641 \u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633) and TGM (Tunis-Goulette-Marsa), as well as bus services, and is linked to other places in Tunisia by SNCFT, the national railways. The important transport authorities are the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Transports de Tunis (STT) and the Ministry of Transport (Airports)\n\nThe A1 motorway connects Tunis with Sfax to the south, and the A3 with Oued Zarga and B\u00e9ja to the west, while the A4 is the link with Bizerte.\nThe city has, as of the beginning of the 21st century, a public transportation system developed under the management of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des transports de Tunis (STT). In addition to some 200 bus routes, the first light rail line opened in 1985. The M\u00e9tro l\u00e9ger de Tunis network has extended gradually since then to reach the suburbs. The capital is also linked to its northern suburbs by the railway line that crosses the lake, dividing the lake into two.\nA new mass transit was planned for Greater Tunis in 2009. This was the RTS (rapid rail network), the local equivalent of the Paris RER, which was to carry tens of thousands of travellers from the distant suburbs of Tunis to the centre by using either existing tracks or new tracks yet to be built. The plan was for lines based on certain criteria such as population density and the lack of coverage for a given area. Among the priority lines were: Tunis-Borj C\u00e9dria (23 km) where modernization and electrification are already planned; Tunis-Mohamedia-Fouchana (19.4 km); Tunis-Manouba-Mnihla (19.2 km); Tunis-Ezzouhour-Sidi Hassine S\u00e9joumi (13.9 km). In addition, the TGM will be integrated into the light-rail network and a new line built around Ayn Zaghouan and Bhar Lazrag (8.4 km). Such an operation would require the upgrading of the docks' TGM stations so that they become suitable for light rail trains. Among other projects are a line to the city of Ennasr (8.4 km) and the extension of the Tunis-Ettadhamen to Mnihla (1.7 km). For its part, the south light-rail line was extended in November 2008 to El Mourouj with a length of 6.8 kilometres (4.2 miles). The total length of the network will eventually be in the range of 84 km (52 mi).\n\n\n=== Infrastructure ===\n\nTunis is served by Tunis-Carthage International Airport, located 8 kilometers (5.0 mi) northeast of downtown, which began operating in 1940 under the name of Tunis El Aouina.  The terminal had 4.4 million passengers (35.98% of total airport traffic in the country) in 2006.  In 2007 that increased to 6 million passengers with a rise in tourism to the city.\nAfter independence, in the 1960s, the National Board of Seaports, which supports all ports in the country, modernized the infrastructure of the port of Tunis.  In the 21st Century, the port of Tunis underwent further transformation with a marina as part of the redevelopment district of La Petite Sicile.\nTunis is the starting point from which the main roads and all highways that serve different parts of the country of Tunis originate.  This city has a high density of traffic because vehicle ownership is rising at 7.5% per year.  The capital is home to approximately 40% of the cars in Tunisia, with 700,000 cars on average used in the city per day.  In this context, major road infrastructure (bridges, interchanges, roads, etc..) was initiated in the late 1990s to decongest the main areas of the capital.  The main roads to other Tunisian cities include: Autoroute A1, Tunis-Sfax; Autoroute A3, Tunis-Oued Zarga; and Autoroute A4, Tunis-Bizerte. Also, as part of the major infrastructure project, the city's traffic lights were increased from 5,000 to 7,500.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, a number of sports institutions were established in Tunis, particularly in school and college settings. In 1905 the Muslim Association of Tunisia brought together students from Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui and Sadiki College to organize gymnastics. A regional gymnastics competition was held in Tunis in 1912 with the participation of thousands of French gymnasts. Football made its appearance in the capital on 15 September 1904, followed by the formal creation of the country's first league, the Racing Club Tunis, on 11 May 1905. It took some time to run properly but soon organized meetings between the teams in schools. The first took place on 9 June 1907, between teams from Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui and Lyc\u00e9e Carnot (1\u20131).\nBut football is not the only discipline to emerge. Between 1928 and 1955 the city hosted nine rounds of the Grand Prix of Tunis, where notable drivers such as Marcel Lehoux, Achille Varzi, Tazio Nuvolari and Rudolf Caracciola took part. The Grand Prix of Tunis has re-emerged since 2000. The city has also held the Mediterranean Games twice, in 1967 and 2001, and the international tennis tournament, the Tunis Open, which is included in the ATP Challenger Series. The 2005 World Championship final for men in team handball was played in Tunis.\nIn total the governorate of Tunis registered 24,095 licences for various clubs in the municipal area in 2007. The city further put itself onto the international basketball map as it hosted the FIBA Africa Championship 1965 and the FIBA Africa Championship 1987.\n\nThe Esperance Sportive de Tunis (EST), Club Africain (CA), and Stade Tunisien are the major sports clubs in the city. A symbolic class difference is present between the EST's and the CA's supporters, despite their playing at the same stadium. The EST is supported by the majority of the masses, while the CA, a poorer club, is supported by the others.\nThe first true sports facilities were managed under the French protectorate, as illustrated by the development of the Ksar Said racecourse and construction of the Stade Chedli Zouiten in the neighborhood of Belvedere, which had long been the main stadium in the capital before being supplanted by the Olympic stadium, Stade El Menzah, where EST and CA play their football today. The Olympic stadium and village area was built to accommodate the Mediterranean Games in 1967. A 60,000-seat stadium was also built in Rad\u00e8s for the Mediterranean Games in 2001 at an estimated cost of 170 million dinars, with nearly half of the loans financed by South Korean businessmen. The Olympic village was financed by an investment estimated at 50 million dinars.

        "wiki": "The Amazing Race 1 (originally broadcast under the name The Amazing Race) is the first season of the American reality television series The Amazing Race. It was broadcast for the first time on American television on September 5, 2001 and ended its run on December 13, 2001. It featured 11 teams of two, with a pre-existing relationship, in a race around the world.\nLawyers and best friends, Rob Frisbee and Brennan Swain were the winners of the inaugural Race.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development and filming ===\n\nIn December 2000, CBS announced that it was set to produce a new reality show entitled CBS Summer Global Adventure Series, which would feature eight teams of two traveling to eleven international locations to win US$1 million.The first season of The Amazing Race traveled 35,000 miles (56,000 km) in 39 days, spanning four continents and nine different countries. The season was hit with multiple filming delays, including an airport strike in Rome and a sandstorm in Tunisia, the latter of which forced teams to begin Leg 6 in Gab\u00e8s, rather than the original Saharan desert Pit Stop.\nOther aspects of filming were unique to the first season of the series. Host Phil Keoghan handed out clues at the beginning of some legs and only greeted the last-place team at each Pit Stop; all other teams were greeted and informed of their placements by local representatives. Each leg's Pit Stop mat featured a localized design; subsequent seasons have used a single mat design throughout the entire Race.  This is also the first and only season which teams left the Starting Line immediately for Africa; all other inhabited continents have more than once served as the route markers directly after the Starting Line in subsequent seasons.\nDuring Leg 5, Paul & Amie got lost in the Sahara Desert after trying numerous routes and found the desert oasis Pit Stop by luck, unknowingly skipping the Roadblock and final route marker.\nThe Amazing Race courses were planned so that the final three teams would all reach the Finish Line; however, Joe & Bill (\"Team Guido\") were so far behind that they could not catch up and did not finish the Race. When they were still completing Leg 12 (which aired alongside Leg 13 in the final episode), Team Guido was required to have villagers bounce one teammate upwards using an Alaskan tapestry. According to the DVD commentary, the tapestry broke under the weight the day before, so a trampoline had to be used instead.\n\n\n=== Cast ===\n\nEleven teams participated in the first season of The Amazing Race, ranging from best friends to couples, as well as a mother and daughter duo.\nMargaretta Groark died on October 26, 2008, after a long battle with cancer, at the age of 67. Nancy Hoyt died on December 8, 2011, after a long battle with ALS, at the age of 56.\n\n\n==== Future appearances ====\nKevin & Drew made an appearance in Season 8, handing out clues from a hot dog stand in New York City. They also returned, along with Joe & Bill, to participate in the first All-Stars edition among a cast of returning teams from seasons 1-10. Runner up Frank Mesa made an appearance at the Starting Line of Season 25. Winners Rob & Brennan made an appearance at the Starting Line of Season 27.\n\n\n=== Distribution ===\nThe DVD for Season 1 was released on September 27, 2005. Kevin & Drew, Lenny & Karen, Joe & Bill, and Rob & Brennan did commentary on four episodes.\n\n\n== Results ==\nThe following teams participated in the Race, each listed along with their placements in each leg and relationships as identified by the program. Note that this table is not necessarily reflective of all content broadcast on television due to inclusion or exclusion of some data. Placements are listed in finishing order:\n\nA red team placement indicates that the team was eliminated.\nAn underlined blue team placement indicates that the team was the last to arrive at a Pit Stop in a non-elimination leg of the Race.\nA green \u0192 indicates that the team won a Fast Forward clue. If placed next to a leg number, this indicates that the Fast Forward was available for that leg but not used.\n\n\n== Episode titles ==\nThe episode titles are:\n\nThe Race Begins\nDivide And Conquer\nHome For Some\nColossal Showdown\nDesert Storm\nWhatever It Takes To Win\nTriumph And Loss\nCompetition To The Fullest\nThe Unexpected Twist\nTo The Physical And Mental Limit\nFight To The Last Minute\nRace To The Finish \u2014 Part 1\nRace To The Finish \u2014 Part 2\n\n\n== Race summary ==\n\n\n=== Leg 1 (United States \u2192 South Africa \u2192 Zambia) ===\n\nAirdate: September 5, 2001\n\nNew York City, New York , United States  (Central Park \u2013 Bethesda Fountain) (Starting Line)\n New York City (John F.

In Air, teams had to take a quick trip along a zip line across the gorge and then experience a 54-metre (177 ft) gorge swing to reach the bottom to receive their next clue. This side of the Detour was later referenced on Season 27 during a Switchback on the Zimbabwean side of the gorge. In Land, teams had to take a long hike down the rim of the gorge to receive the next clue.\nNear the Pit Stop at Songwe Village, there was a Roadblock that required one team member to cook an ostrich egg, which both team members had to eat before checking into the Pit Stop. This task went unaired in the episode but was shown as a bonus feature on the DVD.\n\nAdditional tasksTeams' first clue instructed them to fly to Johannesburg, South Africa on one of three flights: the first was a direct South African Airways flight to Johannesburg, which would arrive first with seats for five teams, the second Swiss Air flight connected in Zurich and would arrive second with two teams, and the third Alitalia flight connected in Milan and would arrive last with four teams.\nAt Lanseria Airport, teams had to find Ryan Blake Air to take one of four charter flights to an unknown destination: Livingstone, Zambia.\nUpon arrival in Livingstone, teams had to find a marked car with their next clue, which instructed them to find \"the smoke that thunders\" leaving teams to figure out that it was the local name for Victoria Falls (Mosi-oa-Tunya).

In Near, teams had to go to Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park only 20 kilometres (12 mi) away and had to use an instant camera to photograph three hard-to-find animals from a provided list of five (giraffe, impala, water buffalo, zebra, rhino). In Far, teams had to go to Chobe National Park in the nation of Botswana 110 kilometres (68 mi) away and photograph a single elephant.\nIn the very first aired Roadblock of the Race, one team member had to take the stairway up to the second level of the Eiffel Tower and use a \u20a310 coin to operate a telescope to search the city skyline for a famous monument with a Race flag on top to find the Pit Stop: the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nAdditional tasksAt the start of the leg, teams had to find the Songwe Museum near the village, where they would find instant cameras along with their next clue.\nAfter the Detour, teams had to travel to Mukuni Village. Once there, they had to take part in a traditional welcome ceremony for honored guests, which included meeting the village chief, who would spit on them, as well as viewing and participating in a tribal dance. After the ceremony, teams gave the village chief the photographs they took during the Detour and received the next clue: a miniature model of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France.\n\n\n=== Leg 3 (France) ===\n\nAirdate: September 26, 2001\n\n Paris (Mariage Fr\u00e8res)Paris (Roue de Paris)\n Paris (Notre-Dame de Paris or Panth\u00e9on)\nParis (H\u00f4tel de Ville) \nParis (Place du Ch\u00e2telet)\n Paris (Gare de Lyon) to Avignon (Gare d'Avignon Centre) or Marseille (Gare de Marseille Saint-Charles)\nLes Baux-de-Provence (Ch\u00e2teau des Baux) The Fast Forward required one team to find an obscure tea shop called Mariage Fr\u00e8res in Rive Gauche and ask for a specific tea called \"L'aventurier\" to retrieve the Fast Forward award.\nThe leg's Detour was a choice of Tough Climb or Easy Walk. In Tough Climb, teams traveled to Notre-Dame de Paris and had to climb up the 297 steps of the cathedral to ring Quasimodo's bell and receive their next clue. In Easy Walk, teams had to locate a statue of a cat sitting beside Foucault pendulum. However, there are two Foucault pendulums in Paris, but only the one at the Panth\u00e9on has the statue and the pendulum at the Museum of Arts and Crafts does not.\nIn this leg's Roadblock, one team member had to walk underground through the sewers of Paris to the Place du Ch\u00e2telet, two blocks away to find their next clue.\n\nAdditional tasksAt the start of the leg, teams had to find La Grande Roue (\"The Big Wheel\") and figure out that it was the nearby Roue de Paris to find the next clue.\nAfter the Detour, teams had to find a man in a blue suit across from the H\u00f4tel de Ville to find the next clue.\nAfter the Roadblock, teams had to travel by train to Les Baux-de-Provence through either Avignon or Marseille to find  the Pit Stop at Ch\u00e2teau des Baux.\n\n\n=== Leg 4 (France \u2192 Tunisia) ===\n\nAirdate: October 3, 2001\n\n Marseille (Marseille Ferry Port) to Tunis, Tunisia  (La Goulette)\n Sidi Bou Said (Port of Sidi Bou Said)\nTunis (Bab el Bhar)\n Tunis (Medina of Tunis \u2013 Caf\u00e9 Mnouchi or Hammam)\nEl Djem (Amphitheatre of El Jem)  This leg's Detour was a choice between Full Body Brew or Full Body Massage.

In Full Body Massage, teams had to search for a massage parlor marked on a provided map. Once there, they had to sit through a 20-minute massage before they received the next clue.\nIn an unused Fast Forward, teams were told to go fishing on board the Kinsa in the port of Sidi Bou Said.In this leg's Roadblock, one team member had to light a torch and, with some basic instructions, navigate the ancient arena to find the pit of death. Then, they had to retrieve a sword dangling above the pit, find a way out of the maze of tunnels, and bring it to the Pit Stop, where they sheathed the sword to finish the leg.\n\nAdditional tasksAt the start of the leg, teams were told to travel to Marseille Ferry Port, where they had to travel by boat from Marseille to a smaller version of the Arc de Triomphe in the country represented by a small unidentified flag. Teams had to figure out that they had a Tunisian flag, and they had to travel to the capital city of Tunis. Once in Tunis, they had to find the man depicted in a provided photograph near Bab el Bhar, which bears strong resemblance to Paris' Arc de Triomphe, and say a traditional greeting of As-sal\u0101m (\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645) to receive the next clue.\nAfter the Detour, teams received a lighter marked with a picture of the amphitheatre in El Djem with the words \"Go Here\" on the back.\n\n\n=== Leg 5 (Tunisia) ===\n\nAirdate: October 10, 2001\n\nTataouine (Monument to the Memory of the Earth) \n Tataouine Governorate (Ksar Hadada or Ksar Ouled Soltane)\nJebil National Park (Ksar Ghilane \u2013 Camel Outpost) \nJebil National Park (Ksar Ghilane \u2013 Oasis) This leg's Detour was a choice between Listening or Puzzling. In Listening, teams had to find the well-known Star Wars movie set Ksar Hadada and use a supplied walkie talkie and their sense of hearing to locate the radio's counterpart, hidden somewhere in the labyrinth of caves with their next clue. In Puzzling, teams had to find Ksar Ouled Soltane, a hard-to-find location, and solve a simple Tunisian dice game to receive their next clue.\nIn an unused Fast Forward, teams had to use a map that had an arrow pointing to a location to find a cave and take a picture of something inside.In this leg's Roadblock, one team member had to ride a camel and use a set of compass directions to reach the flag visible in the distance in the middle of the desert. Teams could hire a camel handler for US$50. The non-participating member had to trek alongside on foot. Once they reached the route marker, teams would find a new set of compass directions to the next Pit Stop, the Ksar Ghilane oasis.\n\nAdditional tasksAt the start of the leg, teams received an enclosed photograph of a globe monument, the Monument to the Memory of the Earth, and instructions to travel to Tataouine for their next clue.\nAfter the Detour, teams had use a map, a compass, and a series of painted yellow stones to find an arrow located approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) north of Guermessa that would direct them along a path of several arrows across the Sahara to their next clue at Ksar Ghilane.Additional noteAlong with their Detour clue, teams found cars that would serve as their transportation for the rest of the leg and could hire a driver for US$50, but drivers could not provide directions so all teams had to navigate using a simple provided map.\n\n\n=== Leg 6 (Tunisia \u2192 Italy) ===\n\nAirdate: October 17, 2001\n\nGab\u00e8s (Avenue Habib Bourguiba)\nLa Marsa (Hotel Le Palace)\n Tunis (Tunis\u2013Carthage International Airport) to Rome, Italy  (Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport)\n Rome (Magistral Villa)\nRome (Colosseum)\n Rome (Palazzo dei Conservatori or Altare della Patria)\n Rome (Roma Termini Railway Station) to Castelfranco Emilia (Castelfranco Emilia Railway Station (in Italian))\nSan Cesario sul Panaro (Pagani Auto Factory) \nSant'Agata Bolognese (Town Square) This leg's Detour was a choice between Foot or Hoof. In Foot, teams had to find a large, well-known statue of a foot at Palazzo dei Conservatori, using a provided picture that contained the entire statue, to find their next clue. In Hoof, teams were given a partial picture of another, more obscure statue depicting the hoof at the equestrian statue of Vittorio Emanuele II to find their next clue. However, if teams completed this task, they would find a line of taxis waiting for them.\nThere was a Fast Forward, which went unused and was unaired, saying that \"This is a key that you can see the arms of St. Peter\", as said by Team Guido in the DVD commentary. It refers to a keyhole on a door in Magistral Villa that, when looked through, provided a view of the entire Vatican City.In this Roadblock, one team member had to drive a Smart car to the town square of Sant'Agata Bolognese, the leg's Pit Stop, using a map written entirely in Italian. The other team member received a free ride to the Pit Stop in a Pagani Zonda traveling at 180 miles per hour (290 km/h).\n\nAdditional tasksAt the start of the leg, teams had to travel to the Hotel Le Palace near Tunis for their next clue.\nAfter the Detour, teams had to travel by train to Castelfranco Emilia via Bologna and then take a cab to the Pagani Auto Factory to find their next clue.Additional notesDuring the Pit Stop, word of a sandstorm in the Sahara forced the teams to move as a safety precaution to Gab\u00e8s to start the leg.\nDue to an airport strike in Rome, all flights to Rome were fully booked or canceled. As a result, teams faced an option of flying to Europe and taking a connecting flight or train to Rome or risk waiting in Tunis for when direct evening flights to Rome could become available.\n\n\n=== Leg 7 (Italy \u2192 India) ===\n\nAirdate: October 24, 2001\n\n Ferrara (Castello Estense) Ferrara (Aeroclub Volovelistico Ferrarese or Bike Shop)\n Ferrara (Ferrara Railway Station) to Fiumicino (Fiumicino Aeroporto Railway Station) or Varese (Malpensa Aeroporto Terminal 1 Railway Station)\n Rome (Leonardo da Vinci International Airport) or Milan (Milan Malpensa Airport) to Delhi, India  (Indira Gandhi International Airport)\nDelhi (Red Fort)\n  Delhi (Chandni Chowk)\nAgra (Taj Khema Hotel) For the Fast Forward, one team had to find Castello Estense in the town of Ferrara and row a boat through the moat around the castle to find the Fast Forward pass hidden in the wall.\nThe Detour was a choice between Glide or Ride.

The show was further hindered by the lack of media coverage and promotion as networks focused on news stories and more patriotic programming. Additionally, the show premiered and competed in the same time slot as with NBC's short-lived Lost, another reality show with a similar premise. The show did just well enough to earn a second season, which aired the following spring.\n\n\n== Ratings ==\n\n\n=== U.S. Nielsen ratings ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nThe Amazing Race: The First Season.

        "wiki": "Tunisian culture is very diverseTunisian culture is a product of more than three thousand years of history and an important multi-ethnic influx. Ancient Tunisia was a major civilization crossing through history; different cultures, civilizations and multiple successive dynasties contributed to the culture of the country over centuries with a varying degrees of influence. Among these cultures were the Carthaginian \u2013 their native civilization, Roman (Roman Africans), Vandal, Jewish, Christian, Arab, Islamic, Turkish, Europeans, and French, in addition to native Amazigh. This unique mixture of cultures made Tunisia, with its strategic geographical location in the Mediterranean, the core of some great civilizations of Mare Nostrum.\nThe history of Tunisia reveals this rich past where different successive Mediterranean cultures had a strong presence. After the Carthaginian Republic, the Roman Empire came and left a lasting effect on the land with various monuments and cities such the El-Jem Amphitheater and the archaeological site of the ancient city of Carthage, which is classified as a world heritage site. El Jem is just one of seven world heritage sites found in Tunisia.\nAfter a few centuries of the presence of Christianity, represented by the Church of Africa, the Arab Islamic conquest transformed the whole country and founded a new city called Al-Qayrawan, Al-Qayrawan is a renowned center for religious and intellectual pursuits.\n\nWith the annexation of Tunisia by the Ottoman Empire, the center of power shifted from Tunis to Istanbul. This shift in power allowed the local government of the new Ottoman Province to gain more independence, which was maintained until the institution of the French Protectorate (which was later seen as occupation). The protectorate introduced elements of Western \u2013 French \u2013 culture.\nThe important elements of Tunisian culture are diverse and represent a unique, mixed heritage. This heritage can be experienced first-hand in: museums such as the Bardo Museum, the contrast and diversity of city architecture such as Sidi Bou Said or the medina of Tunis, cuisine such as cheeses and French croissants, music reflecting Andalusian and Ottoman influences, literature, cinema, religion, the arts, and sports and other areas of Tunisian culture.\n\n\n== Cultural diversity ==\n\nThe Encyclop\u00e9die 360 describes Tunisia as a country that \"did not develop truly original art\" but is \"strongly marked by various influences and is engrained with monuments which illustrate the various stages of its history \". In his thesis study on Cultural Policy in Tunisia, Rafik Said has mused that, \"this relatively small area has produced estates, overlapping of cultures, and a confrontation of morals and doctrines throughout its history. Janice Rhodes Deledalle has referred to Tunisia as \"cosmopolitan\" and has said that \"Tunisia cannot be considered in the category of as other colonies\", because of the diversity of cultures embedded in Tunisia's heritage throughout the ages.Tunisia's cultural life dates to prehistoric times, as illustrated by dolmens near Bou Salem and rock carvings of the Tunisian Sahara. The Herma\u00efon of El Guettar, discovered near the city of El Guettar in the south, is the oldest extant religious display discovered.\nThe dawning era of Tunisian cultural history was shaped by Carthaginian influences including Phoenician, Greek. There is much evidence of Phoenician and western artwork and glass work found in Punic tombs, notably in masks which the Phoenician used to drive out evil spirits or demons of death with their decorations, such as the lotus motifs found on many objects or in the artistic design buildings. The paintings and sculptures of the lids of sarcophagi from the necropolis of Carthage and El Alia, the architecture of the mausoleum of Dougga are characterized by the combined influence of Greece and Egypt. In addition, we find a trace of Hellenic influences overlapping Roman and Punic culture. In sculpture found in Tunisia, there has been a distinct, almost symbolic evolution towards a style which is a representative, idealized perfection of a body, state, etc. Greek pottery is also emulated, and it is a fact that potters from Greece were employed to produce objects in Carthage.\n\nThe works of Roman Tunisia do not differ greatly from those of Europe. Among those handed down to us are Thuburbo Majus, Gigthis, the amphitheater of El Jem, the capital of Dougga, the Baths of Antoninus at Carthage and the Triumphal Arch of Caracalla. Subsequently, when Christianity was founded in Carthage, numerous monuments were erected. The Church in Africa, having been illustrated with famous martyrs such as St. Cyprian of Carthage or bishops as Saint Augustin d'Hippone, grew quickly in prestige. Many Christian monuments are erected including the catacombs of Sousse or the Makthar baptistery. Basilicas in multiple aisles, like St. Cyprian, were built based on the Syrian influences. However, the Church suffered persecution under a long reign of the Vandals who confiscated some of its properties. The arrival of the Byzantines lead to the disappearance of the latter and the restoration of a dense network of Orthodox bishops. During this period, many hills were crowned with Byzantine fortifications, such as in K\u00e9libia.\n\nWith the Arab conquest, specifically during the reign of the dynasty Aghlabids, Kairouan became a renowned intellectual center, attracting many scholars. It played an important role in translation and research, particularly in the dissemination of medical science knowledge. In mathematics, contributions to computational algorithms were also made in Kairouan. The Arabs then erected buildings specific to Islamic architecture. While some retain a Byzantine essence, such as Three Doors Mosque in Kairouan (built in the ninth century) or ribat Sousse, many of the ancient columns are purely Arab such as the great Zitouna Mosque of Tunis (ninth century), the Great Mosque of Mahdia and the Great Mosque of Kairouan.In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, poets, scholars, historians increased in number in Tunisia. Zitouna Mosque, in the medina of Tunis housed the first Islamic university, and replaced Kairouan as an active center of intellectuals that included doctors and scholars, such as Ibn Za\u00eftoun, Ibn Al Abhar, Ibn Al Gafsi and Ibn Arafa. Thanks to scholars like Ibn Khaldun and writers such as Aboul-Qacem Echebbi, Tunisia for centuries became a major cultural center in the Arab-Muslim world and Mediterranean.During the Turkish conquest in the sixteenth century, mosques, such as that of Sidi Mahrez Mosque in Tunis were erected in a manner to those in Constantinople, although the Zaouias generally retain their north African style in Kairouan.The French protectorate in turn left its mark on local architecture by adding a new urban style that can be found in the construction of a new city plan juxtaposed against the old medina of Tunis. Heavily influenced by Paris, with the Avenue Bourguiba, the style is known as \"Rococo Tunisian \".\nThe Tunisian revolution brought about important changes to the intersection of art and politics in post-2011 Tunisia.\n\n\n== Nation ==\ntunisia is a diverse country the arabs make up about 50% of population the berber make up about 25% turks and european about 20% and black african about 5%. \nThe most spoken language is Tunisian Arabic. Other  languages include French and Berber. Mediterranean Lingua Franca and Sened are languages that are not spoken anymore. National identity is strong and Tunisian efforts to create a national culture have proved stronger than in the nineteenth century. National culture and heritage is constantly referred to with reference to the country's modern history, in particular, the fight against the French protectorate and the construction of the modern state that followed from the 1950s. This is celebrated through national holidays, in the names of streets recalling historical figures or key dates or the subject of films or documentaries. With the start of the rule of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali on November 7, 1987, the official reference to the figure 7 and the theme of \"Change\" contributes to the perpetuation of that tradition.\n\n\n=== Flag ===\n\nThe national flag of Tunisia is predominantly red and consists of a white circle in the middle containing a red crescent around a five-pointed star. The Bey of Tunis Al-Husayn II ibn Mahmud decided to create the flag after the Battle of Navarino on October 20, 1827, which was adopted in 1831 or 1835. It remained the country's official flag during its time as a French protectorate, and was confirmed as the national flag of the Republic of Tunisia with the signing of the Constitution of Tunisia on June 1, 1959. It was not until June 30, 1999 that its proportions and design were clearly specified in law.\nThe crescent and star recalls the Ottoman flag and is therefore an indication of Tunisia's history as a part of the Ottoman Empire. It differs from the Turkish flag, however, in the color of the crescent and the position of the star and circle. The crescent is white on the Turkish flag, but red on the Tunisian flag. On the Turkish flag, the star is off-centered, while on the Tunisian flag, the star and circle is located in the center of the flag.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nAs for the national coat of arms, they are officially adopted in 1861 and include revised versions on June 21, 1956 and May 30, 1963. The top has a Carthaginian galley sailing on the sea while the lower part is divided vertically and on the right depicts a black lion seizing a silver scimitar. A banner bears the national motto: \"Liberty, Order, Justice\".\n\n\n=== Jasmine ===\n\nImported by the Andalusians in the sixteenth century, jasmine has become the national flower of Tunisia. The gathering takes place at dawn and then, upon nightfall, when young boys collect small bouquets, and later sell them to passersby on the street or to motorists stopped at intersections.Furthermore, jasmine is the subject of a specific sign language. A man who wears jasmine on his left ear indicates that he is single and in addition, offering white jasmine is seen as a proof of love while on the contrary, offering odorless winter jasmine is a sign of insolence.\n\n\n=== Hamsa ===\n\nThe hamsa (Tunisian Arabic: \u062e\u0645\u0633\u0629\u200e, also romanized khamsa), is a palm-shaped amulet popular in Tunisia and more generally in the Maghreb and commonly used in jewelry and wall hangings. Depicting the open right hand, an image recognized and used as a sign of protection in many times throughout history, the hamsa is believed to provide defense against the evil eye. It has been theorized that its origins lie in Carthage (modern-day Tunisia) and may have been associated with the Goddess Tanit.\n\n\n=== Sign of Tanit ===\n\nThe sign of Tanit is an anthropomorph symbol present on many archaeological remains of the Punic Civilization. Both the symbol and the name of the goddess Tanit, are still frequently used within Tunisian culture such as with the tradition of Omek Tannou or the grand film prize of the Tanit d'or. Some scholars also relate the name of the capital Tunis and by extant the one of the modern country and its people to the Phoenician goddess Tanith ('Tanit or Tanut), as many ancient cities were named after patron deities.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\nThe Tunisian Constitution provides freedom of thoughts and beliefs, as well as the free exercise of religion, as long as it does not affect public order. The government generally respects this right but do not allow the establishment of political parties based on religion. Muslim religious holidays such as Eid el-Adha, Eid el-Fitr or Mouled are considered national holidays. The government also recognizes the sanctity of religious holidays for non-Muslims, particularly those of the monotheistic religions.\n\nIslam is the main official religion of Tunisia with a rate of around 70% of the population. 99% of Tunisians are Sunni Muslims of the Maliki rite, the rest being attached to the Hanafi cult. There is also a small community of Muslim Sufis but there are no statistics regarding its size. The country is also dotted with small white mausoleums scattered in rural and urban areas and called marabouts. These tombs of saints, often male, are usually housed in places such as caves, hills, springs or points on the coast. Through meditation, these characters were supposed to heal the sick and blind. Their graves are still key to the relationship between the human and the divine in the context of festivals bringing together members of a particular community (a village, or extended family or tribe). Today, the Tunisians continue to pray and to ask them for favors.\n\nIn the 1970s, an Islamist movement, based on close adherence to the Koran and other sacred texts, opposed to some unorthodox practices developed and reached its climax with the formation of a political movement, the Ennahda (Renaissance) in the 1980s. Most of their leaders were arrested or exiled during the 1990s.\nRoman Catholics, Jews, Greek Orthodox, and Protestants are some others. These religious groups are promised their rights of practicing their religion by Tunisian government. The country is characterized by its tolerance and openness to other cultures. For instance, the teaching of Islam is compulsory in public schools but the program of religious studies at the secondary level also includes the history of Judaism and Christianity. The Tunisians also retain some native beliefs of Berber origin such as the evil eye. A number of practices, such as shutters painted blue are also used to repel evil spirits.\n\n\n== Languages ==\n\nTunisia is homogeneous in terms of language, since nearly all of the population masters French and Arabic (the state Official language) and speaks Tunisian Arabic which is the mother-tongue of almost all Tunisians. Tunisian Arabic is actually a dialect \u2013 or more accurately a set of dialects, for which there is no official body of standards. It is established on a berber and punic substratum, influenced by the languages of the people that lived or administered the region, during the course of history, including: Arabic, Turkish, Italian, Spanish and French. Tunisian Arabic is not understood by most Arab speaking countries as it does derive from a mixture of a few languages. Tunisian is spoken mostly in the context of a daily dialogue between Tunisians and within the family. The chelha, meanwhile, is spoken by less than 1% of the population, mainly in the semi-Berber villages of the south, including Chenini, Douiret, Matmata, Tamezrett, etc., and in some villages of the island of Djerba, mainly Guellala/Iquallalen, Ajim, Sedouikech / Azdyuch and Ouirsighen / At Ursighen.\n\nDuring the French protectorate in Tunisia, the French introduced many institutions, especially in education. These became a strong vehicle for dissemination of the French language, which quickly became a marker of social advancement and openness to more modern and liberal values.\nFrom independence, the country gradually became Arabized even if the administration, justice and education had long been bilingual, while the knowledge of European languages had been enhanced by exposure of Tunisia to the continent through television. Visas were introduced by the French minister Charles Pasqua in 1986 for population movements between Tunisia and France. Beginning in October 1999, commercial establishments were forced to give twice the space for Arabic characters as Latin characters. At the same time, the administration of Tunisia was forced to communicate only in Arabic, although only the departments of Defense and Justice and the legislature are actually fully Arabized. Like many other documents produced by the administration, the Official Journal of the Republic of Tunisia, which enacts laws and decrees, is written in Arabic but is translated in French, although this version has no legal value and can not be considered official. In this context, the use of French seemed to be on the decline despite the increased number of graduates of the educational system, which leads to the fact that much of French remains an important social indicator. Since it is widely practiced in the business, the medical world and cultural world, we can even consider that it has gentrified.Kindergarten and the first three grades of school are taught entirely in Arabic; thereafter, the second cycle of primary and secondary education is half Arabic and half French. English was also taught from the age of 15 from 1970, from the age of 10 from 1994, from the age of 14 from 1997, and from the age of 12 in 2000.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Development of education ===\n\nThere was, until the nineteenth century, no modern state education in Tunisia. There was actually a score of European schools run by religious institutions while traditional learning was taught in the Zaytuna mosque and the kouttab, particularly the religious sciences studied from commentaries on the Qur'an and Sunnah.\nThe first educational institution of modern Tunisia was the Sadiki College, founded in 1875 by the Grand Vizier Pasha Kheireddine, followed by the Khaldounia School in 1896. In 1956, after independence, began a policy of education reform that was characterized by the unity, the nationalization and the Arabization of the education system. In this context, Habib Bourguiba said in 1958: \"Living on the margins of institutions and harassing the protectorate system for recognition of our rights, I told myself that if the government passed into our hands, we'd address primarily the problem of education.\" This \"problem\" was so vast that the state gave priority to national education and culture from then on. This is one reason why the Tunisian government specifically created a body dedicated to culture, then called \"Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Information\". The second reason was the need to separate culture and education, the latter no longer the only means of transmitting culture. The third reason was the responsibility to the nation.In 1966, as part of increasing political literacy of the workforce, the Institute of Adult Education became responsible for making some 150,000 people literate in a period of five years. It conducted these activities mainly in the productive sectors \u2013 agricultural cooperatives, factories, mines and large companies \u2013 but also in the craft centres, army, prisons and youth centres. The lessons of this institute include, in addition to reading, writing and arithmetic lessons, geography, history, civics, law, and social and religious education. There are also opportunities provided to take additional courses of vocational training. The length of the main course is two years with five sessions of one hour and a half per day, a total of 450 hours, culminating with a certificate of social education. A third year bilingual course was created in 1968 for those wishing to continue their studies. Some 1,090 people attended this course during the 1968\u20131969 school year, resulting in the institute being awarded the Mohammad Reza Pahlavi Prize during the third International Day of Literacy, on September 8, 1969, \"for decisive contribution to the launch and implementation of a national adult literacy in which is developed, tested and has implemented an effective methodology for literacy and education \".On December 31, 1966, there were 21 public libraries for children and independent public libraries for adults, the former run by women. Mobile teachers and librarians were employed to ensure the promotion of culture in rural areas, and some 52 centers of literature were established with the purpose of loaning books for home study. This measure was aimed at increasing the development of reading habits into the customs of the Tunisian people.\n\n\n=== Educational system ===\nThe non-compulsory preschool education, which is for children 3 to 6 years of age, is provided in kindergartens. Basic education is compulsory and free, from 6 to 16 years, and is divided into two cycles: primary school for the first six years, followed by college for another three years. This course is sanctioned by a diploma of graduation from basic education to enable graduates to access secondary education (always free) taught in high schools for four years after the 1995 reform. Students are then directed to a second cycle of three years with five subjects (letters, science, technology, computer science and economics and management) and sanctioned by the BA for access to higher education. Tunisia has twelve universities \u2013 five in Tunis, one in Sousse, one in Sfax, one at Kairouan, one in Gab\u00e8s, one in Gafsa, one in Monastir and one in Jendouba \u2013 but it also has 178 other institutions, including 24 colleges for Technology Studies (ISET) and six higher institutes of teacher training (ISFM).\nThere are two secondary schools in Tunisia run by the French government: the Lyc\u00e9e Pierre Mendes-France and the Lyc\u00e9e Gustave Flaubert. These apply methods and programs similar to those in France. There is also the American Cooperative School of Tunis, the International School of Carthage, the British International School of Tunis and the Tunis International School. New updates to the educational curriculum have been implemented during the last 20 years, so that it is now qualified to be an international system. 80% of Tunisians hold some kind of degree, almost 66% holding a bachelor's. The penetration rate of education among Tunisian is 87%. Attendance remains strong despite high tuition fees (from 1.400 to 1.800 dinars per year in the cycle). Originally intended to educate the children of expatriates and a Francophile elite, they now attract a majority of Tunisians (over 60% of the 3,000 students today); the Tunisian bourgeoisie, in particular,  are attracted by the multicultural courses and the possibility of pursuing higher studies in France. As a result, the Paris Dauphine University is considering opening an office in Tunisia in 2009 to accommodate 1,000 students.Vocational training is provided by a group of public operators which include the Tunisian Agency for Vocational Training, which provides instructional supervision of all public and private operators. The diplomas issued after an initial training are given at three levels: the certificate of vocational aptitude (CAP) which is a course lasting a minimum of one year after basic education, certification as professional engineer (construction) which is a course lasting a minimum of one year after the first cycle of secondary education after obtaining a CPC, and a higher technical certificate (BTP) from a course lasting a minimum of two years after the baccalaureate or after obtaining the construction certificate.In 2001, 19.9% of the Tunisian national budget was spent on education. In 2005, the literacy rate was 76.2%, and the enrollment of children 12 to 17 years was 66% among both boys and girls. Access to higher education is 27% of the age group it concerns.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe Bardo National Museum is one of the largest institutions of its kind in the Mediterranean, consisting of archaeological treasures from over several millennia by many cultures. The museum officially opened on May 7, 1888, and offers one of the finest and largest collections of mosaics of ancient Rome. The Archaeological Museum of Sousse, founded in 1951, has the second largest collection of mosaics after the Bardo. The Oceanographic Museum of Salammbo, with its 11 rooms, is the main Tunisian museum dedicated to the sea. The National Museum of Islamic Art in Tunisia has several collections of pottery, pieces of Korans and calligraphy dating from when Raqqada occupied the Aghlabids capital, from the 9th century.\nIn the 1970s, a program was implemented in cooperation with UNESCO. It provides four types of museum: museums synthesis, regional museums, local museums and specialized museums. The Bardo Museum is a good example of museum synthesis since this type of museum is expected to house objects from all periods of the history of Tunisia without taking into account the origin of these.\n\nThe existence of these museums is justified by the fact that they illustrate the evolution of artistic creation over the civilizations. Regional museums are limited to chief towns and governorates, specializing in the history of each region. As for local museums, they are part of a policy of decentralization of culture to participate through museum education of the masses by encouraigng more and more people to visit the museums. Some local museums exist in Makthar, Utica, Carthage and Monastir. Finally, specialized museums themselves can be divided into two other categories of museums: the museums dedicated to a historical period and museums specializing in a given subject. In the first category, there is already the Dar Hussein museum, entirely devoted to the medieval Tunisia. In the second category, two projects were selected: the mosaic museum and a Paleo-Christian museum. The mosaic museum is fully justified by the richness of Tunisia in art museums and provides an evolution both thematically and chronologically on the subject. As for the Paleo-Christian Museum, it is now located in Carthage.Other specialized museums are also considered as museums of culture and science museums. These are used to trace the history and evolution of technology.\n\n\n== Arts ==\nMost of the country's older art came from the influences of China, Spain, Persia and the Near East forming the style known as Arabesque. Tunisian artists are known for their mosaics and pottery. Their mosaics use a variety of colors in repetitive patterns to adorn walls and floors by depicting a story or person. Mosaics are often used in architecture by implementing the use of geometric shapes and accenting with gold. Though, the displays of some artwork can be seen on buildings and architecture, one could find many sources of art in one place in the Bardo Museum in Tunis.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nTunisian music is the result of a cultural mix. According to Mohammed Abdel Wahab, Tunisian music has also been influenced by old Andalusian songs injected with Turkish, Persian and Greek influences. He believes that the Tunisian music has undergone three phases of outside influences: the first from the East and whose center was in Mecca and Medina, the second coming from Muslim Spain which was the center of Andalusia and the last coming from the Ottoman Empire and whose center was Istanbul. The legacy of its three phases are illustrated respectively in the creation of Tunisian traditional music, the Malouf the introduction of the Nuba in Tunisian music, and finally the use of forms such as Turkish, Samai and Bashraf. Also influenced by Western culture, it is relatively diversified.\nOf major note in Tunisian classical music is the Malouf. Deriving from the reign of the Aghlabids in the 15th century, it is a particular type of Arab-Andalusian music. In urban areas it uses stringed instruments (fiddle, oud and Kanun) and percussion (darbuka) while in rural areas, it may also be accompanied by instruments like the mezoued, gasba and the zurna.At the beginning of the twentieth century, musical activity was dominated by the liturgical repertoire associated with different religious brotherhoods and secular repertoire which consisted of instrumental pieces and songs in different Andalusian forms and styles of origins, essentially borrowing characteristics of musical language. In 1930 The Rachidia was founded well known thanks to artists from the Jewish community. The founding in 1934 of a musical school help revive Arab Andalusian music largely to a social and cultural revival led by the elite of the time who became aware of the risks of loss of the musical heritage and which they believed threatened the foundations of Tunisian national identity. The institution did not take long to assemble an elite group of musicians and poets and scholars. The creation of Radio Tunis in 1938 allowed musicians are greater opportunity to disseminate their works.\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s witnessed the emergence of composers and performers working mostly in the orchestra of the Tunisian Radio and Television. Song using melodies and popular rhythms experienced a significant rise. From the 1980s, the music scene saw the emergence of a generation of musicians, composers and performers of Arab and Western musical training who believed that Tunisian music needed new song writing techniques. The emergence of new patterns of racial and improvised music since the late 1990s changed the musical landscape of Tunisia. At the same time, the majority of the population is attracted by the music of Arab origin (Egyptian, Lebanese or Syrian). Popular western music has also had major success with the emergence of many groups and festivals, including rock music, hip hop, reggae and jazz.\nAmong the major Tunisian contemporary artists include Hedi Habbouba, Saber Reba\u00ef, Dhafer Youssef, Belgacem Bouguenna, Sonia M'barek and Latifa. Other notable musicians include Salah El Mahdi, Anouar Brahem, Zied Gharsa and Lotfi Bouchnak.\n\n\n=== Cinema ===\n\nTunisian cinema is today recognized as one of the most liberal, inventive, and prize-winning cinemas of the Arab world. Beginning in the 1990s, Tunisia became an attractive place for filming, and numerous successful companies have emerged serving the foreign film industry.Cinema has been present in Tunisia since its first world appearance. Starting from 1896, the Lumi\u00e8re brothers were showing animated films in the streets of Tunis. In 1919, the first feature-length movie produced on the African continent, Les Cinq gentlemen maudits (The Five Accursed Gentlemen), was filmed in Tunisia. In 1924, Zohra directed a medium-length film called Ain Al-Ghazal (The Girl from Carthage), making him one of the first native filmmakers on the African continent. In 1966, the first feature Tunisian film, Al-Fajr (The Dawn), was directed and produced by Omar Khlifi; it was 95 minutes long, shot on 35 mm film. Tunisia also hosts the Carthage Film Festival which has been taking place since 1966. The festival, which gives priority to films from Arab and African countries, is the oldest film festival on the African continent and the Arab World.In 1927, the first Tunisian film distribution company, Tunis-Film, started its activities. After independence, movies were exclusively produced by SATPEC (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Tunisienne de Production et d'Expansion Cin\u00e9matographique), which controlled cinema and filming productions in the country at the time. Nevertheless, during the 1980s, private production companies and studios emerged and wanted to make Tunisia the Mediterranean Hollywood. The producer Tarak Ben Ammar, a nephew of Wasila Bourguiba, succeeded in attracting some big production companies to shoot in his studios in Monastir. Major foreign movies were filmed in Tunisia, including Roman Polanski's Pirates and Franco Zeffirelli's Jesus of Nazareth. After visiting Tunisia, George Lucas was seduced by the natural beauty and authentic old architecture of some southern Tunisian towns, where he decided to film the important Tatooine scenes of Star Wars, as well as Indiana Jones. Moreover, Anthony Minghella filmed the nine Academy Awards winner The English Patient in a southwestern oasis of the country.\nDomestic Tunisian productions were rare. The few movies which were produced since 1967 tried to reflect the new social dynamics, development, identity research and modernity shock. Some of them achieved relative success outside Tunisia, including La Goulette (Halq El-Wadi, 1996). Directed by Ferid Boughedir, La Goulette showed a flashback of typical community life in the eponymous small suburb, during a period when Muslims, Jews and Christians lived together in tolerance and peace. Boughedir's Halfaouine: Child of the Terraces (Asfour Stah, 1990) is possibly the biggest popular success in the history of Tunisian cinema; it showed the life of a child from the Halfouine suburb of Tunis in the 1960s, and his quest to understand relationships, the world of women and how to be a man.\nIn earlier films, including Man of Ashes (Rih Essedd, 1986), director and writer Nouri Bouzid depicts controversial issues in Tunisian society, addressing social issues like prostitution, pedophilia and inter-faith relations between Tunisian Muslims and Tunisian Jews. In the 1991 film Bezness, he explores the country's emerging sexual tourism trade.\nThe Ambassadors (As-Soufraa, 1975), directed by Naceur Ktari, portrayed the life of immigrant Maghrebins in France and their struggle against racism. The film won the Golden Tanit for the best picture in the Carthage Film Festival in 1976 and the special jury award from the Locarno International Film Festival in the same year, and was classified in the Un Certain Regard category during the 1978 Cannes Film Festival.\nThe first feature film ever to be directed by a woman in the Arab World was The Silences of Palace (Samt Al-Qusur, 1994). The director, Moufida Tlatli, won several international jury awards for her work. The movie shows the daily life in an aristocratic palace in Tunis through the eyes of a young woman.\nIn 2007, several films were produced and grabbed public attention, such as Nouri Bouzid's Making Of and Nejib Belkadi's VHS Kahloucha.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nThe Tunisian theater was mostly developed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, during the French protectorate. Theaters grew up, such as the French Theater, Politeama Rossini, Arena, Theater Tunisia, the Gringa, Paradiso, etc. Some wooden theaters have since been destroyed by fire, while others have simply changed their function; only one is still in use as a theater, the Municipal Theater of Tunis. In over a century of existence, the theater has hosted big names of the Tunisian and international theatrical scene, such as Sarah Bernhardt, Pauline Carton, G\u00e9rard Philipe and Jean Marais. On November 7, 1962, the Tunisian president Habib Bourguiba (whose brother, Mohamed Bourguiba, was a playwright), devoted his speech to theater, which he considers \"a powerful means of disseminating culture and a most effective means of popular education\". From this date, November 7 is regarded as the Tunisian National Day of drama.\n\nIn 1970, under the leadership of the actor Aly Ben Ayed, Caligula by Albert Camus was translated into Arabic, to great popular success. Other works written by Habib Boular\u00e8s, such as Murad III or The Time of Buraq, retained the themes of bloody violence. Increasingly, more and more shows are restricted for the benefit of a more sophisticated audience. The New Theater of Tunis grew up with Mohamed Driss as one of the most prolific authors. In 1988, Driss was appointed head of the Tunisian National Theater (TNT), and took charge of renovating a neglected theatre, Le Paris, located in the heart of Tunis. He acquired a stage, employed a team of modern architects to rebuild it, and renamed it the \"Fourth Art\". Opened in 1996, it alternates between cycles of TNT theater and ballet, circus and song. Each cultural season lasts from October 1 to June 30; the theatre has hosted more than 80 theatrical performances.In addition to the activities in Tunis other large cities had professional theater groups, most notably Sfax, which boasted of a modern theater venue built post World War II. Many hit plays were produced by the theater group of Sfax in the 1960s and 1970s featuring one of their leading actors at the time, Habib Laroussi, who also played in many national and international TV movies and TV series. Two of the hit plays of the 1960s were \"Rabeh Zmim El Houma\" (Rabeh the neighborhood leader) directed by Jamil El Joudi and starred by Habib Laroussi, and \"Hares El Mahattah\" (The train station attendant) directed by Jamil El Joudi and starred by Mohieddin and Habib Laroussi. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s Laroussi collaborated heavily with Jamil El Joudi and the prominent Sfaxien playwright Ameur Tounsi, who discovered and mentored Laroussi in the early 1950s. Tounsi wrote several hit plays that were broadcast by radio Sfax, such as \"Intikam El Zaman\" (revenge of time)starred by Laroussi and other actors from the Sfax theater community.\nEl Teatro is the first private theatre in Tunisia. Founded in 1987 by Taoufik Jebali, in a wing of the hotel El Mechtel Tunis, El Teatro consists of the main hall of representatives with some 200 seats, an annex called the Carr\u00e9 d'Art, and a gallery called Free Area. El Teatro is directed by Zeineb Farhat. Throughout the year, El Teatro offers theater, dance performances, jazz concerts, galas of Arabic music, art exhibitions and poetry readings.\n\n\n=== Dance ===\n\nDancing in Tunisia is characterized by the multitude of forms it takes and contexts in which it appears, including circumcisions, weddings, festivals, concerts, and football games. Tunisian dance resembles Egyptian dance, and is distinguished mainly by its dynamic, which is faster with more staccato, and its multitude of forms, each region having its own \"style\". It is therefore difficult to speak of a Tunisian dance, especially since the Egyptian influence appears to have long proven itself in major cities.The variety of dances performed by the Tunisians probably reflects the migration flows that have traversed the country throughout the centuries. The early Phoenicians brought with them their songs and dances, whose traces can still be seen in Tunisian dance; on the other hand, the Roman occupation had little influence on Tunisian dance, especially compared to its significant architectural legacy. The arrival of the Banu Hilal in the eleventh century completed the implementation of the Arab Maghreb in Tunisia, introducing the traditions, music and dance of the nomads of Upper Egypt. Religious dances were influenced by Sufism, but by the end of the 15th century they were increasingly subject to the influence of Andalusian dance and urban music. The time at which Oriental dance arrived in Tunisia is disputed: it is generally believed to have arrived at a later date with the Ottomans, but some experts in the history of North African art have said it was brought to Tunisia by the first Turkish corsairs in the sixteenth century, and others claim that it originated even earlier, founded by the early Phoenicians during the era of matriarchy in Mesopotamia. Characteristic features of oriental dance as performed in Tunisia include the rhythmic movements of the pelvis, movement highlighted by the elevation of the arms to horizontal, and feet moving in rhythm and transferring weight onto the right or left leg.The dance reflects a social phenomenon born in the working classes of Tunisian cities. The male dance is typically accompanied by love songs which evoke libertine seduction, attraction and the carnal pleasures of life; it has long been performed in cafes backed by music, typically the darbuka and mezoued. Since the 1970s, however, the dance has declined in cafes and is more often displayed at festivals, circumcision ceremonies, and weddings in big cities.\n\nThe Nuba, more rooted in popular practice, is linked to the dancers, and to a lesser extent the Kerkennah Djerba. Some experts say that the associated dress is of Greek origin. The dance, which is structured into several scenes, is often accompanied by acrobatic games involving jars of water.The most common religious dance is probably the Stambali, which originated as a ritual dance to glorify Sidi Saad, a devout Sudanese Muslim who arrived in Tunisia with his followers in the sixteenth century. Today his shrine is located in the Mornag region. However, in the aftermath of independence, the authorities have banned the ritual and closed many of the sanctuaries. While followers still continue their rituals at home, the dance has subsequently been adopted by the Jews and lost its connection to its Islamic origins.The National Troupe Folk Art Center and the National Dance of Ariana continue practice the traditional Tunisian dances. The national archives notably suffer from a lack of documents related to these dances, as well as to folk arts more broadly.\n\n\n=== Painting ===\n\nBecause of the Muslim prohibition on reproducing the human image, the ruling dynasties of Tunisia stifled pictorial art for centuries; painters therefore often turned to calligraphy. Painting as a Tunisian art form was not reborn until the French protectorate. Although at the beginning of the twentieth century galleries were reserved for European painters, native Tunisian artists such as Moses Levy and Yahia Turki were able to obtain permission to present their work.The birth of a Tunisian contemporary style of painting is strongly linked to the School of Tunis. Established in 1949 by a group of Tunisian artists headed by Pierre Boucherle and including Yahia Turki, Abdelaziz Gorgi, Moses Levy, Ammar Farhat and Jules Lellouche, it aimed to incorporate native themes and reject the influence of Orientalist colonial painting, bringing together French and Tunisian Muslims, Christians and Jews. Some members of the school have turned to the Arab-Muslim sources for inspiration, such as miniature Islamic architecture. The school includes both Expressionist painters such as Amara Debbache, Jellal Ben Abdallah and Ali Ben Salem, and abstract artists such as Edgar Naccache, Nello Levy and Hedi Turki.\n\nAfter independence in 1956, the art movement in Tunisia was propelled by the dynamics of nation building and by artists serving the state. A Ministry of Culture was established, under the leadership of ministers such as Habib Boular\u00e8s who saw art and education and power. Artists such as Hatem El Mekki and Zoubeir Turki gained international recognition and influenced a new generation of young painters. Sadok Gmech drew his inspiration from national wealth, while Moncef Ben Amor turned to fantasy. Youssef Rekik revived the technique of painting on glass and founded Nja Mahdaoui calligraphy with its mystical dimension.In the 1970s, a new wave of artists appeared, who were less homogeneous in their academic formation. Many of them had received an artistic education almost exclusively provided by Tunisian professors at the Tunis Institute of Fine Arts or at the National School of Architecture and Urbanism; such artists included Ali Zenaidi, Abdelmajid Ben Messaoud, Fethi Ben Zakour, Adel Megdiche, Noureddine El Hani, Raouf Gara, Brahim Azzabi, Mohamed Njeh, and Habib Bida.Mny European painters have also been influenced by Tunisia; most famous of these is the Franco-Russian Alexander Roubtzoff, often regarded as the \"painter of Tunisia\". He arrived in Tunis in 1914 through a grant from the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg, and subsequently settled permanently in Tunisia, producing some 3,000 paintings representing aspects of Tunisia before his death in 1949. Paul Klee and August Macke also visited Tunisia in 1914 and left a lasting impression. Macke is noted for his series of watercolors in the cubist style, while Klee is noted for his advocation of light and colors to illustrate the Tunisian landscape.\nThere are currently fifty art galleries housing exhibitions of Tunisian and international artists. These include Gallery Yahia in Tunis and the Carthage Essaadi gallery.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nTunisian literature exists in two forms: Arabic and French. Arabic literature dates back to the seventh century with the arrival of Arab civilization in the region. It is more significant in both volume and literary quality than French literature, introduced during the French protectorate from 1881.\nTunisian literary figures include Douagi Ali, who has produced more than 150 radio stories, over 500 poems and folk songs and nearly 15 plays; Khraief Bashir, an Arabic novelist who published many notable books in the 1930s, causing a scandal because the dialogues were written in Tunisian dialect; and others such as Moncef Ghachem, Mohamed Salah Ben Mrad and Mahmoud Messaadi. Tunisian poetry is characterized by nonconformity and innovation, such as that seen in the works of Aboul-Qacem Echebbi, while French Tunisian literature is most notable for its critical approach. Contrary to the pessimism of Albert Memmi, who predicted that Tunisian literature was sentenced to die young, many Tunisian writers have been successful traveling abroad, including Abdelwahab Meddeb, Bakri Tahar, Mustapha Tlili, Hele Beji and Mellah Fawzi. Their writing focuses on themes of wandering, exile and heartbreak.\nThe national bibliography lists 1249 non-school books published in 2002 in Tunisia, with 885 titles in Arabic. In 2006 this figure had increased to 1,500; in 2007, to 1,700. Nearly a third of these are children's books.\n\n\n== Publishing ==\n\nAt the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century, there was a close relationship between the bourgeois elite and business associations and the Khaldounia Alumni College Sadiki printing press. The French protectorate controlled the press, and affected the publication and dissemination of newspapers at a local level. After the First World War, Tunisian gradually moved into a better position, and during the inter-war years Arabic publishing began to flourish. Before Tunisian independence was proclaimed in 1956, the publication of Tunisian literature was provided by the booksellers, printers and a few publishing houses run by the private French press; subsequently, the state commanded the creation of a major new publishing structure, with the aim of establishing a modern national culture as part of its general culture and education targets. Thus, the state produced over 70% of the books between 1956 and 1987, leaving private publishing little opportunity to evolve.It was not until the early 1990s that the state abandoned its role in centralising publishing. Private publishing companies quickly sprang up in reaction; the editorial production between 1987 and 1996 amounted to 6,068 titles. Most of Tunisia's present book production comes from the private sector, with over a hundred publishers in operation. The budget devoted to literature by the Ministry of Culture in 2003 exceeded three million Tunisian dinars for the purchase of Tunisian and foreign books and periodicals. 2003 was proclaimed \"National Book Year\" in Tunisia, and celebrated with fairs, exhibitions, meetings for reflection and debate, and writing contests.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nTunisian television has long been controlled by the Establishment of the Broadcasting Authority Tunisia (ERTT) and its predecessor, the Tunisian Radio and Television, founded in 1957. On November 7, 2006, President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali announced the demerger of the business, which became effective on August 31, 2007. Until then, ERTT managed all public television stations (T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Tunisienne 1 and T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Tunisienne 2, which had replaced the defunct RTT 2), four national radio stations (Radio Tunis, Tunisia Radio Culture, Youth and Radio RTCI), and five regional (Sfax, Monastir, Gafsa, Le Kef and Tataouine). Most programs are in Arabic, with a minority in French. Since 2003, a growth in private sector broadcasting is underway, including the creation of Radio Mosaique FM, Jawhara FM, Zaytuna FM, Hannibal TV, and Nessma TV.\nIn 2007, some 245 newspapers and magazines (compared to only 91 in 1987) are 90% owned by private groups and independents. The Tunisian political parties have the right to publish their own newspapers, but those of the opposition parties (such as Al Mawkif or Mouwatinoun) have very limited editions. Freedom of the press is guaranteed by the constitution, but almost all newspapers following the government line report uncritically on the activities of the president, government and the Constitutional Democratic Rally Party (in power) through the Agence Tunis Afrique Presse.\n\n\n== Festivals ==\n\nHundreds of international festivals, national, regional or local punctuate the calendar year. Music and theatrical festivals dominate the national cultural scene.\nSeveral festivals take place annually in summer: the Carthage International Festival in July, the International Festival of Arts of Mahr from late July to early August, and the International Festival of Hammamet in July and August.\nThe Carthage Film Festival is held in October and November of every other year, alternating with the Carthage Theatre Festival. It was created in 1966 by the Tunisian Minister of Culture to showcase films from the Maghreb, Africa and the Middle East. In order to be eligible for the competition, a film must have a director of African or Middle Eastern nationality, and have been produced at least two years before entry. The grand prize is the Tanit d'or, or \"Golden Tanit,\" named for the lunar goddess of ancient Carthage; the award is in the shape of her symbol, a trapezium surmounted by a horizontal line and a circle.\nThe International Festival of the Sahara, celebrated annually at the end of December, honors the cultural traditions associated with the Tunisian desert. This attracts many tourists and musicians from all around the world, as well as horsemen who flaunt their saddles and local fabrics and skills.\nThere are also a number of musical festivals; some honor traditional Tunisian music, while others, including the Tabarka Jazz Festival, focus on other genres.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nIslamic architecture and Roman architecture are expressed in various facets in Tunisia. Through many buildings, Kairouan forms the epicenter of an architectural movement expressing the relationship between buildings and spirituality with the ornamental decoration of religious buildings in the holy city. In Djerba, the architecture such as the fortress of Kef reflects the military and spiritual destiny of a Sufi influence in the region.\n\nThe influential role of the various dynasties that ruled the country, particularly in building cities and princes of Raqqada Mahdia, illuminates the role of the geopolitical context in the architectural history of the country. Thus, many original fortresses that protected the coast from Byzantine invasions evolved into cities, like Monastir, Sousse or Lamta.\nThe medina of Tunis, is World Heritage Site of UNESCO, and is a typical example of Islamic architecture. However, in the areas between the ports of Bizerte and Ghar El Melh, settlements founded by the Moors fleeing Andalusia were reconquered by Catholic sovereigns and has more of a Christian influence.\n\nGiven the cosmopolitan nature of cities in Tunisia, they have retained a diversity and juxtaposition of styles. Many buildings were designed by many different architects, artisans and entrepreneurs during the French protectorate. Among the most famous architects of that time were Victor Valensi, Guy Raphael, Henri Saladin, Joss Ellenon and Jean-Emile Resplandy. Five distinct architectural and decorative styles are particularly popular: those of the eclectic style (neo-classical, baroque, etc..) Between 1881 and 1900 and then again until 1920 the style was neo-Mauresque, between 1925 and 1940 it was in the Art Deco style and then the modernist style between 1943 and 1947.In the south, the oasis of Gafsa, Tozeur and Nefta, and ksours and cave dwellings of Matmata are characterized by their response to the hostile environment arising from the heat and dryness of the desert or semi-desert.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Traditions ==\n\n\n=== Crafts ===\n\nTunisia is also known for its many craft products and many of the regions of Tunisia have different specialities and trades.\nTunisian pottery is mainly influenced by Guellala, a city behind the creation of other pottery centers on the coast of Tunisia, including Tunis, Nabeul, Moknine, etc. Yellow, green or brown enamel is the trademark of Nabeul for example. Shaping, baking and decoration of pottery however, remain primitive.The ironwork in Tunisia dates back to the Andalusian era when the studded ornamental wrought iron doors become a characteristic. Blue is the tradition with the window shutters, intended to beautify the homes and preserve the privacy of residents and ward off evil spirits. The grids recall the lattices of the Arab-Andalusian tradition, and carved wood panels, which enabled women to watch the street without being seen.\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, each region and often even each village had its own costume. Today, traditional dress is mostly reserved for only weddings and other national or native ceremonies. On a national level, the jebba has become traditional dress, a wide coat covering the whole body, which differs depending on the quality of its fabric, its colors and its trimmings. The men's slippers are usually the natural color of the leather, while women's are generally of embroidered silk, cotton, gold and silver with floral patterns. Although the workshops in each city and some villages produce textiles typical of the region such as Gabes, the quantity sold is low compared to centers such as Kairouan which is still the national center of carpet production. The kilim, an embroidered rug is a legacy of Ottoman rule in Tunisia.\nFinally, Tunisia has a rich tradition of mosaics dating back to ancient times. Punic mosaics were found at sites around Kerkouane or Byrsa hill at Carthage dating to Roman times, a mosacis with pictorial representation, combined with high quality marble, has been found, especially on the site of Chemtou.\n\n\n=== Traditional clothing ===\n\n\n==== Masculine clothing ====\n\nIn rural areas, the jebba is considered a ceremonial garment. White in summer and grey in winter, it is a sleeveless tunic that a man wears over a shirt, vest and baggy trousers (called seroual). On ordinary days, the men merely wear simple trousers and shirts, or/and a woollen tunic of a slimmer fit than the jebba and fitted with long sleeves. In winter, they wear a heavy wool cloak which is often hooded, or in the north a kachabiya, which differs from the latter by its brown and white stripes.In urban areas, the ceremonial dress consists of a linen shirt with collar and long sleeves. The seroual is adorned at the bottom of the legs with decorative pockets. A wide belt, cut from the same material keeps the seroual in shape. A jebba, a wool and silk full dress is worn in winter. The shoes, leather slippers, leave the heel exposed. Finally, the headdress is a chechia, a red felt hat which is sometimes adorned with a tassel of black thread. For a casual ceremony, during leisure hours, often just a jebba is worn.\n\n\n==== Feminine clothing ====\n\nWomen's clothing is much more diverse than that of men. In the towns, the vast majority of young women have adopted the European style but women of a certain age, even in urban areas, often wrap a sefseri, white veil of silk or fine wool that covers the head with a blouse and baggy pants. These figures of women wearing sefseri is engrained in the traditional culture of Tunisia as much as the blue and white houses of Sidi Bou Said. In rural areas, women still wear brightly colored dresses, often in the Berber style and made of blue or red cotton, representing their region or their village. The fabric is opened on the side and is held at the waist with a belt and at the shoulders by two clasps. Women of all ages typically wear a massive amount of jewelry with the clothing and it is common to see women with tens, even hundreds of gold sovereigns, necklaces and other trimmings around their necks and from the sides of the headdress.\n\nThe festive ceremonial costumes differ somewhat across regions. In the Sahel, the centerpiece of the ceremonial dress is a dress draped in wool or cotton, drawn to a bodice embroidered with silk and silver, a velvet jacket decorated with gold, lace pants and a silk belt. Until the middle of the nineteenth century, the brides of the wealthy aristocracy of Tunis often wore a Kaftan cut in velvet, brocade or silk and richly embroidered with gold and enriched with precious stones. Nowadays, some marrying in Sousse and Hammamet still wear a kaftan with elbow-length sleeves, an open front, and varying in length from the knee to the mid calf. The richness and originality of the costumes are typically based less on the cut or the fabric as they are on woven patterns or embroidery.\nWearing the hijab is not widespread in Tunisia although the country has seen a relative increase since the early 2000s. Indeed, the state prohibited it in schools and in the government offices.\n\n\n=== Oral traditions ===\nUntil the beginning of the twentieth century, Tunisia was characterized by the existence of a popular culture of oral narratives and puppet shows (marionettes). The narrator, known under the terms of Rawi, or fdaoui meddah was highly respected and appreciated by both the Islamic elite and by the popular classes. Often itinerant, traveling from city to city on foot, they used a bendir, flute and some dolls as an accompaniment. The performance would often include the technique of imitating various characters in the context of Halqa, when two or three other narrators are involved and invite the public to participate. Other forms of narrative are the stories told by the cyclic meddah, the character of boussadia and Stambali shows, both of which are linked to communities from sub-Saharan Africa.The narratives are institutionalized into different types: Nadira, the Hikaye, the Qissa and Khurafi. The Nadira (story), as well as recitations of the Koran was considered the oral genre par excellence by the Tunisian elite and working classes. It consists of cycles, relating a vast repertoire of stories based on vulgar but intelligent and witty character named Jha. Other narrators specialize in Hikaye or Hikayat, a Tunisian term to describe the epic sagas that recall the history of Tunisian towns and villages, particularly from the eleventh century. The latter emphasize the female characters, in which the character of Zazi represents the archetype of Tunisian women, and are a fundamental part of oral tradition as they include elements of local Arab epics. As for the Qissa, it can be defined in terms of classical Koranic stories. Didactic in nature, it is considered part of Arab-Islamic religious literature Finally, the Khurafi is the most imaginative and popular oral tradition of Tunisia. Functioning as a kind of collective memory, it results from an interaction between the narrators and the public.The puppet called karakouz, has been present in North Africa from the fourteenth century, and the Teatro dei Pupi (originating in Sicily), enjoyed popularity until the early twentieth century. The performances took place during the month of Ramadan in Halfaouine, a district of Tunis. Karakouz was once played in Turkish until the beginning of the nineteenth century before moving to the Tunisian dialect. The main characters are lively and include officials, a smoker of hashish, the French Madama, Salbi, Nina and ethnic Albanians amongst others. This type of show relies heavily on double entendres, puns, satire, black comedy and caricature. Among the themes addressed are superstition, sexuality or women. The Teatro dei Pupi, executed in Tunisian dialect, account for its three main characters: Nina the Jew, Nekula the Maltese and Ismail Pasha, a valiant warrior who fought against the Christian kings.\n\n\n== Gender roles ==\n\nGradually after independence, gender roles and behavioral norms views start to change in Tunisian culture with the development of gender equality inside the society. In 1957 the Code of Personal Status (CSP) came into force, which gives women a new status, unprecedented in the Arab-Muslim world. This code establishes in particular the principle of equality between man and woman in terms of citizenship, forbade polygamy, allows women to divorce, established the minimum age for marriage at 15 for women and 18 for men and requires the consent of both spouses as a rule of validity of any marriage. Later, in 1964, the minimum age for marriage was advanced to 17 years for women and 20 years for men. Later, on the 50th anniversary of the CSP, President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali decided to unify this age for young men and women in 2007.\nToday, the position of women in Tunisia is among the most privileged in North Africa, and can be compared to that of European women. In 2002, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women commended Tunisia for \"its great strides forward in promoting equality between men and women\". Nevertheless, in rural places where life to some degree remains traditional, Tunisian women still have a long way to go to reach genuine equality. The man is still considered the head of family and inheritance is completely unequal.\nThe official government policies and programs for decades has strongly emphasized on gender equality and on promoting social development, translating into concrete results. According to latest figures, women make up 26% of the working population and more than 10,000 women are heads of businesses. At the same time, over one third of the approximately 56,000 graduates emerging annually from Tunisian universities are girls. On November 1, 1983, President Habib Bourguiba appointed the first two women ministers: Fethia Mzali (Family and Promotion of Women) and Souad Yaacoubi (Public Health) as leaders. Today the proportions of female representation in legislative and advisory bodies are: 22.7% in the Chamber of Deputies, over 15% in the Chamber of Advisors, over 27% in municipal councils, 18% in the Economic and Social Council, 13.3% in the Higher Council of the Judiciary, 12% among ministry departmental staff. In some areas, women outnumber men, for instance in the pharmaceutical sector women represent more than 72% of all Tunisian Pharmacists. In addition, Tunisian Women are present in key national domains such Education where they constitute half of the educational body and 40% of university professors.\n\n\n=== Family life ===\n\nIn the field of marriage, partners may be selected by agreement between the family or an individual selection. Mothers often go in search of a bride for their son. Once a commitment is made it usually follows a series of visits between the two families, but disputes can lead to a rupture of the agreement. The wedding ceremony itself involves the passage of the bride to the house of her husband who waits outside. After consummation of the marriage it is followed by a period of isolation of the couple.\nThe Tunisian household is based on the patriarchal model where the man is placed in the dominant role. Most households are based upon the model of the nuclear family within which the tasks are assigned according to age and sex and personal skills. Developments in education and employment, however, have somewhat altered this situation.\nA study published by the National Family and Population on June 19, 2007, shows that 1 in 10 women accept intercourse before marriage and for boys, this statistic is 4 to 10. The study also shows a sharp decline in the average age at marriage with 33 years for men and 29.2 years for women.\n\n\n== Gastronomy ==\n\nTunisian cuisine is a blend of Mediterranean cuisine and desert dweller's culinary traditions. Its distinctive spicy fieriness comes from neighbouring Mediterranean countries and the many civilizations who have ruled Tunisian land: Phoenician, Roman, Arab, Turkish, French, and the native Berber people. Tunisian food uses a variety of ingredients and in different ways. The main dish that is served in Tunisia is Couscous, made of minuscule grains that are cooked and usually served with meat and vegetables. In cooking they also use a variety of flavors such as: olive oil, aniseed, coriander, cumin, caraway, cinnamon, saffron, mint, orange, blossom, and rose water.\nMany of the cooking styles and utensils began to take shape when the ancient tribes were nomads. Nomadic people were limited in their cooking by what locally made pots and pans they could carry with them. A tagine is the name of a conical-lidded pot, and today a dish cooked in this pot is also called a tagine.\nLike all countries in the Mediterranean basin, Tunisia offers a \"sun cuisine\", based mainly on olive oil, spices, tomatoes, seafood (a wide range of fish) and meat from rearing (lamb).\n\n\n=== Ingredients ===\n\nUnlike another North African cuisine, Tunisian food is quite spicy. A popular condiment and ingredient which is used extensively Tunisian cooking, harissa is a hot red pepper sauce made of red chili peppers and garlic, flavoured with coriander, cumin, olive oil and often tomatoes. There is an old wive's tale that says a husband can judge his wife's affections by the amount of hot peppers she uses when preparing his food. If the food becomes bland then a man may believe that his wife no longer loves him. However, when the food is prepared for guests the hot peppers are often toned down to suit the possibly more delicate palate of the visitor. Like harissa or chili peppers, the tomato is also an ingredient that cannot be separated from the cuisine of Tunisia. Tuna, eggs, olives and various varieties of pasta, cereals, herbs and spices are also ingredients which are featured prominently in Tunisian cooking.\nTabil, pronounced \"table\", is a word in Tunisian Arabic meaning \"seasoning\" and refers to a particular Tunisian spice mix, although earlier it meant ground coriander. Paula Wolfert makes the plausible claim that tabil is one of the spice mixes brought to Tunisia by Muslims expelled from Andalusia in 1492 after the fall of Granada. Today tabil, closely associated with the cooking of Tunisia, features garlic, cayenne pepper, caraway and coriander seeds pounded in a mortar and then dried in the sun and is often used in cooking beef or veal.\nThanks to its long coastline and numerous fishing ports, Tunisia can serve an abundant, varied and exceptionally fresh supply of fish in its restaurants. Many diners will be content to have their fish simply grilled and served filleted or sliced with lemon juice and a little olive oil. Fish can also be baked, fried in olive oil, stuffed, seasoned with cumin (kamoun). Squid, cuttlefish, and octopus are often served in hot crispy batter with slices of lemon, as a cooked salad or stuffed and served with couscous.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nFootball (European style) is the most popular sport in Tunisia. The Ligue Professionelle 1 has 14 teams that compete against one another for a trophy, also a chance to qualify for the Champions league of the African Cup of Nations. The Tunisian national football team won the African Cup of Nations in the year 2004.\nHowever, sports like volleyball (nine national team championship wins in Africa) and handball (ten national team championship wins in Africa) are also among the sports most represented. Handball is the second most popular sport in Tunisia. In 2005, Tunisia held the 2005 World Men's Handball Championship and won fourth place in the competition. Other notable sports include rugby union, martial arts (taekwondo, judo and karate), athletics and tennis. Other major sports like cycling are less represented in contrast, because of lack of infrastructure and equipment but competitors still compete in the Tour de Tunisia.\n\nThe Tunisian sports year is punctuated by major competitions such as the championships in football, handball, volleyball and basketball. The country also organizes international competitions. Thus, the first edition of the FIFA World Cup Under-20 was held in Tunisia in 1977, the final stages of the African Cup of Nations in 1965, 1994, and 2004, and the last edition was won by the national team.\nIn May 2007, the country had 1,673 registered sports clubs whose main assets are in football (250) and taekwondo (206). Then come karate and its derivatives (166), wheelchair sports (140), handball (85), athletics (80), judo (66) kung fu (60), kickboxing (59), basketball (48), bowls (47), table tennis (45), volleyball (40) boxing (37), swimming (31), and tennis (30).\n\n\n== Cultural policy ==\nThe political culture of Tunisia is governed by the Ministry of Culture and Heritage Preservation, directed by Abderraouf El Basti. This department, created on December 11, 1961, is, according to the decree n \u00b0 2005-1707 of June 6, 2005, \"responsible, under the general policy of the state to run national choices in the fields of culture and heritage preservation and establish plans and programs to promote these areas \".In 1999, the budget allocated to 0.6% to culture and reached 1.25% in 2009 and is set to reach 1.5% in 2010. 50% of this increase is linked to a policy of decentralization of culture through the promotion in the areas of cultural institutions such as houses of culture, cultural committees and associations. During 2007, seven libraries were established and 30 public libraries managed. Ten houses of culture were under construction, half completed in 2008, and another 40 houses are under maintenance. The year 2008 was also proclaimed \"national year of translation\".However, while Kairouan's ambition is to become the \"capital of Islamic culture\" in 2009, MPs criticize some of the poor quality of artistic productions. Some regret the delay in the excavation of sites such as Salakta or El Haouaria and criticize the dilapidated state of some buildings, particularly that of Borj Zouara and Bab Saadoun. Moreover, the Tunisian museums should, according to some, be the subject of more attention, notably by addressing the problem of low attendance caused by the high cost of tickets.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArt and politics in post-2011 Tunisia\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSourcesBellahsen, Fabien; Rouche, Daniel; Bizos, Didier (2005). \"Cuisine de Tunisie\" (in French). \u00e9d.

        "wiki": "Tourism in Tunisia is an industry that generates around 9.4 million arrivals per year, which makes it one of the most visited countries in Africa. Tunisia has been an attractive destination for tourists since the beginning of the 1960s. \nAmong Tunisia's tourist attractions are its cosmopolitan capital city of Tunis, the ancient ruins of Carthage, the Muslim and Jewish quarters of Djerba, and coastal resorts outside Monastir. According to The New York Times, Tunisia is \"known for its golden beaches, sunny weather and affordable luxuries.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to Garrett Nagle in his book Advanced Geography, Tunisia's tourist industry \"benefits from its Mediterranean location and its tradition of low-cost package holidays from Western Europe.\"  The development of tourism dates back to 1960 through the joint efforts of government and private groups. In 1962, tourism, with 52,000 entries and 4,000 beds, had a revenue of two million dollars and becomes the main source of foreign exchange in the country. \nTunisia is also an attractive destination for its huge number of important festivals. The majority of these festivals occur in summer such as International Festival of Carthage which is the most important festival in the Arab world hosting stars and bands from all over the world, and Tabarka Jazz Festival.\nUntil recently, Tunisia's main attraction was on its northeast coastline around Tunis; however, the Seventh National Development Plan of 1989 created several new tourist areas including the resort at Port-el-Kantaoui. The tourism sector now represents 6.5% of Tunisia's GDP and provides 340,000 jobs of which 85,000 are direct jobs or 11.5% of the working population with a high share of seasonal employment.\nFrance, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom are the four traditional tourist markets, though Tunisia has decided since the last few years to open its tourism industry to new markets such as Russia and China.  From 2003-2004, it regained tourists, and 2007 saw arrivals increasing by 3 percent over that of 2006.Tourism in Tunisia suffered severe blows following the Bardo National Museum attack and the Sousse attack in 2015, but Tunisia managed to retrieve its position as one of the top destinations in Africa and the Mediterranean shortly afterwards, reaching in 2018 numbers exceeding those of 2010 by 6 percent, and a record of 8.3 million visitors.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nTunisia's attractions are of different types according to the region: \n\nTunis, the largest city and capital and its suburbs mainly Le Bardo,and the mythical must-visit northern suburbs of Carthage, Sidi Bou Said, La Goulette and La Marsa\nBizerte and its surroundings\nThe North-West for its forests in Ain Draham and picturesque coastal mountains close to Tabarka\nThe Cap Bon: Hammamet, Nabeul and surroundings\nThe Sahel, Tunisia: the beach resorts of Sousse, Monastir, Mahdia\nThe religious city of Kairouan, the former capital of the country, the fourth capital of Islam and the city of the oldest mosque in Africa Great Mosque of Kairouan\nThe Island of Djerba\nThe Sahara and the touristic and relaxing cities of Douz, Tozeur and the famous Tataouine, one of the locations of the Star Wars Saga.\n\n\n=== UNESCO World Heritage Sites ===\nTunisia is home to eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites as well 13 others in the tentative list including the island of Djerba for its cultural and religious diversity. \n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThis is a list of some important museums in Tunisia:\n\n\n=== Resorts ===\nThis sector is popular mainly on the east coast, totaling more than 95% of beds. The following is a list of the largest resorts and the percentage of nights out of the total: \n\nSousse-Monastir-Mahdia (36%)\nNabeul-Hammamet (24%)\nDjerba-Zarzis (40%)\nTunis-Zaghouan (10%)\nTabarka-A\u00efn Draham (2%)\n\n\n=== Golf ===\nTunisia is also a pioneer golfing destination in the Mediterranean. It offers world-class golf courses available year round due to the sunny and pleasant weather. Among the most important golf courses of the country  :\n\nYasmine Valley in Hammamet\nCitrus (La Foret) in Hammamet\nEl Kantaoui (Panorama)in Port El Kantaoui\nTabarka golf course\nCitrus (Les Oliviers)in Hammamet\nResidence Tunis in Gammarth\nFlamingo Monastir\nEl Kantaoui (Sea)in Port El Kantaoui\nDjerba (La Mer and Les Palmiers)\nCarthage golf course in La Soukra\n\n\n=== Marinas ===\nTunisia is one of the African countries that has the most marinas. Its yachting infrastructure attracts mostly European tourists who flee the harsh winter in their home countries to enjoy the pleasant weather and relatively warmer sea in Tunisia. The country is planning to create additional marinas in the coming years such as the one in the new modern economic center of Tunis Financial Harbor.\n\nThe existing marinas are 8 from the north to the south of the coast:\n\nYasmine Hammamet Marina in Hammamet\nBizerte Marina in Bizerte\nEl Kantaoui Marina in Port El Kantaoui\nSidi Bou Said Marina\nGammarth Marina\nTabarka Marina\nMarina Cap in Monastir\nDjerba  Marina\n\n\n=== Theme Parks ===\nTunisia offers several theme parks and most importantly water parks in each of the main cities and tourist resorts and among them: : \n\nCarthage Land in Hammamet\nAqua Palace in Sousse\nAqua Splash in Sousse\nAqua Land in Yasmine Hammamet\nDreamy Sea Waterpark in Hammamet\nAqua land in Berges du Lac , Tunis\nBig Splash in Djerba\nLe Pirate in Djerba\n\n\n=== Desert and movie sets ===\n\nThe Tunisian desert represents a major tourist destination in the country. The oases add some greenness and shades to the aridity of the pristine environment and the hot sun of the Saharan dunes.\nSince the Arab invasions on Tunisia, a growing population settled in the arid environment of the Numedian regions Medenine, Tataouine and Tozeur where they created oases as havens and also souks and old towns as new urban centers. Tozeur benefited from its extremely authentic old town and its souks to develop the tourism industry especially for the winter and spring seasons. Several hotels and maisons d\u2019hote opened in Tozeur as well as some upscale units such as the world-famous Thai brand, Anantara in 2019 which is ranked as the best hotels in the world.Taking a horse carriage to visit the oases and to taste the delicious Deglet Nour as well as going to Chott el Djerid, the largest salt lake in the Sahara Desert are must-do activities in the region.\nThe canyons and rocky mountains of the south as in Mides and the Berber village of Chebika, Tozeur can be visited while taking the old and luxurious L\u00e9zard rouge train for a few ride hours stopping at many natural stations.  \nGeorges Lucas\u2019s Star Wars made of Tataouine and Matmata, Tunisia's underground houses tourist destinations. \nNumerous other Hollywood movies were filmed in the Tunisian south, such as The English Patient.\n\n\n=== Festivals and nightlife ===\n\nDuring the summer, Tunisia becomes the venue of a multitude of festivals welcoming Arab and world-famous stars as International Festival of Carthage, Hammamet International Festival and Djem Symphonic Festival. \nOutdoor bars and nightclubs have made of Tunisia\u2019s metropolitan areas very lively during the whole day in the summer and at night especially in Gammarth  and Hammamet. \n\n\n=== Shopping ===\nSouks and historical handicraft markets are present in the old towns of the country. They used to represent the commercial center of each city but they are now major tourist attractions. The old souks of Tunis  for example have separated sections for each type of handicraft such as for the Chechia, the jewelry, etc. \nModern shopping infrastructure has also developed in the recent years attracting big international brands. Despite the creation of many new shopping malls such as Tunisia Mall in Berges du Lac, Mall of Sousse and Azur City Mall in the southern suburb of Tunis , they are all located in the capital city or in the coastal touristic cities. \n\n\n=== New developments ===\nIn recent years, ecotourism, spas and medical tourism are emerging into Tunisia's tourist scene and growing very fast. According to the former Minister of Tourism Ahmed Smaou, \"The medical tourism has a great future ahead of us.\"\n}}\n\n\n== Statistics ==\nIn 2000, there were 197,400 hotel beds in roughly 95,977 rooms with an occupancy rate at 56%. 5,057,193 travellers came to Tunisia that year. That year, tourist expenditures were nearly $1.5 billion. According to 2002 US Department of State estimates, the average daily cost of staying in Tunis or Carthage was $146, compared to $114 in other areas of Tunisia.\n\nA large number of tourists to Tunisia come from Eastern Europe, and the nationalities of major tourist countries is shown here: Libyans (1,472,411 visitors), French (1,234,735), Algerians (945,324), Germans (547,403), Italians (464,323) and British (350,693). There were 1,251,251 domestic tourists staying across the country for 2.75 million nights in 2006.\n\n\n=== Recent years ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nIndex of Tunisia-related articles\nVisa policy of Tunisia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of the Office of Tunisian tourism",

          "A ticket to El Jem Colosseum will give you access to this very nice small museum too. It is well worth a visit for the many Roman era artifacts and the wonderful mosaics.",

          "This is well worth a visit because its not too big and busy like the Bardo Museum and you will see some lovely Mosiacs without having having lots of people getting in your way with there cameras.Worth going round with a guide for more info but you can go round at your own pace",
          "we enjoyed this museum very much was well worth the visit can spend a hour or so here looking around worth a visit but go with a guide because you get lots of information from him",

          "What a amazing and well preserved piece of history. Well worth a visit, no waiting or people like in Rome. We explored at our leisure for just under an hour. Fine for children, not prams due to the steps. So well preserved and if you want to climb the steps, go to the top, an",

          "The coliseum was amazing if you look closely and in the right places you can see people from the war have carved in the walls, the size of this place is just incredible and worth taking some pics",
          "You can walk where the gladiators, Christians and animals were kept as well as sitting where the Romans sat. Beware touts and pickpockets outside. If you hand over a note for goods, expect them to go for change and not see them again as they know your coach is about to leave.",
          "The colosium dates back to the 3rd century and is where the film gladiator was based. You can climb to the top, sit as if watching a fight and even go underground where the animals were kept. It is well preserved and a must see.",
          "El Jem amphitheatre would be high on the list of Roman \"must-see\" sights if it was in Europe: as it is, because it's in Tunisia, it's less crowded and even more of a spectacle due to not being in ten middle of a bustling city. You can see it for miles before you arrive, which is",
          "Been wanting to experience proper roman history/architecture since I was 10 years old (almost a decade ago). Unreal. To any keen historians, the place is a MUST SEE.",

          "This is a small fairly new museum but the mosaics are the best we have ever seen and very well displayed. Well worth a visit!",

          "This was amazing place to visit. The Mosaics were outstanding and so well preserved. Definitely a place to visit if you have time.",
          "If you like Roman histroy then go here if you go to Tunisia. The mosaic s are out of the world, the art and expertise they must have had. The museum is small but really well presented. This and the Colleseum is a jewel amd must be on your bucket list",
          "Amazing to see it yourself, its a must see when you visit tunisia and to learn more about the history, i learned that amphitheatre means two theatre so you see two different types. most recommended and would return for another visit.",
          "Had a great trip well worth the visit liked all of it nothing that did not like Great views all round",
          "Walking around this amazing Colosseum transports you to the 3rd century! Beautiful and well cared for despite of the opposite seeing outside on the streets!",
          "We used the same tickets we purchased to enter the colosseum for entry to the museum. It's a sort walk form the colosseum. It was a small museum, the whole time we were there, there was no one else around, completely empty. Museum mostly full of mosaics. Not much history about",
          "We toured across Tunisia and what a fabtastic place El Jem was. The Museum was so interesting to look around and the amphitheatre...WOW. We had previosly been to the biggest amphitheatre and El Jem has the most intact....amazing. The museum is the place for musing for sure.",
          "Really interesting site which is 10dnr entry (ticket is joint entry for the Amphitheatre also). About a 10 minute walk from the train and 10 minutes from the Amphitheatre. Amazing collection of mosaics and other historic artifacts. The museum is at the site of an excavated house",
          "We took a walk from the amphitheatre of El Jem, and it was really worth! The exhibition is full of beautiful Roman mosaics, and the staff is very nice as well. Don't miss it!",
          "really nice mosaic exhibition! you should drop by if you're around el jem.",
          "This museum contains some of the most spectacular mosaics I have ever seen, it seemed that we went in the low season as my group was the only tourists there. The only other people were the staff. For a cheap, short museum visit I highly recommend heading here!",
          "10 dinar enterence plus 1 dinar to take pics Well preserved able to go underneath Hadn't been tampered with much Few information boards Immaculate toilets",
          "The amphitheatre was incredible, at at just 10 Dinar entry with an extra 1 Dinar to take pictures (I don't know who would object to paying 33p to take pictures here!!!) It was a great day out. We took the train from Sousse to El Jem, the journey in itself was very cheap,",
          "We combined this trip with a visit to the nearby coliseum, doing both as an organised trip with guide. The guide helped to make it an interesting trip as he was passionate about the local history. Excellent examples of mosaics within the museum with illustrations of where they",
          "Really enjoyed walking around the colloseum and going down into dungeons where the gladiators and lions waited before they went into the arena",
          "What a wonderful place. You can feel the atmosphere. Take a camera. Great visit If you want to get to the top you need to be mobile great attraction",
          "I had gone to Tunisia with no particular interest in mosaics. I have come home with such respect for the artists who designed and produced these extraordinary works of art. The museum at El Jem has such a wonderful collection that is so brilliantly displayed that you cannot",
          "Please don't make our mistake. We didn't take our cameras in as it was described as a mosaic museum but is so much more. There are beautifully restored mosaics all over the floors and walls but then you walk out into what you think is a courtyard and there are the ruins if a",
          "I visited El Jem twice and did not even know the museum was there. This time friends told me and I'm so glad. In typical Tunisian fashion, there is no information about the museum at El Jem, just a sign pointing down a side road. The museum is about 2 km down the road, barely",
          "I get the feeling not many people bother with the museum after the amphitheatre which is a shame as it's included in the price of your ticket. It's only about a 15 minute walk up the road and is actually quite interesting. They have some very well preserved stuff and it was more",
          "My family and I visited the museum in October 2014. Apart from the staff we were the only ones there and we could not believe the quality and quantity f mosaics on view. The entrance ticket (10 dinar = approx \u00a33) for the museum includes entrance for the amphitheatre which is a",
          "Impressive how the mosaics and other artifacts here were preserved. A very good idea to end the day after visiting the very impressive el jem amphitheater. For TD 10(\u00a33.50) its worth it.",
          "The museum at El Jem is amazing. Perhaps as impressive as the Bardo Museum. The collection is not as big, but it is a good sized collection, and the quality is unmatched. If you like mosaics, you should not miss this museum. Directly adjacent to the museum, and I suppose a",
          "Gorgeous mosaics, beautiful gardens, peaceful setting. Steeped in history, absolutely loved it! We went here straight after visiting El Jem so if was fabulous to see things that were originally sited there.",
          "This is an amazing museum. It is on the ground of excavated villa of Roman city called Thysdrus. Many, many mosaics, not only on the wall, but also on the ground that you can walk on it. It was seen very few visitors. So don't just rush to Colosseum but take time to visit this",
          "We went a couple of years ago. It is on the road to Sfax, and easy reach of the amphitheatre at el djam. The mosics are housed in a new museum which is in the shape of a Roman villa. A large and impressive building which is flooded in light making the veiwing of the floor",
          "Make sure you go. Well worth the money and if you're staying in or around Mahdia as I did, it's really not that far. We got some great photos and nice memories.",
          "If your into history and want to be amazed by the amazing craftsmanship of mosaics from palaces thousands of years ago this is for you I was mesmerised by the beauty and sheer size of some them many that tell as story in pictures this is quite a small museum so if your traveling",
          "When you visit the amphitheatre don't neglect to also visit the Museum which has a marvellous, well displayed selection of mosaics and the remains of a Roman villa and town. The mosaics are brilliant, detailed and intricate, world class.",
          "I did this trip about 30 years ago with my children so it was good to do it once again and see what differences there were,I'm pleased to say that as far as the museum and the amphitheatre were concerned nothing has changed.The Tour Guide was very knowledgeable and spoke",
          "Loved seeing where 'Gladiator' was filmed. The architecture was absolutely breathtaking, the views from the top were stunning.",
          "This is the third largest amphitheatre in the world. If you enjoyed the Colosseum you will also love this. You can really get the feel of the atmosphere and what went before. Well worth the trip.",
          "Very interesting and well preserved and where Gladiators was filmed. Meuseum was full of intact mosaic roman floors and a near perfect roman villa.",
          "My family and i went to the amphitheater, i went there 24 years ago and was very pleased to say that it was in the same condition as then. We went to the coliseum in Rome and my opinion El Jem is in a much better state than that. You can go down into the chambers and feel how",
          "We went here as part of our 1/2 day El Jem trip in which we saw the amphitheater and this museum. To be honest we weren't expecting much as we thought it was just a little add on to the main attraction of the amphitheater. However we loved it here. The mosaics are amazing with",
          "The mosaics were very interesting. Enter the amphitheatre. Beneath the arena are the chambers and passages where the gladiators, charioteers, beasts and victims waited their turn. Let your imagination wander ! On exit you may be approached by a man with a camel wanting you to",
          "Arrived at El Jem after being picked from hotel are guide was very good . The site was huge you could imagine the gladiators and lions fighting .Left El Jem to go to mosaic museum the reclaimed mosaic carpets were lovely and very detailed worth the visit",
          "This is the site where Gladiator the movie was filmed. I would recommend it for adults not so much for children, my daughters were bored.",
          "We visited the museum as part of an excursion and we had a talked guide around the museum. It was very interesting to see mosaics and roman ruins. we only had an hour here, and was rushed around. However, we really enjoyed our visit, especially looking at a roman villa that has",
          "Came here after the roman Colosseum, OK for adults but exceptionally hot day and kids were bored, hot and grumpy and wanted to get back on the bus ASAP for air-con.",
          "I liked the atmosphere there. It was Great to see something so old, something Europian in Africa. I loved it there. definitely I will come back again.",
          "Very worthwhile visiting as you can walk up to nearly the top, the view is amazing. Also you can walk through the dungeons where the animals used to run. Very large and really well preserved. On our trip a visit to the mosaic museum was included, this is brilliant, so many",
          "We weren't planning on going to the museum, but as it was included in the ticket price to the amphitheatre, we thought we might as well. Wow, this is a real gem of a museum. There are amazing mosaics from 2nd Century AD. Several of which are almost complete. There are signs in",
          "We visited El Jem on the first part of the Sahara explorer trip we booked through our hotel rep. When you get off the bus there are quite a few people trying to sell stuff but more useful things like maps for 1 dinar (30p)! Its very well preserved and views of the surrounding",
          "We decided to do the trip to El Jem which is the largest surviving Coliseum outside of Rome, amazing place & History added to the fact that it was actually used in the Gladiator films, but the trip took in the Oasis, Berber Village, Salt Flats, four by four through the Sahara,",
          "Worth a visit to this ruin , just an hour away from the royal kenz, stalls on the entrance selling their wares, Thomson offer this trip on its own and the 3 cities trip, Monistear is very busy so unless you want to shop i would just do the El Jem trip",
          "Our tour guide showed us around here as part of the amphitheatre trip. It was interesting at first to have a look at some of the mosaics and the outside part where they have been left in place. It didn't take too long to be bored though as they are a little 'samey'. The guide",
          "This is included in the price of your Amphitheatre ticket. To get there from the amphitheatre leave via the main entrance walk up the terracing (up to where the camels are probably sat) and there is a brown sign pointing right at the top. Basically the first road to the right.",
          "Great museum a real chance to look back at Roman history, they have a huge Roman Villa you can explore and more Roman mosaics in one place that I have ever seen! We also went to the Ampitheatre which is mind blowing.",
          "Superb trip with a great view of how a coliseum was. Still plenty to see and a great/interesting morning. Enjoy this...If you like history",
          "Loving Roman ruins these were must sees for me. They were setting up for a concert in the Collesseo as it is still used today and extremely well preserved and restored. The Museum allegedly has the greatest collection of mosaics in the world. They are still digging in the area",
          "OK. Lots of mosaics to see but relatively small inside. Better value on entrance fee if purchased together with el jem ticket",
          "Bigger museums have taken the important pieces, but there is still things to see that gives to an idea of how mosaik creation has developed over time. Wasn't blown away but I'm not the biggest fan of museums, so this is just one guys opinion.",
          "About 1 hours drive from our hotel complex, near Monastir. The coaches that pick up at hotels are air conditioned as we arranged the excursion through the Thomas Cook rep. The ampitheatre is well preserved, steps are available to visit both the top of the structure (very",
          "We arranged a day trip via our Thomas Cook rep (June 2014) which took us to the El Jem ampitheatre and then onto the museum. The ampitheatre was fantastic and really well preserved. I enjoyed being able to explore underground. The mosaic museum was also very interesting and had",
          "Everyone's mosaics are in their opinion the finest in the world we have discovered - these are pretty good though and certainly extensive - with some unusual designs i haven't seen before",
          "this was an interesting visit especially if you like mosaics, the work that that goes into these is amazing, there are plenty to look at and some of them are huge with thousands of pieces in.",
          "Fascinating place, lots of Roman artifacts although did seem very outdated, but this does add to it's charm",
          "Fantastic place for roman mosaics, small museum but a must see. We saw this whilst going on a tour to the amphitheatre.",
          "El Jem's colosseum is in my opinion the best in the world. This one you can walk freely around and still go down in to the cells where they kept the gladiators / slaves. Something not possible in Rome. It is probably in better repair too. The museum has some nice mosaics and the",
          "Whilst staying in the Golf Residence in Port El Kantaoui we decided to take a trip to El Jem. We were not disapointed. This place is stunning, just the thought of standing in the middle of the arena where Gladiators fought was amazing. I would recommend this to anyone.",
          "What an unexpected gem. There are some truly awe-inspiring mosaics which rival those in the Bardo in Tunis. Only complaint is the dust on the mosaics in situ in the reconstructed house, and that they had no book with photos/postcards of the mosaics. It would take you at least",
          "Absolutely fantastic museum. The mosaics are exceptionally well preserved and the entrance ticket is low. We went there from Sousse by taking the train. El Jem is rather small and it is possible to go around on foot in around 15-20 minutes... Total expense was 7.8 dinars for the",
          "Enjoyed a visit here. The mosaics and Roman Villa were great to see. A great addition to the visit to the Amphitheatre.",
          "We booked a car from scherazade and travelled with two friends from the hotel to el jem Well worth the trip the coliseum we spent a couple of hours here and then went the local museum and the local shops great way to spend a morning in Tunisia",
          "Visited El Jem whilst on holiday in Port El Kantaoui - well worth a visit . My husband is in a wheelchair and could still access the site - they did not charge for him as he would not be able to access the top area! It cost 10 dinars entrance and that includes the museum in the",
          "Went on a half day trip to El Jem roman Colosseum, very very impressive. We had booked the visit through Thomson and our guide was brilliant. The whole way there from Sousse about 1 hr 20m we had a full history of Tunisia (which I admit we knew very little about), right up to",
          "Went on a morning trip to ELJem Roman ruins and we were very impressed. The ampitheatre is very well preserved and unlike the Colosseum in Rome it was empty and we could walk around at our leisure. Our trip also included a visit to a great museum full of original Roman floor",
          "our hotel receptionist arranged a taxi for 100 dinar for the trip(good value as thomas cook half day trip tgere was 55 dinar). It took just over 1 hour to get there and what a wonderful experience(10 dinars each in). The thought of the Christians thrown to the lions, cruel",
          "This trip was partly spoilt by our guide who told us little of interest about the Coliseum. We tagged onto a group who were with a guy who looked like the guitarist from ZZ-Top, with a west country accent. This guy was very good. This coliseum is almost as good as the one in",
          "Very impressive remains of a Roman amphitheatre. The site is in very good condition and is well worth a visit. We spent a fantastic hour wandering around the site - underground where they kept the animals and where the wells can be seen then all the way up to the highest point",
          "Impressive remains of third biggest amphitheatre from roman period with capacity of 35 000 spectators. In very good condition.",
          "The film \"Gladiator\" was filmed in a reconstruction of a Colosseum in Malta, not at the one in El Jem. Both The Colosseum & The Museum in El Jem are both worth a visit . We traveled by train from Bir Bou Rekba to El Jem, suggest you travel on Autorail Express ,difficult to get a",

          "It's not the main course, but since you're going to drive to see the theatre, it's worth visiting. Good colection but don't expect any help from who works at the museum. I had to ask for them to open the doors to the outside part...",
          "What a beautiful place to explore. Very interesting and extremely large amphitheatre. An incredible thought provoking trip. The hustle and bustle of the surrounding area was also interesting. Only down side was behind El Jem there were some hagglers who wouldn't take no for an",
          "The museum is an excellent little gem filled with mosaics, a Roman villa, a town but visit the truly awesome Roman amphitheatre first. It is enormous, better preserved than the Colosseum in Rome and truly spectacular. You can go everywhere in it as well and the inexpensive",
          "this museum, although small, had some of the most beautiful mosaics we had seen in Tunisia. It also has a rebuilt Roman villa in the grounds, that was moved here from the centre of El Jem with gardens and was a beautiful place to visit on a sunny morning",
          "El Jem is where they filmed The Gladiator, Not on the same par as The Colleseum in Rome but at least this one had seats",
          "Some contributors are reviewing the amphitheatre on this page. Although the amphitheatre ticket includes the price to this museum, it is separate: it is situated about 600m south-east of the colosseum or 400m south of the station in an unassuming building from outside. I",
          "Went on the Thomson's \"Tale of three cities\" day trip from Port El Kantaoui to Kairouan, El Djem and Monastir of which undoubtably El Djem was the star attraction. It's sheer size and grandeur takes you back to days of gladiators. You have to climb some steps to gain the full",

          "We visited this privately on a trip to El Jem area. It was lovely to see the mosaics and the reconstructed Roman villa. Would definitely recommend a visit - we spent over an hour there, although I think most people would spend less time. One thing we only found out afterwards -",
          "Wasn't quite sure what to expect when we booked visiting here as part of a Thomson day trip, having visited the slightly larger colosseum in Roma. The amphitheatre has been well preserved with much of still standing, you are able to go down stairs under parts of it, and climb up",

          "Included in the price of the amphitheatre, but would have happily paid separate. Fascinating artefacts inside, some dating to more than 2000 years ago. Very quiet, can really take your time having a good look. Just outside but still in the museum grounds are the foundations of",
          "we went here on a trip after seeing El jem amphitheatre which is a must if you are in Tunisia. It is in such good condition & the history is fantastic. Just to see such a thing outside of Greece is a sight to behold. The mosaics museum was a bonus & we could have stayed longer",
          "The amphitheatre at El Djem is one of the finest Roman architectural structures I've seen. In relatively good repair although several restorations have been undertaken over the years. Best visited outside of summertime since it can get fiercely hot. The museum houses the most",
          "Went on an organized trip with Thomsons, had an amazing afternoon. The journey took about 1 hour from Sousse and throughout the whole journey the guide gave us so much information on everything form Tunisian History to the Museum and Amphitheatre . when you arrive you have to",
          "Visited the Roman Amphitheater whilst staying in Souuse (it was about 50 mins away on the coach). We did an organised tour but there is no reason not to do independently. On the way to the site you are met by street hawkers, trying to sell you everything from scarves for your",

          "El Jem is one of the best preserved coliseums in the world. We only had about 45 minutes to look around and would recommend staying at least an hour to really take it in. Not much information there, but we got more info from our tour rep and guide books. Our visit was free with",

          "We arrived just as the gates were opening about 7.30 am and had the place to ourselves. This is the second most complete Roman amphitheatre after the Coliseum in Rome and in wonderful condition giving you a true insight into the use of it as a real come to venue in Roman times.",

          "This is one of the most beautiful, impressive and magic places in Tunisia. To my mind real MUST VISIT of Tunisia. The amphitheater is the largest Roman architectural monument in Africa. Now there are concerts by famous opera and pop artists. In contrast to the Coliseum in Rome",
          "We didn't go to the museum, but the colosseum is most definitely worth a visit. Fascinating place to visit and, unlike Rome, there was almost nobody else there. It may be smaller than the colosseum in Rome but it's in better condition. Well worth making the effort.",
          "There are some spectacular examples of Roman mosaics on display. Many of these mosaics have been excavated from local sites but some are from the excavated Roman villa located on the site. Many mosaics are wall mounted but some are still on the floor. It was a good experience",

          "The El Jem colosseum is very well preserved. Like it's Roman cousin, El Jem has been denuded of the facing stone that once covered the exterior. In some way this adds to the rawness and brutality we associate with this \"sporting\" arena.There are concentric stone passages behind",

          "We came to El Jem, but stayed for the mosaics in this museum. If you find yourself in El Jem, do what we did and don't skip the exhibits in this museum. If you are fed up with the never-ending renovations and erratic closings of the Bardo museum, do yourself a favor and make a",

        "wiki": "Tunis (Arabic: \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633\u200e T\u016bnis) is the capital and largest city of Tunisia. The greater metropolitan area of Tunis, often referred to as \"Grand Tunis\", has about 2,700,000 inhabitants, making it the third-largest city in the Maghreb region (after Casablanca and Algiers) and the sixteenth-largest in the Arab world. \nSituated on a large Mediterranean Sea gulf (the Gulf of Tunis), behind the Lake of Tunis and the port of La Goulette (\u1e24alq il-W\u0101d), the city extends along the coastal plain and the hills that surround it. At its core lies its ancient medina, a World Heritage Site. East of the medina through the Sea Gate (also known as the Bab el Bhar and the Porte de France) begins the modern city, or Ville Nouvelle, traversed by the grand Avenue Habib Bourguiba (often referred to by popular press and travel guides as \"the Tunisian Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\"), where the colonial-era buildings provide a clear contrast to smaller, older structures. Further east by the sea lie the suburbs of Carthage, La Marsa, and Sidi Bou Said. As the capital city of the country, Tunis is the focus of Tunisian political and administrative life and also the centre of the country's commercial and cultural activities. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nTunis is the transcription of the Arabic name \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633 which can be pronounced as \"T\u016bnus\", \"T\u016bnas\", or \"T\u016bnis\". All three variations were mentioned by the Greek-Syrian geographer al-Rumi Yaqout in his Mu'jam al-B\u00fbldan (Dictionary of Countries).\nDifferent explanations exist for the origin of the name Tunis. Some scholars relate it to the Phoenician goddess Tanith ('Tanit or Tanut), as many ancient cities were named after patron deities. Some scholars claim that it originated from Tynes, which was mentioned by Diodorus Siculus and Polybius in the course of descriptions of a location resembling present-day Al-Kasbah; Tunis's old Berber Bourgade.Another possibility is that it was derived from the Berber verbal root ens which means \"to lie down\" or \"to pass the night\". The term Tunis can possibly mean \"camp at night\", \"camp\", or \"stop\", or may have referred to as \"the last stop before Carthage\" by people who were journeying to Carthage by land. There are also some mentions in ancient Roman sources of such names of nearby towns as Tuniza (now El Kala), Thunusuda (now Sidi-Meskin), Thinissut (now Bir Bouregba), and Thunisa (now Ras Jebel). As all of these Berber villages were situated on Roman roads, they undoubtedly served as rest-stations or stops.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Carthage ===\n\nThe historical study of Carthage is problematic. Because its culture and records were destroyed by the Romans at the end of the Third Punic War, very few Carthaginian primary historical sources survive. While there are a few ancient translations of Punic texts into Greek and Latin, as well as inscriptions on monuments and buildings discovered in Northwest Africa, the main sources are Greek and Roman historians, including Livy, Polybius, Appian, Cornelius Nepos, Silius Italicus, Plutarch, Dio Cassius, and Herodotus. These writers belonged to peoples in competition, and often in conflict, with Carthage. Greek cities contended with Carthage over Sicily, and the Romans fought three wars against Carthage. Not surprisingly, their accounts of Carthage are extremely hostile; while there are a few Greek authors who took a favourable view, these works have been lost.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nTunis was originally a Berber settlement. The existence of the town is attested by sources dating from the 4th century BC. Situated on a hill, Tunis served as an excellent point from which the comings and goings of naval and caravan traffic to and from Carthage could be observed. Tunis was one of the first towns in the region to fall under Carthaginian control, and in the centuries that followed Tunis was mentioned in the military histories associated with Carthage. Thus, during Agathocles' expedition, which landed at Cape Bon in 310 BC, Tunis changed hands on various occasions.During the Mercenary War, it is possible that Tunis served as a center for the native population of the area, and that its population was mainly composed of peasants, fishermen, and craftsmen. Compared to the ancient ruins of Carthage, the ruins of ancient Tunis are not as large. According to Strabo, it was destroyed by the Romans in 146 BC during the Third Punic War. Both Tunis and Carthage were destroyed; Tunis, however, was rebuilt first under the rule of Augustus and became an important town under Roman control and the center of a booming agricultural industry. The city is mentioned in the Tabula Peutingeriana as Thuni. In the system of Roman roads for the Roman province of Africa, Tunis had the title of mutatio (\"way station, resting place\"). Tunis, increasingly Romanized, was also eventually Christianized and became the seat of a bishop. However, Tunis remained modestly sized compared to Carthage during this time.\n\n\n=== Early Islamic period ===\n\nWhen the Arab Muslim troops conquered the region at the end of the 7th century, they established themselves at the outskirts of ancient Tunes, and the small town soon became the city of Tunis that could easily be taken for an Arab foundation. The medina of Tunis, the oldest section of the city, dates from this period, during which the region was conquered by the Umayyad emir Hasan ibn al-Nu'man al-Ghasani. The city had the natural advantage of coastal access, via the Mediterranean, to the major ports of southern Europe. Early on, Tunis played a military role; the Arabs recognized the strategic importance of its proximity to the Strait of Sicily. From the beginning of the 8th century Tunis was the chef-lieu of the area: it became the Arabs' naval base in the western Mediterranean Sea, and took on considerable military importance. Under the Aghlabids, the people of Tunis revolted numerous times, but the city benefited from economic improvements and quickly became the second most important in the kingdom. It was briefly the national capital, from the end of the reign of Ibrahim II in 902, until 909 when control over Ifriqiya was lost to the newly founded Fatimid Caliphate.\nLocal opposition to the authorities began to intensify in September 945, when Kharijite insurgents occupied Tunis, resulting in general pillaging. With the rise of the Zirid dynasty Tunis gained importance, but the Sunni population tolerated Shi'ite rule less and less, and carried out massacres against the Shi'ite community. In 1048 the Zirid ruler Al-Muizz ibn Badis rejected his city's obedience to the Fatimids and re-established Sunni rites throughout all of Ifriqiya. This decision infuriated the Shi'ite caliph Al-Mustansir Billah. To punish the Zirids, he unleashed the Banu Hilal Arab tribe on Ifriqiya; a large part of the country was set to the torch, the Zirid capital Kairouan was razed in 1057, and only a few coastal towns, including Tunis and Mahdia, escaped destruction. Exposed to violence from the hostile tribes that settled around the city, the population of Tunis repudiated the authority of the Zirids and swore allegiance to the Hammadid prince El Nacer ibn Alennas, who was based in B\u00e9ja\u00efa, in 1059. The governor appointed by B\u00e9ja\u00efa, having reestablished order in the country, did not hesitate to free himself from the Hammadids to found the Khurasanid dynasty with Tunis as its capital. This small independent kingdom picked up the threads of trade and commerce with other nations, and brought the region back to peace and prosperity.\n\n\n=== New capital of Tunisia ===\nIn 1159, the Almohad 'Abd al-Mu'min took Tunis, overthrew the last Khurasanid leader and installed a new government in the kasbah of Tunis. The Almohad conquest marked the beginning of the dominance of the city in Tunisia. Having previously played a minor role behind Kairouan and Mahdia, Tunis was promoted to the rank of provincial capital.\nIn 1228, Governor Abu Zakariya seized power and, a year later, took the title of Emir and founded the Hafsid dynasty. The city became the capital of a Hafsid kingdom stretching towards Tripoli and Fez. Walls were built to protect the emerging principal town of the kingdom, surrounding the medina, the kasbah and the new suburbs of Tunis. In 1270 the city was taken briefly by Louis IX of France, who was hoping to convert the Hafsid sovereign to Christianity. King Louis easily captured Carthage, but his army soon fell victim to an outbreak of dysentery. Louis himself died before the walls of the capital and the army was forced out.  At the same time, driven by the reconquest of Spain, the first Andalusian Muslims and Jews arrived in Tunis and would become of importance to the economic prosperity of the Hafsid capital and the development of its intellectual life.During the Almohad and Hafsid periods Tunis was one of the richest and grandest cities in the Islamic world, with a population of about 100,000.\nDuring this period, one of the famous travellers to Tunis was Ibn Battuta. In his travel account, when Ibn Battuta and his group arrived in Tunis, the population of the city came out to meet him and the other the members of his party. They all greeted them and were very curious, many were asking questions, however, no one in Tunis personally greeted Ibn Battuta, greatly upsetting him. He felt very lonely and could not hold back the tears coming from his eyes. This went on for a while until one of the pilgrims realized he was upset, he went up and greeted and talked to Ibn until he entered the city. At the time, the Sultan of Tunis was Abu Yahya and during Ibn Battuta's stay, the Festival of the Breaking of the Fast was taking place. The people in the city assembled in large numbers to celebrate the festival, in extravagant and most luxurious outfits. Abu Yahya arrived on horseback, where all of his relatives joined him. After the performance, the people returned to their homes.\n\n\n=== Spanish occupation and Ottoman control ===\n\nThe Ottoman Empire took nominal control of Tunis in 1534 when Hayreddin Barbarossa captured it from the Hafsid Sultan Mulai Hassan, who fled to the court of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. Charles, suffering losses from the corsairs operating out of Djerba, Tunis, and Algiers, agreed to reinstate Mulai Hassan in exchange for his acceptance of Spanish suzerainty. A naval expedition led by Charles himself was dispatched in 1535, and the city was recaptured. The victory against the corsairs is recorded in a tapestry at the Royal Palace of Madrid. The Spanish governor of La Goulette, Luys Peres Varga,  fortified the island of Chikly in the lake of Tunis to strengthen the city's defences between 1546 and 1550. \n\n \nThe Ottoman Ulu\u00e7 Ali Reis, at the head of an army of janissaries and Kabyles, retook Tunis in 1569. However, following the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the Spanish under John of Austria succeeded in retaking the city and re-establishing the Hafsid sovereign in October 1573. Following these conflicts, the city finally fell into Ottoman hands in August 1574. Having become an Ottoman province governed by a Pasha who was appointed by the Sultan based in Constantinople, the country attained a degree of autonomy. After 1591, the Ottoman governors (Beys) were relatively independent, and both piracy and trade continued to flourish. Under the rule of deys and Moorish beys, the capital sprang into new life. Its population grew by additions from various ethnicities, among which were Moorish refugees from Spain, and economic activities diversified. To traditional industry and trade with distant lands was added the activity of the Barbary pirates, then in their golden age. Profits obtained from the trade in Christian slaves allowed the rulers to build sumptuous structures that revived the architectural heritage of the Middle Ages.\n\nIn April 1655 the English admiral Robert Blake was sent to the Mediterranean to extract compensation from states that had been attacking English shipping. Only the Bey of Tunis refused to comply, with the result that Blake's fifteen ships attacked the Bey's arsenal at Porto Farina (Ghar el Melh), destroying nine Algerian ships and two shore batteries, the first time in naval warfare that shore batteries had been eliminated without landing men ashore.\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Tunisia entered into a new period in its history with the advent of the Husainid dynasty. Successive Husainid rulers made great progress in developing the city and its buildings. During this period, the city prospered as a centre of commerce. Taking advantage of divisions within the ruling house, Algerians captured Tunis in 1756 and put the country under supervision. Hammouda Bey faced bombardment by the Venetian fleet, and the city experienced a rebellion in 1811. Under the reign of Hussein Bey II, naval defeats by the British (1826) and French (1827) saw the French become increasingly active in the city and in the economy.Various sources estimate the 19th-century population to have ranged from 90,000 to 110,000 inhabitants. During the later 19th century, Tunis became increasingly populated by Europeans, particularly the French, and immigration dramatically increased the size of the city. This resulted in the first demolition of the old city walls, from 1860, to accommodate growth in the suburbs. The city spilled outside the area of the earlier town and the banks of the lake, and the new districts were modernised with running water (1860), lighting gas (1872), roads, waste collection (1873), and communication with adjacent suburbs and the city centre. The crafts and traditional trades declined somewhat, as the newcomers increased trade with Europe, introducing the first modern industries and new forms of urban life.\n\n\n=== Development under the French protectorate ===\n\nThe creation of the French protectorate in 1881 was a turning point in Tunis's history, leading to rapid redevelopment of the city in the span of two to three decades. The city quickly spread out of its fortifications: it divided into a traditional Arab-populated old city, and a new city populated by immigrants, with a different structure from that of the traditional medina. Tunis also benefited from French construction of a water supply, natural gas and electricity networks, public transport services and other public infrastructure.\nUnder French rule, a substantial number of Europeans settled (like the Tunisian Italians); half of the population was European in origin. The city expanded and created new boulevards and neighborhoods.\nTunis was quiet during the First World War. After the war, the city faced new transformations as the modern portion grew in importance and extended its network of boulevards and streets in all directions. In addition, a series of satellite cities emerged on the urban rim and encroached on the municipality of Tunis proper. In the economic sphere, commercial activities expanded and diversified as modern industries continued to grow, while traditional industry continued to decline.\nDuring World War II, Tunis was held by Axis forces from November 1942 to May 1943. It was their last base in Africa, as they retreated towards Sicily after being surrounded by Allied forces from Algeria to the west and from Libya to the east. \nOn 7 May 1943, at about 15:30 in the afternoon, Tunis fell to troops of British 1st Army and the U.S. 1st Army, which had defeated the German 5th Panzer Army guarding the city. At midday on 20 May 1943, the Allies held a victory parade on Avenue Mar\u00e9chal Galli\u00e9ni, and Avenue Jules Ferry, to signal the end of fighting in North Africa.Having succeeded in driving the Axis powers out of Tunisia, the Allies used Tunis as a base of operations from which to stage amphibious assaults first against the island of Pantelleria, and then Sicily, and finally the mainland of Italy.\n\n\n=== Growth since independence ===\n\nAfter independence in 1956, Tunis consolidated its role as the capital, first with the establishment of a constitution stating that the Chamber of Deputies and the Presidency of the Republic must have their headquarters in Tunis and its suburbs. In a very short time, the colonial city transformed rapidly. As the city has grown and native Tunisians gradually began to replace the extensive European population, conflict between the Arab city and the European city has gradually decreased with the arabization of the population.\nBecause of population pressure and the rate of migration to the capital, the city continued to grow, even with the creation of new districts in the suburbs. Old buildings have gradually been renovated and upgraded and new buildings have come to influence the urban landscape. At the same time, an active policy of industrialization is developing the municipal economy.\nThe Arab League was headquartered in Tunis from 1979 to 1990. The Arab League, which represents 22 Arab nations, transferred its headquarters to Tunis in 1979 because of Egypt's peace with Israel but has been headquartered back in Egypt since 1990.\nThe Palestine Liberation Organization also had its headquarters in Tunis, from 1982 to 2003.\nIn 1985, the PLO's headquarters was bombed by Israeli Air Force F-15s, killing approximately 60 people.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nMany protests took place during the Arab Spring of 2011\u201312.\nOn 18 March 2015, two gunmen attacked the Bardo National Museum and held hostages. Twenty civilians and one policeman were killed in the attack, while around 50 others were injured. Five Japanese, two Colombians, and visitors from Italy, Poland, and Spain were among the dead. Both gunmen were killed by Tunisian police. The incident has been treated as a terrorist attack.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTunis is located in north-eastern Tunisia on the Lake of Tunis, and is connected to the Mediterranean sea's Gulf of Tunis by a canal which terminates at the port of La Goulette/Halq al Wadi. The ancient city of Carthage is located just north of Tunis along the coastal part. The city lies on a similar latitude as the southernmost points of Europe.\nThe city of Tunis is built on a hill slope down to the lake of Tunis. These hills contain places such as Notre-Dame de Tunis, Ras Tabia, La Rabta, La Kasbah, Montfleury and La Manoubia with altitudes just above 50 metres (160 feet). The city is located at the crossroads of a narrow strip of land between Lake Tunis and S\u00e9joumi. The isthmus between them is what geologists call the \"Tunis dome\", which includes hills of limestone and sediments. It forms a natural bridge and since ancient times several major roads linking to Egypt and elsewhere in Tunisia have branched out from it. The roads also connect with Carthage, emphasising its political and economic importance not only in Tunisia but more widely in North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea in ancient times.\nThe Greater Tunis area has an area of 300,000 hectares, 30,000 of which is urbanized, the rest being shared between bodies of water (20,000 hectares of lakes or lagoons) and agricultural or natural land (250,000 hectares). However, urban growth, which is estimated to be increasing by 500 hectares per year, is gradually changing the landscape with urban sprawl.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Suburbs ===\nAfter World War II, suburbs began to rapidly spring up on the outskirts of Tunis. These form a large percentage of the population of the Tunis metropolitan area. It grew from 27% of the total population in 1956, to 37% in 1975 and 50% in 2006.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTunis has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa), characterized by hot and dry, prolonged summers and mild winters with moderate rainfall. The local climate is also affected somewhat by the latitude of the city, the moderating influence of the Mediterranean sea and the terrain of the hills.\nWinter is the wettest season of the year, when more than a third of the annual rainfall falls during this period, raining on average every two or three days.  The sun may still increase the temperature from 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F) in the morning to 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) in the afternoon on average during the winter. Frosts are rare.  In spring, rainfall declines by half.  The sunshine becomes dominant in May when it reaches 10 hours a day on average.  In March temperatures may vary between 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F) and 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), and between 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) and 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) in May. However, it is common for temperatures to soar even as early as April with record temperatures reaching 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F).  In summer, rain is almost completely absent and the sunlight is at a maximum.  The average temperatures in the summer months of June, July, August, and September are very high. Sea breezes may mitigate the heat, but sometimes the sirocco winds reverse the trend.  In autumn, it begins to rain, often with short thunderstorms, which can sometimes cause flash floods or even flood some parts of the city.  The month of November marks a break in the general heat with average temperatures ranging from 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) to 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Capital ===\n\nTunis has been the capital of Tunisia since 1159. Under Articles 43 and 24 of the Constitution of 1959, Tunis and its suburbs host the national institutions: the Presidential Palace, which is known as Carthage Palace, residence of the President of Tunisia, the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Advisors and parliament, the Constitutional Council and the main judicial institutions  and public bodies. The revised Tunisian Constitution of 2014 similarly provides that the National Assembly is to sit in Tunis (article 51) and that the Presidency is based there (article 73).\n\n\n=== Municipality ===\n\n\n==== Institutions ====\n\nFollowing the municipal elections of 6 May 2018, Ennahdha obtained 21 seats out of 60. Nidaa Tounes came second with 17 seats. On 3 July 2018, the head of the Ennahdha list Souad Abderrahim was elected by the council as the new mayor of the capital.\nBefore 2011, unlike other mayors in Tunisia, the mayor of Tunis is appointed by decree of the President of the Republic from among the members of the City Council.\n\n\n==== Budget ====\nThe 2008 budget adopted by the City Council is structured as follows: 61.61 million dinars for operations and 32,516 million dinars for investment. It reflects the improved financial situation of the municipality, the year 2007 was a year registering a surplus in resources that allowed the settlement of debts of the municipality and the strengthening of its credibility with respect its suppliers and public and private partners.\nRevenues are generated by the proceeds of taxes on buildings and vacant lots, fees for the rental of municipal property, income from the operation of the public, advertising, and that the fact that the municipality has capital shares in some companies. On the expenditure side, provision is made for the consolidation of hygiene and cleanliness, the state of the environment and urban design, infrastructure maintenance, rehabilitation and renovation of facilities, and strengthening the logistics and means of work and transport.\n\n\n==== Administrative divisions ====\n\nThe city of Tunis, whose size has increased significantly during the second half of the 20th century, now extends beyond the Tunis Governorate into parts of the governorates of Ben Arous, Ariana and Manouba.\nThe municipality of Tunis is divided into 15 municipal districts:  These include El Bab Bhar, Bab Souika, Cit\u00e9 El Khadra, Jelloud Jebel El Kabaria, El Menzah, El Ouardia, Ettahrir, Ezzouhour, Hra\u00efria, Medina, El Omrane, El Omrane Higher S\u00e9joumi, Sidi El-Bashir and Sidi Hassine.\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nIn the years following independence, the population of the metropolitan area continued to grow: by 21.1% from 1956 to 1966 and by 28.5% from 1966 to 1975 (55.6% between 1956 and 1975). This steady growth was accompanied by changes which affected the nature of the settlement of the capital. Decolonization led to the exodus of some European minorities whose numbers dwindled every year. The gaps created by their departure were filled by Tunisians who emigrated to Tunis from other parts of the country.\nThe population of the city of Tunis exceeds 2,000,000 inhabitants. After independence, the Tunisian government implemented a plan to cope with population growth of the city and country, a system of family planning, to attempt to lower the rate of population growth. However, between 1994 and 2004, the population of the governorate of Tunis grew more than 1.03% per annum. It represents, in the 2004 census, 9.9% of the total population of Tunisia. As in the rest of Tunisia, literacy in the region of Tunis evolved rapidly during the second half of the 20th century and has reached a level slightly higher than the national average. The education level is only exceeded by the neighbouring governorate of Ariana which has many institutions of education.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nProducts include textiles, carpets, and olive oil. Tourism also provides a significant portion of the city's income.\nBecause of the concentration of political authority (headquarters of the central government, presidency, parliament, ministries and central government) and culture (festivals and mainstream media), Tunis is the only nationally ranking metropolis. Tunis is the heartland of the Tunisian economy and is the industrial and economic hub of the country, home to one third of Tunisian companies\u2014including almost all the head offices of companies with more than fifty employees, with the exception of the Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa, headquartered in Gafsa\u2014and produces a third of the national gross domestic product.  Tunis attracts foreign investors (33% of companies, 26% of investments and 27% of employment), excluding several areas due to economic imbalances. According to the Mercer 2017 Cost of Living Rankings, Tunis has the lowest cost of living for expatriates in the world. The urban unemployment rate of university graduates is increasing and the illiteracy rate remains high among the elderly (27% of women and 12% of men). The number of people living below the poverty line, falling at the national level, remains higher in urban areas. In addition, unemployment is high in young people aged 18 to 24, with one in three unemployed as compared to one in six at the national level. In Greater Tunis, the proportion of young unemployed is at 35%.Gulf finance house or GFH has invested $10 billion in order for the construction of tunis financial harbor, that will transform Tunisia as the gateway to Africa from Europe. The project hopes to boost the economy of Tunisia as well as increase the number of tourists visiting Tunisia annually. The project is going through planning.\n\n\n=== Sectors ===\nThe economic structure of Tunis, as well as that of the country, is overwhelmingly tertiary industry.  The city is the largest financial center in the country hosting the headquarters of 65% of financial companies \u2013 while the industrial sectors are gradually declining in importance.  However the secondary industry is still very represented and Tunis hosts 85% of industrial establishments in the four governorates, with a trend towards the spread of specialized industrial zones in the suburbs.\nPrimary industry such as agriculture, however, is active in specialized agricultural areas on the suburbs, particularly in the wine and olive oil industries. The generally flat terrain and the two main rivers in Tunisia, the Medjerda to the north and the Milian to the south, the soils are fertile.  Tunis has several large plains, the most productive are in Ariana and La Soukra (north), the plain of Manouba (west) and the plain of Mornag (south).  In addition, groundwater is easily accessible through the drilling of deep wells, providing water for the different agriculture crops. The soils are heavy and contain limestone in the north but are lighter and sandy containing clay in the south.  There is much diversification in the municipality of Tunis, with Durum grown in Manouba, Olives and olive oil in Ariana and Mornag, wine (Mornag), and fruit, vegetable and legumes are grown in all regions.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Architecture and landscape ==\n\n\n=== Urban landscape ===\n\nThe Medina, built on a gentle hill slope on the way down to the Lake of Tunis, is the historical heart of the city and home to many monuments, including palaces, such as the Dar Ben Abdallah and Dar Hussein, the mausoleum of Tourbet el Bey or many mosques such as the Al-Zaytuna Mosque. Some of the fortifications around it have now largely disappeared, and it is flanked by the two suburbs of Bab Souika to the north and Bab El Jazira to the south. Located near the Bab Souika, the neighborhood of Halfaouine which gained international attention through the film 'Halfaouine Child of the Terraces'.\nBut east of the original nucleus, first with the construction of the French Consulate, the modern city was built gradually with the introduction of the French protectorate at the end of the 19th century, on open land between the city and the lake. The axis to the structure of this part of the city is the Avenue Habib Bourguiba, designed by the French to be a Tunisian form of Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris with its cafes, major hotels, shops and cultural venues. On both sides of the tree lines avenue, north and south, the city was extended in various districts, with the northern end welcoming residential and business districts while the south receives industrial districts and poorer peoples.\nSouth-east of the Avenue Bourguiba the district of La Petite Sicile (Little Sicily) is adjacent to the old port area and takes its name from its original population of workers from Italy. It is now the subject of a redevelopment project including the construction of twin towers. North of the Avenue Bourguiba is the district of La Fayette, which is still home to the Great Synagogue of Tunis and the Habib Thameur Gardens, built on the site of an ancient Jewish cemetery which lay outside the walls. Also to the north is the long Avenue Mohamed V, which leads to the Boulevard of 7 November through the neighborhood of the big banks where there are hotels and Abu Nawas Lake and finally to the Belvedere area around the place Pasteur. This is where the Belvedere Park lies, the largest in the city, and home to a zoo and the Pasteur Institute founded by Adrien Loir in 1893. Continuing to the north are the most exclusive neighborhoods of Mutuelleville which house the French Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-Mend\u00e8s-France, the Sheraton Hotel and some embassies.\nStill further north of the Belvedere Park, behind the Boulevard of 7 November are the neighborhoods of El Menzah and El Manar now reaching the peaks of the hills overlooking the north of the town. They support a range of residential and commercial buildings. To the west of the park lies the district of El Omrane which holds the main Muslim cemetery in the capital and the warehouses of public transport.  Heading east is the Tunis-Carthage International Airport and the neighborhoods of Borgel, giving his name to the existing Jewish and Christian cemeteries in the capital, and the neighbourhood of Montplaisir. Beyond that, several kilometers north-east, on the road to La Marsa,  the Berges du Lac was built on land reclaimed from the north shore of the lake near the airport, which has holds offices of Tunisian and foreign companies, many embassies as well as shops.\nSouthwest of the Medina, on the crest of the hills across the Isthmus of Tunis, is the Montfleury district then on down to the foothills of S\u00e9joumi, the poor neighborhood of Mellassine. Northwest of the latter, north of the National Route 3 leading to the west, is the city of Ezzouhour (formerly El Kharrouba), which spans more than three metres (9.8 feet) and is divided into five sections. It is still surrounded with farmland and vegetables are grown which supply many of the souks in the region.\nThe south of Tunis is made up of disadvantaged neighborhoods, especially due to the strong industry in this part of the metropolis. These include Jebel Jelloud, located in the south-east of Tunis, which concentrates on the heavy industry of cement production, the treatment plant of phosphate s, etc. The main cemetery in Tunis, the Djellaz Cemetery, dominates this part of town, perched on the slopes of a rocky outcrop.\n\n\n=== M\u00e9dina ===\n\nThe medina of Tunis has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979. The Medina contains some 700 monuments, including palaces, mosques, mausoleums, madrasas and fountains dating from the Almohad and the Hafsid periods. These ancient buildings include:\n\nThe Aghlabid Al-Zaytouna Mosque (\"Mosque of the Olive\") built in 723 by Ubayd Allah ibn al-Habhab to celebrate the new capital.\nThe Dar El Bey, or Bey's Palace, comprises architecture and decoration from many different styles and periods and is believed to stand on the remains of a Roman theatre as well as the 10th-century palace of Ziadib-Allah II al Aghlab.With an area of 270 hectares (over 29 hectares for the Kasbah)  and more than 100,000 people, the Medina comprises one-tenth of the population of Tunis. The planning of the Medina of Tunis has the distinction of not grid lines or formal geometric compositions. However, studies were undertaken in the 1930s with the arrival of the first anthropologists who found that the space of the Medina is not random: the houses are based on a socio-cultural code according to the types of complex human relations.\nDomestic architecture (palaces and townhouses), official and civilian (libraries and administrations), religious (mosques and zaou\u00efas) and services (commercial and fondouks) are located in the Medina. The notion of public space is ambiguous in the case of Medina where the streets are seen as an extension of the houses and subject to social tags. The concept of ownership is low however and souks often spill out onto public roads. Today, each district has its culture and rivalries can be strong.\nThe northern end supports the football club of Esperance Sportive de Tunis while at the other end is the rival Club Africain. The Medina also has a social sectorization: with the neighborhood of Tourbet el Bey and the Kasbah district being aristocratic, with a population of judges and politicians, while the streets of Pacha often being military and bourgeois.\nFounded in 698 is the Al-Zaytuna Mosque and the surrounding area which developed throughout the Middle Ages,  dividing Tunis into a main town in two suburbs, in the north (Bab Souika) and the south (Bab El Jazira). The area became the capital of a powerful kingdom during the Hafsid era, and was considered a religious and intellectual home and economic center for the Middle East, Africa and Europe. A great fusion of influences can be seen blending Andalusian styles with eastern influences, and Roman or Byzantine columns, and typical Arab architecture, characterized by the archways.\nThe architectural heritage is also omnipresent in the homes of individuals and small palace officials as well as in the palace of the sovereign of Kasbah. Although some palaces and houses date back to the Middle Ages, a greater number of prestigious houses were built in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries such as Dar Othman (early 17th century), Dar Ben Abdallah (18th century), Dar Hussein, Dar Cherif and other houses. The main palace beys are those of La Marsa, Bardo and Ksar Said. If we add the mosques and oratories (about 200), the madrasahs (El Bachia, Slimania, El Achouria, Bir El Ahjar, Ennakhla, etc..), The zaouias (Mahrez Sidi Sidi Ali Azouz, Sidi Abdel Kader, etc.) and Tourbet El Fellari, Tourbet Aziza Othman and Tourbet El Bey the number of monuments in Tunis approaches 600. Unlike Algiers, Palermo and Naples, its historical heart has never suffered from major natural disasters or urban radical interventions. The main conflicts and potentially destructive human behavior has been experienced in the city occurred relatively recently following the country's independence which it why it made into a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. At the beginning of the 21st century, the Medina is one of the best preserved urban locations in the Arab world.Furthermore, along the boulevards, the contribution of the architectural period 1850\u20131950 can be felt in the buildings, such as the government buildings of the nine ministries and the headquarters of the municipality of Tunis.\n\n\n=== Other landmarks ===\nThe Bardo Museum was originally a 13th-century Hafsid palace, located in the (then) suburbs of Tunis. It contains a major collection of Roman empires and other antiquities of interest from Ancient Greece, Tunisia, and from the Arab period.\nThe ruins of Carthage are nearby, along the coast to the northeast, with many ancient ruins.\n\n\n==== Souks ====\n\nThe souks are a network of covered streets lined with shops and traders and artisans ordered by specialty.  Clothing merchants, perfumers, fruit sellers, booksellers and wool merchants have goods at the souks, while fishmongers, blacksmiths and potters tend to be relegated to the periphery of the markets.\n\nNorth of the Al-Zaytuna Mosque is the Souk El Attarine, built in the early 18th century. It is known for its essences and perfumes. From this souk, there is a street leading to the Souk Ech-Chaouachine (chachia). The main company that operates it is one of the oldest in the country and they are generally descendants of Andalusian immigrants expelled from Spain. Attached to El Attarine are two other souks: the first, which runs along the western coast of the Al-Zaytuna Mosque, is the Souk El Kmach which is noted for its fabrics, and the second, the Souk El Berka, which was built in the 17th century and houses embroiderers and jewelers. Given the valuable items it sells, it is the only souk whose doors are closed and guarded during the night. In the middle there is a square where the former slave market stood until the middle of the 19th century.\nSouk El Berka leads to Souk El Leffa, a souk that sells all kinds of carpets, blankets and other weavings, and extends with the Souk Es Sarragine, built in the early 18th century and specializing in leather. At the periphery are the souks Et Trouk, El Blat, El Blaghgia, El K\u00e9babgia, En Nhas (copper), Es Sabbaghine (dyeing) and El Grana that sell clothing and blankets and was occupied by Jewish merchants.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Walls and gates ====\n\nFrom the early days of its founding, Tunis has been considered an important military base. The Arab geographer El Yacoubi has written that in the 9th century Tunis was surrounded by a wall of brick and clay except the side of the sea where it was stone.  Bab El-Jazeera, perhaps the oldest gate of the south wall, opened onto the southern road. Bab Cartagena gave access to Carthage, important for bringing in construction materials needed for the city. Bab Souika (initially known as Bab El Saqqayin) had a strategic role to keep the roads to Bizerte, B\u00e9ja and Le Kef. Bab Menara (initially known as Bab El Artha) opened onto the medina and on the suburb of El Haoua. As for El Bab Bhar, it allowed access to some funduqs where Christian merchants lived in Tunis.\nWith the development of the capital under the reign of the Hafsids, two emerging suburbs grew outside the walls; Bab El Jazira in the south and Bab Souika to the north. In the early 14th century, Hafsid Darba Ab\u00fb al-Muhammad al-Mustansir Lihy\u00e2n\u00ee ordered the construction of a second chamber including the Medina and two suburbs outside. Six new gates were built including Bab El Khadra, Bab Saadoun, Bab El Allouj (initially called Bab Er-Rehiba), Khalid or Bab Bab Sidi Abdallah Cherif, Bab El Fellah and Bab Alioua. In the Ottoman period, four new gates were established: Bab Laassal, Bab Sidi Abdesselam, Bab El Bab Gorjani and Sidi Kacem. The city retains some of these gates including Bab El Khadra, Bab El Bhar and Bab Jedid but some of the earlier ones have long disappeared.\n\n\n=== Places of worship ===\n\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslim mosques.   There are also Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tunis (Catholic Church), Protestant churches, Evangelical Churches.As in the rest of Tunisia, a very large majority of the population of Tunis (around 99%) is Sunni Muslim.  The capital is home to a large number of mosques in various architectural styles, signs of construction of their respective eras.  The main and oldest of them, is the Al-Zaytuna Mosque, founded in 698 and built in 732 and is in the heart of the Medina. Practicing the Maliki rite as the vast majority of Tunisia's Mosques. It was completely rebuilt in 864 and is a prestigious place of worship, and was long an important place of culture and knowledge with the University of Ez-Zitouna on the premises until the independence of Tunisia.  It still hosts the main ceremonies marking the dates on the Muslim calendar and is regularly attended by the president.\nThe medina contains most of the major mosques in the capital which were built before the advent of the French protectorate.  The mosque in the Kasbah, was founded in 1230.  Practicing the Hanafi rite since 1584, it is recognisable mainly by the dome as well as its minaret, similar to the Koutoubia in Marrakesh and is the highest in the city. Ksar Mosque, also of the Hanafi rite, is located in front of Dar Hussein (Bab Menara) and was built in the 12th century.  The Hammouda Pasha Mosque, built in 1655, is the second mosque built by the Hanafi rite in Tunis. Youssef Dey Mosque operated primarily as public speaking venue before becoming a real mosque in 1631. The Sidi Mahrez Mosque is the largest mosque Hanafi mosque in terms of area but not the tallest.  Built in 1692, it resembles the Ottoman S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul.  The Saheb Ettaba\u00e2 Mosque, built between 1808 and 1814 was the last mosque built by the Tunis Husseinites before the French occupation.The presence of modern churches in Tunis are also testimony to the French presence for half a century.  Tunis is the seat of the Diocese of Tunis, with the seat located at the Cathedral of St Vincent de Paul, The church was built in 1897 on the site of the old Christian cemetery of Saint-Antoine.  This includes a network of Catholic buildings, including the Church of St. Joan of Arc, but also with the Protestant Reformed Church and the Anglican church Saint-Georges.Greeks used to enjoy an important presence in the city since ancient times. Tunis is the headquarters of the Greek Orthodox Holy Archdiocese of Carthage with jurisdiction over Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia. It belongs to the Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa, and its cathedral, small school and other buildings are in Central Tunis.\nIn total, there are three Greek Orthodox and two Russian Orthodox parishes in Tunisia. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria also maintains jurisdiction in Tunisia.\nThe small Orthodox community is centred around the Greek Orthodox Church (1862), managed by the Greek Embassy and the Russian Orthodox Church (1957), reflecting the presence in Tunisia of a small colony of Russian immigrants.Judaism, meanwhile, enjoys a long tradition of presence in the city despite the emigration of a large part of the community after independence.  Among the places of worship are Beit Yaacouv Synagogue and especially the Great Synagogue of Tunis, built at the end of the 1940s to replace the former Great Synagogue which was demolished as part of the Jewish redevelopment area, the Hara.\n\n\n=== Parks and greenery ===\n\nTunis has some large parks, many of which were installed at the end of the 19th century by the authorities of the French protectorate. The largest Park, Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re Park, was founded in 1892 overlooks Lake Tunis. It is the oldest public park in the country and is built in the landscape style common to France.  The park covers an area of more than one hundred hectares across roads that can be explored on foot or by car. It is also home to Tunis Zoo, which houses African fauna, and the Museum of Modern Art.\nHabib Thameur garden in Tunis has a central pond and flower beds. The Gorjani garden, is an English garden located southwest of the city, which notably takes an irregular form, partly due to the steep topography of the land.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nLocated in an old beylical palace (the palace of the Bey of Tunis since the end of the 18th century), the Bardo National Museum (Tunis) is the most important archaeological museum in the Maghreb, and has one of the richest Roman mosaic collections in the world.  Its collections developed rapidly, thanks to numerous archaeological discoveries in the surrounding territory.\nIn 1964 the Dar Ben Abdallah, a palace probably dating back to the 18th century, became the seat of the capital's Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions.  In its exposition halls it holds numerous traditional items, witnesses of the everyday lives of families of the Medina quarter.\nThe Museum of the National Movement is situated in Dar Ma\u00e2kal Az-Za\u00efm, which was the residence of nationalist Habib Bourguiba for the entirety of the fight for independence.  After the advent of independence, a museum was built there to relate the details of the national struggle between 1938 and 1952.\nThe National Military Museum, opened in 1989 in the suburbs west of the city, holds a collection of 23,000 weapons, 13,000 of which date back to the 19th century, and some of which were used by the Tunisian troops during the Crimean War.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nTunis holds some of the most prestigious musical institutions in the country. The Rachidia was founded in 1934 to safeguard Arab music, and in particular to promote Tunisian and malouf music.  The group is made up of 22 members, both instrumental players and choral musicians.The Musical Troupe of the City of Tunis was created in 1954 by Salah El Mahdi. In 1955 he placed his student Mohamed Sa\u00e2da in charge of the ensemble, which at that time included the best artists, and later merged with the ensemble of Radio Tunis.  This group contributed to the rise to stardom of numerous Tunisian singers, including Oulaya.\nThe Association of Arab Orchestra of the City of Tunis began its activities at the end of April 1982, as a workshop linked to the cultural center of the city.  It worked on promoting Arab music, on music education and training, and on cooperation with various partners both in Tunisia and abroad.  The Tunisian Symphony Orchestra, created in 1969 by the Minister of Culture, has also produced monthly concerts at the Municipal Theater and in various cultural spaces in the city.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nTunis is a center of Tunisian culture. The Th\u00e9\u00e2tre municipal de Tunis, opened on 20 November 1902, showcases opera, ballet, symphonic concerts, drama, etc. On the stage of this theater, many performances are regularly given by Tunisian, Arabic and international actors. The National Theatre of Tunisia is an important public enterprise in Tunis, and since 1988 been located in the Khaznadar palace (dating from the middle of the 19th century and situated in the Halfaouine quarter), renamed \"Theater Palace.\" In 1993, it also took possession of the former movie theater Le Paris, with a 350-person seating capacity.  During each \"cultural season\" (from October 1 to 30 June) the theater holds over 80 events.  The Al Hamra theater was the second theater to be opened in Tunis, situated on El Jazira Road.  Al Hamra was one of the most famous theaters in the capital during the 1930s and 1940s.  After being closed for fifteen years, it was turned into a small theater in 1986, and since 2001 has housed the first Arab-African center for theater training and research.  One should also note the El Teatro and \u00c9toile du Nord theater groups.\nOther arts are also represented in the capital. The National Center of the Arts established the puppet theatre in 1976.  The National School of Circus Arts was founded following a meeting between the Director of the National Theater and the Director General of the National Center for Arts of Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne (France) in 1998. In addition, various small theatres and cultural centres are scattered throughout the city and display various artistic performances.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nFilm producers and cinema have long been present in the city of Tunis. The first animated film was shown in Tunis by the Lumiere brothers as early as 1896. The first screenings were held the following year and the first cinema, the Omnia Path\u00e9, opened in October 1908. The first film club opened in Tunis in 1946 and the Globe, in 1965. The Carthage Film Festival is the oldest established film festival in Africa, running biennially until 2014 and annually thereafter.\nIn 1990, Ferid Boughedir shot the notable film Halfaouine Child of the Terraces in Halfaouine district. The films The English Patient (1996) and The Last Days of Pompeii (2003) were also shot in studios in Tunis.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nThe city holds several festivals each year, of which the largest is the International Festival of Carthage which takes place in July and August. Founded in 1964, much of the festival is held in an old amphitheater of Carthage (with a capacity of 7,500 seats), and hosts the performances of singers, musicians, actors, dancers and films on display on outdoor screens.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nTunis and its suburbs have many of the major Tunisian universities including the University of Tunis, Tunisia Private University, University of Ez-Zitouna, the University of Tunis \u2013 El Manar, the University of Carthage and the Manouba University. It therefore has the highest concentration of students in Tunisia, with a student population of 75,597 as of 2006.\n\nThere are also a number of other post-secondary institutions, such as the National School of Engineers of Tunis, the National School of Science, the Graduate School of Communications of Tunis, and the Higher Institute of Technological Studies in Communications of Tunis. In addition, private training institutes include the Open University of Tunis, the Central University Private Business Administration and Technology, the Graduate School of Private Engineering and Technology, and the North African Institute of Economics and Technology.\nAmong the high schools in the capital, the best-known are the Lyc\u00e9e de la Rue du Pacha (founded 1900), Lyc\u00e9e Bab El Khadhra, Lyc\u00e9e de la Rue de Russie, Lyc\u00e9e Bourguiba (formerly Lyc\u00e9e Carnot de Tunis), and the Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui. Until independence, Sadiki College (founded 1875) and Khaldounia (founded 1896) were also among the most recognized. A legacy of the French presence in the country remains, and the city retains many French schools, the most important being the Lyc\u00e9e Pierre Mendes-France at Mutuelleville.\nStudents can pursue language studies at small private schools such as Sidi Bou Said Centre for Languages (Centre Sidi Bou Said de Langues et d'Informatique) in the picturesque Tunis suburb of Sidi Bou Said, next to the Sidi Bou Said TGM station that specializes in Arabic, offering classes in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), classical Arabic, Tunisian Arabic and the various dialects of North Africa, the Gulf and the Levant.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nTunis has some of the most important libraries in Tunisia including the National Library of Tunisia which was first installed in 1924 in the Medina, in a building built in 1810 by Hammouda Bey to serve as barracks for troops and then a jail.  The library moved to its current location on Boulevard 9 April in 1938. The new building contains a reading room, conference room, laboratories, an exhibition gallery, a block of technical and administrative services, a restaurant, a parking and green space areas.\nHoused in a former home of a Hafsid scholar, the library of the Khaldounia was founded in 1896 along with the creation of the educational institution. After independence and following the consolidation of programs of education, the association ceased operations but the library is now linked to the National Library, which provides for its management.Built in the 17th century, the Dar Ben Achour also contains a library. Acquired in the late 1970s by the municipality of Tunis, the house was restored in 1983 into a library.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nTunis is served by the Tunis-Carthage International Airport. The growing metropolitan area is served by an extensive network of public transportation including buses, an above-ground light rail system (le Metro), as well a regional train line (the TGM) that links the city centre to its closest northern suburbs. Multi-lane autoroutes surround the city and serve the increasing number of privately owned cars one encounters in Tunisia.\nThe Tunis area is served by the m\u00e9tro l\u00e9ger (Ar.: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0631\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0641\u064a\u0641 \u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633) and TGM (Tunis-Goulette-Marsa), as well as bus services, and is linked to other places in Tunisia by SNCFT, the national railways. The important transport authorities are the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Transports de Tunis (STT) and the Ministry of Transport (Airports)\n\nThe A1 motorway connects Tunis with Sfax to the south, and the A3 with Oued Zarga and B\u00e9ja to the west, while the A4 is the link with Bizerte.\nThe city has, as of the beginning of the 21st century, a public transportation system developed under the management of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des transports de Tunis (STT). In addition to some 200 bus routes, the first light rail line opened in 1985. The M\u00e9tro l\u00e9ger de Tunis network has extended gradually since then to reach the suburbs. The capital is also linked to its northern suburbs by the railway line that crosses the lake, dividing the lake into two.\nA new mass transit was planned for Greater Tunis in 2009. This was the RTS (rapid rail network), the local equivalent of the Paris RER, which was to carry tens of thousands of travellers from the distant suburbs of Tunis to the centre by using either existing tracks or new tracks yet to be built. The plan was for lines based on certain criteria such as population density and the lack of coverage for a given area. Among the priority lines were: Tunis-Borj C\u00e9dria (23 km) where modernization and electrification are already planned; Tunis-Mohamedia-Fouchana (19.4 km); Tunis-Manouba-Mnihla (19.2 km); Tunis-Ezzouhour-Sidi Hassine S\u00e9joumi (13.9 km). In addition, the TGM will be integrated into the light-rail network and a new line built around Ayn Zaghouan and Bhar Lazrag (8.4 km). Such an operation would require the upgrading of the docks' TGM stations so that they become suitable for light rail trains. Among other projects are a line to the city of Ennasr (8.4 km) and the extension of the Tunis-Ettadhamen to Mnihla (1.7 km). For its part, the south light-rail line was extended in November 2008 to El Mourouj with a length of 6.8 kilometres (4.2 miles). The total length of the network will eventually be in the range of 84 km (52 mi).\n\n\n=== Infrastructure ===\n\nTunis is served by Tunis-Carthage International Airport, located 8 kilometers (5.0 mi) northeast of downtown, which began operating in 1940 under the name of Tunis El Aouina.  The terminal had 4.4 million passengers (35.98% of total airport traffic in the country) in 2006.  In 2007 that increased to 6 million passengers with a rise in tourism to the city.\nAfter independence, in the 1960s, the National Board of Seaports, which supports all ports in the country, modernized the infrastructure of the port of Tunis.  In the 21st Century, the port of Tunis underwent further transformation with a marina as part of the redevelopment district of La Petite Sicile.\nTunis is the starting point from which the main roads and all highways that serve different parts of the country of Tunis originate.  This city has a high density of traffic because vehicle ownership is rising at 7.5% per year.  The capital is home to approximately 40% of the cars in Tunisia, with 700,000 cars on average used in the city per day.  In this context, major road infrastructure (bridges, interchanges, roads, etc..) was initiated in the late 1990s to decongest the main areas of the capital.  The main roads to other Tunisian cities include: Autoroute A1, Tunis-Sfax; Autoroute A3, Tunis-Oued Zarga; and Autoroute A4, Tunis-Bizerte. Also, as part of the major infrastructure project, the city's traffic lights were increased from 5,000 to 7,500.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, a number of sports institutions were established in Tunis, particularly in school and college settings. In 1905 the Muslim Association of Tunisia brought together students from Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui and Sadiki College to organize gymnastics. A regional gymnastics competition was held in Tunis in 1912 with the participation of thousands of French gymnasts. Football made its appearance in the capital on 15 September 1904, followed by the formal creation of the country's first league, the Racing Club Tunis, on 11 May 1905. It took some time to run properly but soon organized meetings between the teams in schools. The first took place on 9 June 1907, between teams from Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui and Lyc\u00e9e Carnot (1\u20131).\nBut football is not the only discipline to emerge. Between 1928 and 1955 the city hosted nine rounds of the Grand Prix of Tunis, where notable drivers such as Marcel Lehoux, Achille Varzi, Tazio Nuvolari and Rudolf Caracciola took part. The Grand Prix of Tunis has re-emerged since 2000. The city has also held the Mediterranean Games twice, in 1967 and 2001, and the international tennis tournament, the Tunis Open, which is included in the ATP Challenger Series. The 2005 World Championship final for men in team handball was played in Tunis.\nIn total the governorate of Tunis registered 24,095 licences for various clubs in the municipal area in 2007. The city further put itself onto the international basketball map as it hosted the FIBA Africa Championship 1965 and the FIBA Africa Championship 1987.\n\nThe Esperance Sportive de Tunis (EST), Club Africain (CA), and Stade Tunisien are the major sports clubs in the city. A symbolic class difference is present between the EST's and the CA's supporters, despite their playing at the same stadium. The EST is supported by the majority of the masses, while the CA, a poorer club, is supported by the others.\nThe first true sports facilities were managed under the French protectorate, as illustrated by the development of the Ksar Said racecourse and construction of the Stade Chedli Zouiten in the neighborhood of Belvedere, which had long been the main stadium in the capital before being supplanted by the Olympic stadium, Stade El Menzah, where EST and CA play their football today. The Olympic stadium and village area was built to accommodate the Mediterranean Games in 1967. A 60,000-seat stadium was also built in Rad\u00e8s for the Mediterranean Games in 2001 at an estimated cost of 170 million dinars, with nearly half of the loans financed by South Korean businessmen. The Olympic village was financed by an investment estimated at 50 million dinars.  In 2008, the government announced the start of construction of a large sports complex that will include several sports academies, a 20,000-seat stadium, and a swimming centre. Known as Tunis Sports City, it will expand around the lake of Tunis, on the road to La Marsa.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nTunis is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Other cooperations ===\n\n\n== Notable inhabitants ==\n\nIbn Khaldun (1332\u20131406), Arab sociologist and scholar\nTahar Haddad (1899\u20131935), promoter of women's emancipation in Tunisia\nAlbert Memmi (1920-2020), French writer and sociologist\nSalah El Mahdi (1925\u20132014), musicologist and composer\nAlberto Pellegrino (1930\u20131996), Italian fencer\nPhillip King (born 1934), British sculptor\nFouad Mebazaa (born 1933), politician, President of Tunisia in 2011\nNicola Pietrangeli (born 1933), Italian tennis player\nPierre Darmon (born 1934), French tennis player\nGeorges Wolinski (1934\u20132015), French illustrator and caricaturist\nRoberto Blanco (born 1937), German pop singer and actor\nYazid Zerhouni (born 1937), Algerian politician\nClaudia Cardinale (born 1938), Italian actress\nFatma Moalla (born 1939), mathematician\nMustapha Ben Jafar (born 1940), Tunisian politician\nAlain Boublil (born 1941), French musical author\nAbdelwahab Meddeb (1946\u20132014), Tunisian-French writer and radio staff\nSerge Adda (1948\u20132004), president of the French TV channel TV5\nSophie Bessis, (born 1947), Franco-Tunisian historian, journalist and researcher\nTarak Ben Ammar (born 1949), film producer\nBertrand Delano\u00eb (born 1950), mayor of Paris\nKarine Chemla (born 1958), historian of mathematics and sinologist\nAbdellatif Kechiche (born 1960), French film director, screenwriter and actor\nChokri El Ouaer (born 1966), Tunisian football goalkeeper\nAmel Karboul (born 1973), Tunisian entrepreneur, business consultant and politician\nMarc Gicquel (born 1977), French tennis player\nKhaled Mouelhi (born 1981), Tunisian footballer\nKarim Saidi (born 1983), Tunisian footballer\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBarbary pirates\nTunisian Community Center\nTunisian Italians\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nJellal Abdelkafi, La m\u00e9dina de Tunis, \u00e9d.

          "Carthage stands out in any American's minds if we recollect our ancient history classes, but there is so little left that it was disappointing. After spending time in Roman and other Italian cities, plus seeing the remains in Sicily, I don't thing Carthage is worth the time to",
          "Great place to visit. I went in the afternoon and just before the storm hit. Would not recommend in mid summer months as not a lot of shade. The actual museum building was under renovation so could not enter but walked around the grounds and the views on a clear day are WOW!",
          "You can visit the grounds of, and ruins around the museum which itself is c l osed for renovations but you can pay the entry (also good for all the sites) and visit the ruins around the museum, but there are not interesting.",
          "The museum was closed for renovation on the date of our visit (June 2019), so we paid the entrance ticket just to walk around the yard, where there is nothing really impressive to see. Just a few fragments of stone walls, fragments of mosaics, fragments of statues. All just",
          "Entrance is included as part of the 12tnd ticket for all 8 of the main sites. Unfortunately, the museum was closed for renovation but the outside areas were still worth seeing especially for the impressive views of the city.",
          "Me and my wife went on this tour a private tour for only \u00a340 each through the hotel reception. it was extremely good value. ful day with Carthage sidi bou said and Tunis. best time ever. museum itself was closed but the ticket includes every sight in 12 DN. definitely worth",
          "You will want to go here to collect your ticket to see the 6-8 sights where you can see more remains of Carthage. The Museum grounds have some pieces and archeological digs, but the best part is the view down to the ancent harbour. From Byrsa Hill to the double harbour is",
          "If you are planning your trip it's helpful to know that the actual museum is currently closed. However, the ticket covers all 6 or 8 sites in Carthage, so still well worth it. The Bardo Museum is open if you want to see more mosaic floors from the ruins.",
          "This was part of a package tour including Sidi Bou Said and Tunis. I would happily have forgone the other 2 and spent the day wandering around these ruins and the Antonian Baths down below. Plenty to see and if the weather is nice ;-) a great day out.",
          "I think the actual museum will be \"renovated\" yet for a long time, but the views from the outdoor complex are outstanding. You can see Tunis, and also Sidi Bou Said on the other side.",
          "Carthage National Museum is a national museum in Byrsa, Tunisia. The museum sits atop Byrsa Hill, in the heart of the city of Carthage. Lots of history of this historic place and its impact in our civilization.",
          "Arriving in May, I was hoping to visit as many sites as I could in one day around Carthage, and while the cathedral next to the museum was open, the museum itself was closed. What was bizarre though is a man was still charging a few dinar to enter the museum grounds, with",
          "Yes it would have been nice to see information and exhibits in the building that is being renovated, but the exterior ruins were enough to keep a history lover like me happy. Yes, there could have been more explanations on layout etc (and some will definitely say that!), but",
          "There is still plenty to see and do outside. A few ruins and spots for pics. But the ticket you buy gets you in to all the sites in the area. The roman theater, the baths, villas, etc. Early or late evening is best as there are many tour buses in the middle of the day.",
          "We were told it was closed due to renovations and would be for several months Very little appeared to be happening. We still had a worthwhile time by looking at the limited remains of the capital including Punic housing and a few pieces of marble. The view was very nice and gave",
          "Did a quick walk around this place. There is not a lot to see, especially if you are going to be traveling to sites outside of Tunis. The place is well maintained and the Museum itself had a few interesting pieces in it. Remember that your ticket price includes 5 other sites in",

          "If you are in Tunisia, you should not miss this museum. It is located on what is believed to be the berth of the Carthage -Punic civilization, with a 360 views from the hills over the Mediterranean, the Lake and the city. Be sure to be with a guide, to have a full pictures of",
          "The ruins are something to see but the museum has nothing exceptional and felt like a scam. At 3\u00a3 per person it wasn\u2019t expensive but a waste of time as the history is all outside in the ruins",
          "Our guide was indifferent, but if we had not gone here we would never have understood Carthage. The museum is at the top of the hill that was Carthage and the successor Roman city. The museum is pretty small, but all marked and has maps and items that bring home Carthage in",
          "The museum on the site leaves a lot to be desired, especially compared to the Bardo. The museum is just part of the site, with other areas around the site to roam and explore old Roman ruins. Piles of old marble columns, various statues, and good views of Tunis and the old Punic",

          "This museum is rather deceiving. We paid 10 dinars to tour well scrubbed ruins with a guide. According to the guide Carthage a nice city was constantly being attacked by the Romans. You see the remains of their small houses maybe four and some statues expertly carved. You can",

          "An open ground of history. A museum full of mosaics and Roman and Phoenician statues, buildings. Bi lingual and even trilingual guides. Just a step away from the basilique St Augustin, the 5 star hotel La villa Didon, the train station that takes you to downtown Tunis or Sidi",
          "This museum is not massive (a good thing in my opinion) but really gets you up close and personal with the ruins of Carthage. There was a man on site who had been there for 40 years- he gave us a walking tour (in English), pointing various points of interest and even condensing",
          "The museum has a large collection of old historic statues, coins, weapons, and other great stuff for the old civilizations. it's worth the visit.",
          "This is a wonderful place to visit. You can get a card for all five historic sites in carthage for only ten dinar. There are plenty of clean toilets. A nice little souvenir shop abd basic cafe. Little market stalls outside entrance. Fabulous views over tunis. From sousse you",
          "On self guided tour of ruins and area. Read in tour book that it was worth a peek. It is. Cost is 10dinar and the area is well signed. Guides are available for donation. Good display of various artifacts of different cultures that occupied area.",

          "There's some pretty cool mosaics here, but if you're mosaic-ed out, I'd recommend skipping...BUT. Do go to the grounds--from the outside of the museum you get AMAZING views of the city! Also, the parking lot is full of souvenir vendors. If you're looking for Carthage souvenirs,",
          "It's about 1500 sq foot museum it's got some artefacts but I didn't find the information supplied helpful at all, I would like to read more about what we were watching, but no one there again to help or ask, a lot more information required",
          "Well worth a visit, it will surprise you exactly how big this building was, unfortunately all that is left is the underground heating system - it's also adjacent to their presidential palace so the grounds are patrolled by soldiers",
          "While living for a few months I was exploring the area of the Great Tunis. Carthage is one of the closest attractions. The Carthage Museum is one of three major places that are worth visiting here. I have spent there a few hours rambling through ruins of Roman buildings, antic",
          "Fantastic history at Byrsa Hill, Carthage .Awesome view overlooking Tunis. Amazing monuments and ruins.If you love history this is a definite must!!",
          "If visiting Tunis and Carthage to explore, see and experience the great past of Tunisian ancient history, you must include the Carthage Museum. Make yourself prepared by bring a guidebook as the information in english is sparse. E.g. on the first floor of the museum building",
          "Worth going to see. Lots of great artifacts and the view is spectacular. You can take as long as you'd like to really see everything. There is also a cathedral attached that you can visit.",
          "If you go to Carthage you should pop in here for a look as it is right on the site. It is small with not a lot in it but it is interesting with most items explained in English (Arabic and French too).",
          "Both the Museum and the grounds have limited about of \"treasures\".... pleasant enough but quite basic in content and information. Worth a quick visit if you are there, but don't designate a huge amount of time. Nice clean washrooms, and they are free",
          "Amazing tour of this site. Passion of our Thomas cook tour guide would be hard to beat. To be able to walk around this wonderful place in history is awe inspiring.",
          "The museum has a small collection of Punic and Roman era artifacts and one large mosaic as well as outdoor ruins. Next door is a huge Roman Catholic church that was seized by the government and is locked shut.",
          "Very enjoyable experience substantially enhanced by the guide without whom we would have been confused at times -the layout is not easy to understand in parts.",
          "The museum was ok...the grounds were blocked off to really get a close look at the ruins. Great views and overall a nice visit. You get to see many other sites with the price of this ticket.",
          "In many nations this site would be better protected and more information available to tourists. This was haphazard....interesting but given the historical significance could have been much better.",
          "The museum is a little confusing for English speakers. While many exhibits have English translation (along with Arabic and French), they are dated and most don't include date(s) of artifact. Also many are replicas and/or reconstruction, but not necessarily identified as such.",
          "I've always wanted to come to an ancient historical site like this. Being here was like a dream come true and I can spend hours in this place. I would recommend having a guide to bring you around and explain to you in detail about the history of Tunisia and the story behind the",
          "The museum is a must see, shows really interesting items and the displays are well explained. However, I agree with a few that the displays are showing too much information in one place as the so many items are gathered in one place, so you can miss a few.",
          "The history represented is fantastic, but some displays are just \"lumped\" together without much care.",
          "We visited this museum as part of our visit to Carthage. The museum has a number of interesting exhibits and artifacts. As noted by others, this museum pales in comparison to the Bardo. Admission is included in the admission to the ruins.",
          "I have dreamed of coming to Carthage my entire life. The works hear are amazing and worth the visit. Also make sure you go down to the port and see where the old military ships were.",
          "A great tour made better by a great tour guide. Beautiful pictures and a great array of artefacts to view and take pictures of, only 1 dinar per camera which is truly well worth it. But be careful not to walk to far up the hill towards the palace as armed police/ army stop you",
          "This is a small collection of artifacts from the local ruins. They are nice but if you are used to seeing museums in Italy with Roman ruins, this may disappoint you. There is some cool things like painted ostrich eggs, coins, ceramics and mosaics. There is a charge to enter.",
          "This is an extremely interesting museum with a good overview of the local history. Although relatively small, it's worth the visit if you're interested in archaeology and history, and there are some truly amazing mosaics and statues here. It's definitely worth the stopover on",
          "The best bits are in the Bardo museum in Tunis but some interesting displays of every day objects. A few beautiful glass jugs and a great statue of a Silene carried by satyres",
          "This museum is located at the main entrance site to the ruins. There was not much explanation about what the exhibits were but fortunately we had a guide who was an archaeology professor who was greatly helpful in explaining what we were seeing. If you are pressed for time you",

          "It is clear that the Tunisians are trying to build their tourism industry. The museum houses an impressive collection of mosaic art from various eras. It was fine, but a little too much of one thing. I have attached a few pictures with other featured displays.",

          "The guides in there will tell you a lot of stories, stuff you might not have read in the history books. It's a bit of an enlightenment. The place is small littered with columns and slabs of rocks. It's nice to combine with visit to the Punic Port Museum.",

          "There is an amazing view from this vantage point, You can look down into the city of Carthage and see the Punic Port and the mountains in the distance. There are several marble statues, although broken, they have tried to display what is left of the, Tunisia does not have a lot",
          "I was expecting a museum full of Roman artifacts and that's what, in part, it is. I was knocked out by the Carthaginian artifacts too. Well kept, well presented, easy to find you way around. Signage is excellent. If you are interested in the Carthaginian civilisation, the Punic",
          "I was very very disappointed in this museum. Display was poor. I could not get anything new out from Tunisia's history from this museum. Punic Tunisia? Roman Tunisia? Muslim Tunisia? And their stories? Where were they? I was very disappointed. Tunisia has much more to offer. The",

          "Don't have great expectations about this museum. Small budgets mean Punic and Roman artefacts aren't numerous, or even particularly well preserved or displayed. However, to get an idea of the scale of mosaics or the minutiae of Carthaginian life (jewellery, weapons, pottery),",
          "Although there lies the history i was totally shocked to see how the tunisians underestimated the ruins and the importance of history. The displays were so rotten and the ruins were badly displayed, if these ruins were in europe i am sure this place will be very popular place",

          "If the Bardo is still under renovation, you will see a lot more at the Carthage Museum a bit out of town (about 20 minutes or so on train). Most of the exhibits have French and or English explanations and you can also walk around the ruins. There is also a large mosaic",
          "It is a pity how much more this museum could make out of the fascinating site of ancient Carthage, the city's long, proud & at times violend history both in Punic & Roman times. Instead, this museum is a collection of few (!) old shards, mosics and statues with little",
          "We have bought the permit to Tunis three days before flying away, but I have already known that I want to visit. The well-known phrase: \u201cCarthage should be destroyed\u201c has defined one of places for visiting (main thing). Time for gathering is not enough, but I have familiarized"

        "wiki": "Houmt Souk (Tunisian Arabic: \u062d\u0648\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0642\u200e \u1e24\u016bmet es S\u016bq), meaning literally: \"The Market neighborhood\", is a commune and the main town of the island of Djerba, Tunisia. A popular tourist destination, it is best known for its traditional souk (market) and the Aghlabid fortress.\nIt is located at approximately 20 km (12 miles) from Ajim and 22 km (14 miles) from El Kantara by the Roman road. It is also the chief town and a municipality with 75,904 inhabitants. The city itself shelters a population of 44,555 inhabitants as of 2005. The city developed on the old site of a Roman city called Gerba or Girba which had the honor of giving birth to two Roman Emperors, Trebonianus Gallus and his son Volusianus.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe city as it is today developed on the site of an ancient Roman city called Gerba or Girba, which shared its name with the island.  Many besides the Romans lived there, including Numidians, Punics, Arabs, Spanish, and Turks; the town was also home to many merchants and pirates for many years.  The Battle of Djerba took place in the northern part of the city.  Close to the fort is a large village which served as a market; cattle and woolen cloth were traded there, as were dried grapes.  Under the French protectorate (1881\u20131956) the island was divided into twelve sheikhates.  French soldiers entered the town on July 28, 1881, and it remained a garrison until 1890, when its administration passed to civil French authority.  In 1956, upon Tunisian independence, it became the capital of Djerba.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHoumt Souk is located on a plain on the northern coast of Djerba.  There is an artesian well, called Bir Erroumi, 767 meters deep, which was dug under French rule.  The city is divided into several districts; the three major ones are Taourit, Boumellel, and Hara El K' will bira, which in turn includes neighborhoods like Fatou, Thouirane, Houmet Eljouamaa and Binibandou.  These three districts are located in the northern part of town.  The climate of the city is moderate, with a semi-arid tendency, and receives a breeze from the sea in summer.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nDue to the density of the city center, its architectural character sometimes differs from that of the rest of the island.  The typical menzel may especially be noticeably different; in addition, a new architectural style in which the courtyard is missing may be seen in some more modern houses.  Dominant colors remain sharp white for masonry and sky blue for doors and windows.  The city has several small streets connected by arcades, and there are a number of covered souks like that of Errba\u00e2, or the more recent Central Market.\nFondouks in town, dating back several centuries, often follow the same building style; a generally square courtyard with a group of stores may be found at ground level, along with a door with a heavy lock.  This is sometimes joined by an attic window in the area were goods were stored.  Animals, carts and equipment were sheltered in the yard.  The first floor, reached by a single staircase, has a gallery supported by columns and arches; this is often the point of access for a number of rooms or storerooms.  Many such buildings may still be seen in the downtown area, where they have been turned into hotels and youth hostels; some have even become tourist malls. The coastal area, formerly deserted, is becoming increasingly urbanized.\n\n\n=== Religious buildings ===\n\nAs befits a Muslim country, mosques are numerous in the city, and their architecture varies greatly.  Several are built in a style native to the island, among which is the Jema\u00e2 El Ghorba (literally mosque from abroad) of the Maliki rite.  The Jema\u00e2 Ettrouk (mosque of the Turks), of the Hanafi rite, dates back to the 18th century and is equipped with a minaret typical of Ottoman style.  There is also the Sidi Brahim El Jemni, built in 1674, with a roof with multiple vaults and a zaouia containing the tomb of a saint.  These three mosques are classified as historic buildings.  Sidi Bouakkazine, located near the public library, is built of centuries-old green tiles, and also houses a zaouia with a saint's tomb.  Called Lella Gmira, this is visited most often by women suffering from infertility; they wash and light a candle there in the hope of gaining a blessing, and perhaps giving birth.\n\nA little further out of town, on the road to Ajim, may be seen the Sidi Bouzid of the Ibadi rite.  Sidi Salem and Sidi Youssef are located on the new speedway to the airport, and the Jema\u00e2 Ejdid may be seen on the road to Mellita.   Jama\u00e2 Echeikh, Jema\u00e2 El Bassi and Jema\u00e2 El Guellal are in the same neighborhood in the south-east of Houmt Souk.\nLegends surround a number of the town's mosques.  Sidi Zitouni, located not far from Jama\u00e2 Ettrouk and which houses another saint's tomb as well as the Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions, is one of them.  According to lore, the mosque is inhabited by djinns that appear only in the early evening.  Consequently, Djerbians will leave the mosque only at sunset.  Another story concerns Jema\u00e2 El Guellal: supposedly a potter in the eighteenth century put his pots, which had taken months to craft, on a cart to be taken to market.  While on the road the cart overturned, dropping its contents to the ground.  The potter nevertheless decided to save what he could, discovering with great astonishment that all his wares were intact.  Upon selling them, and seeing divine intervention in the episode, he chose to build a mosque at the site of the accident.\nJam\u00e2a Tajdid, whose construction was begun in the nineteenth century and entrusted to Abou Messeouar, is on the road to Midoun.  Messeouar completed the work with the help of his son.There are several small synagogues in Hara El K'bira and Hara Sghira districts, the latter being a community of around 100 Jews. In addition, a Catholic church may be found in the center of town, and a Greek Orthodox structure is located near the port, by the hotel Lottos, one of the island's first hotels.\n\n\n=== Borj El K'bir Fort ===\n\nThe Borj El K'bir is a castle and fort that was constructed on the waterfront in 1432 under Sultan Ab\u00fb F\u00e2ris `Abd Al `Az\u00eez Al-Mutawakkil.  It is also known as Borj El Ghazi Mustapha because it was added to significantly between 1560 and 1567, during the reign of the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent.  A commemorative statue in marble, originally sealed in one of the fort's interior walls, is now on display at the Bardo National Museum in Tunis.  Excavations have been made within the structure, revealing much of its history; some of the artifacts discovered are now on display inside one of the rooms of the fort.  From the top of the walls may be had a panoramic view over the port; also visible from this location is the nine-meter-high obelisk which indicates the site of Borj-er-Rous, the Tower of Skulls, built using the bones of Dragut's enemies executed after his victory, in July 1560, against a coalition made up of soldiers from Spain,  Naples, Sicily, Lombardy, Germany, France, and the Knights of Malta.  The tower was conical in shape, 34 feet in diameter at its base. It was removed in 1848 under orders from the capital.  Today the bones are buried in the Christian cemetery of the city.  The obelisk which replaced the tower was constructed under the rule of France.\nJust opposite the fort, behind the old city hospital, there exists a cistern, dating back to Roman times, which is used for the collection of rainwater.\n\n\n=== Other buildings of note ===\n\nAmong the other characteristic buildings, one can quote the fondouks, lodging warehouses for the goods. The cupola of the combatants (Goubbat El Moujahdine), near Jema\u00e2 Ettrouk, is a small square construction, with wrought iron, which shelters three tombs that of venerated inhabitants of Houmt Souk and is regarded as a zaou\u00efa. There is the Hammam El Barouni, a Turkish bath which goes back to several centuries and which, renovated on several occasions, continues to be used.  Old bakeries, workshops of weaving (of which the architecture is particular in Djerba) with their half-vaults and their triangular pediment of Greek style and the old wells (with their large wings) which were useful for the irrigation of the fields of barley, of sorghum and pulses also have a typical architecture. The Errba\u00e2 souk, market hall formed in a labyrinth with the roofs in semi-vaults, gathered the craftsmen tailors, shoe-makers, jewellers. Its doors closed at the falling night and much of stores remained closed on Saturdays taking into account the high number of Jewish tradesmen and craftsmen who had their graves there. The market is currently very popular with tourists.\nA large theatre in the open air, built in 2004 between the zone of the port and Borj El K' to bir, shelters the great cultural events including those of the annual festival of Ulysses. Houmt Souk counts several schools as well primary as secondary (of which several colleges and colleges) but also a post office (in a characteristic building going back to French protectorate), several banks, a public hospital and several private clinics, several pharmacies, a tourist bureau and a trade unions initiative. There is also several small hotels built under the French protectorate.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nHoumt Souk is the most populated city of Djerba; it only shelters with it more of the third of the population of the island. Houmt Souk and its neighbourhoods have a very high density: it was already of 474 inhabitants per km \u00b2 in 1956 whereas the average of the island was of 127 inhabitants per km \u00b2 and that of the remainder of Tunisia of 27 inhabitants per km \u00b2. Maltese, Muslim Italians, French, Arabo-Berber Greeks, Jews and Christians (Catholic and Greek Orthodox) have lived a long time side by side with Houmt Souk. From the 1950s a migratory movement primarily turned towards France reduced the population considerably; European and Jewish inhabitants of Houmt Souk. Several thousand Jews were concentrated in Hara El K' will bira, a district formerly exclusively Jewish and where the density remains very high. This district saw many Muslim families coming from the south of Tunisia after the departure of Jewish families, and this especially after independence. One of the districts of Houmt Souk, called Houmet Ejjouma\u00e2, is inhabited in majority by families coming from Beni Khedache. These families have brought different traditions, including celebration of religious holidays.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe coexistence of various ethnicities (in particular Berber, Arab and black African) and of various religious beliefs contributed to the richness and the variety of the cultures and traditions of this locality. The island of Djerba is a true mosaic of cultures and traditions and even the accent of its inhabitants varies from one locality to another, thus the Houmt Souk accent is different from the other localities.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nHoumt Souk shelters a Museum of arts and traditions popular which presents a panorama of Djerba history. Installed in old a zaou\u00efa built at the end of the 18th century in the honor of Sidi Zitouni and Sidi Ameur, not far from the \"Mosque from Abroad\", it is possible to discover the folklore of the island, its traditions and its economy from jewels and colored glass, pottery,  weaving looms, and the traditional costumes of various social groups, kitchen utensils, one workshop of pottery, and jars which were used to preserve foodstuffs such as barley, sorghum, olive oil or dried meat. These earthenware jars bear different names -  sefri, khabia' ' , tass' ' or zir - and their opening depends on the intended products to be preserved there.\n\n\n=== Clothes ===\nThe inhabitants of Djerba, in particular the women, wear traditional costumes which may also differ between locality. The women of Houmt Souk do not normally wear a hat contrary to the woman of Guellala - for whom the traditional hat is an important accessory. The woman of Houmt Souk typically drape themselves in a white dress, without embroidery.\nHowever the veil often has different names and colors in other localities of island: and may be navy blue with small squares with Guellala or Midoun or embroidered white of red and yellow with Mahboubine or Mellita; and named fouta or hrem. The Jews of Houmt Souk, both male and female wear traditional clothes similar to those of the Muslim inhabitants but who can however be distinguished by a black band at the bottom of the trousers, known as a seroual arbi. With the interior, the woman of Houmt Souk typically wear a  houli, multicoloured, made out of cotton or natural silk and increasingly in modern society out of synthetic fibre. Under this may be embroidered sleeves called hassara or khabbaia. The clothing of the men in Houmt Souk also differs from that of the Djerbiens of the other localities of the island.\n\n\n=== Traditions ===\nMuch of the practices and the cultural traditions of the city are also different from those of the other localities. These include ceremonies of marriage, circumcision, religious holidays, etc. Traditionally, in new year the children of Houmt Souk went from house in house and sang typical songs (like ' ' khachia, khachiiti, waatini khachiiti\u2026 ' '), sometimes disguised as characters called Guerdellif and Aljia, which played a spectacle of song and dance and received gifts of money, dried fruits or candy. During the three days of A\u00efd el-Fitr, also called  Arfa Kaddhabia, Arfa Es or Arfa will el-Kebira, the children enjoy a greater freedom: and typically receive gifts of money from their parents and visit the market, often in groups to buy toys, and items for the house particularly for the kitchen. During the new year the families of Houmt Souk still nowadays send to their married daughters a large meal, often dried meat (' ' kaddid' ') sheep or calf killed at the time of the festival,  with hard boiled eggs, chick peas and broad beans. The woman who receives such a dish offers in return a gift of money for the giver.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nTourism brought a certain prosperity to the local population. The city counts a multitude of restaurants and souvenir shops which attract a varied crowd daily, with tourists coming mostly from Europe. The Houmt Souk economy rests primarily on the trade of the markets. Houmt Souk remains famous for its souk markets which attracts the inhabitants of the neighbouring localities as well as many tourists. There are several specialized markets that existing catering for cattle, fish, fruit and vegetables, herbs and spices, goldsmiths, antique dealers, ironmongers, etc. On the island each important locality has its own market day such as for example Friday for Midoun or Sunday for Guellala whereas Houmt Souk has two of them: Monday and Thursday.\nThe Tunisian Craft industry employees many craftsman. If the artisanal activities are varied in the city, those related to wool are perhaps the most popular among both men and women. One of the survivors of the Battles of Djerba said in 1560, according to a book reproduced by Charles Monchicourt \u201cthe inhabitants weave with fine wool of very beautiful baracans (covers) out of thin fabric, and decorate silk longer than an ordinary carpet\u201d.Weaving, performed on the island for over 1000 years grew during the 19th century which turned it into one of the principal textile centers for wool in all of North Africa, and remains, in spite of the competition of textile industries an important activity in Houmt Souk  The wool industry employs a larger number of families and the activities range from washing in sea water, washing in the sun, then come carding, spinning, dyeing and then weaving followed by marketing. It is an important source of revenue as well for the female population although carding and the spinning mill of wool are traditionally female activities and dyeing, weaving and marketing traditionally carried out by the men. The manufacture of carpet with embroidery is traditionally a female activity which developed considerably with the rise of tourism. The jewellery, formerly practised exclusively by the Jewish craftsmen (specialized especially in partitioned jewels encrusted with hard stones of various colors) is currently practised by young Muslim craftsmen. The work of leather, and in particular the shoe manufacture and the manufacture of bags in camel skins, as well as the basket making also developed with the new market offered by tourism.\nHoumt Souk has one port, primarily oriented towards fishing. There are great quantities of earthenware jars in terra cotta which are used for the fishing with octopus, a delicacy of the people of Houmt Souk. The supply of engines and ensuring the traffic of the heavy goods and passengers between Tunis and Sfax is also performed at the port.\nIn 1964, Houmt Souk counted 297 boats and 746 \"marins\". The fish caught is sold fresh but certain species such as a small fish called  ouzaf play a big role in the local gastronomy. A fish canning facility was built with the port to preserve the fish. In addition to fishing, the port is used nowadays for excursions towards the island of which is used as a refuge for migratory birds; in particular for pink flamingos and dolphins which can sometimes be observed off the city coastline. One of the traditions of Houmt Souk is the sale of fish through bidding and the shouting by the town crier. The fishermen thread fish fished in chains (between five and ten fish per chain according to the size of fish) and deliver it to the town crier after having been informed of the minimum price. The town crier, seated on a high chair, announces the basic price and even the slightest of movements from the crowd is seen as a signal for a bid.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in French) Official site for Houmt Souk\nLexicorient",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Great Mosque of Kairouan (Arabic: \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0643\u0628\u0631\u200e), also known as the Mosque of Uqba (\u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0639\u0642\u0628\u0629 \u0628\u0646 \u0646\u0627\u0641\u0639), is a mosque  situated in the UNESCO World Heritage town of Kairouan, Tunisia and is one of the most impressive and largest Islamic monuments in North Africa.Established by the Arab general Uqba ibn Nafi in the year 50 AH (670AD/CE) at the founding of the city of Kairouan, the mosque occupies an area of over 9,000 square metres (97,000 sq ft).  It is one of the oldest places of worship in the Islamic world, and is a model for all later mosques in the Maghreb.     Its perimeter, of about 405 metres (1,329 ft), contains a hypostyle prayer hall, a marble-paved courtyard and a square minaret. In addition to its spiritual prestige, the Mosque of Uqba is one of the masterpieces of Islamic architecture, notable among other things for the first Islamic use of the horseshoe arch.\nExtensive works under the Aghlabids two centuries later (9th Cent.AD/CE) gave the mosque its present aspect.    The fame of the Mosque of Uqba and of the other holy sites at Kairouan helped the city to develop and expand. The university, consisting of scholars who taught in the mosque, was a centre of education both in Islamic thought and in the secular sciences.    Its role at the time can be compared to that of the University of Paris in the Middle Ages.    With the decline of the city from the mid-11th century, the centre of intellectual thought moved to the University of Ez-Zitouna in Tunis.\n\n\n== Location and general aspect ==\n\nLocated in the north-east of the medina of Kairouan, the mosque is in the intramural district of Houmat al-Jami (literally \"area of the Great Mosque\"). This location corresponded originally to the heart of the urban fabric of the city founded by Uqba ibn Nafi. However given the natural lay of the land crossed by several tributaries of the wadis, the urban development of the city spread southwards. Human factors including Hilalian's invasions in 449 AH (1057 AD) led to the decline of the city and halted development. For all these reasons, the mosque which once occupied the center of the medina when first built in 670 is now on the easternmost quarter abutting the city walls.\nThe building is a vast slightly irregular quadrilateral covering some 9,000 m2. It is longer (127.60 metres) on the east side than the west (125.20 metres), and shorter on the north side (72.70 metres) than the south (78 metres). The main minaret is centered on the north. \nFrom the outside, the Great Mosque of Kairouan is a fortress-like building with its 1.90 metres thick massive ocher walls, a composite of well-worked stones with intervening courses of rubble stone and baked bricks. The corner towers measuring 4.25 metres on each side are buttressed with solid projecting supports. Structurally given the soft grounds subject to compaction, the buttressed towers added stability to the entire mosque. Despite the austere fa\u00e7ades, the rhythmic patterns of buttresses and towering porches, some surmounted by cupolas, give the sanctuary a sense of striking sober grandeur.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Evolution ===\n\nAt the foundation of Kairouan in 670, the Arab general and conqueror Uqba ibn Nafi (himself the founder of the city) chose the site of his mosque in the centre of the city, near the headquarters of the governor. Around 690, shortly after its construction, the mosque was destroyed during the occupation of Kairouan by the Berbers, originally conducted by Kusaila. It was rebuilt by the Ghassanid general Hasan ibn al-Nu'man in 703. With the gradual increase of the population of Kairouan and the consequent increase in the number of faithful, Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik, Umayyad Caliph in Damascus, charged his governor Bishr ibn Safwan to carry out development work in the city, which included the renovation and expansion of the mosque around the years 724\u2013728. During this expansion, he pulled down the mosque and rebuilt it with the exception of the mihrab. It was under his auspices that the construction of the minaret began. In 774, a new reconstruction accompanied by modifications and embellishments took place under the direction of the Abbasid governor Yazid ibn Hatim.\n\nUnder the rule of the Aghlabid dynasty, Kairouan was at its apogee, and the mosque profited from this period of stability and prosperity. In 836, Emir Ziyadat Allah I reconstructed the mosque once more: this is when the building acquired, at least in its entirety, its current appearance. At the same time, the mihrab's ribbed dome  was raised on squinches. Around 862\u2013863, Emir Abu Ibrahim enlarged the oratory, with three bays to the north, and added the cupola over the arched portico which precedes the prayer hall. In 875 Emir Ibrahim II built another three bays, thereby reducing the size of the courtyard which was further limited on the three other sides by the addition of double galleries.The current state of the mosque can be traced back to the Aghlabid period\u2014no element is earlier than the ninth century besides the mihrab\u2014except for some partial restorations and a few later additions made in 1025 during the Zirid period, 1248 and 1293\u20131294 under the reign of the Hafsids, 1618 at the time of Muradid beys, and in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. In 1967, major restoration works, executed during five years and conducted under the direction of the National Institute of Archeology and Art, were achieved throughout the monument, and were ended with an official reopening of the mosque during the celebration of the Mawlid of 1972.\n\n\n=== Host stories ===\n\nSeveral centuries after its founding, the Great Mosque of Kairouan is the subject of numerous descriptions by Arab historians and geographers in the Middle Ages. The stories concern mainly the different phases of construction and expansion of the sanctuary, and the successive contributions of many princes to the interior decoration (mihrab, minbar, ceilings, etc.). Among the authors who have written on the subject and whose stories have survived are Al-Bakri (Andalusian geographer and historian who died in 1094 and who devoted a sufficiently detailed account of the history of the mosque in his book Description of Septentrional Africa), Al-Nuwayri (historian who died in Egypt, 1332) and Ibn Nagi (scholar and historian of Kairouan who died around 1435).\n\nOn additions and embellishments made to the building by the Aghlabid emir Abu Ibrahim, Ibn Nagi gives the following account: \u00ab He built in the mosque of Kairouan the cupola that rises over the entrance to the central nave, together with the two colonnades which flank it from both sides, and the galleries were paved by him. He then made the mihrab. \u00bb\n\nAmong the Western travelers, poets and writers who visited Kairouan, some of them leave impressions and testimonies sometimes tinged with emotion or admiration on the mosque. From the eighteenth century, the French doctor and naturalist John Andrew Peyssonnel, conducting a study trip to 1724, during the reign of sovereign Al-Husayn Bey I, underlines the reputation of the mosque as a deemed centre of religious and secular studies: \u00ab The Great Mosque is dedicated to Uqba, where there is a famous college where we will study the remotest corners of this kingdom : are taught reading and writing of Arabic grammar, laws and religion. There are large rents for the maintenance of teachers. \u00bb \nAt the same time, the doctor and Anglican priest Thomas Shaw (1692\u20131751), touring the Tunis Regency and passes through Kairouan in 1727, described the mosque as that: \"which is considered the most beautiful and the most sacred of Berberian territories\", evoking for example: \"an almost unbelievable number of granite columns\".\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, the French writer Guy de Maupassant expresses in his book La vie errante (The Wandering Life), his fascination with the majestic architecture of the Great Mosque of Kairouan as well as the effect created by countless columns: \"The unique harmony of this temple consists in the proportion and the number of these slender shafts upholding the building, filling, peopling, and making it what it is, create its grace and greatness. Their colorful multitude gives the eye the impression of unlimited\". Early in the twentieth century, the Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke describes his admiration for the impressive minaret: \u00ab Is there a more beautiful than this still preserved old tower, the minaret, in Islamic architecture? In the history of Art, its three-storey minaret is considered such a masterpiece and a model among the most prestigious monuments of Muslim architecture. \u00bb\n\n\n== Architecture and decoration ==\n\n\n=== Exterior ===\n\n\n==== Enclosure ====\nToday, the enclosure of the Great Mosque of Kairouan is pierced by nine gates (six opening on the courtyard, two opening on the prayer hall and a ninth allows access to the maqsura) some of them, such as Bab Al-Ma (gate of water) located on the western fa\u00e7ade, are preceded by salient porches flanked by buttresses and surmounted by ribbed domes based on square tholobate which are porting squinches with three vaults. However, Arab geographers and historians of the Middle Ages Al-Muqaddasi and Al-Bakri reported the existence, around the tenth and eleventh centuries, of about ten gates named differently from today. This reflects the fact that, unlike the rest of the mosque, the enclosure has undergone significant changes to ensure the stability of the building (adding many buttresses). Thus, some entries have been sealed, while others were kept.During the thirteenth century, new gates were opened, the most remarkable, Bab Lalla Rihana dated from 1293, is located on the eastern wall of the enclosure. The monumental entrance, work of the Hafsid sovereign Abu Hafs `Umar ibn Yahya (reign from 1284 to 1295), is entered in a salient square, flanked by ancient columns supporting horseshoe arches and covered by a dome on squinches. The front fa\u00e7ade of the porch has a large horseshoe arch relied on two marble columns and surmounted by a frieze adorned with a blind arcade, all crowned by serrated merlons (in a sawtooth arrangement). Despite its construction at the end of the thirteenth century, Bab Lalla Rihana blends well with all of the building mainly dating from the ninth century.\n \n\nEnclosure and gates of the Mosque of Uqba\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Courtyard ====\n\nThe courtyard is a vast trapezoidal area whose interior dimensions are approximately 67 by 52 metres. It is surrounded on all its four sides by a portico with double rows of arches, opened by slightly horseshoe arches supported by columns in various marbles, in granite or in porphyry, reused from Roman, Early Christian or Byzantine monuments particularly from Carthage. Access to the courtyard by six side entrances dating from the ninth and thirteenth centuries.\nThe portico on the south side of the courtyard, near the prayer hall, includes in its middle a large dressed stone pointed horseshoe arch which rests on ancient columns of white veined marble with Corinthian capitals. This porch of seven metres high is topped with a square base upon which rests a semi-spherical ribbed dome; the latter is ribbed with sharp-edged ribs. The intermediary area, the dodecagonal drum of the dome, is pierced by sixteen small rectangular windows set into rounded niches. The great central arch of the south portico, is flanked on each side by six rhythmically arranged horseshoe arches, which fall on twin columns backed by pillars. Overall, the proportions and general layout of the fa\u00e7ade of the south portico, with its thirteen arches of which that in the middle constitutes a sort of triumphal arch crowned with a cupola, form an ensemble with \"a powerful air of majesty\", according to the French historian and sociologist Paul Sebag (1919\u20132004).\n\nCourtyard area and porticoes\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Details of the courtyard ====\nThe combination formed by the courtyard and the galleries that surround it covers an immense area whose dimensions are about 90 metres long and 72 metres in width. The northern part of the courtyard is paved with flagstones while the rest of the floor is almost entirely composed of white marble slabs. Near its centre is an horizontal sundial, bearing an inscription in naskhi engraved on the marble dating from 1258 AH (which corresponds to the year 1843) and which is accessed by a little staircase; it determines the time of prayers. The rainwater collector or impluvium, probably the work of the Muradid Bey Mohamed Bey al-Mouradi (1686\u20131696), is an ingenious system that ensures the capture (with the slightly sloping surface of the courtyard) then filtering stormwater at a central basin furnished with horseshoe arches sculpted in white marble. Freed from its impurities, the water flows into an underground cistern supported by seven-metre-high pillars. In the courtyard there are also several water wells some of which are placed side by side. Their edges, obtained from the lower parts of ancient cored columns, support the string grooves back the buckets.\n\nDetails of the courtyard\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Minaret ====\n\nThe minaret, which occupies the centre of the northern fa\u00e7ade of the complex's enclosure, is 31.5 metres tall and is seated on a square base of 10.7 metres on each side. It is located inside the enclosure and does not have direct access from the outside. It consists of three tapering levels, the last of which is topped with a small ribbed dome that was most probably built later than the rest of the tower. The first and second stories are surmounted by rounded merlons which are pierced by arrowslits. The minaret served as a watchtower, as well as to call the faithful to prayer.The door giving access to the minaret is framed by a lintel and jambs made of recycled carved friezes of antique origin. There are stone blocks from the Roman period that bear Latin inscriptions. Their use probably dates to the work done under the Umayyad governor Bishr ibn Safwan in about 725 AD, and they have been reused at the base of the tower. The greater part of the minaret dates from the time of the Aghlabid princes in the ninth century. It consists of regular layers of carefully cut rubble stone, thus giving the work a stylistically admirable homogeneity and unity.The interior includes a staircase of 129 steps, surmounted by a barrel vault, which gives access to the terraces and the first tier of the minaret. The courtyard fa\u00e7ade (or south fa\u00e7ade) of the tower is pierced with windows that provide light and ventilation, while the other three fa\u00e7ades\u2014facing north, east and west\u2014are pierced with small openings in the form of arrowslits. The minaret, in its present aspect, dates largely from the early ninth century, about 836 AD. It is the oldest minaret in the Muslim world, and it is also the world's oldest minaret still standing.Due to its age and its architectural features, the minaret of the Great Mosque of Kairouan is the prototype for all the minarets of the western Islamic world: it served as a model in both North Africa and in Andalusia. Despite its massive form and austere decoration, it nevertheless presents a harmonious structure and a majestic appearance.\n\nMinaret\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Domes ====\n \nThe Mosque has several domes, the largest being over the mihrab and the entrance to the prayer hall from the courtyard. The dome of the mihrab is based on an octagonal drum with slightly concave sides, raised on a square base, decorated on each of its three southern, Easter and western faces with five flat-bottomed niches surmounted by five semi-circular arches, the niche in the middle is cut by a lobed oculus enrolled in a circular frame. This dome, whose construction goes back to the first half of the ninth century (towards 836), is one of the oldest and most remarkable domes in the western Islamic world.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\n\n\n==== Prayer hall ====\nThe prayer hall is located on the southern side of the courtyard; and is accessed by 17 carved wooden doors. A portico with double row of arches precede the spacious prayer hall, which takes the shape of a rectangle of 70.6 metres in width and 37.5 metres' depth.\n\nThe hypostyle hall is divided into 17 aisles of eight bays, the central nave is wider, as well as the bay along the wall of the qibla. They cross with right angle in front of the mihrab, this device, named \"T shape\", which is also found in two Iraqi mosques in Samarra (around 847) has been adopted in many North African and Andalusian mosques where it became a feature.The central nave, a sort of triumphal alley which leads to the mihrab, is significantly higher and wider than the other sixteen aisles of the prayer hall. It is bordered on each side of a double row of arches rested on twin columns and surmounted by a carved plaster decoration consisting of floral and geometric patterns.Enlightened by impressive chandeliers which are applied in countless small glass lamps, the nave opens into the south portico of the courtyard by a monumental delicately carved wooden door, made in 1828 under the reign of the Husainids. This sumptuous door, which has four leaves richly carved with geometric motifs embossed on the bottom of foliages and interlacing stars, is decorated at the typanum by a stylised vase from which emerge winding stems and leaves. The other doors of the prayer hall, some of which date from the time of the Hafsids, are distinguished by their decoration which consists essentially of geometric patterns (hexagonal, octagonal, rectangular patterns, etc.).\n\nPrayer hall\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n===== Columns and ceiling =====\n\nIn the prayer hall, the 414 columns of marble, granite or porphyry (among more than 500 columns in the whole mosque), taken from ancient sites in the country such as Sbeitla, Carthage, Hadrumetum and Chemtou, support the horseshoe arches. A legend says they could not count them without going blind. The capitals resting on the column shafts offer a wide variety of shapes and styles (Corinthian, Ionic, Composite, etc.). Some capitals were carved for the mosque, but others come from Roman or Byzantine buildings (dating from the second to sixth century) and were reused. According to the German archaeologist Christian Ewert, the special arrangement of reused columns and capitals surrounding the mihrab obeys to a well-defined program and would draw symbolically the plan of the Dome of the Rock. The shafts of the columns are carved in marble of different colors and different backgrounds. Those in white marble come from Italy, some shafts located in the area of the mihrab are in red porphyry imported from Egypt, while those made of greenish or pink marble are from quarries of Chemtou, in the north-west of current Tunisia. Although the shafts are of varying heights, the columns are ingeniously arranged to support fallen arches harmoniously. The height difference is compensated by the development of variable bases, capitals and crossbeams; a number of these crossbeams are in cedar wood. The wooden rods, which usually sink to the base of the transom, connect the columns together and maintain the spacing of the arches, thus enhancing the stability of all structures which support the ceiling of the prayer hall.\n\nThe covering of the prayer hall consists of painted ceilings decorated with vegetal motifs and two domes: one raised at the beginning of the central nave and the other in front of the mihrab. The latter, which its hemispherical cap is cut by 24 concave grooves radiating around the top, is based on ridged horns shaped shell and a drum pierced by eight circular windows which are inserted between sixteen niches grouped by two. The niches are covered with carved stone panels, finely adorned with characteristic geometric, vegetal and floral patterns of the Aghlabid decorative repertoire: shells, cusped arches, rosettes, vine-leaf, etc. From the outside, the dome of the mihrab is based on an octagonal drum with slightly concave sides, raised on a square base, decorated on each of its three southern, Easter and western faces with five flat-bottomed niches surmounted by five semi-circular arches, the niche in the middle is cut by a lobed oculus enrolled in a circular frame.\n\nThe painted ceilings are a unique ensemble of planks, beams and brackets, illustrating almost thousand years of the history of painting on wood in Tunisia. Wooden brackets offer a wide variety of style and decor in the shape of a crow or a grasshopper with wings or fixed, they are characterised by a setting that combines floral painted or carved, with grooves. The oldest boards date back to the Aghlabid period (ninth century) and are decorated with scrolls and rosettes on a red background consists of squares with concave sides in which are inscribed four-petaled flowers in green and blue, and those performed by the Zirid dynasty (eleventh century) are characterised by inscriptions in black kufic writing with gold rim and the uprights of the letters end with lobed florets, all on a brown background adorned with simple floral patterns.\nThe boards painted under the Hafsid period (during the thirteenth century) offers a floral decor consists of white and blue arches entwined with lobed green. The latest, dated the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (mostly dating from the time of the Muradid Beys), are distinguished by an epigraphic decoration consists of long black and red texts on olive green background to those painted from 1618 to 1619, under the reign of Murad I Bey (1613\u20131631), while those back to the eighteenth century have inscriptions in white naskhi script on an orange background.\n\n\n===== Mihrab and minbar =====\n\nThe mihrab, which indicates the Qibla (direction of Mecca), in front of which stands the imam during the prayer, is located in the middle of the southern wall of the prayer hall. It is formed by an oven-shaped niche framed by two marble columns and topped by a painted wooden half-cupola. The niche of the mihrab is two metres long, 4.5 metres high and 1.6 metres deep.The mosque's mihrab, whose decor is a remarkable witness of Muslim art in the early centuries of Islam, is distinguished by its harmonious composition and the quality of its ornaments. Considered as the oldest example of concave mihrab, it dates in its present state to 862\u2013863 AD.\n\nIt is surrounded at its upper part by 139 lusterware tiles (with a metallic sheen), each one is 21.1 centimetres square and they are arranged on the diagonal in a chessboard pattern. Divided into two groups, they are dated from the beginning of the second half of the ninth century but it is not determined with certainty whether they were made in Baghdad or in Kairouan by a Baghdadi artisan, the controversy over the origin of this precious collection agitates the specialists. These tiles are mainly decorated with floral and plant motifs (stylised flowers, palm leaves and asymmetrical leaves on bottom hatch and checkered) belong to two series: one polychrome characterised by a greater richness of tones ranging from light gold to light, dark or ocher yellow, and from brick-red to brown lacquer, the other monochrome is a beautiful luster that goes from smoked gold to green gold. The coating around them is decorated with blue plant motifs dating from the eighteenth century or the first half of the nineteenth century. The horseshoe arch of the mihrab, stilted and broken at the top, rest on two columns of red marble with yellow veins, which surmounted with Byzantine style capitals that carry two crossbeams carved with floral patterns, each one is decorated with a Kufic inscription in relief.\n\nThe wall of the mihrab is covered with 28 panels of white marble, carved and pierced, which have a wide variety of plant and geometric patterns including the stylised grape leaf, the flower and the shell. Behind the openwork hint, there is an oldest niche on which several assumptions were formulated. If one refers to the story of Al-Bakri, an Andalusian historian and geographer of the eleventh century, it is the mihrab which would be done by Uqba Ibn Nafi, the founder of Kairouan, whereas Lucien Golvin shares the view that it is not an old mihrab but hardly a begun construction which may serve to support marble panels and either goes back to work of Ziadet Allah I (817\u2013838) or to those of Abul Ibrahim around the years 862\u2013863. Above the marble cladding, the mihrab niche is crowned with a half dome-shaped vault made of manchineel bentwood. Covered with a thick coating completely painted, the concavity of the arch is decorated with intertwined scrolls enveloping stylised five-lobed vine leaves, three-lobed florets and sharp clusters, all in yellow on midnight blue background.The minbar, situated on the right of the mihrab, is used by the imam during the Friday or Eids sermons, is a staircase-shaped pulpit with an upper seat, reached by eleven steps, and measuring 3.93 metres' length to 3.31 metres in height. Dated from the ninth century (about 862) and erected under the reign of the sixth Aghlabid ruler Abul Ibrahim (856\u2013863), it is made in teak wood imported from India. Among all the pulpits of the Muslim world, it is certainly the oldest example of minbar still preserved today. Probably made by cabinetmakers of Kairouan (some researchers also refer to Baghdad), it consists of an assembly of more than 300 finely carved wood pieces with an exceptional ornamental wealth (vegetal and geometric patterns refer to the Umayyad and Abbasid models), among which about 90 rectangular panels carved with plenty of pine cones, grape leaves, thin and flexible stems, lanceolate fruits and various geometric shapes (squares, diamonds, stars, etc.). The upper edge of the minbar ramp is adorned with a rich and graceful vegetal decoration composed of alternately arranged foliated scrolls, each one containing a spread vine-leaf and a cluster of grapes. In the early twentieth century, the minbar had a painstaking restoration. Although it has existed for more than eleven centuries, all panels, with the exception of nine, are originals and are in a good state of conservation, the fineness of the execution of the minbar makes it a great masterpiece of Islamic wood carving referring to Paul Sebag. This old chair of the ninth century is still in its original location, next to the mihrab.\n\n\n===== Maqsura =====\n\nThe maqsura, located near the minbar, consists of a fence bounding a private enclosure that allows the sovereign and his senior officials to follow the solemn prayer of Friday without mingling with the faithful. Jewel of the art of woodwork produced during the reign of the Zirid prince Al-Mu'izz ibn Badis and dated from the first half of the eleventh century, it is considered the oldest still in place in the Islamic world. It is a cedar wood fence finely sculpted and carved on three sides with various geometric motifs measuring 2.8 metres tall, eight metres long and six metres wide. Its main adornment is a frieze that crowns calligraphy, the latter surmounted by a line of pointed openwork merlons, features an inscription in flowery kufic character carved on the background of interlacing plants. Carefully executed in relief, it represents one of the most beautiful epigraphic bands of Islamic art.The library is near located, accessible by a door which the jambs and the lintel are carved in marble, adorned with a frieze of floral decoration. The library window is marked by an elegant setting that has two columns flanking the opening, which is a horseshoe arch topped by six blind arches and crowned by a series of berms sawtooth.\n\n\n== Artworks ==\nThe Mosque of Uqba, one of the few religious buildings of Islam has remained intact almost all of its architectural and decorative elements, is due to the richness of its repertoire which is a veritable museum of Islamic decorative art and architecture. Most of the works on which rests the reputation of the mosque are still conserved in situ while a certain number of them have joined the collections of the Raqqada National Museum of Islamic Art; Raqqada is located about ten kilometres southwest of Kairouan.\nFrom the library of the mosque comes a large collection of calligraphic scrolls and manuscripts, the oldest dating back to the second half of the ninth century. This valuable collection, observed from the late nineteenth century by the French orientalists Octave Houdas and Ren\u00e9 Basset who mention in their report on their scientific mission in Tunisia published in the Journal of African correspondence in 1882, comprises according to the inventory established at the time of the Hafsids (circa 1293\u20131294) several Qur'ans and books of fiqh that concern mainly the Maliki fiqh and its sources. These are the oldest fund of Maliki legal literature to have survived.\n\nAmong the finest works of this series, the pages of the Blue Qur'an, currently exhibited at Raqqada National Museum of Islamic Art, from a famous Qur'an in the second half of the fourth century of the Hegira (the tenth century) most of which is preserved in Tunisia and the rest scattered in museums and private collections worldwide. Featuring kufic character suras are written in gold on vellum dyed with indigo, they are distinguished by a compact graph with no marks for vowels. The beginning of each surah is indicated by a band consisting of a golden stylised leafy foliage, dotted with red and blue, while the verses are separated by silver rosettes. Other scrolls and calligraphic Qur'ans, as that known as the Hadinah's Qur'an, copied and illuminated by the calligrapher Ali ibn Ahmad al-Warraq for the governess of the Zirid prince Al-Muizz ibn Badis at about 1020 AD, were also in the library before being transferred to Raqqada museum. This collection is a unique source for studying the history and evolution of calligraphy of medieval manuscripts in the Maghreb, covering the period from the ninth to the eleventh century.\nOther works of art such as the crowns of light (circular chandeliers) made in cast bronze, dating from the Fatimid-Zirid period (around the tenth to the early eleventh century), originally belonged to the furniture of the mosque. These polycandelons, now scattered in various Tunisian museums including Raqqada, consist of three chains supporting a perforated brass plate, which has a central circular ring around which radiate 18 equidistant poles connected by many horseshoe arches and equipped for each of two landmarks flared. The three chains, connected by a suspension ring, are each fixed to the plate by an almond-shaped finial. The crowns of light are marked by Byzantine influence to which the Kairouanese artisan brought the specificities of Islamic decorative repertoire (geometric and floral motifs).\n\n\n== Role in Muslim civilisation ==\nAt the time of its greatest splendor, between the ninth and eleventh centuries AD, Kairouan was one of the greatest centres of Islamic civilisation and its reputation as a hotbed of scholarship covered the entire Maghreb. During this period, the Great Mosque of Kairouan was both a place of prayer and a centre for teaching Islamic sciences under the Maliki current. One may conceivably compare its role to that of the University of Paris during the Middle Ages.In addition to studies on the deepening of religious thought and Maliki jurisprudence, the mosque also hosted various courses in secular subjects such as mathematics, astronomy, medicine and botany. The transmission of knowledge was assured by prominent scholars and theologians which included Sahnun ibn Sa'id and Asad ibn al-Furat, eminent jurists who contributed greatly to the dissemination of the Maliki thought, Ishaq ibn Imran and Ibn al-Jazzar in medicine, Abu Sahl al-Kairouani and Abd al-Monim al-Kindi in mathematics. Thus, the mosque, headquarters of a prestigious university with a large library containing a large number of scientific and theological works, was the most remarkable intellectual and cultural centre in North Africa during the ninth, tenth and eleventh centuries.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of the oldest mosques\nHistory of Medieval Arabic and Western European domes\nMinar (Firuzabad)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nN\u00e9ji Djelloul, 2000.

          "We went to the Aqua Park with a 6 & a 17 year old. Both enjoyed the slides, maybe 5/6 big slides, a couple with double inflatables, Also a large pool with wave machine which was clean and not too busy. Plenty of sun beds and secure lockers available. Lots of food choice at the",
          "As modern aqaua parks go nowadays, this was very poor. Only 5 different slides (a couple had been closed down) a small lazy river (only half a dozen rings) so kids fighting for them, and a wave pool that made waves every couple of hours. Not very relaxing, very loud and",
          "So I visited this place in August of 2019: What you should know: - The entree fee is 35 DT for Adults which is almost 11 Euros, for a whole day from 9h to 17h30 - There is a free parking. - There are : ** One Big pool, the waves start in the afternoon ** There is another",

          "Had a fabulous day out here. 30 dinar for adults and 25 for children over 80cm. You cannot take in food and drinks but prices are ok inside the park, sandwiches around 4 dinar and big pizzas 10 dinar. Large waters 2 dinar, beers 5 dinar. Ices are a bit more than normal and so is",
          "Had a great time here. Didn't try the adult slides as we had a 3 and 6 year old with us but they looked fun. Kids enjoyed the smaller pool with slides. Went to the larger pool with a wave machine that they switch on occasionally. Very loud music playing which adds to the fun",

          "Really enjoyed the park although we discovered that prices for the park were different in the hotel from other places we seen. It was better to go for the offer of park entry, food and transport to and from the park rather than Just entry tickets to the park it was a lot",

          "Today I went there with my family and we have been told that the water park is closed until 21 May. Luckily it is on the way from RIU Imperial Marabha to Sassue city so we went to city. We didn't get chance to see the water park so can't really comment ;-)",
          "I really enjoyed the Water Park, they treated all women with respect and it was great value for money.",
          "its d best ur gonna get over there we really enjoyed it slides r great fun but they only have 5 r 6 of them kept us busy for the a day food is ok",
          "Has no value at all. It most of the time closed and very old equipments. They did not hear anything about hygenic items. I do not advice and recommend anyone!",
          "The water park is cheap and has some really good slide ect.Lots to eat at different restaurants and panni snack bars.I would recommend that if you have teenage girls with you that you keep a close eye on them, as local men were taking pictures and recording ours on there",
          "4 or 5 good slides, easy to get around as it's not too big. Good for families and adults. The locker rooms need a bit of work though",

          "didn't go in as it didn't looked packed and from the outside it looked rubbish. the slides also didn't look safe either.",
          "We were a tiny bit disappointed with this water park. However we did go very off season which made the queues non existent. There are 6 main water slides however the best rides were not working in parallel when we were there. The kiddies area looked fun even for grown adults",
          "Loved this water park. Only cost about \u00a311 for the day not busy and even restaurant was VERY reasonable in price. 2 meals and drinks only cost about \u00a36.50",
          "Clean, great slides, relaxed, quiet so you could go on many rides. The food was also OK, entrance was cheap at 30TDN (\u00a310.00) for all day, one slide was closed but it was a slow one so we were not bothered. overall very good day out that i would recommend",
          "didn't like anything apart from wave pool,do not waste your time and money,only few very old slides,very small park",
          "Me and my friend had a good day out here whilst on holiday. It is a small water park but there were a few good slides and the wave pool is nice to relax in. Cheap entrance and food and drink cheap. Only downside was that it was a bit grotty and could do with a clean, especially",
          "Nice pools and food...kids enjoyed it...staff very helpful...nice walk up from the hotel Kanta Hotel...only 5 dinar by taxi",

          "Visited acqua palace in August. Found the complex to be quite dirty and tatty, and quite expensive for a family as it is only enough to keep you busy for half a day at most. Wouldn't recommend a visit, wish we had just stayed in hotel pool instead!",
          "Its a 1970 water park, I stayed at the Soviva they have 2 slides it was better. I liked one slide apart from that, it only cost 10 Diner to get in which is \u00a33 so for money very good I suppose Its Bad because there is no good slides at all no height on them just little ones for",
          "not much to do only 6 slides and 1 was closed :). wave pool was probably the best thing there. The lazy river you have no rings etc to lye on and relax. We left the park by 1.30 as we had had enough",
          "Enough to do for half a day, food very good value, sandwiches, pain is etc. Shame one of the slides wasn't working, and the wave pool only on for a limited time.",
          "The resort itself was very clean and responsibly priced, 30 dinar each entry. You do have to pay 2 dinar for a locker and 5 dinar deposit which you get back when you hand back your lock. There are 6 slides in total, 3 big ones and 3 smaller ones. There are rapids and a wave",
          "Same thing in Spain cost you twice the price for your Money but kids enjoyed it and plenty of sun beds . Food in cafe excellent",
          "Great to get out of hotel only about 5 slides but the wave pool is a great laugh. No food or drink allowed but cheap to buy inside",
          "Small park and great for a half a day. Only about \u00a39 in English money to get in and Very cheap to eat and drink. Was about \u00a33 for a large pizza and the same for a large nuggets and chips.Got very busy In the afternoon but was quiet until about 12 o'clock pm.",
          "Fantastic time was had by all 5 of us ... The park feels really safe; it's clean, well run and everyone was friendly \u2026 staff, locals and trippers alike. There are 5 full size and 2 kids slides, plus the lazy river ride and a fantastic wave pool. It's not Florida but",
          "Liked- the big red and white ride you need a double ring and go down in pairs it was fantastic first time I went down I screamed from top all the way to bottom Disliked- the crowds, it opens at 9.30 we were one of the first in and went down the 2big slides 2or 3 times before it",
          "great day out, very reasonable entrance fee. lockers in changing rooms. a restaurant and numerous snack bars around which are unbelievably cheap as you can't take food in. Beware no toilet roll is supplied so take your own. Go as early as possible to get a lounger and you get to",
          "Quite cheap to get in. Get your tickets from the rep. Not awfully big but a lovely day. The wave machine is great and they have dancing in the waves in the afternoon. All the locals join in so it can't be that bad.",
          "A modestly sized water park situated between Port El Kantoaui and Sousse, the Acqua (sic) Palace is in need of some modernisation but provides a great value day (or half-day) out. It has a large wave pool and two major slides which you ride on inflatables (in pairs). There are",
          "A lot of locals go here so expect it to be very busy during their school holidays (mid June to mid September). Many push in too which is annoying! But we had a good laugh as at 3pm there is an actual rave in the wave pool. Was brilliant! The chips were lush too if you get",
          "If only this had more slides it would be great. Admission price was real value for money, food price was excellent value. we left after A few hours though after we had been on all the slides many times. Well worth a visit though",
          "The ques for the larger slides were very long all the time we were in the park, we arrived at 9.30 when the park opened so didn't go on the larger slides. The lazy river isn't very lazy as you got jumped on from all angles by kids and adults, who seem to think the no diving",
          "Had some really good slides but not the biggest water park. However for \u00a310 was worth a visit. You do need to get there early though if you want a sunbed. Lockers are 7dinar but you get 5 back.",
          "A fun place to spend a day. The food was really cheap. Like most Tunisian place there was a lot of queue skipping",
          "Had a great time at Acqua Palace , Slides and wave pool are all great fun and would recommend to anyone, My advice would be get in as early as you can as it can really fill up at 12pm, The ques for the slides can get long after 12 and means more waiting around, Wave pool is good",
          "Fantastic water park, cheap snacks, Secure locker for 7td, 5td refunded when the lock is handed in at the end. \u00a336 for a family of 4 entry.",
          "Not a bad water park but is absolutely packed with locals and other holidayers. Big queues and long waits.",
          "Cheap - 30 dinar. Locker 2 dinar with 5 dinar deposit. Opens 09.30am. Get there early as coach trips arrive around 11am. Food reasonably priced. Free loungers.",
          "The Waterpark cost 30 dinar (approx \u00a310), fairly small park but great for a half day trip. Nicely set out and very clean. Kids and adults loved it.",
          "After booking through Thomas Cook, we arrived and skipped straight past the queue. The park has 6 big slides, 3 of which require a boat (although 1 of these was closed the day we went). Queues for the rides with boats were very long as it was busy so we only went on these",
          "We had a great time at the Acqua Palace, but I would recommend you get there at 1000 because it gets really busy. Food and drink was really cheap there too.",
          "Visited with the family. Two of our group (women) were physically assaulted by a group of local lads in the wave pool. Decent park and staff...but very few tourists compared to \"groups\" of the locals Avoid..avoid..or be very careful",
          "The park has a few rides that certainly kept the children entertained. It made a welcome change for the children who had got bored with pools and the beach. There are 3 rides with rings, wave machine, an assortment of rides for varying degrees in confidence, a children's pool",
          "Very reasonable price for a smaller water park. Reasonable range of rides, but do not go the day after ramadan has finished, far too crowded.",
          "good water park, breaks up the holiday , food and drinks not to overpriced in the park . Good range of slides to keep kids entertained.",
          "Fantastic value at only \u00a310 and a great day out. Snacks were yummy especially the pizzas! Fantastic photographer taken great snaps as you play",
          "Not enough to do and so small ! Lunch was disgusting a total waste of money we were back in our hotel after lunch although we had paid for the full day. Everything closed for lunch anyway and the park was very disappointing",
          "A clean and tidy water park with good facilites. Lunch time food was really good and very cheepest! We went with a family I of 5 and some friends and had a good day out. Good value for money - more people should venture out of their all inclusive hotels and try it!",
          "This aqua park is dreadful, only 6 slides and a wave pool, me and my partner were bored after 2 hours, don't even waste your time with this place!",
          "Only four rides and a wave machine, definitely no Siam Park. It is only a tenner though!!! Wasn't busy when we were there so you don't have to queue. I would've left earlier if I did mind you.",
          "Wave machine was great, flumes were fun. Very clean and well organised park. Entrance price was very, very reasonable and the food, ice creams and drinks were exceptionally reasonable. Lunch was good and you felt safe and welcomed. Wish we went more as left it to our last",

          "Entrance fee for adults \u00a38 and well worth it. Don't take your own food or drinks as you do get your bags searched, but the food is really cheap, 90p for Panini's 60p for a can of pop or big bag of crisps. It's not the biggest park but has got enough to provide a fun day for all",
          "Brilliant plenty of shade rides very good and safe food and drink is very reasonable didn't dislike anything",

          "I visited the water park 3 times during my stay. But I'd say it's ok for a morning of afternoon. Most people won't want to spend all day there. It's fairly small and doesn't have many water slides, there is a lazy river and wave pool. For \u00a310 it's pretty good value. Food and",
          "this is a fairly small waterpark but we spent two full days there and really enjoyed ourselves. The slides are fun with plenty staff on hand to assist. Food and drink offered was really cheap. Well worth the equivalent of 10 English pounds.",
          "5 water slides, big pool, kid's pool, lazy river, bar, bistro and shop. A big territory with enough places. It's absolutely worth to have a spare time here for 25 DT per person.",
          "depending on where you stay a short taxi drive is all you need,you can haggle and we managed to get it for 10 dinar which was about \u00a34.overall theres about 5 slides at the moment and a huge wavepool,a kiddies pool with 2 small slides but you'll find that as long as your child",
          "brilliant, kids and adults both loved it. Nice food in restaurant, nice lounge and general surroundings. More lifeguards and staff onsite at all times. A good range of slides to suit all ages. Entertainment excellent and a good range of activities planned throughout the day.",
          "Great place had only just reopened when we went in may 6 of us between the ages of 2 and 46 we all had a great time enough slides for everyone and the lazy river is great we spent about 6 hours there it cost \u00a312 per adult and well woth the day out., very clean and tidy ,staff",

          "Brilliant for all ages! Just an amazing water park to visit. However some water slides are not appropriate for kids",
          "Absolutely fantastic place, well worth every penny you pay. Great flumes, slides and water rides. Staff very friendly and helpful. You do need 7TD for a lock for the locker (5TD deposit and 2TD to get a lock)",
          "very old , out dated and hidden. rust were on rides and we didnt want to trust them which meant a high chance of getting cut :(",
          "The water park had enough slides to entertain myself and my boyfriend for a full day. Luckily, the park was quiet when we went but I could imagine huge queues due to the limited amount of slides in the height of summer. their were approx. 8 slides in total with only 5 different",
          "came to acqua palace in october 3 times in 2 weeks, were all adults but we werent bored but came home completely shattered each time. the wave machine is epic, realise how unfit i was when i swam too far in. The inflatable ride is a bumpy ride if you share but thats half the",
          "A few good waterslides but overall the waterpark was disappointing. Wave machine was very good and spent most of our time there.",
          "Not very many slides - but we spent a Monday morning there just for a bit of fun. Wave pool comes on every hour & there's a river rapids - tends to get full of teenagers who don't get out of the inflatables to allow anyone else to use them.",
          "We walked it to the aqua park the 1st time we went but I wud suggest going with the reps trip.this is more fun and organised.its not very big as waterparks go but we thort it was just right.u can take yor own snacks or eat there.we just bought drinks and ate out on the walk",
          "We arrived at a building site, they were still building the slides! the changing rooms were awful (as expected) but that didn't bother us as we just went back to the hotel and dressed. The water was freezing! The lazy river was nice and the pool with wave machine is nice. It was",
          "There are 3 main slides, a kids area, a lazy river a wave pool and a Ringo slide that the guy surfs down on with you. We stayed or about 4 hours and that was plenty. 25TD entry fee works out at about a tenner, so not expnsive for half a day out",
          "wave machine good. looked a bit like Weston on a bad day. they were sprucing it up a little. for the lockers, don't forget to get your deposit back.",
          "We have been many times and always enjoy ourselves. Mum dad and our eleven year old son normally. All slides are great. Crazy river too but one main problem nowadays with the lazy river is not enough rings to go round. We were in a group of friends so there were eleven of us",
          "We went to the Aqua Palace last year with the grandchildren,so we thought we would show our fellow travelers the 'delights' or so we thought of the park. Well without the kids it was not the same the noise and the 'music' went unnoticed last time, this is expensive for what you",
          "We spent a good 6 hours here it found it very clean inside cheap to get in less than \u00a360 pound for 4 adults and 2 kids. Slides where great fun and I'm 48 no queuing and lots of staff monitoring the slides wave pool was fun as was the lazy river. Food was cheap and good quality",
          "Super place for water fun with great slides and worthwhile.Suggest you arrive early to avoid queues in the morning.",
          "Thiswater park although not overly big has everything you need and all for 10dina (\u00a34) there are 4 water slides, a white drop flume, a yellow circuar flume and a flume which allows to people to travel on a dingy... there is also a wave pool and a lazy river... Food in the park",
          "Can't really put the waterpark down to much as it is good for somewhere in tunisia as it does kill a morning or afternoon, but it is very small, 2 slides and a wave pool, thats it! would recommend for families with children or groups, but you wouldn't be missing anything if",
          "This was really cheap (25 dinar which is \u00a310) but there were only 4 water slides. There was a big water area with huge rubber rings which was nice & plenty of sun beds",
          "We didn't go but 2 other families we met said there children had a great time. Costs about \u00a310 each for the whole day and has about 4 big waterslides.",
          "All of my family loved it ... There was something to do for everyone .. would truly recommend please check it out",
          "We spent 6 hours in the park and rode all of the rides / slides and had loads of fun. True it got busier as the day wore on but it was almost empty when we arrived at 10 o'clock; the park is clean and well managed and appeals to locals and tourists alike. We easily got loungers",
          "Love the shopping for bargains in sousse shopping centres sousse has a great shopping area also the madina market just take care of your personals like every where you go mind pick pockets . The fun fare is a five min walk from hotel great fun",

          "Well I'm 21 and my husband 24 we weren't expecting much from the review and we were right. There were five slides, wave pool, small lazy river and a children's area. We went on a Saturday which was a stupid mistake as lots of Tunisians there. They were mad, the wave machine came",
          "This park is not good, it has just 3 slides and one of those was closed for the entire 5 hours that we spent there. The wave machine is ok but as soon as it was started people came running from everywhere and the pool became totally packed. The lazy river is a complete joke, you",
          "Went for a cheap day out... came back after an hour and that was too long. Probably be better for younger children but there is not much to do at all (three small slides, a lazy river which is not very big and a wave pool which is turned on every 2 hours throughout the day.)",
          "You can not take food or drink in with you but it is cheap inside anyway so it's not a problem. There are lockers for belongings with deposit which is returned when key handed back",
          "not the greatest aqua park but still good, food is cheap compared to rip off britain. about 4 slides and a wave machine.",
          "Hubby liked it but i dont like water so just went for the company. Very cheap once inside and only 25 dina for all day",
          "It was fine for our aged children (13, 11, 10 and 8) but not much to do for older kids. You only need a couple of hours in here, its not worth planning to go for a full day. The big pool had a wave machine at 3pm which was a very interesting experience.",
          "Not too big & scary. Great for young kids (ours were 7 & 9). 4 slides, a big wave pool & a lazy river. You can't take your own food or drink but food & drink inside is cheap. A great fun day out.",
          "This was fun, not really too many rides but it was nice to cool down, plenty of sunbeds, shade if you wanted it and food and water were cheap, our belongings were safe in a locker and we had a lot of fun. Wear a long t-shirt over your bikini to stop the staring which could be",
          "As 6 women aged from 26-50 we attended the water park. It was very basic but we had fun despite the lack of slides. The park was mainly used by locals and they tended not to share the rings for the lazy river etc so we swam around it instead. THEY STARE!!! The men will gorp",
          "There are only three slides in the park, the water tastes funny, it is filled with Arabian men and not child safe at all. Would not recommend, we were there for 1 hour before we quickly grabbed our things and left. Not at all worth it.",
          "There were only a few slides in it, I have nothing else to say. The tickets were quite expensive for the park like this.",
          "Well worth a visit, well priced and a variety of slides and pools for adults and children. Even though we were on our honeymoon we went here for a laugh and certainly had that. The large pool is great for serious swimming, the slides are just good fun.",
          "This Water Park isn't massive but we had a great day, I went with a 12 year old and a 14 year old and we all had great fun. The beach effect pool area with a wave machine has plenty of sun loungers and is very relaxing. Food, drink, ice-creams and pancakes are all very",
          "After reading reviews decided to go to the new Water Park which opened in May 2013 at one of the local hotels. Shocked by how much they were charging to get in 75 dinar (adult) thats \u00a330.... and \u00a325 for kids. Didn't accept cards. Don't care what they may offer but at that price",
          "Everyone who went said there weren't many slides and it was quite small, even for quite low \u00a320 or so entrance fee.",
          "Good slides and nice food, service here was the best i had all holiday.. Compared to the hotel and taxi rides",
          "Small but had a fab day there, wasn't crowded and getting a sun lounger was no problem, the restaurants are very good value and food is good. It's a cheap and cheerful day out that I would definitely recommend. There was some building work going on as they are in the process",
          "The slides were fantastic and there was also good activites and slides for the younger children.It was well worth the money!!",
          "There was nothing much at all and was very basic and was not massively clean in the shower and getting changed area, but we went with a group of six and we had fun as a group if you go as a couple it could get boring!",
          "Not the biggest or best waterpark we have been to but enjoyed our time there , they are still develloping the park with the constuction of 2 more slides when we visited.The park is well worth a visit.",
          "For 10Dinar each we thought we'd give the water park a go. When we got there there was 3 slides and looked rather run down but once we started it was so much fun! There is actually 6 slides, rapids, swimming pool etc and not kids dominated!",
          "I visited this water park for 2 reasons: something to do and somewhere to cool off. I had read other reviews saying 'don't waste your money' etc but also read reviews saying it was good and so decided to have a look for myself. This water park is apparently the only water park",
          "Very dated and only about 6 slides, fine if you have a little baby who wants to play in the water in front of you but not worth the money.",
          "Very clean water park. Not overly crowded, probably due to the steep entrance fee. 20tnd for children and 25 per adult. Food was good and inexpensive once inside the park. Lots to do there. Fun!",
          "Would recommend a visit to this place. Kids and I had a fun day out which didn't cost the earth. Staff friendly and helpful.",
          "There really is nothing good to say about this water park, 3 slides in the adult pool and 3 slides in the children's pool rubbish sums it up!! We visited on a Sunday and it is the Tunisian day off do it is extremely busy, we stayed just under an hour before we had to leave,",
          "great day out at the aqua palace not over crowed easy to get to and cheap to get in and to eat and drink inside. loved the wave pool and all the locals dancing in it.",
          "Just returned after 1 week in port el kantaoui,cudnt leave without squeezing a trip to the waterpark.we just paid at the door as it was cheaper than booking with your holiday rep,plus our hotel was only 10min walk away which ment we wasn't tied on waiting on trip buses,we was",
          "Worst water park ever... 3 slides and a lazy river with a wave machine. 50 Dina's to get in about 20 quid for 2 of us and we were in there for about 30 mins",
          "We are a young family of 4, and we booked this park throughnthompson so not that cheap. Gaving been to other parks in the world, this was rubbish and consistsbof around 4 death trap slides 2 pools and a wave machine. The food is cheap inside and quite nice. But i wouldnt waste",
          "It was a good place to go, we just chose the day where a big school trip was there, but certainly somewhere to go for 3-4 hours. Good if you have kids.",
          "Being a bit more of an adult - I'd forgotten how much fun these water parks are! Well looked after, friendly staff, Loved it",
          "nothing to dislike.. like well great value plenty to do the kids don't seem to keep still for long a great day out...",
          "Great park with wave control sea cheap enough to eat in hereall good get a taxi your self don't pay expensive prices with tour operators",
          "This water park was average not very large and was full of young children the crazy river was fun , the changing rooms where not that great . I don't think I would go back again , was nice first time but that's it !",
          "I am shocked at what people have written about this place. It is expensive for what it is! We were there an hour and left. The water was so salty that me and my bf burnt badly even though we had piles of sun cream on. The slides are pretty much death traps, not safe at all.",
          "It's very nice place to go for fun and enjoying out time to kill the time the water was a pit cold but could be nice in hot wether",
          "brilliant, every aspect was amazing.I had an endless amount of things to do and it wasnt far from the hotel at all.",
          "The time we traveled it was really quiet but the place was spotless and the staff were amazing. It was smaller than expected but a lovely half of day to sit back and relax. There is a separate pool that have a wave machine which was great fun. My partner lost his gold bracelet",
          "the aqua palace water park was a 15 minute walk from the Iberostar, Diar El Andalous where we were staying. Although it's quite a small water park it still had a good selection of slides - nothing too spectacular but you can't complain considering its 20 dinar per person",
          "not that good been to alot better the wave machine is ok and the two slides are fun but thats it lazy river you walk round somewhere i would'nt go again",

          "I had to wait a long time for the slides and they are rubbish this place is only for 5 year olds! I was in a queue and one of the people behind me pushed me and told me to go to the back of the queue so i ended up waiting 40 minutes for a rubbish slide.",
          "not a great deal there but good for the price. queues ok food on site not bad and not to crowed for high season",
          "Brilliant for all the family but gets very very busy in the afternoons. So it is best to go as it opens and leave about 2 - 3. It could of been especially busy when we went as it was Eid ( Xmas ) so that could account for it but either way is a Must if you have children.",
          "We visited the waterpark in the afternoon and and it was very busy. There are only about 5 large waterslides so inevitably there were big queues for them. They have identical mini slides for the smaller children. There is a running river which you go round in a ring, if you",
          "Good place to take the children to cool off and for some fun in the flumes Adults may well enjoy it too!",
          "A short walk from Kantaoui toen centre, the aqua park is a cracking day out for kids. Lots of slides ertc for the kids to enjoy and a few for the adults as well. The on-site restaurant is also very good for both food and value.",
          "Lots to do here but there were huge queues for the big slides and the so called music would deafen you. Worth a visit to get rid of excess energy",
          "full of arrogant and aggressive locals with no idea of queueing. there is like 2 slides and one is only open for 45 mins a day",
          "The slides were terrible! The main slides opened 10 minutes before we left. Lack of staff. All in all just a terrible water park compared to the other ones we have been to abroad! Avoid.",

          "A small park but cheap to get in (20 Dinar). Lunch was cheap too. We had a panini which was 3 dinar (currently about \u00a31.20-ish). Not too many slides but a nice lazy river, a good rubber ring slide and plenty of sunbeds with shade. The park was clean and there was a good emphasis",
          "This is the only water park in kantaoui it is nice but i have been to better, there is a very big wave pool which is good there only a few slides a multi track one, curly one and then one with 2 drops then there is the crazy one which you go down on a ring which is really good",
          "boring only a few slides not really safe for kids people go down the slide immediately after you and will land on ur sun burn :(",

        "wiki": "Sousse or Soussa (Arabic: \u0633\u0648\u0633\u0629\u200e, S\u016bsa; Berber: Susa) is a city in Tunisia, capital of the Sousse Governorate. Located 140 km (87 mi) south of the capital Tunis, the city has 271,428 inhabitants (2014). Sousse is in the central-east of the country, on the Gulf of Hammamet, which is a part of the Mediterranean Sea. Its economy is based on transport equipment, processed food, olive oil, textiles, and tourism. It is home to the Universit\u00e9 de Sousse.\n\n\n== Name ==\nSousse and Soussa are both French spellings of the Arabic name S\u016bsa, which may derive from Berber (cf., e.g., Morocco's Sous River and Region). The present city has also grown to include the ruins of Hadrumetum, which had many names in several languages during antiquity.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Hadrumetum ===\n\nIn the 11th century BC, Tyrians established Hadrumetum as a trading post and waypoint along their trade routes to Italy and the Strait of Gibraltar. Its establishment (at a river mouth about 9.7 km or 6 mi north of old Sousse) preceded Carthage's but, like other western Phoenician colonies, it became part of the Carthaginian Empire following Nebuchadnezzar II's long siege of Tyre in the 580s and 570s BC.\nThe city featured in the Third Sicilian War, the Second and Third Punic Wars (in the latter of which it secured additional territory and special privileges by aiding Rome against what was left of the Carthaginians), and Caesar's Civil War, when it was the scene of Caesar's famously deft recovery: upon tripping while coming ashore, he dealt with the poor omen this threatened to become by grabbing handfuls of dirt and proclaiming \"I have you now, Africa!\" (Latin: Teneo te Africa!) The second city in Roman Africa after Carthage, it became the capital of the province of Byzacena during the Diocletianic Reforms. Its native sons included the jurist Salvius Julianus, the emperor Clodius Albinus, and numerous Christian saints. The Roman and Byzantine catacombs beneath the city are extensive.\nThe Vandals sacked Hadrumetum in 434 but it remained a place of importance within their kingdom; a bishop and proconsul were martyred there during the Vandals' periodic forced conversions of their subjects to Arianism. The Byzantine Empire reconquered the town in 534 during the Vandal War and engaged in a public works program that included new fortifications and churches. The town was sacked during the Umayyad Caliphate's 7th-century conquest of North Africa. According to a 1987 ICOMOS report, Uqba ibn Nafi's siege and capture of the city resulted in its almost complete destruction, such that no monument of Hadrumetum \"subsists in situ\".\n\n\n=== Medieval Susa ===\nMuslim Arab armies rapidly spread Arab culture across what had been a thoroughly Romanized and Christianized landscape. Under the Aghlabids, Susa was established near the ruins of Hadrumetum and served as their main port. Their 827 invasion of Sicily was mainly launched from the town's harbor. After the Byzantine city of Melite (modern Mdina on Malta) was captured by the Aghlabids in 870, marble from its churches was used to build the Ribat. A soaring structure that combined the purposes of a minaret and a watch tower, it remains in outstanding condition and draws visitors from around the world. Its mosque is sometimes accounted the oldest surviving in the region and the town's main mosque, also built during the 9th century, has a similarly fortress-like appearance.\nSusa was briefly occupied by Norman Sicily in the 12th century; it fell to the Ottoman Empire in the 16th; and it was bombarded by a French and Venetian fleet in the 18th.\nMedieval Susa was known for its textile industries, producing silk and flax fabrics called S\u016bs\u012b. Especially renowned were its robes called shuqqas, some of which were mass-produced and sold ready-to-wear throughout the Mediterranean.\n\n\n=== Colonial Sousse ===\nTunisia became a French protectorate in 1881. The French improved the town's harbor during the next two decades. Prior to the First World War, Sousse had about 25,000 inhabitants, including around 10,000 French and roughly 5,000 other Europeans, mostly Italians and Maltese.\n\n\n=== Modern Sousse ===\nSousse has retained the solidly Arabian look and feel it had assumed in the centuries after its initial conquest. Today it is considered one of the best examples of seaward-facing fortifications built by the Arabs. These days, Sousse, with a population of about 200,000, retains a medieval heart of narrow, twisted streets, a kasbah and medina, its ribat fortress and long wall on the Mediterranean. Surrounding it is a modern city of long, straight roads and more widely spaced buildings.\nSousse was the site of the chess interzonal in 1967, made famous when American Grandmaster Bobby Fischer withdrew from the tournament even though he was in first place at the time.On 26 June 2015, a lone gunman later identified as Seifeddine Rezgui Yacoubi opened fire on tourists sunbathing on a beach near the Riu Imperial Marhaba and Soviva hotels, killing 38 and wounding 39, before being shot dead by the police.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSousse is the third largest city in Tunisia after Tunis and Sfax. Although Sousse is associated with olive oil manufacture and has other industries, tourism predominates today. An olive grove covering more than 2,500 km2 (965 sq mi) constitutes one of its main riches since antiquity. The busy port near downtown adds a touch of liveliness to its activity. Sousse also had many oil wells in the area during its colonial period.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nSousse is an important tourist resort. It has a hot semi-arid climate, with the seaside location moderating the climate, making it an all-season resort with hot, dry summers and warm, mild, wet winters. The fine sandy beaches are backed by orchards and olive groves.\nOnly 20 km (12 mi) from Monastir and Monastir Habib Bourguiba International Airport, hotel complexes with a capacity of 40,000 beds extend 20 km (12 mi) from the old city (medina) north along the seafront to Port El Kantaoui. Some 1,200,000 visitors come every year to enjoy its hotels and restaurants, nightclubs, casinos, beaches, and sports facilities.\nSousse is considered to be a popular tourist destination, especially due to its nightlife. Well-known nightclubs include Bora Bora, Living, Rediguana, Platinum, and The Saloon. The top producers and DJs in dance come to play at the various clubs. The season traditionally begins at the start of June and finishes on the first weekend of October with the closing parties.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nSousse is well-connected with the main Tunisian Railways network, having non-electrified lines to Tunis (since 1899), Sfax (since 1911), and Kasserine (since 2004) with diesel multiple unit and locomotive-driven trains. The main Gare Sousse terminus is in the city center, while Gare Kalaa Seghira serves a bypass route.\nSince 2010 the electrified Sahel Metro line goes south to Monastir Habib Bourguiba International Airport, Monastir, and Mahdia. This line has the Sousse - Bab Jadid station as its northern terminus in Sousse's city center, and 4 additional stations in the city.\nIntercity buses and red-strip microbuses (so-called louages) connect Sousse with many cities in Tunisia. Urban transit in Sousse is served by routes of articulated and conventional buses, blue-strip louages, and cheap taxis.\nThe 600 mm (1 ft 11 5\u20448 in) Sousse\u2013Kairouan Decauville railway operated from 1882 to 1996, before it was regauged to 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3\u20448 in) gauge.\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\nA medina, surrounded by its city walls and fortifications, is of historical interest. The medina includes open and covered bazaars (souks). Buildings of historical interest include the ribat castle, the central mosque, and a historical museum in the Casbah with mosaics from the area's many Roman villas. The Carthaginian catacombs can be visited.\nUNESCO declared the medina of Sousse a World Heritage Site in 1988, citing among various things its preservation from modern development.\n\n\n== Statistics ==\nPopulation:\t220,000 inhabitants (2003 estimate)\nAltitude:\t2 m\nHumidity:\t69%\nNumber of hospitals: (private and public) \t15\nAverage Temperatures: (mean temperatures from May to August for the last 30 years)\nMin: 19.7 \u00b0C\nMax: 29.1 \u00b0C\nAverage: 24.4 \u00b0C\nRainfall average: May: 19.3 mm\nJune: 4 mm\nJuly: 1.7 mm\nAugust: 10.3 mm\n\n\n== Climate ==\nK\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot semi-arid (BSh) bordering with hot-summer Mediterranean (Csa).\nThe highest recorded temperature was 48 \u00b0C (118 \u00b0F) on August 28, 2007, while the lowest recorded temperature was 4.5 \u00b0C (40.1 \u00b0F) on December 27, 1993.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nPrimasius of Hadrumetum, Roman bishop and exegete, noted for his Commentary on the Apocalypse\nMohamed Ghannouchi, Prime Minister of Tunisia from 1999 to 2011 and self-proclaimed President of Tunisia\nHamadi Jebali, former Secretary-General of the Ennahda Movement.\nAymen Abdennour, footballer\nMakrem Ben Romdhane, basketball player\nDov Alfon, author and journalist\nOns Jabeur, tennis player\n\n\n== In films ==\nSousse's old city has aspects that made it ideal as a film location. Most famous is Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), where Sousse represents Cairo, however the architectural style of Sousse, white-washed houses with blue details, bear no resemblance to the actual architecture of Cairo.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\nSousse is twinned with:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nA New Classical Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, Mythology, and Geography, New York: Harper & Bros, 1860.\nBadelon, Ernest Charles Fran\u00e7ois (1911), \"Hadrumetum\", Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th ed., Vol. XII, Encyclopaedia Britannica Co., pp. 802\u2013803.\nNorie, J.W.

          "Unless you are bored with mosaics - this is a must do in Sousse - another great collection of fabulous mosaics - not much else but worth your time",
          "As we were in Sousse we thought we would visit. The price is great value and it was lovely to look around and see the mosaics. We went outside to have a look on the viewing area but that was just houses and rubbish. An hour well spent.",
          "Small museum, the have very beautiful mosaics it will take you about on hour to visit. Very clean and good description of the mosaics.",
          "Sousse is museum is unique because it has the biggest number of mosaics dating back to the Roman's Era and it also has what we call catacombs that go under the ground for a long distance.",
          "On a par with El Jem museum for wonderful Roman mosaics. Possibly better than the Bardo. Do not miss",
          "The Museum was quiet, clean and had wonderful mosaics and relics from the past. Labels explained the history behind the artefacts. The courtyard was the true piece de resistance. There were beautiful palm trees, views of the city and the sea. Tickets were 10 dirham per adult.",
          "Sousse Archaeological Museum also known as Bardo Museum is a jewel of Tunisian heritage. It is housed in an old Beylic palace dating back to the XIXth Century. It collection traces back a big part of Tunisia\u2019s history and contains the largest collection of mosaics in the world.",
          "Carefully curated museum with good infrastructure and display, showcasing some of the richest archaeological heritage in North Africa and the Mediterranean - from fenitians and Carthaginois until arab occupation. Situated right in Sousse's kasbah and well worth a stress-free",
          "Not much to see here but worth the visit. Lots of Roman Mosaic which I'm sure will be of interest to art lovers but unfortunately I found it very samey",
          "This was def one of the best roman museums that I have ever seen. Really nice place, lots to see. The building used to be an ex prison, later converted to museum. It was really worth to pay to see this place. Absolutely gigantic mosaics and items were restored such",
          "If you like mosaics, then this is the place for you! Amazing examples of intact Roman era beautiful mosaics. I just hope they're being preserved correctly as they've all been removed from their original locations! Well worth a visit tho.",
          "This museum is just above the medina and from the garden you can have a look to the city. This museum is very interesting and has a very nice display of roman mosaics well preserved and of potteries and old oil lamps from the christic time. Do not miss it ! If you want to go to",
          "This museum concentrates on Carthaginian, Roman and Byzantine artefacts mostly in the form of mosaics. The main items on show are the Roman indicating the artistry of mosaic manufacture.",
          "Mostly a display of Roman mosaics, with a few statues and some steles. Would have been interesting to have a bit more information about Sousse and life as a Roman and later citizens. It would be nice to be able to ascend the walls, though the views are quite good anyway.",
          "Situated within the walls at the top of the medina, 9 dinars to get in and then one dinar if you wish to take photographs. All mosaic pictures and pottery and sculpture displays have informative information plaques in both french and english. Mosaics are very well preserved",
          "Firstly, you will be more than happy with the museum location. It is on the top of Sousse Medina, within the Medina's walls (Sousse Medina was built in 11 century AD) and overlooks the Medina, part of the city and the sea. It houses the second largest collection of mosaics in",
          "Sousse museum located next to the media and its catacombs reach a far way place is known for its mosaics which are unique in the world. The museum is at the heart of the tourist city Sousse Tunisia, the visit is free for students and teachers and is a monument worth visiting",
          "Got there and there was a charge of 9 denars each (roughly \u00a32.50 each) which was fine. V hot day but some Aircon and the displays were very interesting, though far too much writing on some and could have been spread out more! You couldn\u2019t walk along the top of the walls to the",
          "I wish I could have spent more time there. The mosaics were so much better than I had imagined. Not vvery big, but phenomenal collection!",
          "The museum is located right next to Sousse's medina and should be easily accessible from anywhere inside Sousse. I think I was the only one inside the museum whilst I was there with some bored looking museum staff. It has a huge collection of mosaics as well as several articles",
          "I like to see things when I visit a country, and on the excursion I took to Tunis the guide mentioned there were a lot of mosaics, not only at the Bardo but also in Sousse itself. So, the next day I set out to this museum with a friend. It's not too large, so you can do it in",
          "One of the must see things when in Sousse ; There is air conditioning and everything is well labelled and signed. Well worth a visit",
          "This museum is a must see when in Sousse. The interior is modern and air conditioned. It has a large collection of mosaics that is probably second only to the vast collection in the Bardo. There were only a few people visiting when we were there.",
          "A lovely little museum with mosaics of exceptional quality. The marine head of the ocean God is particularly fine with a haunting quality about it. Not to be missed!",
          "This museum is a little gem, well worth a visit, for a small entry fee, they have an amazing collection of Roman artefacts, lots of things to explore, the Roman mosiacs are truly beautiful . It's quite a small museum , two hours will easily be enough time to see and appreciate",
          "Easy to find right off the main road. Entrance was obvious and you can pay extra to take photos (1TND). Nice collection of mosaics and artifacts. Descriptions in Arabic, French and English. You can walk around the grounds and climb stairs although the best views were",
          "It never ceases to surprise me how under visited this great museum is, especially by the locals. Great collection of well displayed Roman Mosaics. I've been four times now and always enjoy it. Combine it with a visit to the Medina as both are at the same side of town.",
          "Very well displayed collection. Virtually empty when our group were there. Excellent toilets, always a plus!",
          "It was a great pleasure to visit this museum, it contains mosaics and archeological items of the punic area , roman, chrestien roman and bisantien ampire...I advise everyone to visit it. If you are a tunisian or you have a tunisian residency card you can get in for free in every",
          "I have see many mosaic collections in Tunisia and this one is probably the best one after Bardo. The whole place is nice, clean and makes it an important place to visit in Sousse and the entire Tunis. See pictures attached! It is up on hill from the sea and the Mdina, you can",
          "This museum worth visiting if you\u2019re in town.we paid 9 Tunisian Dirahm entrance fee .You may also combine your visit with Sousse Medina just few hundred meters from back entrance. The place is well designed architecture .",
          "This is a must see if you are ever in Sousse. I visited this museum when I was a kid about 30 years ago. And boy did it change for the better. The collection of artifacts have improved. The way artifacts are displaced is amazing with mirrors, lights and even seats to admire the",
          "A synchronized museum, with some interesting things to see, inside an old fortress. A much see in Sousse!!",
          "This is a small-medium sized museum located just on the outskirts of the Sousse Medina, accessible via the outside of the Medina (rather than within the walls). The museum is visually extremely impressive, located in a stunning old Sousse fort. The exhibits focus on just",
          "We visited there because we found the review on TripAdvisor that it was worth to visit who loves mosaic. Collection really well but ticket a bit expensive I guess (9 dinar per person). If you are boring to swim on the sea only, you can visit to see.",
          "One of largest collections of Roman mosaics in the world - just beautiful. Even worth seeing this museum paired with the Bardo Museum in Tunis.",
          "Really amazing and well maintained museum and has many great so old statues from the ancient history from more than 2000 years and it is really must be seen during your visit to sousse",
          "Stopped off here on a visit to Sousse. It's not that easy to find. You need to walk through Sousse medina or drive around it to the top of the city. The museum is impressive - very similar to the Bardo - and you can easily spend a good 1-2 hours here. For those concerned",
          "Certainly worth a visit if you like Roman history as the quality of the collection of mosaics is very good and well displayed. Just check the opening times before you go. As is usual in Tunisia, it lacks any guided tours, informative signage or information but don't let that",
          "Lovely place to visit some great facts about the island. Make sure you go with a guided tour. Worth a visit though",
          "Very interesting this was a few years ago just to see how in those days they could build that and it is still standing also well worth going to Jem where the old Roman ruins and still standing and all the things they have dug up and still finding things",
          "This museum houses the majority of Roman ruins found around the Sousse area. It is well worth visiting. It is clean and well-kept.",
          "Sousse for me is the one of nicest city in Tunesia.There is so many things to see and to enjoy.Medina is like open market I bought so many things .French fortresses and mosques are to visit.If someone like arabic spaices is right place to by.Dont walk or stay in the street and",
          "Amazing historical mosaics and pottery finds mostly found in sousse or nearby in Tunisia. leading into the narrow streets of the old medina.",
          "We were so pleasantly surprised by the Sousse Museum. Fabulous mosaics and a baptismal pool that reminds one of the Christian heritage of the area.",
          "The most important and interesting mosaics were those of Medusa and Poseidon. They are must-sees. The museum is housed in a glass shell - very airy and bright. Nice to spend 1-2 hours in.",
          "A must see if you are in Sousse. Like the Bardo museum in Tunis, this place houses mostly mosaics but the Sousse museum is a more manageable size so it can be done even with small children. Some of the mosaics, such as the large Medusa, are in good condition and look fabulous.",
          "At the top of the Medina in Sousse you will find the Museum. Recently refurbished and very smart and clean. Lovely views of the (Punic) walls too. The exhibits are not large, but entirely stunning. The mosaics are almost worth visiting Tunisia just to see!",
          "Very interested place. In old castle. To exhibit paintings and artifacts from ancient roman period to 2-3 centuries. I most exciting expositions from history of first Cristian's. There is stella's from graves people's who's was bury here.",
          "If you love art, culture and history don't miss the opportunity. The museum is located within the fortification of the old city.",
          "Great mosaics, friendly staff that went out of their way for a special needs child, handicapped accessible, clean, well presented, our favourite piece was the baptismal font. Amazing!",
          "Unfortunately, we have not been for some time but still reflect on how spacious, modern, clean and interesting this museum is. Seems a little tucked up the street but easy to find. From entrance to the Medina walk straight up the hill past the buses and following the outside",
          "it's really great how history is preserved through these ancient walls packed with small shops and friendly locals",
          "a lovely museum in the heart of the typical medina of Sousse, rich with the roman collection of mosaic",
          "As long as you don't need to ask a local how to get here - I travelled the length of Sousse medina for times before someone knew where it was and sent me in the right direction. Wonderful exhibits and friendly staff make this a great place to visit. Don't miss it.",
          "I viste this place many time its very beautiful I like it , its a old place and it have a good historyand its a public place and u find what u need there I mean its a very good place that I visited",
          "A bit like Bardo Museum, but not that big. You could get some knowledge of Tunisia in the Carthage time and the arts in that period. Lots of masterpieces to view.",
          "It is a museum with quite a bit of mosaic collections. However, if you have visited Bardo national museum before, this place will be quite boring. I was quite disappointed at the end.",
          "The Sousse Archeological Museum is one of the top two or three most beautiful and high-quality museums that I visited in Tunisia. Reopened in 2012 after extended restorations, the museum displays a fine collection of objects, with primary emphasis given to the magnificent",
          "The castle built by the Aghlabi dynasty is in great shape. The minaret has a magnificent overlook of the old city. Too much history and culture. The castle has been renovated but it maintains its overall look. across from the castle is a new shop which shows a contrast of the",
          "if you are any way intressted in ainchant remains this is for you,this place is a total roman town which arciolegists have slowly uncoverd,and reveadle the most beutefull roman mosaks i have ever seen.",
          "The museum contains the second largest collection of mosaics in the world after Bardo National Museum at the Tunisian capital \u2013 a true treasure trove. Some votive stelae and urns are displayed at the punic room date from the 7th century BC. Until the 2nd century AD, they were",
          "Absolute must visit. There isn't much in terms of artifacts to see, but the building itself and very impressive and the views are spectacular. Easy to access near the beginning of the medina, it was very quiet when I visited. Walk all the steps and keep going up in the tower to",
          "excellent opportunity to discover Sousse through thousands of years. from civilisation to an other and from dynasty to an other the museum is a fantastic opened historical Book .",
          "Nice place, rather interesting. Tickets cost 9 dn for a person. There are a lot of Byzantium mosaics and bowls. A few sculptures",
          "Great place, cheap to get in. Intersting to see the mosaics. Spent around an hour here. AS we went during Ramadan it was very quiet, as were most tourist attractions, which was great. WE only saw two other people there. Ramadan is an excellent time to go to Tunisia. Quiet,",
          "Excellent, very well preserved artifacts. Wonderful collection of mosaics and well presented . Very helpful staff.",
          "Excellent for History & Cultural Buffs.... Located in the Right Hand Side Corner on route to the Medina just past the Mosque..",
          "Really relaxing and scenario atmosphere inside and outside the museum. It also surrounded by residential areas, where you can experience the normal Tunisians lifestyle.",
          "Nice quiet and relaxing atmosphere. Doesn't have the \"workers\" standing around to show you something then asking you for money! I paid the extra few Dinar to take photos and I think it was worth it. A lovely building with some lovely ladies at the entrance who were polite and",
          "A nice museum that consists mostly of mosaics. Some are very impressive and it is well worth the visit. You can work your way around the whole museum in a couple of hours maximum and is a nice place to visit before or after going to the medina for some shopping.",
          "Another excellent maintained archaeological site which offers good info/history and most excellent views from the top of the building. Bring a torch for going up the crooked staircase and a camera for those stunning views. Can be noisy early on when tour groups visit so mid",
          "This is a lovely building in its own right and has many ancient artifacts within its walls. It is part of the walled Medina and is well worth a visit.",
          "If you are into Archaeology you will find this well worth a visit. Makes you think how they put up this stunning castle like building so long ago.",
          "Fantastic museum, the mosiac art is amazing and seeing all the statues and artifacts that are so old makes you feel like your stepping back in history, really enjoyed our visit!",
          "Not exactly the same as Bardo but a good place to go if you are in the area. Mostly mosaics and some relics are displayed but as mentioned, not as extensive as their National Museum.",
          "Really nice mosaic works, like the head of Medussa, Zeus... Very interesting museum inside the kasbah of Sousse. You can climb on a wall to see the city medina.",
          "Taxi costs about 5-6 dinars each way. Mosaics are absolutely amazing and the whole museum is very entertaining.",
          "There isn't loads of exhibits here so don't expect to need much more than 30 minutes. What they have is quite interesting though, particularly if you're interested in Roman Carthage. The highlights are definitely the Medusa and Dionysus mosaics. Sadly, it seems most of Sousse's",
          "The mosaics here are incredible and so well preserved. The staff was happy to talk to us about how they were recovered and maintained. Very impressive and worth a visit.",
          "My holiday was going well and I went to the museum by foot. A spectacular building both inside and out. Their was rather a lot of people around and you didnt get much free time to look around but all was enjoyed. We had to cancel 4 trips due to an incident involving misguided",
          "This is a lovely place to visit, the mosaics are amazing. Well worth a look if you're in sousse. When you pay for your tickets you get a map, on it it says there is a cafe. We spent 20mins looking for it and eventually asked at the entrance, it doesn't exist haha! So take a",
          "The museum is well worth a visit it's well laid out with really helpful staff Plenty to see and really good guide book Go and see it your on holiday",
          "This museum is not well publicised, but is a real jewel in the heart of Sousse. Its a pity that so few tourists know about it or take the time to visit it. We have ben to the Bardo and numerous historical sites during previous visits to Tunisia, but were amazed by the displays.",
          "I have visited the Bardo Museum many years ago and now that this has been refurbished I must say that this is a Must Visit when in Sousse. The Staff don't speak much English which is something that could be improved upon but all the exhibits are illustrated in Arabic/French and",
          "We began our visit with a problem, having paid our 9dinar each admission,there were no descriptive leaflets in English. However all of the wonderful Mosaics which we really marvelled at, were labled in English as were the marble statues. Unfortunately when we wanted some more",
          "If you are staying in Sousse it is well worth a visit. The mosaics are particularly amazing and if you are travelling with kids rather than taking a long bus trip to the Bardo in Tunis this is probably a really good option instead.",
          "I have three criteria for museums - interesting exhibits, allowing photos, and having information in English that makes a subject interesting. This place gets high marks for all three - even as someone that usually sees my eyes glaze over when it comes to history, there's plenty",
          "Loverly mosaics and pleanty of history reasanable entry at 9 Dinars, if you are not interested in this sort of museum",
          "Given the recent attacks the Bardo is now out of consideration. We did however immensely enjoy the Sousse museum which was packed with the most wonderfully detailed mosaics. It took us about 1 1/2hrs to walk around so you do not suffer museum fatigue. Highly recommended. It does",
          "If you are into ancient history, it is a wonderful little museum. Some real treasures and amazing mosaics.",
          "The museum has recently reopened after a major restoration of the building. It is now restored to its former glory with a magnificent display of Roman mosaics, not to be missed. I was rather concerned to the future fate of the brilliant mosaics displayed around a glasses in",
          "We went and were told its closed can you not read ?? It was in Arabic how was I meant to translate that,doors open no one to ask until this man came and said this.....mad place tunisia they want your money but not the tourists ....asked when it would open man said I don't speak",
          "A really great museum. Almost as good as Bardo. A very fine collection of mosaics in a beautiful location",
          "A excellent view of 2nd & 3rd AD mosaics. The 2nd AD are in better condition. Not to say the 3rd AD are not of Interest. This museum is based in an old building but with modern design allowing natural light in to enhance the mosacis. This Museum. Its located north east of the",
          "A very nicely displayed set of mosaics in a newly revamped building in a corner of the medina. Some of the exhibits are really exceptional (both in quality of preservation and design) when compared to the Roman mosaics one might see in many European museums. Entrance fee is",
          "beautiful building. Big ones can go for a walk. The location may be quiet and loud. Not to be missed.",
          "Beautiful building in South west of medina with a nice collection of mosaics with descriptions.You can easily spend an hour to 2 hours",
          "Located at the rear of the huge medina in sousse, the archaelogical museum promises a fascinating glimpse of the past. As a lover of history, i was tempted. I have to say that i was disappointed. Having been to the Bardo museum in Tunis, the one in sousee is very much the poor",
          "It's well worth a visit to see an amazing collection of huge floor and wall mosaics! It's situated in the old Kasbah which is quite an imposing building in Sousse.",
          "Stunning building housing this collection of mosaics. Well worth an hour of your time exploring this building.",
          "Intereasting, the mosaics were excellent. The lifts were not working but this was not a problem for us but for other people it would be.",
          "Wonderful location excellant displays of Mosiac right up their with the Brado in Tunis just smaller. Location of the. 6 th century Bekalta baptismal font stunning Bzantine Mosiac work. Don't miss throughly enjoyed time spent and outstanding renovation work and displays of",

          "This museum is located in the Sousse Kasbah, the 11th C fortress which takes up the south west corner of the medina. It contains a wealth of large mosaics from the numerous roman ruins which dot this part of the Tunisian coast. Look for the Triumph of Neptune, and the god",
          "Has been renovated recently, very nice mosaics well conserved and a big number of sculptures but unfortunately the descriptions and explanations are in a small characters.",
          "You'll find Roman history littered around Tunisia. The museum is no exception and they've gathered a fair amount of mosaics in one place! I have to say I'm not terribly interested in mosaics and after the first few I was ready to leave again... the outside area is really nice",
          "It s a beautiful country, but reputation destroyed by the hotel, Tax \u2013 The tourist tax introduced in October 2014. The hotel will not allow us to pay at the hotel. The information states that we can pay this tax at the hotel",
          "Please do visit this is a get little museum full of great roman & Christian relics. A taxi here costs less than \u00a31 & it's well worth it",
          "Wasn't expecting this at all. Totally fantastic pieces of mosaic works. Recommended. A great time to pass a few hours and so calm and tranquil inside too.",
          "The Sousse Museum was great the mosac,s are great so well preserved and the sculptur is to would recomend to all you are able to take picture,s with a ticket bought when you pay to go in.",
          "Very interesting - objects from as far back as 1st Century. There is a really cool baptismal font as well. A welcome cool spot for an hour out of the sun.",
          "This is the most important museum in Sousse and a must-see. There are really great objects there to see. Ancient and interesting and well-preserved. If you're a student, don't forget to bring your International student card. It will be free. Also if you go up the building, it",
          "Well worth a visit little bit pricey but if you like history and want to learn more about the history of Sousse and Tunisia.",
          "The museum is a fantastic place to visit, starting with the striking entrance. Inside you will pay 9 Dinars and an additional 1 Dinar to be allowed to use your camera (why wouldn\u2019t you pay for this?) the main part of the museum is underground in a really well air conditioned",
          "Grat place to learn about the history of this beautiful country. take a guide to explain the history and enjoy",
          "Interesting museum and in the centre of Sousse near the medina. Collection of beautiful mosaics. Combine the visit with a shopping trip.",
          "Depends if you like this sort of thing. Can be quite boring and not all parts of the museum are open to the public.",
          "took awhile to find it, but worth it and it was very interesting. it was an old house as they used to live, there was also a guide in english and all free!",
          "Loved all the original Roman Mosaics,some that you could walk over. The guide did an excellent job of giving us all the history of the Mosaics.",
          "Worth a trip, if only for the ice cold air con! Lots of roman stuff, and very large, near complete mosaics. 9DT per adult, kids free :o)",
          "Our visit to Sousse Archeological Museum was one of the highlights of our holiday.I was last in Sousse 15 years ago and I don't recall this museum being there so visiting it now in it's fine form filled all our cultural needs at a very reasonable entrance fee,though we were",
          "very interesting, so much to explore and imagine i really didnt know there was so much to the country, A must",
          "A very interesting place and well laid out. It's cheap a 2.5 \u20ac. The roman house really comes alive. Please give generously to the guides as they are volunteers.",
          "Fantastic museum. The Roman mosaics are fabulous. The workmanship of the mosaic workers from almost 2000 years ago is simply outstanding. I think the bath that is mentioned in earlier reviews is in fact an early Christian baptismal pool. My personal favourite is the mosaic",
          "they have on display some excellent roman mosaics and a roman bath along with some statues be advised to take pictures in the museum you pay 1 denar",
          "The Sousse Museum is really a treasure with an extensive collection of North African mosaics from the Roman and Byzantine periods. I came to Tunisia specifically to go to this museum, and it did not let me down. The museum is very modern, with labels in Arabic, French, and",
          "Very interesting. mosaics we're very impressive. The guide was very helpful. Went to colossium before the museum also recommended.",
          "We had a car to ourselves for this trip. The guide was very informative and knowledgeable. It was a really interesting day and I would recommend it.",
          "There are some great mosaics and there is a fantastic view of the city, but the layout is a bit weird. When you are outside above the gallery space, there are stairwells that lead to offices. We thought the rooms were more galleries but when we got up the stairs, there were",
          "What an amazing place - we took my 8 year old daughter who was mesmerised by the beautiful mosaics. Such a shame that the Thomson hotel rep doesn't tell anyone about it! The museum is clean, informative and air conditioned. On the site which was the original kasbah are wonderful",
          "One of the top attractions there. It was a bid hard to find it, because it is placed in Medina, and if you go there it is very hard to orientate only with a map, need to have gps",
          "Small and well maintained museum with amazing mosaics - so very beautiful. They must have looked so lovely in their original houses\u2026particularly liked the one of the Nilotic scene with the peasants pulling a donkey out of the crocodile's mouth! Some fine tigers too. Very plesant",
          "Beautiful mosaics and a great courtyard. Price is 9TD + 1TD for camera - worth visiting this place for 1 hour and you can do this on your own and don't require any guides at all.",
          "Very informative sign in varies languages on exibits lots to see small charge for camera ticket so could take pictures",
          "Stunning mosaics of every shape and colour imaginable .Our tour guide really brought it to life and tho it was raining the outside villa was lovely and took yopu right back into history",
          "This would be considered excellent in Britain. It had some very good exhibits, well portrayed and all had explanations of what they depicted in English and French. It is not my sort of interest normally, but this is very well worth a visit.",
          "This was rated number one visitor attraction on trip advisor before I went so was on my 'must see' list for my holiday. It did not disappoint. I have a new found fascination with mosaics now. Incredible artistry and excellent information about each piece at the side of it. Staff",
          "Amazing mosaics the like of which I have never seen before. Beautiful muted colours, tiny pieces of mosaic dating from 3rd CE. Brilliantly displayed in modern museum. Some only discovered quite recently. A 'must' if you are in Tunisia!",

      "name": "Zaghouan Aqueduct",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Zaghouan Aqueduct or Aqueduct of Carthage is an ancient Roman aqueduct, which supplied the city of Carthage, Tunisia with water. From its source in Zaghouan it flows a total of 132 km, making it amongst the longest aqueducts in the Roman Empire.\n\n\n== Date ==\nThe date of the construction of the aqueduct is not entirely clear. Sources mention a visit by the Emperor Hadrian in 128, with which a five-year-long drought is meant to have come to an end. The water shortage resulting from the drought might have convinced him that the people should not rely only on rainwater any more. A second event which might have inspired it was the opening of the Baths of Antonius in Carthage in 162. These facilities on the same scale as the Imperial baths in Rome demanded a steady supply of water, which could not be fulfilled with rain water.\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\nThe aqueduct draws on several sources which ran dry at different times. The first and most important source is located near the town of Zaghouan in the Djebel Zaghouan, a mountain range about 60 km south of Carthage. In Roman times a sacred fountain structure was built over the spring, which became one of the most important in ancient North Africa.\n\n\n=== Description ===\nThe sacred fountain is located on an artificial terrace. It is open on the north side, and on the southern side there is an open space enclosed by a 4-metre-wide (13 ft), crescent-shaped portico. In the centre of the portico is a cella from which the spring sprang.\nThe outer wall had a core of Roman concrete covered with coarse limestone bossages. This wall continued from the ends of the crescent shaped portico and was divided into 26 sections be engaged columns. In every second section there is a niche for statues, which do not survive. Opposite each engaged column is a full column, which together once supported a vaulted peristyle. The vaults are made of porous travertine covered in marble, while the columns are sandstone. The exterior of the vault was sealed with waterproof Opus signinum and left without further protection. The floor of the portico was decorated with mosaic. The cella, as the most important part of the building was built from limestone and clad in marble.\n\n\n=== Intake ===\nThere were five springs in the area of the sacred fountain. These were in the area of the artificial terrace in their original, underground bed and gathered in a basin under the terrace. From this basin the water then flowed into the pipe of the aqueduct. As well as feeding the aqueduct intake, the basin also served to clean the water - while the water sat in the basin, impurities would settle on the bottom.\n\n\n=== Second source ===\nIn Severan times, a second source was attached to the aqueduct. This was located in the region of Djouggar. A sacred fountain was built over this spring too, but it never reached the significance of the one at Zaghouan.\n\n\n== Water channel ==\n\n\n=== Technical data ===\nThe aqueduct is a masterpiece of Roman engineering. In the journey from Zaghouan to Carthage, it travels a little over 90 km and drops only 264 m in height, which is an average decline of 0.3%. However, 130 m of the height difference occurs in the first 6 km from Zaghouan to Moghrane. For the rest of the journey to Carthage, the decline averages only 0.15%. In Moghrane the aqueduct met the later channel coming from Djouggar, another 33 km away. Including all its tributary channels, the aqueduct has a length of 132 km and is among the longest in the Roman empire.\nThe channel discharged between 200 and 370 l of water per second or between 17 and 32 million litres per day. The flow rate was around 3.5 and 5.5 km per hour. Therefore, the water made the journey from Zaghouan to Carthage in between a day and a half and two days.\n\n\n=== Course ===\nThe channel was built such that it had a steady, if not uniform, fall, so that the water would travel the route by the force of gravity alone. In order to minimise the building work, the channel was laid on or a little under the Earth's surface where possible. In order to avoid unnecessary loss of height, the channel follows the countours of hills. In three places it was not possible for the channel to remain at ground level, so the engineers erected imposing arcades. They are:\n\nThe plain of Oudna: 5 km, including a 125-metre-long (410 ft) bridge on a double arcade with a height of 33 m. This bridge was demolished in 1859 in order to reuse the stone for the construction of a new bridge.\nThe plain of Miliane: 2 km, the arcade reaches up to 20 m in height.\nThe plain of La Soukra, before Carthage: 10 km, the arcade reaches up to 20 m in height.\n\n\n=== Cross-section ===\nIn cross-section, the channel measures about 90 cm in width and 130 cm in height. It was closed on top by a vault. The walls were made from Roman cement and were clad with sandstone bossage. The part of the channel which came in contact with water was further clad in waterproof opus signinum. The screed also served to smooth the channel's rate of decline. For ventialtion there were small, square openings in the roof. At regular intervals on the base of the channel there were circular depressions, which served to purify the water, since detritus would settle in them. To continue to operate, these had to be cleaned out regularly, so the channel required ongoing care and attention\n\n\n== Cisterns ==\n\nThe distribution of the water within Carthage is not yet entirely clear. It seems that the channel discharged into two cisterns and the water was further distributed from these. To date, however, archaeological excavations have found no sure signs of discharge into the cisterns.\n\n\n=== Cisterns of La Malga ===\n\nThe cisterns of La Malga form the largest cisterns surviving from the ancient world anywhere. They held approximately 51 million litres. Based on the nature of the mortar, they are dated to the first century AD. It is not yet clear how these cisterns were used in that period, since the aqueduct had not yet been built and this enormous volume could never have been filled by rainwater alone.\n\n\n=== Cistern of Bordj Djedid ===\nThe cistern of Bordj Djedid is made up of 18 barrel-shaped basins arranged in parallel and held between 25 and 30 million litres. It was responsible for supplying the Baths of Antonius. The construction date is unknown, but modifications have been detected in connection with the construction of the Baths of Antonius, implying that the cistern preceded the baths.\n\n\n== Later usage ==\nSince the water supply was essential for the city, the aqueduct was destroyed during the Vandal siege of 439, the Eastern Roman reconquest under Justinian and finally at the conquest of Carthage by the Arabs in 698, but each time it was subsequently restored. In the thirteenth century one of the Hafsid rulers added a branch leading to his palace in Manouba in order to supply water for his garden. From the sixteenth century, the aqueduct deteriorated rapidly and was employed as a stone quarry.\nIn 1859 a French engineer received the task of restoring the water channel in order to supply Tunis with water. While the majority of the channels at ground level could be reused, the parts of the channel on pillars were mostly destroyed and a modern pressure pipe system was installed. Since it was put into operation in 1862, the channel has remained in use and today it supplies an average of 12,000,000 L per day in winter and 3,000,000 in summer.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of aqueducts in the Roman Empire\nList of Roman aqueducts by date\nAncient Roman technology\nRoman engineering\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFriedrich Rakob. \"Das r\u00f6mische Quellenheiligtum bei Zaghouan in Tunesien\".

        "wiki": "The Cisterns of La Malga or Cisterns of La M\u00e2alga are a group of cisterns, which are among the most visible features of the archaeological site of Carthage near Tunis, Tunisia. They are some of the best preserved Roman cisterns.\nThe cisterns, with a capacity of 50,000\u201360,000 m3 (1,800,000\u20132,100,000 cu ft), received water from a branch of the Zaghouan Aqueduct (exactly which branch remains uncertain). They were designed to provide the water supply for Carthage, the most important city of Africa Proconsulare during the High Empire, and especially to supply the Baths of Antoninus.\nAs part of the site of Carthage, the cisterns are classified as a World Heritage site by UNESCO. On 17 February 2012, the Tunisian government proposed that the whole Zaghouan-Carthage Roman hydraulic complex, of which they are a part, should be classed as a world heritage site.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe large, relatively well-preserved cisterns are located on the north side of the ancient Roman city. They were not the only largest cisterns of Carthage, but existed alongside others: the \"basins of Hamilcar\" and those located on the hill of Bordj Djedid.\nFrom the Middle Ages, the cisterns were used as makeshift houses, stables, barns or cellars by the local populations; a practice which continued until the twentieth century. For a long time this prevented archaeological investigation of the complex.According to Al Idrisi, there were at least 24 cisterns in a single line, each with a length of 130 pace and a width of 26 pace - though Henri Saladin considered this width too high. According to Christian Tuxen Falbe, there were fifteen cisterns which were 430 ft (130 m) in width and four ruined cisterns a little to the west and each of these nineteen cisterns had a length of 300 ft (91 m).\nThere is an active project to conserve and restore the site, and to develop a museum space devoted to it.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe group of cisterns forms a rectangular space measuring 127 m (417 ft) x 102 m (335 ft) (12,945 m2 (139,340 sq ft)). Each cistern is composed of a vaulted space, 102 m (335 ft) long, 7.4 m (24 ft) wide and 7 m (23 ft) high (excluding the vault), with a total capacity of 60,000 m3 (2,100,000 cu ft). There are fifteen individual cisterns, which are separated from one another and arranged in parallel.\nEach vault has about ten circular openings. A cistern which distributed water to the others is aligned perpendicular to the others. A subsidiary aqueduct derived from the Zaghouan Aqueduct ran alongside the distribution cistern and supplied it with water through openings on its edge.\nThe presence of numerous circular openings on top of the each cistern's vault appear to be openings for water to escape through when the cisterns were too full or for collecting rain water. However, it is probable that the cisterns were actually surmounted by another level of tanks - in the same manner as Gallo-Roman two-story reservoirs.The large cisterns were relied upon by the vast bath complex of Antoninus. The water flowed down from the cisterns to the baths through underground pipes.In the immediate neighbourhood of the cisterns are other important sites: the cemetery of the officials, the villa of Scorpianus and some mausoleums, one of which has been re-constructed in a special room of the Bardo National Museum.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Roman cisterns\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in French) Jacques V\u00e9rit\u00e9, \u00ab Le site de La Malga \u00e0 Carthage \u00bb, Bulletin du CEDAC, n\u00b010, 1989, pp. 41-47\n(in French) Auguste Audollent, Carthage romaine : 146 avant J\u00e9sus-Christ-698 apr\u00e8s J\u00e9sus-Christ, \u00e9d.

          "The scale of the baths is really impressive, especially as we were told that they were damaged due to bombing in the war. A must visit if you're in Tunis.",

          "The ruins at Carthage aren't as impressive as those at Ephesus or at Jerash, but they're certainly worth a visit. The sites are fairly spread out, so don't expect to see everything in a day, especially if you want to take things at a leisurely pace. Probably a good idea to",
          "We saved this attraction for last when we visited Carthage and are we glad we did! This is by far the best site in the area. It is a huge place with so many relics and ruins. The views are amazing and the ohotos you can get are out of this world. Highly recommend you visit this",
          "Being a full on ancient Rome history buff I must say that I fully geeked out during my visit. Here is one of the largest and most well preserved roman ruin in northern Africa and since it's Tunisia there are no restrictions other than a a sign that asks one to not climb on",

          "Having learnt about Carthage many years ago I wanted to visit this historic site. Although the baths are in ruins there is plenty to see to gain an impression of how large and important this site was. Having been to Rome and seeing Roman sites around Europe this is another piece",

          "It\u2019s quite the eye-opener to see the geographic scope of the Roman Empire. How grand it must have been to enjoy the hot baths over-looking the Mediterranean. But not-so-grand for those that built it and served the bathers. This was a great cruise ship excursion while docked",

          "To be honest there isn't a massive amount to see, but what there is is impressive. There aren't a lot of signs explaining what you're looking at, so you either need a guide or your own knowledge. When you enter you see the last stages of development of the city (Roman) and you",

It was founded in 1939 by the French scholar on Maghrebi art Lucien Golvin, in a palace located in the heart of the ancient city of Sfax.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe house was built by Andalusian Muslim refugees fleeing from the Spanish persecutions in the 17th century. Since then the house was bought by Farhat al-Jalouli, a military commander from Sfax and a wealthy gun dealer. The son of his grandson, Mahmoud al-Jalouli, was a wealthy businessman as well and he moved to Medina of Tunis, but five of his sons (Farhat, Hassan, Mohammed, Sadiq and al-Arabi) lived at the house in Sfax as military commanders from the area. The house became their headquarters.\nThe house became a medical clinic in 1934. In 1939, it became an artistic center under the direction of the French university professor Lucien Golvin. To this day the house has been serving as a regional museum of arts and folk traditions.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe facade of the house is modest and its design is purely classical, and it contains many characteristics of Tunisian housing. Around the square courtyard in the center, there are rooms of inverted T shape. The courtyard is located opposite from the entrance door, with its two compartments serving as storage area of supplies.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Museum ==\nIn the hallways, scenes from the traditional daily life of the 18th-century Sfax were reconstructed in both urban and rural characters. On the first floor there are exhibition of several traditional costumes and on the second floor there are several oil paintings and Islamic calligraphy.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDouz Museum\nNabeul Museum\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Hammuda Pasha Bey (\u062d\u0645\u0648\u062f\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0634\u0627), died 1666 was the second Bey of the Tunisian Muradid dynasty. He reigned from 1631 until his death.\n\n\n== Reign ==\nSon of Murad I Bey and an odalisque of Corsican origin named Yasmine, Hammuda was notable for his strength as much as his generosity and concern for his people. During his reign, he led many expeditions against dissident tribes in the northwest and south of the country in order to maintain order and security.In 1637, Hammuda orchestrated the election of Usta Murad as Dey, commander of the Ottoman military in Tunis. Usta Murad, a friend of his father, was an old corsair, who European sources claim had captured around 900 ships and more than 20,000 prisoners to be sold as slaves at market in Tunis.\nHe obtained from the subsequent Dey, Ahmed Khodja Dey the right to a force of almost 600 footmen drawn from the sipahis to serve as a bodyguard; their command was guaranteed to the agha of the sipahis. In addition, in his reign the island of Djerba, which belonged to the pasha of Tripoli was definitively annexed by Tunis, although this was in large part the result of Yusuf Dey's diplomatic efforts.\nIn 1647, at the height of his power, he appointed all the officials and managed to gain control of the janissary force in Tunis. In 1659, the Ottoman sultan Mehmed IV named him pasha of Tunis. But his piratical activities bothered the European powers and France sent a large naval squadron to perform a demonstration of force. Hammuda, wishing to avoid conflict, signed a treaty on 25 December 1665. In it he specifies that Tunisia rcognised the preeminence of the French consul over other foreign ambassadors and granted them the right to engage in commerce throughout the whole of Tunisia.\n\n\n== Achievements ==\n\nHammond a Pasha established peace and order throughout the country. Bin Abi Dinar al-Kairaouani said of his reign that merchants could move everywhere freely without arms.A dedicated builder, Hammuda was responsible for the construction of many souks of the Medina of Tunis, as well as many palaces, including the Dar Hammouda Pacha and the predecessor of the modern Dar El Bey. In 1655, he had Ottoman architects build the Hammouda Pacha Mosque in the Turkish style, with an elegant octagonal minaret, below which he constructed his family mausoleum.Among his other achievements are the construction of a bimaristan (hospital) in the medina of Tunis and the reconstruction, with embellishments, of the mausoleum of Sidi Sahab (mosque of Barbier) at Kairouan. In 1643 he bought the old pleasure palace of the Hafsids at Le Bardo from the divan of the Turkish garrison in Tunis. Composed initially of three pavilions, which he had restored, he aggrandised it by adding orchards, a hammam, a cafe, souks and a funduq for visitors. His son Murad II Bey made this his primary residence, dwelling there almost permanently.\n\n\n== Marriages and succession ==\n\nHammuda's father had married him to the very popular princess Aziza Othmana, granddaughter of Othman Dey. Her inheritance and the property given to her by Hammuda Pasha made up the most important habous in the country; in totally it is believed to have amounted to almost 90,000 hectares scattered through the whole country. The revenue of these lands financed several funds supporting the needy at the Aziza Othmana hospital as well as the maintenance of religious buildings in Tunis and in the holy cities of Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem. Only a portion was retained for her descendants. It was not until 1957 that the habous was dissolved and Aziza Othmana's property was liquidated or nationalised.\nHammuda's other spouses reflect mostly the need for political alliances:\n\nSecond spouse: Fatma, daughter of a Turkish odalisque, freed by a Hmida Charfi;\nThird spouse: Hiziyya, daughter of Ali Thabet, an assistant and companion of Yusuf Dey, and mother of Murad II Bey;\nFourth spouse: Khadija, daughter of the qaid Ja'afar, a rich and treacherous corsair\nFifth spouse: Mira, daughter of Mouhamed Askri, sheikh of the Hannacha tribe (Algeria\u2013Tunisia border).In 1663, tired by age, he progressively divested himself of power in favour of his three sons: Murad II Bey received the succession to the Beylik of Tunis, Mohamed el-Hafsi Bey gained the sanjaks of Kairouan, Sfax, Sousse, Monastir and the whole southern part of the country, and the youngest brother Hussein Bey gained the sanjaks on the border with Algeria. Hammuda died in 1666 at Dar El Bey, which he had built so that he could reside closer to his people.\nOn his death he was buried in the mausoleum located under his mosque, in the corner opposite the minaret.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Africa portal\n History portal\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== General sources ==\nAlphonse Rousseau, Annales tunisiennes ou aper\u00e7u historique sur la r\u00e9gence de Tunis, \u00e9d.

          "I visited the Mausoleum as part of a TUI excursion (a few of us were going stir crazy at our hotel). The walk up to the Mausoleum is breathtaking - the scale of the dome and the minaret, the mosaic tiling, carved stone and ceilings...it\u2019s a real treat for the eyes. The history",

          "You can tell by the mausoleum that Habib Bourghiba and his family were highly held in the Tunsian society even though many people disapproved of him as well, but seems to have withheld a prominent place. The mausoleum is shaped as a mosque with domes and minarets but there is no",
          "This has limited opening times but it\u2019s worth a visit. We got in because we had a Tunisian with us and we tipped the security guard. So beautiful inside and well laid out to show the history. Not been ruined by the usual tourism stuff. The walk down the tree lined avenue to it",
          "Absolutely amazing place! He was the first president of Tunisia after the French got expelled and was treated like an admirable figure to the Tunisian people. This palace looks great. The only issue I had was that there isn't much to visit inside, only the office and the",

          "We got a taxi from Sousse to come here which was cheap. The Mosque and the surrounding area is stunning and managed to take some really nice pictures. If you come for a tour I would recommend to wear suitable clothing otherwise the locals become a bit unfriendly as noticed",

          "Worth a visit and not too expensive. You can pay a guide to give you information. There is information there but wr found a guide useful. Guides are not official but you negotiate a tip money fee, ifbits closed when you get there look through railings as often the guard will let",
          "Nothing impressive about this site, I can just pass by it without being curious to check it at all. A part from seeing how Bourguiba wasted a lot of tax payers money for his tomb nothing to see.",
          "I went to see the medina of Monastir and as there's not much to see anyway, I decided to pop into this place. Turned out it's a much more curious place than I can judge from the reviews here. Indeed, the place looks majestic from the outside and a bit Soviet-style inside, mixed",
          "Simply the Mausol\u00e9e of Bourguiba which was the first tunisian president till 1987 (after independance in 1956)",
          "For the history buffs, the \"Father of the nation\" Mausoleum is an interesting part of modern Tunisia's history. Through it you can start learning about how this little country started being shaped into the complex reality of today.",

          "This place is not only a grave but also a museum and a remembrance for what bourguiba did. Not more than one hour and worth the stop. Don't miss the small Mezri mausoleum just beside it. Worth the 5min Detour",

          "The place itself has a very nice position, near the Ribat and an old cemetery near the sea. I personally disliked the long paved entrance way, it is too opulent and overwhelming in comparison with the size and attractivity of the Mausoleum itself. Since I was alone, the",
          "What a surprise! Palatial and very impressive. Free admission was a bonus. Incredible marble and mosaics and immaculately kept. Definitely worth a visit. Camel rides available outside.",
          "The building is beautiful from the walk up to the gates to inside the Mausoleum. The most interesting part for me was the photos of Bourghiba with all the leaders of the Middle East including Anwar Sadat but it was those that have gone down in history as monsters like Sadam",

          "So exquisite, we only had enough time to take pictures from outside though. Must check this out if you're in Tunisia",
          "I think since this is a free attraction it would be remiss not to go whilst in Monastir. There is a very touching memorial to Bourghiba in the form of personal photos and possessions. The building and it's materials are noteworthy too for their beauty. The signage here is all",

          "Tunisians value Bourghiba's memory very much and it is clearly seen in this mausoleum. I probably would not go from another town to see it, as I am not the biggest fan of historical objects, however if you are staying in Monastir it is a must to see. Entry is free of charge.",
          "Everything about Bourghiba Mausoleum is Grand and Glam! Worth visiting! Architecturally excelling and fitting memorial. Marble has been used well and with great deal of thought given to the whole structure. Imposing minarets give a grand feel to the whole visit here. Entry is",

          "A guide will introduce himself & start showing you around if you agree to this or not & of course then expects a nice tip. If you like tipping in general then Tunisia is for you. Tip Tip Horay !",
          "Although lacking historical refinement it displays adulation, not in a very clumsy way. It is worth stopping in Monastir for and allows for understanding of the relation and elevation of the historical leader.",
          "Free entrance to Habib Bourguiba's Mausoleum so if in Monastir it is a must see. I found it touching to see his personal effects , clothing ,desk on display. He liberated the Tunisien women by giving them the right to vote , abolished bigamy , & underage marriages & is a hero to",

          "The Bourghiba Mausoleum is at the end of a long avenue which cuts through the main cemetery in Monastir. Lined with trees, marble paving and well tended gardens its surrounding are very impressive. The domed mausoleum at the end, makes for some great photographs. I left it too",
          "I visited the Mausoleum with a First Choice excursion. Had it not been part of the tour, I possibly would not have considered visiting here. However, it is definitely worth a visit. I'd never heard of Bourguiba until the day we visited and our tour guide explained that he was",

          "Amazing outside grounds but you really must go inside. The chandeliers, the rooms and the decor is unbelievable. We paid a couple of Dinar to a guide in there and he took us all over the three Mausoleum parts - Bourghiba's, his wife's and his family's.",
          "While visiting The Mausoleum, which was a gorgeous place, we discovered a small women's refuge, where Muslim woman can retreat, prey and meet other women, while visiting the landmark nearby. It was truly amazing to get a direct look into their culture and habits. They were",

          "Popped into the mausoleum on a whistle-stop trip into Monastir. It is a pretty building with impressive architectural features and an amazing chandelier. Most of the information in the building is in Arabic or French, so it is worth taking a phone/tablet to find out more",

          "Really nice looking mausoleum. Makes me wonder how many current politicians did half of what President Bourghiba did. A must - see for those interested in history of Tunisia, not just the sunbathing :)",

          "For many years I have stood at the gates of this mausoleum. I remember a young tunisian saying we are such a poor country how can we afford this. After Bourghiba died the gates were opened. What extravagance for just one man. How could such a poor country afford this",

          "We really liked the trip back home. If you read the reviews for September 2012, you will get the whole picture of what this awful place is like. There were no lights on when we were shown to our room, and this was after filling in silly forms that we were told to do, or we will",

        "wiki": "Tunis (Arabic: \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633\u200e T\u016bnis) is the capital and largest city of Tunisia. The greater metropolitan area of Tunis, often referred to as \"Grand Tunis\", has about 2,700,000 inhabitants, making it the third-largest city in the Maghreb region (after Casablanca and Algiers) and the sixteenth-largest in the Arab world. \nSituated on a large Mediterranean Sea gulf (the Gulf of Tunis), behind the Lake of Tunis and the port of La Goulette (\u1e24alq il-W\u0101d), the city extends along the coastal plain and the hills that surround it. At its core lies its ancient medina, a World Heritage Site. East of the medina through the Sea Gate (also known as the Bab el Bhar and the Porte de France) begins the modern city, or Ville Nouvelle, traversed by the grand Avenue Habib Bourguiba (often referred to by popular press and travel guides as \"the Tunisian Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\"), where the colonial-era buildings provide a clear contrast to smaller, older structures. Further east by the sea lie the suburbs of Carthage, La Marsa, and Sidi Bou Said. As the capital city of the country, Tunis is the focus of Tunisian political and administrative life and also the centre of the country's commercial and cultural activities. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nTunis is the transcription of the Arabic name \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633 which can be pronounced as \"T\u016bnus\", \"T\u016bnas\", or \"T\u016bnis\". All three variations were mentioned by the Greek-Syrian geographer al-Rumi Yaqout in his Mu'jam al-B\u00fbldan (Dictionary of Countries).\nDifferent explanations exist for the origin of the name Tunis. Some scholars relate it to the Phoenician goddess Tanith ('Tanit or Tanut), as many ancient cities were named after patron deities. Some scholars claim that it originated from Tynes, which was mentioned by Diodorus Siculus and Polybius in the course of descriptions of a location resembling present-day Al-Kasbah; Tunis's old Berber Bourgade.Another possibility is that it was derived from the Berber verbal root ens which means \"to lie down\" or \"to pass the night\". The term Tunis can possibly mean \"camp at night\", \"camp\", or \"stop\", or may have referred to as \"the last stop before Carthage\" by people who were journeying to Carthage by land. There are also some mentions in ancient Roman sources of such names of nearby towns as Tuniza (now El Kala), Thunusuda (now Sidi-Meskin), Thinissut (now Bir Bouregba), and Thunisa (now Ras Jebel). As all of these Berber villages were situated on Roman roads, they undoubtedly served as rest-stations or stops.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Carthage ===\n\nThe historical study of Carthage is problematic. Because its culture and records were destroyed by the Romans at the end of the Third Punic War, very few Carthaginian primary historical sources survive. While there are a few ancient translations of Punic texts into Greek and Latin, as well as inscriptions on monuments and buildings discovered in Northwest Africa, the main sources are Greek and Roman historians, including Livy, Polybius, Appian, Cornelius Nepos, Silius Italicus, Plutarch, Dio Cassius, and Herodotus. These writers belonged to peoples in competition, and often in conflict, with Carthage. Greek cities contended with Carthage over Sicily, and the Romans fought three wars against Carthage. Not surprisingly, their accounts of Carthage are extremely hostile; while there are a few Greek authors who took a favourable view, these works have been lost.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nTunis was originally a Berber settlement. The existence of the town is attested by sources dating from the 4th century BC. Situated on a hill, Tunis served as an excellent point from which the comings and goings of naval and caravan traffic to and from Carthage could be observed. Tunis was one of the first towns in the region to fall under Carthaginian control, and in the centuries that followed Tunis was mentioned in the military histories associated with Carthage. Thus, during Agathocles' expedition, which landed at Cape Bon in 310 BC, Tunis changed hands on various occasions.During the Mercenary War, it is possible that Tunis served as a center for the native population of the area, and that its population was mainly composed of peasants, fishermen, and craftsmen. Compared to the ancient ruins of Carthage, the ruins of ancient Tunis are not as large. According to Strabo, it was destroyed by the Romans in 146 BC during the Third Punic War. Both Tunis and Carthage were destroyed; Tunis, however, was rebuilt first under the rule of Augustus and became an important town under Roman control and the center of a booming agricultural industry. The city is mentioned in the Tabula Peutingeriana as Thuni. In the system of Roman roads for the Roman province of Africa, Tunis had the title of mutatio (\"way station, resting place\"). Tunis, increasingly Romanized, was also eventually Christianized and became the seat of a bishop. However, Tunis remained modestly sized compared to Carthage during this time.\n\n\n=== Early Islamic period ===\n\nWhen the Arab Muslim troops conquered the region at the end of the 7th century, they established themselves at the outskirts of ancient Tunes, and the small town soon became the city of Tunis that could easily be taken for an Arab foundation. The medina of Tunis, the oldest section of the city, dates from this period, during which the region was conquered by the Umayyad emir Hasan ibn al-Nu'man al-Ghasani. The city had the natural advantage of coastal access, via the Mediterranean, to the major ports of southern Europe. Early on, Tunis played a military role; the Arabs recognized the strategic importance of its proximity to the Strait of Sicily. From the beginning of the 8th century Tunis was the chef-lieu of the area: it became the Arabs' naval base in the western Mediterranean Sea, and took on considerable military importance. Under the Aghlabids, the people of Tunis revolted numerous times, but the city benefited from economic improvements and quickly became the second most important in the kingdom. It was briefly the national capital, from the end of the reign of Ibrahim II in 902, until 909 when control over Ifriqiya was lost to the newly founded Fatimid Caliphate.\nLocal opposition to the authorities began to intensify in September 945, when Kharijite insurgents occupied Tunis, resulting in general pillaging. With the rise of the Zirid dynasty Tunis gained importance, but the Sunni population tolerated Shi'ite rule less and less, and carried out massacres against the Shi'ite community. In 1048 the Zirid ruler Al-Muizz ibn Badis rejected his city's obedience to the Fatimids and re-established Sunni rites throughout all of Ifriqiya. This decision infuriated the Shi'ite caliph Al-Mustansir Billah. To punish the Zirids, he unleashed the Banu Hilal Arab tribe on Ifriqiya; a large part of the country was set to the torch, the Zirid capital Kairouan was razed in 1057, and only a few coastal towns, including Tunis and Mahdia, escaped destruction. Exposed to violence from the hostile tribes that settled around the city, the population of Tunis repudiated the authority of the Zirids and swore allegiance to the Hammadid prince El Nacer ibn Alennas, who was based in B\u00e9ja\u00efa, in 1059. The governor appointed by B\u00e9ja\u00efa, having reestablished order in the country, did not hesitate to free himself from the Hammadids to found the Khurasanid dynasty with Tunis as its capital. This small independent kingdom picked up the threads of trade and commerce with other nations, and brought the region back to peace and prosperity.\n\n\n=== New capital of Tunisia ===\nIn 1159, the Almohad 'Abd al-Mu'min took Tunis, overthrew the last Khurasanid leader and installed a new government in the kasbah of Tunis. The Almohad conquest marked the beginning of the dominance of the city in Tunisia. Having previously played a minor role behind Kairouan and Mahdia, Tunis was promoted to the rank of provincial capital.\nIn 1228, Governor Abu Zakariya seized power and, a year later, took the title of Emir and founded the Hafsid dynasty. The city became the capital of a Hafsid kingdom stretching towards Tripoli and Fez. Walls were built to protect the emerging principal town of the kingdom, surrounding the medina, the kasbah and the new suburbs of Tunis. In 1270 the city was taken briefly by Louis IX of France, who was hoping to convert the Hafsid sovereign to Christianity. King Louis easily captured Carthage, but his army soon fell victim to an outbreak of dysentery. Louis himself died before the walls of the capital and the army was forced out.  At the same time, driven by the reconquest of Spain, the first Andalusian Muslims and Jews arrived in Tunis and would become of importance to the economic prosperity of the Hafsid capital and the development of its intellectual life.During the Almohad and Hafsid periods Tunis was one of the richest and grandest cities in the Islamic world, with a population of about 100,000.\nDuring this period, one of the famous travellers to Tunis was Ibn Battuta. In his travel account, when Ibn Battuta and his group arrived in Tunis, the population of the city came out to meet him and the other the members of his party. They all greeted them and were very curious, many were asking questions, however, no one in Tunis personally greeted Ibn Battuta, greatly upsetting him. He felt very lonely and could not hold back the tears coming from his eyes. This went on for a while until one of the pilgrims realized he was upset, he went up and greeted and talked to Ibn until he entered the city. At the time, the Sultan of Tunis was Abu Yahya and during Ibn Battuta's stay, the Festival of the Breaking of the Fast was taking place. The people in the city assembled in large numbers to celebrate the festival, in extravagant and most luxurious outfits. Abu Yahya arrived on horseback, where all of his relatives joined him. After the performance, the people returned to their homes.\n\n\n=== Spanish occupation and Ottoman control ===\n\nThe Ottoman Empire took nominal control of Tunis in 1534 when Hayreddin Barbarossa captured it from the Hafsid Sultan Mulai Hassan, who fled to the court of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. Charles, suffering losses from the corsairs operating out of Djerba, Tunis, and Algiers, agreed to reinstate Mulai Hassan in exchange for his acceptance of Spanish suzerainty. A naval expedition led by Charles himself was dispatched in 1535, and the city was recaptured. The victory against the corsairs is recorded in a tapestry at the Royal Palace of Madrid. The Spanish governor of La Goulette, Luys Peres Varga,  fortified the island of Chikly in the lake of Tunis to strengthen the city's defences between 1546 and 1550. \n\n \nThe Ottoman Ulu\u00e7 Ali Reis, at the head of an army of janissaries and Kabyles, retook Tunis in 1569. However, following the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the Spanish under John of Austria succeeded in retaking the city and re-establishing the Hafsid sovereign in October 1573. Following these conflicts, the city finally fell into Ottoman hands in August 1574. Having become an Ottoman province governed by a Pasha who was appointed by the Sultan based in Constantinople, the country attained a degree of autonomy. After 1591, the Ottoman governors (Beys) were relatively independent, and both piracy and trade continued to flourish. Under the rule of deys and Moorish beys, the capital sprang into new life. Its population grew by additions from various ethnicities, among which were Moorish refugees from Spain, and economic activities diversified. To traditional industry and trade with distant lands was added the activity of the Barbary pirates, then in their golden age. Profits obtained from the trade in Christian slaves allowed the rulers to build sumptuous structures that revived the architectural heritage of the Middle Ages.\n\nIn April 1655 the English admiral Robert Blake was sent to the Mediterranean to extract compensation from states that had been attacking English shipping. Only the Bey of Tunis refused to comply, with the result that Blake's fifteen ships attacked the Bey's arsenal at Porto Farina (Ghar el Melh), destroying nine Algerian ships and two shore batteries, the first time in naval warfare that shore batteries had been eliminated without landing men ashore.\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Tunisia entered into a new period in its history with the advent of the Husainid dynasty. Successive Husainid rulers made great progress in developing the city and its buildings. During this period, the city prospered as a centre of commerce. Taking advantage of divisions within the ruling house, Algerians captured Tunis in 1756 and put the country under supervision. Hammouda Bey faced bombardment by the Venetian fleet, and the city experienced a rebellion in 1811. Under the reign of Hussein Bey II, naval defeats by the British (1826) and French (1827) saw the French become increasingly active in the city and in the economy.Various sources estimate the 19th-century population to have ranged from 90,000 to 110,000 inhabitants. During the later 19th century, Tunis became increasingly populated by Europeans, particularly the French, and immigration dramatically increased the size of the city. This resulted in the first demolition of the old city walls, from 1860, to accommodate growth in the suburbs. The city spilled outside the area of the earlier town and the banks of the lake, and the new districts were modernised with running water (1860), lighting gas (1872), roads, waste collection (1873), and communication with adjacent suburbs and the city centre. The crafts and traditional trades declined somewhat, as the newcomers increased trade with Europe, introducing the first modern industries and new forms of urban life.\n\n\n=== Development under the French protectorate ===\n\nThe creation of the French protectorate in 1881 was a turning point in Tunis's history, leading to rapid redevelopment of the city in the span of two to three decades. The city quickly spread out of its fortifications: it divided into a traditional Arab-populated old city, and a new city populated by immigrants, with a different structure from that of the traditional medina. Tunis also benefited from French construction of a water supply, natural gas and electricity networks, public transport services and other public infrastructure.\nUnder French rule, a substantial number of Europeans settled (like the Tunisian Italians); half of the population was European in origin. The city expanded and created new boulevards and neighborhoods.\nTunis was quiet during the First World War. After the war, the city faced new transformations as the modern portion grew in importance and extended its network of boulevards and streets in all directions. In addition, a series of satellite cities emerged on the urban rim and encroached on the municipality of Tunis proper. In the economic sphere, commercial activities expanded and diversified as modern industries continued to grow, while traditional industry continued to decline.\nDuring World War II, Tunis was held by Axis forces from November 1942 to May 1943. It was their last base in Africa, as they retreated towards Sicily after being surrounded by Allied forces from Algeria to the west and from Libya to the east. \nOn 7 May 1943, at about 15:30 in the afternoon, Tunis fell to troops of British 1st Army and the U.S. 1st Army, which had defeated the German 5th Panzer Army guarding the city. At midday on 20 May 1943, the Allies held a victory parade on Avenue Mar\u00e9chal Galli\u00e9ni, and Avenue Jules Ferry, to signal the end of fighting in North Africa.Having succeeded in driving the Axis powers out of Tunisia, the Allies used Tunis as a base of operations from which to stage amphibious assaults first against the island of Pantelleria, and then Sicily, and finally the mainland of Italy.\n\n\n=== Growth since independence ===\n\nAfter independence in 1956, Tunis consolidated its role as the capital, first with the establishment of a constitution stating that the Chamber of Deputies and the Presidency of the Republic must have their headquarters in Tunis and its suburbs. In a very short time, the colonial city transformed rapidly. As the city has grown and native Tunisians gradually began to replace the extensive European population, conflict between the Arab city and the European city has gradually decreased with the arabization of the population.\nBecause of population pressure and the rate of migration to the capital, the city continued to grow, even with the creation of new districts in the suburbs. Old buildings have gradually been renovated and upgraded and new buildings have come to influence the urban landscape. At the same time, an active policy of industrialization is developing the municipal economy.\nThe Arab League was headquartered in Tunis from 1979 to 1990. The Arab League, which represents 22 Arab nations, transferred its headquarters to Tunis in 1979 because of Egypt's peace with Israel but has been headquartered back in Egypt since 1990.\nThe Palestine Liberation Organization also had its headquarters in Tunis, from 1982 to 2003.\nIn 1985, the PLO's headquarters was bombed by Israeli Air Force F-15s, killing approximately 60 people.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nMany protests took place during the Arab Spring of 2011\u201312.\nOn 18 March 2015, two gunmen attacked the Bardo National Museum and held hostages. Twenty civilians and one policeman were killed in the attack, while around 50 others were injured. Five Japanese, two Colombians, and visitors from Italy, Poland, and Spain were among the dead. Both gunmen were killed by Tunisian police. The incident has been treated as a terrorist attack.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTunis is located in north-eastern Tunisia on the Lake of Tunis, and is connected to the Mediterranean sea's Gulf of Tunis by a canal which terminates at the port of La Goulette/Halq al Wadi. The ancient city of Carthage is located just north of Tunis along the coastal part. The city lies on a similar latitude as the southernmost points of Europe.\nThe city of Tunis is built on a hill slope down to the lake of Tunis. These hills contain places such as Notre-Dame de Tunis, Ras Tabia, La Rabta, La Kasbah, Montfleury and La Manoubia with altitudes just above 50 metres (160 feet). The city is located at the crossroads of a narrow strip of land between Lake Tunis and S\u00e9joumi. The isthmus between them is what geologists call the \"Tunis dome\", which includes hills of limestone and sediments. It forms a natural bridge and since ancient times several major roads linking to Egypt and elsewhere in Tunisia have branched out from it. The roads also connect with Carthage, emphasising its political and economic importance not only in Tunisia but more widely in North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea in ancient times.\nThe Greater Tunis area has an area of 300,000 hectares, 30,000 of which is urbanized, the rest being shared between bodies of water (20,000 hectares of lakes or lagoons) and agricultural or natural land (250,000 hectares). However, urban growth, which is estimated to be increasing by 500 hectares per year, is gradually changing the landscape with urban sprawl.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Suburbs ===\nAfter World War II, suburbs began to rapidly spring up on the outskirts of Tunis. These form a large percentage of the population of the Tunis metropolitan area. It grew from 27% of the total population in 1956, to 37% in 1975 and 50% in 2006.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTunis has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa), characterized by hot and dry, prolonged summers and mild winters with moderate rainfall. The local climate is also affected somewhat by the latitude of the city, the moderating influence of the Mediterranean sea and the terrain of the hills.\nWinter is the wettest season of the year, when more than a third of the annual rainfall falls during this period, raining on average every two or three days.  The sun may still increase the temperature from 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F) in the morning to 16 \u00b0C (61 \u00b0F) in the afternoon on average during the winter. Frosts are rare.  In spring, rainfall declines by half.  The sunshine becomes dominant in May when it reaches 10 hours a day on average.  In March temperatures may vary between 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F) and 18 \u00b0C (64 \u00b0F), and between 13 \u00b0C (55 \u00b0F) and 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) in May. However, it is common for temperatures to soar even as early as April with record temperatures reaching 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F).  In summer, rain is almost completely absent and the sunlight is at a maximum.  The average temperatures in the summer months of June, July, August, and September are very high. Sea breezes may mitigate the heat, but sometimes the sirocco winds reverse the trend.  In autumn, it begins to rain, often with short thunderstorms, which can sometimes cause flash floods or even flood some parts of the city.  The month of November marks a break in the general heat with average temperatures ranging from 11 \u00b0C (52 \u00b0F) to 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Capital ===\n\nTunis has been the capital of Tunisia since 1159. Under Articles 43 and 24 of the Constitution of 1959, Tunis and its suburbs host the national institutions: the Presidential Palace, which is known as Carthage Palace, residence of the President of Tunisia, the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Advisors and parliament, the Constitutional Council and the main judicial institutions  and public bodies. The revised Tunisian Constitution of 2014 similarly provides that the National Assembly is to sit in Tunis (article 51) and that the Presidency is based there (article 73).\n\n\n=== Municipality ===\n\n\n==== Institutions ====\n\nFollowing the municipal elections of 6 May 2018, Ennahdha obtained 21 seats out of 60. Nidaa Tounes came second with 17 seats. On 3 July 2018, the head of the Ennahdha list Souad Abderrahim was elected by the council as the new mayor of the capital.\nBefore 2011, unlike other mayors in Tunisia, the mayor of Tunis is appointed by decree of the President of the Republic from among the members of the City Council.\n\n\n==== Budget ====\nThe 2008 budget adopted by the City Council is structured as follows: 61.61 million dinars for operations and 32,516 million dinars for investment. It reflects the improved financial situation of the municipality, the year 2007 was a year registering a surplus in resources that allowed the settlement of debts of the municipality and the strengthening of its credibility with respect its suppliers and public and private partners.\nRevenues are generated by the proceeds of taxes on buildings and vacant lots, fees for the rental of municipal property, income from the operation of the public, advertising, and that the fact that the municipality has capital shares in some companies. On the expenditure side, provision is made for the consolidation of hygiene and cleanliness, the state of the environment and urban design, infrastructure maintenance, rehabilitation and renovation of facilities, and strengthening the logistics and means of work and transport.\n\n\n==== Administrative divisions ====\n\nThe city of Tunis, whose size has increased significantly during the second half of the 20th century, now extends beyond the Tunis Governorate into parts of the governorates of Ben Arous, Ariana and Manouba.\nThe municipality of Tunis is divided into 15 municipal districts:  These include El Bab Bhar, Bab Souika, Cit\u00e9 El Khadra, Jelloud Jebel El Kabaria, El Menzah, El Ouardia, Ettahrir, Ezzouhour, Hra\u00efria, Medina, El Omrane, El Omrane Higher S\u00e9joumi, Sidi El-Bashir and Sidi Hassine.\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nIn the years following independence, the population of the metropolitan area continued to grow: by 21.1% from 1956 to 1966 and by 28.5% from 1966 to 1975 (55.6% between 1956 and 1975). This steady growth was accompanied by changes which affected the nature of the settlement of the capital. Decolonization led to the exodus of some European minorities whose numbers dwindled every year. The gaps created by their departure were filled by Tunisians who emigrated to Tunis from other parts of the country.\nThe population of the city of Tunis exceeds 2,000,000 inhabitants. After independence, the Tunisian government implemented a plan to cope with population growth of the city and country, a system of family planning, to attempt to lower the rate of population growth. However, between 1994 and 2004, the population of the governorate of Tunis grew more than 1.03% per annum. It represents, in the 2004 census, 9.9% of the total population of Tunisia. As in the rest of Tunisia, literacy in the region of Tunis evolved rapidly during the second half of the 20th century and has reached a level slightly higher than the national average. The education level is only exceeded by the neighbouring governorate of Ariana which has many institutions of education.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nProducts include textiles, carpets, and olive oil. Tourism also provides a significant portion of the city's income.\nBecause of the concentration of political authority (headquarters of the central government, presidency, parliament, ministries and central government) and culture (festivals and mainstream media), Tunis is the only nationally ranking metropolis. Tunis is the heartland of the Tunisian economy and is the industrial and economic hub of the country, home to one third of Tunisian companies\u2014including almost all the head offices of companies with more than fifty employees, with the exception of the Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa, headquartered in Gafsa\u2014and produces a third of the national gross domestic product.  Tunis attracts foreign investors (33% of companies, 26% of investments and 27% of employment), excluding several areas due to economic imbalances. According to the Mercer 2017 Cost of Living Rankings, Tunis has the lowest cost of living for expatriates in the world. The urban unemployment rate of university graduates is increasing and the illiteracy rate remains high among the elderly (27% of women and 12% of men). The number of people living below the poverty line, falling at the national level, remains higher in urban areas. In addition, unemployment is high in young people aged 18 to 24, with one in three unemployed as compared to one in six at the national level. In Greater Tunis, the proportion of young unemployed is at 35%.Gulf finance house or GFH has invested $10 billion in order for the construction of tunis financial harbor, that will transform Tunisia as the gateway to Africa from Europe. The project hopes to boost the economy of Tunisia as well as increase the number of tourists visiting Tunisia annually. The project is going through planning.\n\n\n=== Sectors ===\nThe economic structure of Tunis, as well as that of the country, is overwhelmingly tertiary industry.  The city is the largest financial center in the country hosting the headquarters of 65% of financial companies \u2013 while the industrial sectors are gradually declining in importance.  However the secondary industry is still very represented and Tunis hosts 85% of industrial establishments in the four governorates, with a trend towards the spread of specialized industrial zones in the suburbs.\nPrimary industry such as agriculture, however, is active in specialized agricultural areas on the suburbs, particularly in the wine and olive oil industries. The generally flat terrain and the two main rivers in Tunisia, the Medjerda to the north and the Milian to the south, the soils are fertile.  Tunis has several large plains, the most productive are in Ariana and La Soukra (north), the plain of Manouba (west) and the plain of Mornag (south).  In addition, groundwater is easily accessible through the drilling of deep wells, providing water for the different agriculture crops. The soils are heavy and contain limestone in the north but are lighter and sandy containing clay in the south.  There is much diversification in the municipality of Tunis, with Durum grown in Manouba, Olives and olive oil in Ariana and Mornag, wine (Mornag), and fruit, vegetable and legumes are grown in all regions.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Architecture and landscape ==\n\n\n=== Urban landscape ===\n\nThe Medina, built on a gentle hill slope on the way down to the Lake of Tunis, is the historical heart of the city and home to many monuments, including palaces, such as the Dar Ben Abdallah and Dar Hussein, the mausoleum of Tourbet el Bey or many mosques such as the Al-Zaytuna Mosque. Some of the fortifications around it have now largely disappeared, and it is flanked by the two suburbs of Bab Souika to the north and Bab El Jazira to the south. Located near the Bab Souika, the neighborhood of Halfaouine which gained international attention through the film 'Halfaouine Child of the Terraces'.\nBut east of the original nucleus, first with the construction of the French Consulate, the modern city was built gradually with the introduction of the French protectorate at the end of the 19th century, on open land between the city and the lake. The axis to the structure of this part of the city is the Avenue Habib Bourguiba, designed by the French to be a Tunisian form of Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris with its cafes, major hotels, shops and cultural venues. On both sides of the tree lines avenue, north and south, the city was extended in various districts, with the northern end welcoming residential and business districts while the south receives industrial districts and poorer peoples.\nSouth-east of the Avenue Bourguiba the district of La Petite Sicile (Little Sicily) is adjacent to the old port area and takes its name from its original population of workers from Italy. It is now the subject of a redevelopment project including the construction of twin towers. North of the Avenue Bourguiba is the district of La Fayette, which is still home to the Great Synagogue of Tunis and the Habib Thameur Gardens, built on the site of an ancient Jewish cemetery which lay outside the walls. Also to the north is the long Avenue Mohamed V, which leads to the Boulevard of 7 November through the neighborhood of the big banks where there are hotels and Abu Nawas Lake and finally to the Belvedere area around the place Pasteur. This is where the Belvedere Park lies, the largest in the city, and home to a zoo and the Pasteur Institute founded by Adrien Loir in 1893. Continuing to the north are the most exclusive neighborhoods of Mutuelleville which house the French Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-Mend\u00e8s-France, the Sheraton Hotel and some embassies.\nStill further north of the Belvedere Park, behind the Boulevard of 7 November are the neighborhoods of El Menzah and El Manar now reaching the peaks of the hills overlooking the north of the town. They support a range of residential and commercial buildings. To the west of the park lies the district of El Omrane which holds the main Muslim cemetery in the capital and the warehouses of public transport.  Heading east is the Tunis-Carthage International Airport and the neighborhoods of Borgel, giving his name to the existing Jewish and Christian cemeteries in the capital, and the neighbourhood of Montplaisir. Beyond that, several kilometers north-east, on the road to La Marsa,  the Berges du Lac was built on land reclaimed from the north shore of the lake near the airport, which has holds offices of Tunisian and foreign companies, many embassies as well as shops.\nSouthwest of the Medina, on the crest of the hills across the Isthmus of Tunis, is the Montfleury district then on down to the foothills of S\u00e9joumi, the poor neighborhood of Mellassine. Northwest of the latter, north of the National Route 3 leading to the west, is the city of Ezzouhour (formerly El Kharrouba), which spans more than three metres (9.8 feet) and is divided into five sections. It is still surrounded with farmland and vegetables are grown which supply many of the souks in the region.\nThe south of Tunis is made up of disadvantaged neighborhoods, especially due to the strong industry in this part of the metropolis. These include Jebel Jelloud, located in the south-east of Tunis, which concentrates on the heavy industry of cement production, the treatment plant of phosphate s, etc. The main cemetery in Tunis, the Djellaz Cemetery, dominates this part of town, perched on the slopes of a rocky outcrop.\n\n\n=== M\u00e9dina ===\n\nThe medina of Tunis has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979. The Medina contains some 700 monuments, including palaces, mosques, mausoleums, madrasas and fountains dating from the Almohad and the Hafsid periods. These ancient buildings include:\n\nThe Aghlabid Al-Zaytouna Mosque (\"Mosque of the Olive\") built in 723 by Ubayd Allah ibn al-Habhab to celebrate the new capital.\nThe Dar El Bey, or Bey's Palace, comprises architecture and decoration from many different styles and periods and is believed to stand on the remains of a Roman theatre as well as the 10th-century palace of Ziadib-Allah II al Aghlab.With an area of 270 hectares (over 29 hectares for the Kasbah)  and more than 100,000 people, the Medina comprises one-tenth of the population of Tunis. The planning of the Medina of Tunis has the distinction of not grid lines or formal geometric compositions. However, studies were undertaken in the 1930s with the arrival of the first anthropologists who found that the space of the Medina is not random: the houses are based on a socio-cultural code according to the types of complex human relations.\nDomestic architecture (palaces and townhouses), official and civilian (libraries and administrations), religious (mosques and zaou\u00efas) and services (commercial and fondouks) are located in the Medina. The notion of public space is ambiguous in the case of Medina where the streets are seen as an extension of the houses and subject to social tags. The concept of ownership is low however and souks often spill out onto public roads. Today, each district has its culture and rivalries can be strong.\nThe northern end supports the football club of Esperance Sportive de Tunis while at the other end is the rival Club Africain. The Medina also has a social sectorization: with the neighborhood of Tourbet el Bey and the Kasbah district being aristocratic, with a population of judges and politicians, while the streets of Pacha often being military and bourgeois.\nFounded in 698 is the Al-Zaytuna Mosque and the surrounding area which developed throughout the Middle Ages,  dividing Tunis into a main town in two suburbs, in the north (Bab Souika) and the south (Bab El Jazira). The area became the capital of a powerful kingdom during the Hafsid era, and was considered a religious and intellectual home and economic center for the Middle East, Africa and Europe. A great fusion of influences can be seen blending Andalusian styles with eastern influences, and Roman or Byzantine columns, and typical Arab architecture, characterized by the archways.\nThe architectural heritage is also omnipresent in the homes of individuals and small palace officials as well as in the palace of the sovereign of Kasbah. Although some palaces and houses date back to the Middle Ages, a greater number of prestigious houses were built in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries such as Dar Othman (early 17th century), Dar Ben Abdallah (18th century), Dar Hussein, Dar Cherif and other houses. The main palace beys are those of La Marsa, Bardo and Ksar Said. If we add the mosques and oratories (about 200), the madrasahs (El Bachia, Slimania, El Achouria, Bir El Ahjar, Ennakhla, etc..), The zaouias (Mahrez Sidi Sidi Ali Azouz, Sidi Abdel Kader, etc.) and Tourbet El Fellari, Tourbet Aziza Othman and Tourbet El Bey the number of monuments in Tunis approaches 600. Unlike Algiers, Palermo and Naples, its historical heart has never suffered from major natural disasters or urban radical interventions. The main conflicts and potentially destructive human behavior has been experienced in the city occurred relatively recently following the country's independence which it why it made into a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. At the beginning of the 21st century, the Medina is one of the best preserved urban locations in the Arab world.Furthermore, along the boulevards, the contribution of the architectural period 1850\u20131950 can be felt in the buildings, such as the government buildings of the nine ministries and the headquarters of the municipality of Tunis.\n\n\n=== Other landmarks ===\nThe Bardo Museum was originally a 13th-century Hafsid palace, located in the (then) suburbs of Tunis. It contains a major collection of Roman empires and other antiquities of interest from Ancient Greece, Tunisia, and from the Arab period.\nThe ruins of Carthage are nearby, along the coast to the northeast, with many ancient ruins.\n\n\n==== Souks ====\n\nThe souks are a network of covered streets lined with shops and traders and artisans ordered by specialty.  Clothing merchants, perfumers, fruit sellers, booksellers and wool merchants have goods at the souks, while fishmongers, blacksmiths and potters tend to be relegated to the periphery of the markets.\n\nNorth of the Al-Zaytuna Mosque is the Souk El Attarine, built in the early 18th century. It is known for its essences and perfumes. From this souk, there is a street leading to the Souk Ech-Chaouachine (chachia). The main company that operates it is one of the oldest in the country and they are generally descendants of Andalusian immigrants expelled from Spain. Attached to El Attarine are two other souks: the first, which runs along the western coast of the Al-Zaytuna Mosque, is the Souk El Kmach which is noted for its fabrics, and the second, the Souk El Berka, which was built in the 17th century and houses embroiderers and jewelers. Given the valuable items it sells, it is the only souk whose doors are closed and guarded during the night. In the middle there is a square where the former slave market stood until the middle of the 19th century.\nSouk El Berka leads to Souk El Leffa, a souk that sells all kinds of carpets, blankets and other weavings, and extends with the Souk Es Sarragine, built in the early 18th century and specializing in leather. At the periphery are the souks Et Trouk, El Blat, El Blaghgia, El K\u00e9babgia, En Nhas (copper), Es Sabbaghine (dyeing) and El Grana that sell clothing and blankets and was occupied by Jewish merchants.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Walls and gates ====\n\nFrom the early days of its founding, Tunis has been considered an important military base. The Arab geographer El Yacoubi has written that in the 9th century Tunis was surrounded by a wall of brick and clay except the side of the sea where it was stone.  Bab El-Jazeera, perhaps the oldest gate of the south wall, opened onto the southern road. Bab Cartagena gave access to Carthage, important for bringing in construction materials needed for the city. Bab Souika (initially known as Bab El Saqqayin) had a strategic role to keep the roads to Bizerte, B\u00e9ja and Le Kef. Bab Menara (initially known as Bab El Artha) opened onto the medina and on the suburb of El Haoua. As for El Bab Bhar, it allowed access to some funduqs where Christian merchants lived in Tunis.\nWith the development of the capital under the reign of the Hafsids, two emerging suburbs grew outside the walls; Bab El Jazira in the south and Bab Souika to the north. In the early 14th century, Hafsid Darba Ab\u00fb al-Muhammad al-Mustansir Lihy\u00e2n\u00ee ordered the construction of a second chamber including the Medina and two suburbs outside. Six new gates were built including Bab El Khadra, Bab Saadoun, Bab El Allouj (initially called Bab Er-Rehiba), Khalid or Bab Bab Sidi Abdallah Cherif, Bab El Fellah and Bab Alioua. In the Ottoman period, four new gates were established: Bab Laassal, Bab Sidi Abdesselam, Bab El Bab Gorjani and Sidi Kacem. The city retains some of these gates including Bab El Khadra, Bab El Bhar and Bab Jedid but some of the earlier ones have long disappeared.\n\n\n=== Places of worship ===\n\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslim mosques.   There are also Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tunis (Catholic Church), Protestant churches, Evangelical Churches.As in the rest of Tunisia, a very large majority of the population of Tunis (around 99%) is Sunni Muslim.  The capital is home to a large number of mosques in various architectural styles, signs of construction of their respective eras.  The main and oldest of them, is the Al-Zaytuna Mosque, founded in 698 and built in 732 and is in the heart of the Medina. Practicing the Maliki rite as the vast majority of Tunisia's Mosques. It was completely rebuilt in 864 and is a prestigious place of worship, and was long an important place of culture and knowledge with the University of Ez-Zitouna on the premises until the independence of Tunisia.  It still hosts the main ceremonies marking the dates on the Muslim calendar and is regularly attended by the president.\nThe medina contains most of the major mosques in the capital which were built before the advent of the French protectorate.  The mosque in the Kasbah, was founded in 1230.  Practicing the Hanafi rite since 1584, it is recognisable mainly by the dome as well as its minaret, similar to the Koutoubia in Marrakesh and is the highest in the city. Ksar Mosque, also of the Hanafi rite, is located in front of Dar Hussein (Bab Menara) and was built in the 12th century.  The Hammouda Pasha Mosque, built in 1655, is the second mosque built by the Hanafi rite in Tunis. Youssef Dey Mosque operated primarily as public speaking venue before becoming a real mosque in 1631. The Sidi Mahrez Mosque is the largest mosque Hanafi mosque in terms of area but not the tallest.  Built in 1692, it resembles the Ottoman S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul.  The Saheb Ettaba\u00e2 Mosque, built between 1808 and 1814 was the last mosque built by the Tunis Husseinites before the French occupation.The presence of modern churches in Tunis are also testimony to the French presence for half a century.  Tunis is the seat of the Diocese of Tunis, with the seat located at the Cathedral of St Vincent de Paul, The church was built in 1897 on the site of the old Christian cemetery of Saint-Antoine.  This includes a network of Catholic buildings, including the Church of St. Joan of Arc, but also with the Protestant Reformed Church and the Anglican church Saint-Georges.Greeks used to enjoy an important presence in the city since ancient times. Tunis is the headquarters of the Greek Orthodox Holy Archdiocese of Carthage with jurisdiction over Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia. It belongs to the Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa, and its cathedral, small school and other buildings are in Central Tunis.\nIn total, there are three Greek Orthodox and two Russian Orthodox parishes in Tunisia. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria also maintains jurisdiction in Tunisia.\nThe small Orthodox community is centred around the Greek Orthodox Church (1862), managed by the Greek Embassy and the Russian Orthodox Church (1957), reflecting the presence in Tunisia of a small colony of Russian immigrants.Judaism, meanwhile, enjoys a long tradition of presence in the city despite the emigration of a large part of the community after independence.  Among the places of worship are Beit Yaacouv Synagogue and especially the Great Synagogue of Tunis, built at the end of the 1940s to replace the former Great Synagogue which was demolished as part of the Jewish redevelopment area, the Hara.\n\n\n=== Parks and greenery ===\n\nTunis has some large parks, many of which were installed at the end of the 19th century by the authorities of the French protectorate. The largest Park, Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re Park, was founded in 1892 overlooks Lake Tunis. It is the oldest public park in the country and is built in the landscape style common to France.  The park covers an area of more than one hundred hectares across roads that can be explored on foot or by car. It is also home to Tunis Zoo, which houses African fauna, and the Museum of Modern Art.\nHabib Thameur garden in Tunis has a central pond and flower beds. The Gorjani garden, is an English garden located southwest of the city, which notably takes an irregular form, partly due to the steep topography of the land.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nLocated in an old beylical palace (the palace of the Bey of Tunis since the end of the 18th century), the Bardo National Museum (Tunis) is the most important archaeological museum in the Maghreb, and has one of the richest Roman mosaic collections in the world.  Its collections developed rapidly, thanks to numerous archaeological discoveries in the surrounding territory.\nIn 1964 the Dar Ben Abdallah, a palace probably dating back to the 18th century, became the seat of the capital's Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions.  In its exposition halls it holds numerous traditional items, witnesses of the everyday lives of families of the Medina quarter.\nThe Museum of the National Movement is situated in Dar Ma\u00e2kal Az-Za\u00efm, which was the residence of nationalist Habib Bourguiba for the entirety of the fight for independence.  After the advent of independence, a museum was built there to relate the details of the national struggle between 1938 and 1952.\nThe National Military Museum, opened in 1989 in the suburbs west of the city, holds a collection of 23,000 weapons, 13,000 of which date back to the 19th century, and some of which were used by the Tunisian troops during the Crimean War.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nTunis holds some of the most prestigious musical institutions in the country. The Rachidia was founded in 1934 to safeguard Arab music, and in particular to promote Tunisian and malouf music.  The group is made up of 22 members, both instrumental players and choral musicians.The Musical Troupe of the City of Tunis was created in 1954 by Salah El Mahdi. In 1955 he placed his student Mohamed Sa\u00e2da in charge of the ensemble, which at that time included the best artists, and later merged with the ensemble of Radio Tunis.  This group contributed to the rise to stardom of numerous Tunisian singers, including Oulaya.\nThe Association of Arab Orchestra of the City of Tunis began its activities at the end of April 1982, as a workshop linked to the cultural center of the city.  It worked on promoting Arab music, on music education and training, and on cooperation with various partners both in Tunisia and abroad.  The Tunisian Symphony Orchestra, created in 1969 by the Minister of Culture, has also produced monthly concerts at the Municipal Theater and in various cultural spaces in the city.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nTunis is a center of Tunisian culture. The Th\u00e9\u00e2tre municipal de Tunis, opened on 20 November 1902, showcases opera, ballet, symphonic concerts, drama, etc. On the stage of this theater, many performances are regularly given by Tunisian, Arabic and international actors. The National Theatre of Tunisia is an important public enterprise in Tunis, and since 1988 been located in the Khaznadar palace (dating from the middle of the 19th century and situated in the Halfaouine quarter), renamed \"Theater Palace.\" In 1993, it also took possession of the former movie theater Le Paris, with a 350-person seating capacity.  During each \"cultural season\" (from October 1 to 30 June) the theater holds over 80 events.  The Al Hamra theater was the second theater to be opened in Tunis, situated on El Jazira Road.  Al Hamra was one of the most famous theaters in the capital during the 1930s and 1940s.  After being closed for fifteen years, it was turned into a small theater in 1986, and since 2001 has housed the first Arab-African center for theater training and research.  One should also note the El Teatro and \u00c9toile du Nord theater groups.\nOther arts are also represented in the capital. The National Center of the Arts established the puppet theatre in 1976.  The National School of Circus Arts was founded following a meeting between the Director of the National Theater and the Director General of the National Center for Arts of Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne (France) in 1998. In addition, various small theatres and cultural centres are scattered throughout the city and display various artistic performances.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nFilm producers and cinema have long been present in the city of Tunis. The first animated film was shown in Tunis by the Lumiere brothers as early as 1896. The first screenings were held the following year and the first cinema, the Omnia Path\u00e9, opened in October 1908. The first film club opened in Tunis in 1946 and the Globe, in 1965. The Carthage Film Festival is the oldest established film festival in Africa, running biennially until 2014 and annually thereafter.\nIn 1990, Ferid Boughedir shot the notable film Halfaouine Child of the Terraces in Halfaouine district. The films The English Patient (1996) and The Last Days of Pompeii (2003) were also shot in studios in Tunis.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nThe city holds several festivals each year, of which the largest is the International Festival of Carthage which takes place in July and August. Founded in 1964, much of the festival is held in an old amphitheater of Carthage (with a capacity of 7,500 seats), and hosts the performances of singers, musicians, actors, dancers and films on display on outdoor screens.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nTunis and its suburbs have many of the major Tunisian universities including the University of Tunis, Tunisia Private University, University of Ez-Zitouna, the University of Tunis \u2013 El Manar, the University of Carthage and the Manouba University. It therefore has the highest concentration of students in Tunisia, with a student population of 75,597 as of 2006.\n\nThere are also a number of other post-secondary institutions, such as the National School of Engineers of Tunis, the National School of Science, the Graduate School of Communications of Tunis, and the Higher Institute of Technological Studies in Communications of Tunis. In addition, private training institutes include the Open University of Tunis, the Central University Private Business Administration and Technology, the Graduate School of Private Engineering and Technology, and the North African Institute of Economics and Technology.\nAmong the high schools in the capital, the best-known are the Lyc\u00e9e de la Rue du Pacha (founded 1900), Lyc\u00e9e Bab El Khadhra, Lyc\u00e9e de la Rue de Russie, Lyc\u00e9e Bourguiba (formerly Lyc\u00e9e Carnot de Tunis), and the Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui. Until independence, Sadiki College (founded 1875) and Khaldounia (founded 1896) were also among the most recognized. A legacy of the French presence in the country remains, and the city retains many French schools, the most important being the Lyc\u00e9e Pierre Mendes-France at Mutuelleville.\nStudents can pursue language studies at small private schools such as Sidi Bou Said Centre for Languages (Centre Sidi Bou Said de Langues et d'Informatique) in the picturesque Tunis suburb of Sidi Bou Said, next to the Sidi Bou Said TGM station that specializes in Arabic, offering classes in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), classical Arabic, Tunisian Arabic and the various dialects of North Africa, the Gulf and the Levant.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nTunis has some of the most important libraries in Tunisia including the National Library of Tunisia which was first installed in 1924 in the Medina, in a building built in 1810 by Hammouda Bey to serve as barracks for troops and then a jail.  The library moved to its current location on Boulevard 9 April in 1938. The new building contains a reading room, conference room, laboratories, an exhibition gallery, a block of technical and administrative services, a restaurant, a parking and green space areas.\nHoused in a former home of a Hafsid scholar, the library of the Khaldounia was founded in 1896 along with the creation of the educational institution. After independence and following the consolidation of programs of education, the association ceased operations but the library is now linked to the National Library, which provides for its management.Built in the 17th century, the Dar Ben Achour also contains a library. Acquired in the late 1970s by the municipality of Tunis, the house was restored in 1983 into a library.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nTunis is served by the Tunis-Carthage International Airport. The growing metropolitan area is served by an extensive network of public transportation including buses, an above-ground light rail system (le Metro), as well a regional train line (the TGM) that links the city centre to its closest northern suburbs. Multi-lane autoroutes surround the city and serve the increasing number of privately owned cars one encounters in Tunisia.\nThe Tunis area is served by the m\u00e9tro l\u00e9ger (Ar.: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0631\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0641\u064a\u0641 \u0644\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0633) and TGM (Tunis-Goulette-Marsa), as well as bus services, and is linked to other places in Tunisia by SNCFT, the national railways. The important transport authorities are the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Transports de Tunis (STT) and the Ministry of Transport (Airports)\n\nThe A1 motorway connects Tunis with Sfax to the south, and the A3 with Oued Zarga and B\u00e9ja to the west, while the A4 is the link with Bizerte.\nThe city has, as of the beginning of the 21st century, a public transportation system developed under the management of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des transports de Tunis (STT). In addition to some 200 bus routes, the first light rail line opened in 1985. The M\u00e9tro l\u00e9ger de Tunis network has extended gradually since then to reach the suburbs. The capital is also linked to its northern suburbs by the railway line that crosses the lake, dividing the lake into two.\nA new mass transit was planned for Greater Tunis in 2009. This was the RTS (rapid rail network), the local equivalent of the Paris RER, which was to carry tens of thousands of travellers from the distant suburbs of Tunis to the centre by using either existing tracks or new tracks yet to be built. The plan was for lines based on certain criteria such as population density and the lack of coverage for a given area. Among the priority lines were: Tunis-Borj C\u00e9dria (23 km) where modernization and electrification are already planned; Tunis-Mohamedia-Fouchana (19.4 km); Tunis-Manouba-Mnihla (19.2 km); Tunis-Ezzouhour-Sidi Hassine S\u00e9joumi (13.9 km). In addition, the TGM will be integrated into the light-rail network and a new line built around Ayn Zaghouan and Bhar Lazrag (8.4 km). Such an operation would require the upgrading of the docks' TGM stations so that they become suitable for light rail trains. Among other projects are a line to the city of Ennasr (8.4 km) and the extension of the Tunis-Ettadhamen to Mnihla (1.7 km). For its part, the south light-rail line was extended in November 2008 to El Mourouj with a length of 6.8 kilometres (4.2 miles). The total length of the network will eventually be in the range of 84 km (52 mi).\n\n\n=== Infrastructure ===\n\nTunis is served by Tunis-Carthage International Airport, located 8 kilometers (5.0 mi) northeast of downtown, which began operating in 1940 under the name of Tunis El Aouina.  The terminal had 4.4 million passengers (35.98% of total airport traffic in the country) in 2006.  In 2007 that increased to 6 million passengers with a rise in tourism to the city.\nAfter independence, in the 1960s, the National Board of Seaports, which supports all ports in the country, modernized the infrastructure of the port of Tunis.  In the 21st Century, the port of Tunis underwent further transformation with a marina as part of the redevelopment district of La Petite Sicile.\nTunis is the starting point from which the main roads and all highways that serve different parts of the country of Tunis originate.  This city has a high density of traffic because vehicle ownership is rising at 7.5% per year.  The capital is home to approximately 40% of the cars in Tunisia, with 700,000 cars on average used in the city per day.  In this context, major road infrastructure (bridges, interchanges, roads, etc..) was initiated in the late 1990s to decongest the main areas of the capital.  The main roads to other Tunisian cities include: Autoroute A1, Tunis-Sfax; Autoroute A3, Tunis-Oued Zarga; and Autoroute A4, Tunis-Bizerte. Also, as part of the major infrastructure project, the city's traffic lights were increased from 5,000 to 7,500.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, a number of sports institutions were established in Tunis, particularly in school and college settings. In 1905 the Muslim Association of Tunisia brought together students from Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui and Sadiki College to organize gymnastics. A regional gymnastics competition was held in Tunis in 1912 with the participation of thousands of French gymnasts. Football made its appearance in the capital on 15 September 1904, followed by the formal creation of the country's first league, the Racing Club Tunis, on 11 May 1905. It took some time to run properly but soon organized meetings between the teams in schools. The first took place on 9 June 1907, between teams from Lyc\u00e9e Alaoui and Lyc\u00e9e Carnot (1\u20131).\nBut football is not the only discipline to emerge. Between 1928 and 1955 the city hosted nine rounds of the Grand Prix of Tunis, where notable drivers such as Marcel Lehoux, Achille Varzi, Tazio Nuvolari and Rudolf Caracciola took part. The Grand Prix of Tunis has re-emerged since 2000. The city has also held the Mediterranean Games twice, in 1967 and 2001, and the international tennis tournament, the Tunis Open, which is included in the ATP Challenger Series. The 2005 World Championship final for men in team handball was played in Tunis.\nIn total the governorate of Tunis registered 24,095 licences for various clubs in the municipal area in 2007. The city further put itself onto the international basketball map as it hosted the FIBA Africa Championship 1965 and the FIBA Africa Championship 1987.\n\nThe Esperance Sportive de Tunis (EST), Club Africain (CA), and Stade Tunisien are the major sports clubs in the city. A symbolic class difference is present between the EST's and the CA's supporters, despite their playing at the same stadium. The EST is supported by the majority of the masses, while the CA, a poorer club, is supported by the others.\nThe first true sports facilities were managed under the French protectorate, as illustrated by the development of the Ksar Said racecourse and construction of the Stade Chedli Zouiten in the neighborhood of Belvedere, which had long been the main stadium in the capital before being supplanted by the Olympic stadium, Stade El Menzah, where EST and CA play their football today. The Olympic stadium and village area was built to accommodate the Mediterranean Games in 1967. A 60,000-seat stadium was also built in Rad\u00e8s for the Mediterranean Games in 2001 at an estimated cost of 170 million dinars, with nearly half of the loans financed by South Korean businessmen. The Olympic village was financed by an investment estimated at 50 million dinars.  In 2008, the government announced the start of construction of a large sports complex that will include several sports academies, a 20,000-seat stadium, and a swimming centre. Known as Tunis Sports City, it will expand around the lake of Tunis, on the road to La Marsa.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nTunis is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Other cooperations ===\n\n\n== Notable inhabitants ==\n\nIbn Khaldun (1332\u20131406), Arab sociologist and scholar\nTahar Haddad (1899\u20131935), promoter of women's emancipation in Tunisia\nAlbert Memmi (1920-2020), French writer and sociologist\nSalah El Mahdi (1925\u20132014), musicologist and composer\nAlberto Pellegrino (1930\u20131996), Italian fencer\nPhillip King (born 1934), British sculptor\nFouad Mebazaa (born 1933), politician, President of Tunisia in 2011\nNicola Pietrangeli (born 1933), Italian tennis player\nPierre Darmon (born 1934), French tennis player\nGeorges Wolinski (1934\u20132015), French illustrator and caricaturist\nRoberto Blanco (born 1937), German pop singer and actor\nYazid Zerhouni (born 1937), Algerian politician\nClaudia Cardinale (born 1938), Italian actress\nFatma Moalla (born 1939), mathematician\nMustapha Ben Jafar (born 1940), Tunisian politician\nAlain Boublil (born 1941), French musical author\nAbdelwahab Meddeb (1946\u20132014), Tunisian-French writer and radio staff\nSerge Adda (1948\u20132004), president of the French TV channel TV5\nSophie Bessis, (born 1947), Franco-Tunisian historian, journalist and researcher\nTarak Ben Ammar (born 1949), film producer\nBertrand Delano\u00eb (born 1950), mayor of Paris\nKarine Chemla (born 1958), historian of mathematics and sinologist\nAbdellatif Kechiche (born 1960), French film director, screenwriter and actor\nChokri El Ouaer (born 1966), Tunisian football goalkeeper\nAmel Karboul (born 1973), Tunisian entrepreneur, business consultant and politician\nMarc Gicquel (born 1977), French tennis player\nKhaled Mouelhi (born 1981), Tunisian footballer\nKarim Saidi (born 1983), Tunisian footballer\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBarbary pirates\nTunisian Community Center\nTunisian Italians\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nJellal Abdelkafi, La m\u00e9dina de Tunis, \u00e9d.

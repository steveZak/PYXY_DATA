        "wiki": "Bergenhus fortress (Norwegian: Bergenhus festning) is a fortress located in Bergen, Norway. Located at the entrance of Bergen harbour, the castle  is one of the oldest and best preserved stone fortifications in Norway.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe fortress contains buildings dating as far back as the 1240s, as well as later constructions built as recently as World War II. The extent of the enclosed area of today dates from the early 19th century. In medieval times, the area of the present-day Bergenhus Fortress was known as Holmen and contained the royal residence in Bergen, as well as a cathedral, several churches, the bishop's residence, and a Dominican monastery. Excavations have revealed foundations of buildings believed to date back to before 1100, which might have been erected by King Olav Kyrre. In the 13th century, until 1299, Bergen was the capital of Norway and Holmen was thus the main seat of Norway's rulers. It was first enclosed by stone walls in the 1240s.Of the medieval buildings, a medieval hall and a defensive tower remain. The royal hall, today known as Haakon's Hall, was built around 1260.,  The defensive tower,  was built around 1270 and contained a royal apartment on the top floor. In the 1560s, it was incorporated into a larger structure, which is today known as the Rosenkrantz Tower.\nIn the Middle Ages, several churches, including Bergen's cathedral Christ Church (Kristkirken p\u00e5 Holmen i Bergen),  were situated on the premises. These were torn down between 1526 and 1531, as the area of Holmen was converted into a purely military fortification under Danish rule. From around this time, the name Bergenhus came into use. Building work on Christ Church probably started around 1100. It contained the shrine of Saint Sunniva, the patron saint of Bergen. In the 12th and 13th centuries it was the site of several royal coronations and weddings. It was also the burial site of at least six kings, as well as other members of the royal family. The site of its altar is today marked by a memorial stone.\n\nIn the 19th century, the fortress lost its function as a defensive fortification, but it was retained by the military as an administrative base. After restoration in the 1890s, and again after destruction sustained during World War II, Bergenhus is today again used as a concert venue and as a feast hall for public events. During World War II, the German navy used several of its buildings for their headquarters, and they also constructed a large concrete bunker within the fortress walls. The buildings, including Haakon's Hall, were severely damaged  during World War II but the buildings were later restored.\nBergenhus is currently under the command of the Royal Norwegian Navy, which has about 150 military personnel stationed there. The fortifications Sverresborg fortress and Fredriksberg fortress also lie in the centre of Bergen. Haakon's Hall and Rosenkrantz Tower are open for visits by the public. Koengen, the central part of Bergenhus Fortress is also known as a concert venue. \n\n\n== Prominent buildings ==\n\n\n=== Haakon's Hall ===\nHaakon's Hall (Norwegian: H\u00e5konshallen) is a medieval stone hall located inside the fortress. The hall was constructed in the middle of the 13th century, during the reign of King H\u00e5kon H\u00e5konsson (1217\u20131263). In medieval times, it was the largest building of the royal palace in Bergen. It is the largest secular medieval building in Norway and the likely inspiration to similar great halls that were built on the royal estates in Oslo and Avaldsnes.\nNo written records survive of the construction of the hall. According to H\u00e5kon H\u00e5konsson's saga the building was not there at the coronation of King H\u00e5kon in 1247. It does, however, state that it was used during the wedding celebrations of King Magnus H\u00e5konsson and the Danish princess Ingebj\u00f8rg Eriksdatter on 11 September 1261. The hall is built in Gothic style. In addition to the great hall, there were two more levels, a cellar and a middle floor. The hall's similarity to English structures of the same time, and the fact that monumental stone building was relatively uncommon in Norway at the time, has led to an assumption that the hall was designed by English architects, possibly the court architect of King Henry III of England, with whom King H\u00e5kon was on friendly terms.\nThe hall has been hit by several fires, the first one as early as 1266. Upon the death of King Eirik Magnusson in 1299, Bergen lost its status as the main royal residence. From 1380 until 1814, Norway was in a personal union with Denmark, which meant that the royal castle in Bergen gradually fell into decay. In 1429 it was captured and burnt by the Victual Brothers (viktualiebr\u00f8drene), but a new stone portal from the mid-15th century shows that the hall was rebuilt after this event. Soon after, however, as the old royal residence was transformed into a purely military fortress, the Hall was turned into a storage building.By the 18th century, its original function had been largely forgotten. However, the 19th century saw the rise of Norwegian romantic nationalism as the country gradually regained its independence. As a result, the independent medieval kingdom was used as a source of new national symbols to rally around. In 1840, it was proven that the great stone building in Bergenhus fortress was, in fact, King H\u00e5kon H\u00e5konsson's old feast hall. For the next half century, its restoration back to its original function was debated. Henrik Ibsen wrote a poem in the hall's honor, and poet Henrik Wergeland first used the name Haakons hall in one of his poems. The hall was finally restored in the 1890s, and in the 1910s it was decorated with frescos with motives from H\u00e5kon H\u00e5konsson's saga, and stained glass windows.The hall was severely damaged on 20 April 1944, when  the wooden roof caught fire and burnt up. The fire also destroyed all the decorations from the first restoration. A second restoration took place in the 1950s, and the hall was reopened on 11 September 1961, the 700th anniversary of its first use. It is now decorated more discreetly, primarily with tapestries. Haakon's Hall is now administered by the Bergen City Museum, which also takes care of Rosenkrantz Tower and other protected buildings in the city. The hall is occasionally used for concerts, especially choir song and chamber music, and for banquets, mainly for official functions.\n\n\n=== Rosenkrantz Tower ===\n \nRosenkrantz Tower (Norwegian: Rosenkrantzt\u00e5rnet) is a tower that derives its name from governor Erik Rosenkrantz (1519-1575) who was governor of Bergenhus Fortress from 1560 to 1568.  During his administration,  the tower received its present shape and structure. The oldest part of the building is made up of a medieval tower built during the reign of  King Magnus the Lawmender in the 1270s as part of the royal castle in Bergen.\nThe keep was slightly modified circa 1520, then extensively modified and expanded in the 1560s by Scottish stonemasons and architects in the service of Erik Rosenkrantz to attain its present form. Rosenkrantz' building contained dungeons on the ground floor, residential rooms for the governor higher up, and positions for cannons on the top floor. In the 1740s, the tower was converted to a magazine for gunpowder, a function it served until the 1930s. The whole building has been open to the general public since 1966. Today, the tower serves primarily as a tourist attraction.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Other sources ==\nKavli, Guthorm  Norges festninger, fra Fredriksten til Vard\u00f8hus (Universitetsforlaget. 1987) ISBN 8200184307\n\n\n== External links ==\nHomepage\nBergenhus Fortress - Haakon's Hall pictures\nBergenhus Fortress 1954",

          "Situated above the harbour both the tower and the hall are worth a visit in Bergen. The tower is under restoration but still open to visitors. Great history lesson in it on the development of Bergen. Only go if you can climb a tight stone spiral staircase and descend the same.",

          "An interesting place to visit. Very relaxing and well maintained. Museums are found within the fortress walls.",
          "It was interesting to walk around and see the buildings. Most areas of interest within the walls require a fee to enter.",
          "Rather annoying that you have to buy a ticket for each element of the fortress separately. Couldn't the attraction offer discounted ticket prices if visitors want to see all areas? The free drink in the caf\u00e9 is a really nice gesture though.",

          "It's a hotch-potch of extensions and modifications done over the centuries and much of it is not original, the structures having to be rebuilt after WWII destruction. Suspected to have been designed by an English architect, it has more of a British feel to it than anything",

          "Apparently its one of the oldest and best preserved fortresses in Norway. What is open right now is the Rosenkrantz Tower which is I think 5 stories. Many of the rooms are empty but some have displays outlining the history of the Fortress. Look at the map when you go in and",

          "Make it a point to see the military fortress. It's amazing to see the beautiful park like grounds so close to the harbor. We chose not to pay the entrance fee to see Hakon's hall, as it was redone and not original. But, it is a lovely place to walk.",
          "From the cannon situated at one end to Rosenkrantz Tower at the other and flowing gardens/grassy areas and the barracks and Haakon Hall there is a lot to consume here. Some you can enjoy free of charge. Or if you just want to flop in the park area and chill/relax or daydream of",

          "We didn't actually make it into the main fort, but if you're in Bergen it's well worth checking out the military museum which is tucked away slightly off the beaten path behind the Thon Hotel Brygge. I never knew much about Norway's World War 2 history but this museum was very",

          "The fortress was a more interesting stop than we anticipated. We saw both Haakons Hall and Rosencrantz Tower, both of which were mostly empty but had great medieval ambiance. Good tip: We asked about tours running when we bought our tickets, and we ended up getting a private",

          "The two medieval buildings are cool, but have their own categories on this site and I have not entered them yet. The fortress is a nice place for a walk and a decent view of Bergen (not compared to the mountains!!).",
          "I visited here in 1975 when I was a kid and again in June 2011. I had a look at my pictures for my first visit before I came to Norway and that made exploring Bergenhus even more fun as I was looking for things from my first tour as well. Enjoyed it quite a lot.",
          "This well restored castle, some parts of which are 700+ years old, is just a beautiful sight to see!",
          "We went for a walk and run into the fort and the park around it. Even thought it was late and the fort was close, it is possible to walk around and enjoy nice views of the city port and surroundings. Make sure to check the map at the entrance of the fort and take the park walks,",
          "There's a fish market which reminded me of the one in Seattle. All types of seafood are available (even whale!). Many people seemed to purchase caviar. The old shops and waterfront are a nice place to spend an afternoon.",
          "Even though Bergen was packed with cruise tourists, this fort turned castle was surprisingly empty and we were able to wander around the narrow passages mostly alone. We've visited many castles across Europe and this one had a distinctly authentic feel-- not beautifully"

          "The Fortress was under renovation during our stay in Bergen. The place has a little park and a nice view over part of the port. Great for a moment of quiet.",
          "Nice little fort to visit in Bergen. The only time the fort has seen battle is apparently to protect a Dutch fleet from a British assault. The firm's location at the entrance to the bay must have been very strategic indeed.",
          "Interesting place but mostly closed possibly because it was Monday. I would go back and check it out but had to catch flight home.",
          "Interesting old medieval fortress and hall situated in central Bergen. Both the fortress and hall have interesting if not beautiful interiors. There are displays explaining the extensive history of the buildings and the members of the Norwegian Royal family that occupied them.",
          "Very old part of the city worth a visit",
          "A place near the docs and old houses that represent Bergen. It is a nice walk, but it doesn't have this wow effect. It is old and looks nice. I think that it is treated as a park, more than an attraction. We saw many locals sitting under the trees chilling. Entrance to the park is free.",
          "Fun place to take the kids. The little ones will love the castle and the older ones will enjoy the history.",
          "Beautiful place. I didn't get into to Tower as it's seems it's opened only at the weekends in winter.",
          "Lots of history. This is a great way to spend a few hours in Bergen. I've been here quite a few times and always manage to find an architectural element that I missed previously.  The blend if stone and brick work is especially fascinating. This place is a must see.",
          "Unique.  The size and layout of the Foetress is quite impressive.  Bergen uses the grand hall for many civic functions and concerts.",

          "A wonderful place to enjoy some peace and quiet in the middle of downtown Bergen. The original castle of Norway is here and when it's not a quiet place it's usually some awesome musician or group having a concert.",
          "It's a very nice park in which to enjoy a walk or bike ride. The fortress and grounds are well maintained. Unfortunately, we weren't able to go inside to see any of the exhibits for the Hall or Tower.",
          "It's a nice fortress close to the center, that has no entry fee, only during the day some parts of it are open for visitors, so check these hours before. During my visit one part of it was accessible only after a 3km walk but it was worth the view from higher ground.",
          "Very nice, but you can finish there in 30 minutes.",
          "Interesting experience ... Come have spent 3-4 hours here. Needs better signage as to what pretty l path to follow. Watch the low clearances on doorways!",

          "Well worth the hike to the top,we went on foot out of the port and into the centre of town, veiws from the top almost 360 degrees, stopped at a great little on street cafe, good filtered coffee served in bone china cups and saucers, free refills, worth the visit",
          "The fortress looks really nice, and all the little stops around it tell you a lot about history. Worth a visit !",
          "Beautiful fortress just beside the harbor. Some buildings date back to the 1500s. The views looking out from the fortress are also noteworthy. Quick, worthwhile stop.",
          "The fortress was amazing. We walked around the outside a bit and then went up the tower. Very interesting. Oh! And the cafe has really good ice cream.",
          "Interesting place to walk around.  Nothing too special but worth coming to nevertheless.\n\nThe view of the harbor is great.  Also, you can see towards the other side of the city.",
          "A nice place, with lovely sights and often houses the Dr\u00e6ggen boy brigade and more. But you get a sense that the exterior area is very empty. The interior is a different matter, however.",
          "Well it's a spit a way from the center, and there is nothing to do there. The building is closed for the most there are no signs or explanation of what is it or any kind of info. There are some old Canons as it used to be part of the city \u2026",
          "Grounds are lovely  and views stunning and they  are  free you have to pay to go  into the fortress. The main hall is lovely  but the rest isn't.",

          "The grounds give a nice view of the surrounding area. Very little of the actual fortress exists",
          "Just a nice view and beatiful place to spend some time,  sitting on the grass during sunny day. Beware of the heights as tall walls are not protected. I will not recommend going there with small kids.",
          "Too tall for this place",
          "Must see Bergen attraction! I really enjoyed the hakon's hall",
          "Nice park but one of the main buildings was covered in scaffolding. They can't help that and I guess that work has done in summer in this northern climate.",

          "Open late, great place to see the sunset over the fjords. Just keep walking past the old Hanseatic block near the fish market and you are there. Walk along the ramparts and the whole site will take about 30-45 minutes to explore. Apparently \u2026",
          "Well maintained building with beautiful views of town and mounts around",
          "Good pkaxe to visit on holidays.",

          "Very interesting and worth a visit",
          "We went because a website said it was free. The entry cost was 100NOK per person. Didn't go up but looked nice from the outside",
          "An interesting place to visit, historic.",
          "I totally loved the Rosenkratz tower. Totally worth the 100 Kr. Beautiful historical expositions and an awesome stone building. You can really feel the history from that place. The Haakon's Hall on the other hand was a bit underwhelming. \u2026",
          "To be away from the hustle and bustle of the town, visit Bergenhus Fortress in the quiet park on the north end of the city. Beautifully maintained and well worth your visit",

          "Such an interesting place, unfortunately we came while a lot of work is being done so a lot of scaffolding.",
          "Not much to see, to be honest... A few old preserved buildings, decent park inside the walls. Close to zero info on history that could interest people - some ruins by church with no info at all. Needs work to be a central attraction / serious museum.",

        "wiki": "Bryggen (the dock), also known as Tyskebryggen (Norwegian: [\u02c8t\u028f\u0300sk\u0259\u02ccbr\u028f\u0261\u02d0n\u0329], the German dock), is a series of Hanseatic heritage commercial buildings lining up the eastern side of the V\u00e5gen harbour in the city of Bergen, Norway. Bryggen has been on the UNESCO list for World Cultural Heritage sites since 1979.\nThe city of Bergen was founded around 1070 within the boundaries of Tyskebryggen. Around 1350 a Kontor of the Hanseatic League was established there, and Tyskebryggen became the centre of the Hanseatic commercial activities in Norway. Today, Bryggen houses museums, shops, restaurants and pubs.\n\n\n== History ==\nBergen was established before 1070 AD. In the Middle Ages, the Bryggen area encompassed all buildings between the sea and the Stretet (\u00d8vregaten) road, from Holmen in the north to V\u00e5gsbunnen in the south. According to the Sagas, the city was founded within this area.One of the earliest pier constructions has been dated to around 1100, and the existing buildings are of a much later date, with only Sch\u00f8tstuene and some buildings towards Julehuset being originals from 1702.Around 1350, an office of the Hanseatic League was established in Bryggen. As the town developed into an important trading centre, the wharfs were improved and the buildings of Bryggen were gradually taken over by the Hanseatic merchants. The warehouses were used to store goods, particularly stockfish from northern Norway, and cereal from Europe.\nIn 1702, the buildings belonging to the Hanseatic League were damaged by fire.  They were rebuilt, and some of these were later demolished, and some were destroyed by fire. In 1754, the operations of the office at Bryggen ended, when all the properties were transferred to Norwegian citizens.Throughout history, Bergen has experienced many fires, since most of its houses were traditionally made from wood. This was also the case for Bryggen, and as of today around a quarter were built after 1702, when the older wharfside warehouses and administrative buildings burned down. The rest predominantly consists of younger structures, although there are some stone cellars that date back to the 15th century.\nParts of Bryggen were again destroyed in a fire in 1955. A thirteen-year archaeological excavation followed, revealing the day-to-day runic inscriptions known as the Bryggen inscriptions. The Bryggen museum was built in 1976 on part of the site cleared by the fire. \n\n\n== Architectural heritage ==\nBryggen was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979, by Criterion (iii): Bryggen bears the traces of social organization and illustrates the use of space in a quarter of Hanseatic merchants that dates back to the 14th century. It is a type of northern \u201cfondaco\u201d, unequalled in the world, where the structures have remained within the cityscape and perpetuate the memory of one of the oldest large trading ports of Northern Europe.\nNotable houses at Bryggen include Bellg\u00e5rden (a 300-year-old building), Svensg\u00e5rden, Enhj\u00f8rningsg\u00e5rden, Bredsg\u00e5rden, Bug\u00e5rden, Engelg\u00e5rden. The oldest and tallest building in the area is St Mary's Church. Streets include Jacobsfjorden. Museums include Bryggens Museum and Hanseatic Museum and Sch\u00f8tstuene.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Had a great time with my family doing the escape rooms here, far better than any I\u2019ve tried in the UK! Great clues to resolve in the heart of Bergen old town - what more could you wish for! Lovely eateries close by so good for a family day out. We\u2019ll be back and thank you \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Escape room in Bergen's emblematic place, fun game and very attentive staff, 100% recommended. perfect option for a rainy day",
          "The Evil Rain Machine is one of the best escape rooms we have tried. And we have tried many. To bad it is probably not going to be around for too long. The receptionis told us that particular romm will be discontinued.",
          "We had a fun hour trying to crack the codes in the Diva room. This is a great fun activity to do when visiting Bergen. The staff are really friendly and accommodating, sorting out a booking mistake I had made without hesitation. Highly recommend for families. You\u2019ll want to do",
          "4 peolpe, Hanseatic, 2 hints, 50 minutes. Was fun and challenging, non of the puzzles we've seen anywhere else. Stylish location.",
          "The Hanseaticus escape room had a great theme and design, and felt very authentic due to its location in the Bryggen. The puzzles were clever and not repetitive. We were a team of two and just made it out in time. It was a really fun experience overall.",
          "This escape room is located in one of the heritage buildings right in Bryggen. The building itself is really interesting and definitely sets the mood. The Hanseatic room was really cool. The puzzles were challenging and clever and my group had an awesome time! The staff were",
          "Our party of 6 (3 adults and 3 children) LOVED the Escape Bryggen Experience! Definitely recommend this to everyone looking for a challenge!",
          "we were three friends ing to sovle this puzzle and it was awesome! Thumbs up all the way!:) Recomend this!",
          "We have been 6 and had great fun with the Puzzles. Working as a team(s) is the key to find the keys.",
          "Went as a couple to the \"la diva supernova\", and it was very funny. Cool experience, really worth the time! Nice staff, and great location. Two people was good for this Room, but it would probably be good with more too.",
          "Would highly recommend, polite and serviceminded staff. Gets you and your friends a nice teamwork experienced activity. Several \u00abescapes\u00bb to choose from. Affordable and perfect for bacheloretteparty, family, teambuilding etc. Thumbs up!",
          "We were two teams in the two rooms at Skuteviken, Crimson Hotel and La Diva Supernova. It was great fun and there was strong competition between the teams! The level of difficulty was good, both rooms had exciting and unexpected twists and turns in the plot and only one team",
          "We did the Hanseaticus room as a group of four, two of which had never done an escape room before. The whole thing was well organized and went very smoothly. The rooms are available in English and Norwegian. The location is very atmospheric. You enter through one of the alleys",
          "I went there with some colleagues. It was fun and interesting. Some tasks difficult and some easier. It was a great experience, and the whole group loved it.",
          "We were a team of 9 colleagues who barely managed to defeat the evil rain machine. It was a lot of fun and everyone was involved.",
          "Great fun solving La Diva Supernova. Tricky codes, absolutely worth the hour. We were four people, in different ages, were we could all tribute to the solution.",
          "My brother, his girlfriend and I did the room \"Hanseaticus\", since this is the one at Bergen brygge and it is suitable for three people. I really like the room. There are many padlocks, but I thought it was good because all the locks are tagged, so you always know where to try",
          "We were a couple who went for the Hanseatic escape room. The riddles were fun enough, although a bit repetitive in form. Considering the price, I had higher expectations to finesse in detail and narrative.",
          "I went with 8 friends ( so recommend go in big groups or a accepted more people on the game). They have a lot of mystery to figure out, definitely you will have fun! We did it. And I would love to come back and try the other ones... Camila",
          "Did the Supernova game with 3 of my friends. It was great fun and very rewarding to solve the puzzles.",
          "Group of five people trying the escape room concept for the first time. We did the \"La Diva Supernova\" and had a lot of fun, even though we did not manage to escape. The puzzles are quite clever, but manageable if you put your focus in the right place. Service was excellent, and",
          "Difficult room, but it was a really cool experience. We have now tried two rooms in Bergen (Crimson Hotel and Hanseaticus). We recommend you to try them. We are looking forward to trying a new room. Crimson Hotel was in english.",
          "Very nice activity for teambuilding, family occation, etc. Develops creative thinking, intuition, cooperation and sense of humour.",
          "This was my first time trying an Escape Room and it turned out to be a lot of fun, more than I thought it would be. We were six friends who were locked into the Hanseaticus room and we managed to solve the riddles and get out in 39 minutes. Very entertaining and I'd love to try",
          "We didn\u2019t know what to expect, but were very positively suprised by this. It was actually a lot of fun and something I\u2019d want to do again. We also liked the location, as you are actually in a room in one of the Bryggen buildings. Worth a visit.",
          "Was there as a corporate event. As a first time experience, I gather the confusion is great to begin with - then things get quite funny as the clock ticks towards the deadline. Escape Bryggen also has two similar rooms just outside the town centre. Good fun - worth trying out.",
          "We love escape rooms in England so decided why not try one in Norway ! They are much harder but still fun! We had a great time so much so we left and booked another one for later that afternoon and ended up doing two in one day! Thank you.",
          "This was our first escape room experience and it was pretty awesome\u2026 We did really well, The puzzles were amazing and the layout and design of the room\u2026 With a theme of old smugglers was awesome\u2026 I highly recommend!",
          "Our family of five (including three older teens) really enjoyed solving the many clever puzzles in this escape room. We did need to use a few clues and were able to get out in 50 minutes. The setting for the Hanseatic room was perfect given that it is located in the Bryggen",
          "Exciting and different, fun and good for a small group like ours (5 people) to work togehter in an excellent way. A perfect thing to do on a rainy day in Bergen. You'll forget all about the rain for a while.",
          "I booked the Evil Rain Machine for my daughters birthday. It was my daughter, my husband, our 13 year old son and I.The puzzles are quite difficult and the game is quite immersive so you get really in to it. The staff were brilliant.. Great value for money.It was a great place",
          "We (4 people in their 60ies) were a bit apprehensive to the experience before starting, but this is something we definitely would like to do again! We were impressed by our hosts, who were friendly and humourous, gave good and clear instructions and very good \"pointers\" when we",
          "Really enjoyed our escape room today! We booked the Hanseatic room by the internet. This location is based in an antique Brygge house within the historic centre so great to combine with some sightseeing. Our kids (age 12-16) could all participate and had a great time solving",
          "The game is absolutely wonderful. A lot of different kinds of puzzles you need to solve. Every solved puzzle leads to a clue for the next. It is a very fun experience. Be mindful though, If you wish to pay at the property there is an extra fee of 79 krone. There is a very small",
          "The site is impressive. Old wood warehouses with more than 400 years of history. Now houses many nice shops. Worth to visit it more than once!",
          "We where a group of 7 friends who figured... why not, and why not? We had a great time, with an amazing personal and a challenging assignment. We have already set a date in August when we will go again.",
          "A great experience! Its a bit pricy, but then again you'll only do it once and it is WORTH IT! My group had a great time!",
          "We had a great time solving the puzzle at Escape Bryggen! It was more diffucult than I thought, but great fun!!!",
          "We had a great time, it was fun to solve the riddles and puzzles. We managed to escape the room, and are planning to do the other rooms as well. We had a really fun time. We were 6 people and it worked great, 3 siblings so where a bit curious how the teamwork would be and it",
          "I have visited all 3 rooms and we managed to escape all of them. I liked The Hanseaticus and The Crimson Hotel, while Diva Supernova was not as good as the other two. Very interesting and I can't wait to try a new one again. I consider repeating sometimes the same room beacuse I",
          "Fantastic place to have teambuilding with your collegues! Exciting to solve all the codes and find the solution together. We will absolutely try this again - in some of the other rooms that Escape Bergen provide, together with collegues, friends or familiy. You should really try",
          "We were looking for a fun and unusual activity for our teambuilding event, and hit it spot on! We all had a great time solving different riddles and Puzzles. It can definately be recommended!",

          "Escape Bryggen was a fun and exciting challenge! We visited with 5 adults and one very smart boy of 10 years. The riddles and puzzles were brilliantly laid out and we all had a great time trying to figure out clues and unlock the next level. We came out laughing after enjoying",
          "Five bright 12 year old girls did a great job in the Hanseatic room. We were a bit worried it would be too difficult, but they had tons of fun working together to solve the riddles and get out in time. We got a few hints, but a lot of the tasks they did without any assistance.",
          "I went with a group of 5, none of the others had played an escape room before. Central location on Bryggen but a little hard to find due to the lack of outside signs. We all had a fun hour and the four others in my group loved the experience. I felt that it was more of an",
          "Loved this room - really good atmosphere and a good range of puzzles. Unfortunately I misread the email and we turned up at the Bryggen room. However they were very accommodating and allowed us our full game time, despite being late. We played as a group of 4, and only just got",
          "With a bunch of friends I did two of the 3 rooms. It is quite fun to do and work your way through the riddles. We especially enjoyed the toughest room and manage to escape it 20 sec before the time was up :) So very fun and highly recommended. If I could give two critics though",
          "I didn't know anything about escape rooms before this one, and we decided to do it in Bergen solely based on Tripadvisor (group of four). We chose the scary one, and the experience, though slightly expensive, didn't disappoint, and persuaded us to try other escape rooms in",
          "Our first experience in an escape room, really fun and got us thrilled from the first moment. Since we were two, we went for the easiest choice, and we almost managed to make it. The experience is fun, although the props are a little worn down. Nevertheless an overall great",
          "Because we were only a group of two and had never done an escape room before, my partner and I chose the easiest of the 3 options (the Hanseaticus room). We completed the challenge in 35-40 minutes and maybe should have gone with a more difficult option, but I thought it was a",
          "This was really a nice activity to do with our collegues. Teamwork activity highly recommended. Take your team out and have fun.",
          "Great fun in a unique location. Found this more difficult than other similar experiences but enjoyed it just the same. Highly recommended.",
          "The escape room was a fun and challenging experience. It really takes some team work. We were four persons and I think that is probably ideal. Enough people to cover all the puzzels, but few enough so you know what everyone is doing and you can communicate while you are in the",
          "We head a good time in this Exciting game-room, with puzzling challanges. And friendly helpful staff, perfect family or friend activity.",
          "We did the Hansiaticus room at Bryggen in Bergen as a teambuilding excersice at work. This was so amazing and we had so much fun! I Would abolutely recommend everyone to try this :-)",
          "We enjoyed the whole time we were inside the room. Easy to order on webside and easy payment with paypal",
          "This one was my third Escae room and it was the worse of them, too easy. We were six and we managed to Escape in a record time (after 28 min we had the key to scape). You will enjoy If you like this kind of activities... but If you are looking for a new challenge this room is",
          "I went with 5 friends and i played before another Escape room. If you like puzzles, and have a nice group time you'll like it. The girl that was working was nice and polite, so everything ok. I recommend it for families or friends, but maybe better in 4 or less people. Maybe we",
          "We went on August 24th in the early afternoon and had a great time. The attendant was very friendly and answered all our questions. He contacted us several times during the game to answer questions and gave us 2 clues at our request. We made it pretty far , and after we ran",
          "You have to use Your head. The game was not easy at first, but then after a while we figert out what to do. It was a lot of fun.",
          "I completed this room as part of a pair. Although on their website they set themes for the room this wasn't really evident upon entering the building or the room which detracted from the experience a little. The room was quite basic and I found myself often over complicating the",
          "We have tried the \"Hanseaticus\" challenge, because it is located in one of those beautiful Bryggen houses. The atmosphere of the place is really unique! There were 5 of us there, and 4 of us have tried escape room before (another place in Bergen). The game is great fun! However,",
          "I really don't know what rating to give this business. The game was really a lot of fun, challenging and well put together, but I felt like the people who work there either have no clue what their doing, or are not running honest business practices. We stopped by the office to",
          "My family (two adults and a 14yo) booked the La Diva room online from the UK, never having done anything like this before. We had massive amounts of fun but failed (just!) to get out. We enjoyed it so much that we booked the Hanseaticus room for a few days later - and made it",
          "I thought this might be a bit of a challenge for my 12 year old son and I, but we thoroughly enjoyed the puzzle solving and although didn't get out within the hour, felt we had done well. Another pair of hands would have helped as the time went so quickly. Great fun - highly",
          "Challenging, but not impossible. It was a fun way to spend the afternoon with friends. Can very much recommend!",
          "Hysterically funny thing to do if it's raining. Don't be overconfident, it's not easy, but it's a very cool challenge.",
          "A fantastic, hectic, fun and rewarding hour, crowned with us solving the puzzle with a few minutes to go. We will definately book again and also look up escape rooms in other countries and cities we visit. Very informative staff and the girl that helped us spoke very good",
          "The four of us visited Escape Bryggen today with anticipation and excitement, ready to experience an escape room for the first time. And Escape Bryggen did not disappoint! It was probably the most adrenaline, fun filled hour I've had in a long time. The puzzles were",
          "Many puzzles to find code for many locks. 1 hour to dismantle bomb. Easy booking ans upfront payment with paypal. Possibility to get tips while playing by using phone. Super fun!",
          "This was really something exciting and different! We played the Diva quest, and the puzzles and clues were really clever. We did not escape the bomb though, but we were only two people and that means a lot of puzzle for one hour. Highly recommend the place for a rainy day!",
          "What a fantastic find on a rainy day at short notice - and would also have been on any other kind of day! Two adults plus a 9 & 11 year old - none of us had ever done one of these locked room places before. We had huge interactive, family fun for an hour in the Hanseaticus room",
          "La diva supernova... The sense of adventure and challenge is overwhelming when you enter the room. We, a group of 6, managed to clear the challenge with some time left on the clock. It was fun, we worked together and integrated all our efforts to prevent the bomb from",

          "We really enjoyed the Bryggen room escape. Good puzzles and very friendly staff. I would really recommend this for groups of friends. It was also great to be able to go inside one of the warehouses in Bryggen. One thing we would say is that the actual escape from the room was",
          "We had the Crimson Hotel and La Diva Supernova in Skutviksbodene 13. We split up in two teams - and both teams had great fun! Challenging, funny, and a great way to work together :) Highly recommended for couples, friends , team bulding and so on! Just really fun !",

          "Although the start was affected by the sound system failing and not giving us the narrative, we had a great time. As the host of a stag party, we were 10 people using both rooms in their Sandviksbodene facility. The rest regards my experience in the room called Crimson:",
          "This was surprisingly alot of fun, even for four middleaged women! At first there was some confusion as to exactly what we were supposed to look for. Bur then we got into the swing of things and started using those little grey cells up there that have been languishing due to",
          "We tried the Escape room at Bryggen Bergen. It was great fun, but a bit too difficult for just two persons. The makers creativity was too far beyond ours, and for us it seemed impossible to find the clues in just 1 hour. We would recommend the users to be more than just two",
          "We went 4 people for this room, and we had a ton of fun. Lots of things to interact with and to try solve. The feeling of the room had a solid progression, and it all builds up to a very epic climaxing moment.",

          "Tried all three rooms. We'll have to wait a bit to ensure we have forgotten some clues, but we will be back for you Crimson hotel!",
          "This was really cool. The ancient wooden houses at Bryggen suit this kind of place very well. We were six colleagues who solved the puzzle together, and I would say 4-6 people is the perfect size of a group. Tricky and exciting! I think my son aged 14 would love it too, and may",
          "Very nice room. We need one advice, but we manage to do it 2 minutes before the end!:D There were a lot of puzzles there, some times easy one, but some times they were very tricky one. But puzzles are very good one. Everything was working perfectly. I am very recommend it, but",
          "It was an amazing experience. 5/5 highly recommended! Luckily we managed to complete the challenge and escaped the room with 1 min to spare. And now I want to try all the escape rooms! Many thanks for a brilliant time.",
          "Me and my gf tried the Crimson Hotel room, the most difficult room of the three rooms that Escape Bryggen offers. We didn't make it since it was pretty challenging for two people, but it was still a lot of fun! I would recommend this to anyone who likes mystery and puzzle",
          "This was the first time that we have tried one of these escape challenges. The Bryggen pirate theme was very well executed. This was well themed being located in the old wooden houses. You really need to focus on what is in front of you and also what is around. Thoroughly",
          "One friend and me 40 and 50 year tried this after recommendations from a co worker. Had no ide of what would meet us , played some escape games on internet and this was like the real deal. You have one hour to get out and the is the fastest hour in a long time. Both my friend",
          "We've been to several Escape Rooms in Europe, NY and Norway, and I am sorry to say that the two rooms we've did in Bergen was definitely the worst. They have just filled their rooms with lots and lots of stuff whitch gives the rooms a messy look. And we did not like the consept",
          "Planned only the Crimson Hotel for our 4 day stay in Bergen to try that experience. But after the room, we were completely hooked and squeezed the other two rooms into our schedule as well - were not disappointed! We were two people only and it was so much fun and at some points",
          "This was an amazing experience for me and my girlfriend. It is quite challanging if you are just two seeing as there are a lot of tasks to be done, but still doable. It is a little pricy but well worth the money.",
          "We tried the pirate treasure one, its supposedly be easier than crimson hotel but we couldn't get out in 60 minutes. solving clues is very exciting. The only thing is we went to the place which is in skuvitienborden as bryggen one was closed. The skuvitienborden one is not very",
          "This was our first Room Escape adventure, but something that we had hoped to do for sometime, and we were not disappointed. It took us 44 minutes to escape. We felt it was the right level of challenge and still good fun! A little pricey, but then this is Norway so it is to be",

          "Have been here twice to two different rooms and both times have throughly enjoyed it - although we didn't manage to escape either time! Just 5 more minutes...! But that's all part of the fun. The rooms I visited were completely different to one another which was great as both",
          "Inside the beautiful Bryggen you will find the escape room. You get locked in a room for 60 minutes, and have to solve a series of tasks/riddles to find combination to locks to get out of the room. We chose the hanseatic room for our first escape room experience. You should book",
          "Just stepped out of Escape Bryggen, we made it out. We had ten seconds to spare. My wife had booked it, but our kids (23 & 16) and I had no idea what we were about to do. It was an awesome experience. It was a team effort. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",
          "We were only 2 in the room, but we almost got out. Had just a few tasks left. Only negative I have to say is that the codelocks dont necessarilly open up on the first try, even if its the correct code. They are a bit worn out. Some of them you really have to jiggle before it",
          "It was a lot of fun to do, and at the same time also very challenging and difficult - you definitely need to really use your brain, think outside the box and be aware of details. We were only two in the room, so it was a bit difficult to make it around to all the assignments,",
          "it is great fun, super nice to get to know each others. a bit challenging if you are 2/3 people. and we were welcomed by a very nice man!",
          "We visited Escape Bryggen as work related team building/have fun. Our group was enough to fill two rooms so we split up in two teams. All of us had high expectations and everyone left with a big smile on their faces. I would highly recommend this to everyone! Too bad my kids",
          "Very fun for both a small group of people and a bigger one. It is a great teambuilding experience and boost your confidence when solving puzzles correctly.",
          "It was hard to solve! And all the clues and riddles was well thought out :) worth every penny! I will defently visit the other rooms!",

          "We were 11 people from our company, using the two rooms at Skuteviksboder 13. We all had a blast and the puzzles were hard, but solveable. Well worth the money!",
          "This was a really fun experience and worth the money! It's in the tourist section on the water and tucked away. My friend and I came close but unfortunately fell a little short. The gentleman who walked us through the process couldn't of been nicer. I would visit again and we",
          "It's challenging and fun, I went with some associates from university, and we had to work together to solve the puzzles. Will recommend this as a good attraction, you should go with atleast one friend/associate/significant other, but recomended party size is 2-6. It's a event",
          "We went with 7 people as a team outing. All my questions on beforehand were answered promptly and the issue with paying the bill was resolved professionally. All of us enjoyed the excitement of the Crimson Hotel room. We would have liked it even better if we would have been",

          "This was our first visit to Bergen and we are so thrilled to have discovered Escape Bryggen - it was without a doubt the highlight of our holiday! So much fun, excellently thought out, and just the right level of taxing. Certainly requires logical thinking and a good level of",
          "We are there on 11 September 2015 and want to try out escape for so long. The staff are friendly and helpful, If you have any problem you can make a call at any time. We took the treasure room which has a clever puzzle, It is fun to solve it. We want to try other rooms but next",

          "We tried out this activity with our family, at first we just looked around the room, trying to find clues on what to do. After a couple of minutes we started breaking the first puzzles and it was so rewarding when we succeeded and the locks went open. Although we did not escape",
          "Went to Escape Bryggen with BIG expectations after hearing and reading a lot about it. It wasn't quite like I thought, but it was still top notch. I thought it would involve riddles and such, but it was more like puzzles and connecting clues to find keys and codes. So much fun!!",
          "This was a really funny experience! Would recommend it to couples, families, friends etc. We couldnt get out of the room but still enjoyed the challenge. Totally worth a try. Totally worth the Money!",

          "Oh my God, probably the best hour of my life. I went with two of my friends, all 19 years old, and it was AMAZING!! We made it just in time, and we thought the difficulty was perfect. Definitely challenging, but not impossible (and you can always ask for hints). I don't want to",
          "We got the chance to try a brand new room with a spooky atmosphere and really cool puzzles. We where 5 people, and we where all occupied with fun puzzles that required teamwork, cleverness, ingenuity and creativity to solve. It'll definitely also work well with fewer players.",
          "Even though we did not make it out of the room in time, we had a great time filled with laughter and fun. We were two boys and two girls, but all of us got to contribute to the game. It was challenging, but not to hard when you first got the big picture. Will definitely do it",
          "First time I tried the concept, and loved it. Very fun, I think I never experienced such a fast going hour... We were 5 in the room, it seems to me like a good number, everybody is busy most of the time. I would not go in if less than 4 players, too hard. Enigmas are fun and",

          "We went as a team of 5 and it took us some minutes to understand the room and the game. Then it was fun and exiting to find the clues and solve the puzzles. We all enjoyed it the same level and this is some thing you can do with your friends or family.Highly recommended even",
          "I entered this room with one friend, and I believe that we would have won with one more head. We managed to open the chest, but had only 30 seconds left, so we failed to find the key and unlock the door. So close, yet so far away. But it was thrilling all the way to the end. A",

          "This museum was much better when the admission was free. And money is not the only matter here. It used to have a good collection of Norwegian artists, well selected and tastefully presented. Now they have a Munch exhibit, which is fine, but it's done at the expense of other",
          "If your like me and The Scream is all you know of Edvard Munch's work, do not miss the opportunity to have your eyes opened to a remarkable body of work . . . I also love that the museum focuses on Norwegian artists so for example II felt we were exposed to dozens of wonderful",

          "This museum is in 4-5 separate buildings along the small lake in the very centre. The best in my experience is the display of Nikolai Astrup, a painter largely unknown outside Norway. But his paintings and prints are loved and instantly recognized by many Norwegians. The display",

          "Walked from number 4 to number 1. As you. are passing the park you can hear wind chimes. Saw some Picasso very good. Not sure about Munch as his art was varied in style and didn\u2019t get to see The Scream. Presume it was being cleaned. We used our Bergen Card which gave discounts.",

          "Kode is not one museum. This is association of five or six museums. One ticket bought in one of kode museums is valid for all others 24 hours. I was impressed by Hans Gude who is one of the most popular Norwegian landscape painters.",
          "The Kode museum is great value as you can visit four museums over two days on the ticket. The most imaginative display was the silver exhibition in the shape of a magpies nest with mirrors. KODe 3 has the major exhibition of Munch who really stands out. His ability to convey",
          "Lots of different types of art styles to see here. We went in all the buildings and enjoyed a nice selection of Norwegian art over history as well as several other styles. Definitely worth a visit if you've got a Bergen card. A good way to learn about Norway and stay out of the",
          "My personal favorite is the Nikolai Astrup exhibition, not a permanent one so do hurry if you want to see it, it will come to an end at 31 Dec 2019. As the museum writes on its homepage; \"The exhibition sheds light on how the darkness of night and the mystique of childhood were",

          "Just a great experience. After managing the lockers for our bags we moved from building to building enjoying the paintings. Hard to be explicit why, as we are not knowledgable about Norwegian art, but it was great with beauty and humour as well as Munch. We both really enjoyed",
          "Visited all four KODE art museums in one day, very enjoyable and good for a rainy day! The art work is very well curated/presented using innovative and modern techniques. Definitely recommend!",

          "My husband and I often visit art museums while on vacation and we tend to find that you need big chunks of time and by the end your visually exhausted and can't remember half of what you saw. The Koda museums don't do that! We visited Koda 1 and 3. The collections were curated",
          "In KODE are situated the biggest collection of Munk`s paintings. KODE is a small museum, but there are enough art inside. E[hibition is full of emotions. Only 4 rooms of Munk - worth to visit it. I wish I saw it again )",

          "KODE is a series of art exhibitions spread across four gallery buildings. You can visit on two consecutive days if you wish. The star attraction is the Munch exhibition which is a good pr\u00e9cis of how his art developed across his lifetime. The Dahl show shouldn't be missed",
          "It\u2019s free to visit if you have Bergen card. We visited Kode house 2 & 4 only. A lot of silver art work were exhibited in house 2. In house 4, mainly paintings from famous Norwegian painters including Edvard Munch were displayed.",
          "4 different buildings host 4 different exhibit.on august 10 we were unlucky on building 1(kode 1).basically nothing interesting was on display,unless something like your rich granny's silverware collection is your idea of art worth looking at. Instead,kode 4 had some fine pieces",

          "My 18 year old nephew decided to spend an afternoon at KODE. There were 5 buildings lining side by side. Each KODE had slightly different openning hours. We completed in 3 hours because we spent so little time in some KODE buildings due to our interest. I learned more on",
          "Guided tours in English are well worth the 50kr pp cost. Most if not all of the displays are labelled in English.",

          "For the culture portion of our Bergen tour, we opted for the KODE art museums near our hotel. It is located in four interesting and grand buildings of different architectural styles and eras along the southern shore of the lovely Lille Lungg\u00e5rdsvannet (lake park). As a",

          "For a single ticket, you can visit the 4 Kode museums. They feature Norwegian artists, notably Edvard Munch, but it's wonderful to discover other, less well known artists. Their collection of modern art is small but very rich, especially in works by Picasso. The museums are set",

          "We enjoyed the Norwegian painters and some of the modern pieces. In addition to paintings there were some very good pieces of furniture and music instruments spread around amongst the paintings.",
          "This art museum is so big that it\u2019s 4 buildings. We visited buildings 2 and 4 and enjoyed them both. Building 2 has a great exhibit by JC Dahl of lovely Norwegian landscape paintings from the 1800\u2019s that introduced many to the beauty of the country and spurred tourism here. We",
          "This art museum is spread among 4 buildings facing the municipal park and lake. Best is the Rasmus Meyer museum. The decorative arts building was closed for our June visit and only silver was on display",
          "Part of the KODE 4 where we went had a nice collection of paintings from 1500-now. There is a special section devoted to kids creativity, which involved crying for our daughter to leave after 1,5 hour. Excellent for when it is raining...",
          "One pass gets you into all 4 museums. I can't remember which is what but each museum specializes in something different. One of them house Munch's works. This can easily take a few hours.",

          "Coming from a USA centric experience, I was delighted to discover here a trove of Norwegian master artists of the outdoors / landscapes who do not garner adequate exposure elsewhere (IMO). These museums are adjacent to a couple of extremely well designed parks that are",
          "A lovely house built by Rasmus Meier to house his collection of art including the biggest of Edvard Munch. A most interesting gallery and some beautiful paintings including a section of portraits. In kode 2 a nice shop and caf\u00e9. Well worth it.",
          "This is a set of museums with a combined entry fee. Worth doing at least some of them. The painting exhibits are a good complement to the National Museum in Oslo, including a rather different perspective on Munch.",
          "I visited KODE 3 (which opens an hour earlier than the others) and KODE 4 before the weather again turned beautiful. You will see a lot of lovely Norwegian and Nordic art. But there are also art from the old Dutch masters to Picasso and other contemporary. You notice that",
          "I love visiting galleries in the places I travel; it's one of my favourite things to do. This said, the Kode galleries were the most boring art galleries I have ever been to! I understand that we visited during off-season in Norway, but this isn't really an excuse for a national",
          "These are great art museums to see and they exceeded my expectatons. There is plenty of art of Munch and Dahl as well as numerous other famous Norwegian artists. The museums are most interesting and very well presented. The nearby lake adds to the overall beauty of the area.",
          "We visited Kode museum during our recent Bergen trip in early April. This has 4 separate buildings each housing different theme. The location is beautiful next to a pond, which was partly frozen. The scenic beauty in winter is surreal. The mountain in the distance was clad in",
          "Kode offers a variety of different exhibitions located in the four main buildings. You get the chance to experience Norwegian art and get to know Norwegian artists through their paintings. Take your time and enjoy the walk around, it takes a while but it is worth!",
          "Since the musem is free for children, it isn't too expensive to come several times. There is soo much art that I wouldn't suggest seeing everything in one go. Everything is clean and spacious. A good place to go during a rainy afternoon.",
          "I love art and have visited a number of art museums around the world. There are 4 separate buildings so you can choose what interests you. Although the buildings are big, some of the collections are large whereas others are small. We visited two of the museums out of four.",
          "Representative, nice collection from the Golden Age Norwegian and some Dutch painters and interesting glass/metal sculptures, presented in 4 buildings on the coast of a lovely lake, pleasant walk between galleries. Well worth the time you can carve out of your visit to Bergen.",
          "The museum consist of 4 galleries all with a different emphasis. Kode 4 contains the Rasmus Meyer Collection, including a selection of Edvard Munch works. We were fortunate to have a sensitive guide who took us through the gallery and gently highlighted works and Munch\u2019s",
          "Saw the paintings in Kode 3 and 4. Very worthwile. Some beauties from Norway but also international artwork like Picasso. No huge amounts. Norwegian works not famous but really attractive.",
          "During our short stay in Bergen we visited 2 of the 4 KODE museums. Each of the four buildings are separate and architecturally different. All are adjacent to Lille Lungegard Lake. KODE 2 contains temporary exhibits. We were fortunate to see a collection of paintings, drawings",
          "Spent the most brilliant 4 hours taking our time walking around the 4 buildings. You definitely get what you pay for!! The collections are fascinating and well worth the visit!",
          "There are four museums in a row, each of which are genuine treats for the senses. A multi-venue ticket is recommended as each museum has its own character. At least , visit the Munch collection (Kode 3) and discover that there is so much more to the artist that the",
          "I didn't know before visiting this museum that there are pieces by Van Gogh and Picasso curated here. Some of the Edvard Munch pieces are unique and have been donated by a collector who purchased them directly from the artist when Edvard was not yet famous. Be aware that your",

          "The ticket is valid for two days. Kode 3 and 4 have arguably the most important Norwegian paintings in the world - those by JC Dahl, Nikolai Astrup, Munch, etc. The galleries are not huge (don't think Louvre), so you can focus on arts from a particular period and region, slowly",
          "The Munch and avant-garde exhibits are especially unique and well curated. Really enjoyed my visit. Great location in the center city.",
          "The price of admission includes several museums all located right next to each other. Well worth a visit.",
          "There are three museums side by side. We visited all three... we were lucky enough to find a very knowledgeable guide to the Munch's, who gave us an insight into the life of this fascinating man. In Kode 1 there was more fascinating paintings , including an exhibition of the",
          "The architecture is interesting and so are the the art. The good thing is, that you buy one ticket for the full collection which is spread in 4 buildings. Each has their won personality which fit he era of the shown art. I would like to go back and spend more time there",
          "We only saw the Munch exhibition, but it was a pleasure. Signage in English available. We spent approx. 45 min walking through the building. Most time on Munch, shorter time on the other paintings. We enjoyed it.",
          "We arrived at the airport at 10:30am, check-in at airbnb was at 4, 5+ hours of toting luggage in the rain didn't appeal. We got off the Flybussen right in front of Kode 1, went in and found they had luggage size lockers!!! Locked our stuff up and enjoyed the silver exhibit - not",
          "Some of the best art museums of Bergen are locatetd along the side of the little pond in the city. one ticket gives access to all of them. Among other artists they show a wide range of mainly norwegian artists of the 19th century. Don't miss the Edward Munch paintings though at",
          "Good collection of Munch works. The rest of the stuff in this fairly small museum is just OK. Better Munch works on display at the dedicated Munch museum a little further away.",
          "I only visited Koda 3. It is a small museum and very doable. I was disappoint to find out the Edvard Munch sketch of the Scream, wasn't there, but I enjoyed the rest of the artwork. There is a place to put your bags and jackets, which I was thrilled to hear. The staff is very",

          "Bergen is a rainy city, so the KODE offers a great indoors activity. Admission is 100 NOK. This gets you into all 4 buildings. There is lots of great Norwegian art, including several works by Edvard Munch. There is also art by Queen Sonia of Norway. The KODE is located in a",
          "For one price you can see all museums. We started with #3 and it was fabulous, a large number of Munch and Dahl were the main artists. Went to #4 and it too was great, a good number if Picasso with a few more Munch. Great works of art in #3 & 4. Then we went to one, not so",
          "Visited last week with my husband. Art is not a particular interest for us, but we were blown away by the works of Munch, Dahl and a couple of others (Isaacson, maybe?) A wonderful place to spend half a day (or more) if you're on a visit to Bergen. However, don't expect it to be",
          "We only had time for one of the KODE's while in Bergen and chose this one to see the Munch, which was great. We also enjoyed a display of Norwegian painters, which included excellent descriptions of the different periods of art history. Our 11 and 13 year old enjoyed it. Would",

          "We visited both Kode 3 and 4 in an afternoon and thoroughly enjoyed the visit. There was some wonderful Norwegian art housed in the art museum including Munch, Dahl and Astrup. There are also several Picasso's in the collection. Unfortunately the English tour was booked out, so",
          "The collection of Norwegian art is interesting and I would wholeheartedly recommend the guided tour in English of the Munch paintings - our guide was very knowledgable and enthusiastic.",
          "Although there are lots of buildings, the art collection is not on par with other European art museums. The only area I enjoyed was the Munch paintings. The rooms are all very pleasant and painted in nice colors. There are lovely shops and cafes in each building. Nice for a",
          "The four KODE Art Museums of Bergen are all conveniently located next to each other alongside Byparken, the Central Park of Bergen; they host special exhibitions, some of which can be very interesting, such as the one I saw of the art of Edvard Munch, Norway's most famous",

          "We didn't know much about Nikolai Astrup before entering the museum. We knew a little more about Edvard Munch, but this was also limited. Given our limited knowledge, we decided to book in for the tours of each exhibit. The Astrup tour was amazingly informative with our guide",
          "We went to KODE specifically to see the Edvard Munch exhibit. It was very well done, and I liked the way it explained his history and how that played into his development as an artist. The exhibit allows the viewer to see into how his art changed over time. We also saw the",
          "On a rainy day we went to the Kode Art Museum to see the Munch Exhibit - the museum was very nice and focused on Norwegian artists. It took about 2 hours to go through. We took the free guided tour of the Munch exhibit which was very nice and very worthwhile",

          "Whilst I always enjoy a new gallery, my teenagers thought it was 'boring'. We went to Kode 3 and had the English tour with a lovely lady. The tour of Munich's work was excellent - she clearly knew is work. To improve this gallery it would be useful to have a list of artists",
          "We only visited one of the museum because of time.. we saw the one that has a large collection of Munch paintings in it. There is not a copy of 'The Scream' at this museum.",
          "We really enjoyed our trip to 2 of the 4 Kode museums. The Munch section was definitely worth a visit!",
          "If Bergen is Norway's second city, what must Oslo be like? The answer is a poor imitation. Bergen's collection of museums, each with a different focus, along a pleasant lake in the city centre, is unmatched for learning, experience and convenience by any city I've been to.",
          "Good value for the price - ticket good for 2 days to all 4 museums. You can easily see everything in one day, as the museums are small.",
          "Discovered this wonderful museum on our last day with way too little time. Could only visit one of the 4 buildings. Must do for art lovers.",
          "The Kode Gallery is 4 separate galleries with one entrance fee and a great cafe and shop. There is a wonderful collection of international art and some great Munch with a guided tour in English if you want. It's well worth spending time here.",
          "Apparently all the KODE museums have been so called to make them into one entity - each offers different art, collectibles etc . We chose the one that was showing Queen Sonja's own exhibition of her special printing style which was very interesting. We asl saw an amazing",
          "These Galleries are well worth visiting and give a fascinating insight into the history of Norwegian art and one can appreciate how it relates to their culture and environment.",
          "We visited 3 of the 4 museums as one was closed. The first contains exquisitely crafted silver works, ceramics and other objects, etc. We especially enjoyed seeing Queen Sonja's artwork which was on display. Some exceptionally lovely prints as well as huge vases. The other two",
          "Many of us think of fiords and Bryggen storefronts when going to Bergen, but the Kode Art Museum is definitely a must. Divided into four buildings, Kode 4 not only has a great exhibition of modern art on its top floor, but on the first one also houses an interactive art space",
          "We arrived in Bergen at the end of June in the rain! Not unexpected but limiting. However the tourist office pointed us to the four different buildings which make up the magnificent Kode Art Museums. We covered three of them and had a coffee in the fourth which was otherwise",
          "Loved Kode 4, especially the guided tour of the Astrup exhibition. We found the art and craft museum a bit lightweight and left disappointed. The Munch exhibition on Kode 3 was really good. Kode is situated fairly centrally snd overlooks a lovely park. It 8s near the railway",
          "I enjoyed Kode 4 the best. Appreciated the free tours of 2 different artists. Decent price for all that you can see. I spent just over 2 hours and could have stayed longer. Good location. Nice little lake in front of the area.",
          "The Kode museum spans four different buildings. We went to the Munch exhibition in building 3 which was really interesting. It was great that some of the other artists' works depicted views of Bergen from long ago so it was very interesting to compare them to present day. The",

          "The KODE is 4 different buildings each with a theme. One is closed, so there are 3 really. The # 1 is the most eclectic one, mostly paintings, old art and newer stuff. A good mix and well presented, but nothing to really stand out as an activity. Rainy-day excellent choice, it",
          "KODE 4 is the art museum designed especially for children. There's art display, play room, drawing room, and an activity room where children can create an artwork using beads, wires, and laces. Our little ones loved this place and could spend hours here. The staffs were all very",
          "Took advantage of a very rainy Sunday to visit the art museums. Went on a guided tour of some of Edvard Munch's most important works, NOT including The Scream. This man really should be better known for his other work, which was helpfully divided here into 3 different periods.",
          "Clustered together close to a park are the KODE museums. A single ticket gives you entry to all so it is worth spending half a day there to see everything from several Picassos to the work of Danish artists.",
          "Oh my! Incredible artwork. I could have spent a lot more time there. I would like to have had a tour guide.",
          "KODE has 4 buildings,each architecturally different and each with different collections. One was closed when last visited, but the three that were open were all good.",
          "This four building museum is better than the national gallery, I would argue. Better collection of Munch paintings, and I especially enjoyed the Astrup exhibit. It is situated along the beautiful park and is included in the Bergen card. If you have children be sure to visit the",
          "KODE is as small as Bergen, although one can find interesting exhibitions from time to time. Museum has a variety of artists to choose from (most of the exhibitions changes periodically) and one (i believe) exhibition about Norwegian art that is always open.",
          "You have to go to all the Kodes if you have even the slightest interest in art and/history They are all beautiful. Plan for a minimum of 1 hour in each and there are 4",
          "Although there are some remarkable works exhibited in this location, the buildings themselves do not invite enthusiasm as they appear drab. One building was closed for maintenance while we were there. There are several buildings ringing one side of a pretty fountain and man made",
          "This is a great art museum for Bergen but it's not quite as good as the National Gallery in Oslo. It has some Munch on display and also a good range of other historical art but there's nothing that is of huge note to see. It's spread out over 3 buildings. They say it's spread",
          "My wife and I bought a Bergen Card which allowed us to go into some very interesting art galleries and museums quite cheaply. I really enjoyed looking at the different styles of art and thought the Astrup exhibition was fantastic- I really liked his use of colour and his subject",
          "The art gallery is a gem. A great collection of Munch's paintings especially from his social paintings period. A very good modernist collection with Picasso and Klee and Niro and the Kobra group and an interesting collection of Norwegian landscape paintings. The earlier",
          "Paying for museum admission entitles you to enter all four Kode museums for 2 days. What a bargain! The location along the park and lake is beautiful, with a great view of the mountain beyond. Area is close to city center and literally next to the main performance hall and the",
          "Although two of the four buildings of the museum were closed for renovations, visiting the other two buildings can be a nice experience for art lovers with artworks of Munch, Picasso, Astrup, and contemporary art as well. With Bergen card the visit was free.",
          "Although Bergen is Norways second biggest city and cultural hub of the west coast this museum doesn't quite hit it out of the park. First is the fact that two of the four Kode buildings are closed. second is the number of dull and poorly explained furniture and decorative",
          "We didn't know about this museum and nearly missed it when we stopped in Bergen for a fjord tour. What a shame that would have been! Although two of the four buildings that comprise the museum are closed for renovations, the one of greatest interest to all fans of Edvard Munch",
          "We really enjoyed looking around the different KODE museums as there was different types of art from beautiful paintings to contemporary designs. It's worth having a walk around the lake outside as well whilst you are there as there are lovely views of the mountains and Bergen",
          "This is a fantastic collection of great paintings by Edvard Munch and other Norwegian masters you will be so pleased to have experienced. A place to not miss on a trip to Bergen. The buildings of the Kode Museum are in a lovely park.",
          "We paid 100NOK to enter which gives you access to the 4 gallery buildings which can be used over 2 days. Firstly, only 2 of the 4 buildings were open and actually those closed would probably have been the more interesting ones for tourists who aren't necessarily art experts. The",
          "I really enjoyed my time at the KODE art museums. There were some big names, but most impressive were the collections of Norwegian artists. I hadn't heard of most of them and it was really nice to see something different.",
          "There is a wide choice of things to look at in these impressive institutions. Munch is always there and also contemporary shows.",
          "KODE 1 & 2 are closed but 3 & 4 is enough to make the entrance fees worth it! Checked out Picasso and Munch's works. Of cos there are many other artists paintings as well. Expect to spend at least 3-4 hrs to really enjoy the intriguing works.",
          "There are a number of Kode buildings, each with different art inside. We found some things of interest in each building that interested us, spent the whole morning in them.",
          "A great collection of Art Galleries and Museums (9 in total). A good opportunity to explore Norwegian and Bergen local art and culture - good coffee shop (disappointed in the range on offer in the shop in Kode 2?)",

          "The themes vary from period to period, so it makes sense to check their websites to see whether there are any specail exhibitions if you plan to visit. I would recommend the Norwegian historical paintings, but there are many worthwhile items to look at. Recommended!",
          "Reasonable price for Norway, I guess. We visited only building no. 3 for the Edvard Munch collection but were disappointed as none of the well known pieces were there. Remaining art average at best.",
          "Really informative and rich in interesting collections of Norwegian visual arts, including some wonderful works of their very own national painter Edvard Munch... Kode is made up of a complex of buildings (four, if I remember correctly), so you need to take your time to visit",
          "Came here to kill some time whilst visiting Bergen. They had the Edvard Munch collection here at the time. Free to enter with some great examples of his work.",
          "The entire museum was wonderful, but the Edvard Munch collection was illuminating. It is the 2nd largest collection of his works, from early in his career to late in life.",
          "some nice collections of norwegian painters, and quite centrally located too, however, if you want to see the best Norwegian art, you really have to travel to Oslo where most of it is housed, as you would expect. Some respite from the rain, however.",
          "There are four buildings in total, included in the one ticket. You could spend a whole day going through these exhibitions. LOTS of art. A long slog if you're not really into art, but otehrwise really great.",
          "My expectations were not the highest, as this was a small museum in the second city in a small country. Shame on me! All museums are a mixed bag, but this one has one world class gems in its collection. The three highlights were, 1. Munch - there were a good number of these",
          "I went there to see Edvard Munch, an author of the famous \"The Scream\" painting. Surprisingly there was a few more very intersting paintings of him, and a lot more totally new to me. The biggest surprise was to discover some other Norwegian painters with the most impressive",
          "We just happened to drop by and loved the emphasis on Norwegian painting in Building 3. We really wanted to see some Munch on our visit to Norway and Kode has a beautiful selection of his works.",
          "We went to museum 3 which has Munch and other Norwegian artists incl J.C. Dahl, Hans Gude, Christian Krohg, Harriet Backer. Loved the cloud pictures.",
          "We waited until later in the day to go to the art museums. There were three out of four buildings open. We did not give ourselves enough time to go through them all. My husband's backpack did not fit in the available lockers in the first museum so we decided we would hit that",
          "Had the opportunity to spend Sunday afternoon visiting the three buildings KODE museums. Is full of beautiful Norwegian art! From Munch to Astrup as well as Picasso, among others. Also, has a children area to play and also create their own art. If you are short in time I would",

          "We missed the Nikolai Astrup exhibition in Dulwich so keen to see some of his works in Bergen. Excellent exhibition. Quite busy but the pictures were easy to see and a very enjoyable activity for a wet afternoon . Lots of good quality souvenirs in shop. Also excellent light",
          "Every city we visit, we try to find the museums and galleries; they're some of our favourite places to visit. Bergen isn't a large city, but it's full of history, and the Kode Art Museums reflect some of the best in local and international art. There are four buildings, of",
          "Several buildings that provide an excellent overview of Norwegian art. Helpful tags in Norwegian and English to put most of the art into historical perspective and make more interesting. Worth the time during a visit.",
          "We found the organisation of this museum rather difficult as it is located in Koln 2/3/4. Essentially what you need are numbers 3 and 4 where you will find Munch, Klee and others right up to current work. There is a good deal of contemporary Norwegian art. It is the quality of",
          "There are 4 buildings that house many different art exhibits. We only had time for one building containing the work of Munch and his contemporaries. We found this to be very worthwhile.",
          "I was somewhat overstimulated by this art museum! It houses some of Norway's most famous paintings, but it also caters for a bit of everything; neoclassical masterpieces followed by a modern exhibit gone bananas. Truly exceptional. And the staff were very helpful indeed - the",
          "Our first port stop was Bergen and since there was a light rain it seemed prudent to visit the museum which was a 15 min walk from the ship. We were delightfully surprised to find a wonderful collection of paintings by Norwegian artists. Of course we were already familiar with E",
          "Spread over 4 buildings (only three were open), this is a fine Art Gallery which features Munch and Norwegian Art. The old paintings of life in Norway were our highlights.",
          "I was disappointed in the galleries although I did see paintings by Munch which I had not seen before however there appeared to be a few duplicates of ones I had seen in Oslo art gallery. I would not rush back. Oslo museums offer half price for seniors Bergen doesn't, poor show.",
          "This is a great art museum, spread out over 4 buildings. We especially enjoyed the Astrup exhibit in KODE 1 and the kids' wing. There's a good collection of Munch as well.",
          "If you are intrigued by Munch paintings and drawings, an excellent opportunity to take a free docent led tour. A nice selection of paintings as well as some drawings (the Scream) representing his career. The docent led tours were at noon and 2 PM. Cafe closes earlier in the",
          "For 100NOK, you get a ticket to all three museums. This is a tremendous bargain. The fourth museum is closed for renovation. Subjects range from ancient religious art, to Norwegian, to modern and op art, and to one devoted to furniture and antiques. Very well conceived",
          "We took 2 days to look at the artwork in the museums and did not see all of it. Artwork and displays are beautiful and you may take photographs.",
          "The Kode art museum is certainly one of the highlights of Bergen. Although its most famous painter, Edvard Munch of \"The Scream\" is on display, here you will find some of his lesser known paintings. The museum provides guided tours in English every day and the 30 minute tour",
          "Come in summer and enjoy the free guided tour to Munch's paintings, very informative! It's at 12 and 2 pm every day but check the website.",
          "Four museums, one entrance fee good for two days. Large bags or backpacks must be stored in lockers (free). Excellent cafe (I ate the best ever salad there two days in a row). Each building has its own gift shop. Lots of benches to sit on in front of the paintings. Kode 1 was",
          "The 4 Kode buildings all look out on to a pleasant city park with flower borders, lawns and a fountain, but the one not to miss is Kode 3, that contains the Rasmus Meyer collection, donated to the city in 1924. Probably the collection that contains the best examples of the work",
          "An interesting display worthy of some time if you are interested in art. Not outstanding but has some nice paintings.",
          "KunstLab is gallery for kids - they can climb, crawl and explore the installtions. There is also a room full of crafting supplies - paper, glue, etc where children can create their own art objects. Even our 4-year old was intensely focusing on the job :)",
          "On a rainy cold day we visited this museum it was very interesting especially the contemporary art exhibition , and of course they have a lot of paintings by Munch.",
          "The KODE has lots of great landscape paintings showing off the beautiful of Norway. There are some nice portraits, Munch works, etc. But it's the landscapes that stay with me.",
          "Great set of museums which are well displayed. One does not need to know much about art to say if they like it or not. I got to learn about Romanticism and Norwegians masters paintings , trends and come out more convinced, I am slowly learning about art like one reading various",
          "One can visit both Kode3 where the Munch pairings complete the Norwegian art history and Kode2 which is a modern art museum. Between them is the Kunstehalle which has a pleasant less utilised cafe restaurant. It shows contemporary art - also hard. So with the Bergen card you get",
          "The Kode Museums were the first stops we made on a rainy day in Bergen. Art is very beautifully displayed. Especially loved the Dahl and Munch pieces.",
          "Once you get your head around the fact that KODE is the collective name for all of the art museums clustered on the side of the main lake in Bergen and then understand that Kunst Lab is the dedicated Kids museum then you're on to a winner. At lease 90 mins of hands on fun and",
          "Pleasant enough with a limited number of Munch works. Lots of J.C. Dahl paintings. Tickets are good for two days so you can break up your visit.",
          "Just had a fantastic meal at Kode 2. Cowboy meal and veggie eggs benedict both really tasty. Cowboy meal was eggs, ham, cheese, tomatoes on a panini and was so tasty.",
          "decent regional collection; a handful of good Munch works (prints and paintings) and one major Munch painting.",
          "The restaurant has a good selection of dishes reasibabkt sized for a lunch. Hubby shops around and always has something different, I always have the poached eggs on an english muffin. Perfect size meal for me at lunchtime with a slim dinner ahead.....well he does often choose",
          "We enjoyed walking through all 3 open KODE Museums. Beautiful collections, lovely galleries, welcoming staff.",
          "The museum comprises 4 buildings. Too bad they are not connected. Building 1 was closed when we were there. Wide range of art in the collection.",
          "These museums are only of average quality. There just isn't that much to see in them. The Munch collection is pretty small--if you like Munch, go to the Munch Museum in Oslo.",
          "We toured 2 of the 3 open museums (one was closed). We took the guided tour of the Munch exhibit. Neither of the museums were overwhelming and we enjoyed both. One price gets you in to all of the museums over a 2 day period.",
          "We spent a Sunday afternoon here, having had lunch in the cafe. Each museum is different, and full of surprises. One has a set route to follow, but that's good for keeping people spaced apart. We were delighted to find that one ticket covers all the museums - the fourth is",
          "Lovely and manageably sized museum, known mostly for the Munchs, but also with a fantastic collection of Norwegian 19th and 20th century paintings, which I found generally wonderful. Even on a summer day, it was not particularly crowded, and at least one of the guards had taught",
          "We visited while Kode 1 was closed for renovation, which is a shame because it's the museum we wanted to see the most. The others have plenty of nice art, though, and there is a lot to see. We especially enjoyed Kode 3 and 4, which had more contemporary art. The modern exhibits",
          "No trip to Norway is really complete without looking into the work of Edward Munch; most famous in America for his painting The Scream, but really an artist with much more depth than this, now, pop culture icon suggests. The KODE, Building 3, has a very good collection of Munch",
          "We visited buildings 3 and 4. Munch's collection is excellent and we were lucky to see it without any crowds before visiting the National Gallery in Oslo. We got a better understanding and appreciation of this great artist. In additional we learned about some other very good",
          "This review is about Rasmus Meyer's Samlinger only. While the main interest would be the works of Edvard Munch (giving an interesting perspective to how he developed as an artist), the works of I.C. Dahl and other artists less known outside of Norway are amongst the cornerstones",
          "Enjoyed several hours here. The hourly tour in English was really great. The restaurant wasn't open when I visited but understand from locals it is quite good. Munch exhibition is worthwhile",
          "It is located in 4 b A variety of modern and old art. 4 buildings (one was closed) Learned a lot about Norwegian visual culture. You can use the ticket for two days (if you stay ther).",
          "The Munch exhibit takes you through the many phases of his art. The famous \"Scream\" is in Oslo, which is probably the reason the cruise ship tours don't visit...thus the museum is not crowded and a pleasant experience.",
          "It's great that there is 4 art galleries on one street ranging from 17/18th century to avant- garde. The best thing has to be the munch tour of kode3. It's about 40mins and about 4 rooms of the first floor.",
          "I am a bad art gallery go-er but enjoyed 2 of the 4 KODE galleries. KODE 3 has great works of Norwegian artists including a very good Edvard Munch exhibit. The 30 minute tour is very helpful too. KODE 4 has a good variety and I enjoyed the Astrup section. KODE 1 is currently",
          "We didn't stay long (we had to get to another thing we'd planned), but what we saw was good. I just wish they stayed open a bit later so we could have seen more. They closed pretty early (5pm, I think).",
          "It's worth getting Bergen card so you can visit all Kode Art Museum. I believe there are four different buildings--Lysveket, Rasmus Meyer, Stenersen, Permanenton.",
          "This is a wonderful art museum in four buildings. Northern European art of the late 19th and early 20th century is superb.",
          "Bergen has several art museums and galleries all well worth a visit. Most are centrally placed and within wasy walking distance of each other.",
          "The girlfriend and I walked in KODE 1 at around 430 (closes at 5). The girl at admission thoughtfully told us that it we only had 1/2 hour to walk around then we should check out the Munch collection in KODE 3. I'm very grateful she did. KODE 3 was decorated very interestingly-I",
          "This complex of different galleries covers a wide range of periods and styles - there is something for everybody and (obviously) a decent selection of paintings by Edvard Munch",
          "I wish that the KODE 1 had been open while we were in town, but unfortunately it was closed for refurbishment. It didn't matter because we really enjoyed our time in the other three buildings. The paintings are arranged in a setting that allows you to enjoy everything without",
          "Absolutely amazing. If you have the chance please take time and enjoy the museum. There are 4 buildings and with a pass you can enjoy the museum at your leisure. A ticket is good for two days. My wife and I spent the better part of a rainy day walking the halls and enjoying",
          "Huge variety, with the 4 buildings you could easily spend the whole days in there. After seeing the national gallery in Oslo and the munch museum, I would say the Rasmus Meyers collection actually had the best munch selection, ranging across his career. Also a fantastic amount",
          "When we bought our tickets, the woman said don't just rush to the Munch and it was great advice. Seeing the other wonderful Norwegian artists introduced us to some terrific artists and also helped us appreciate Munch.",
          "We visited the Munch exhibit and were able to catch most of an English language tour by a docent. I wish that the tour had included discussion of more of the paintings by Munch, because it was fascinating to hear about the more famous ones. And it made us want to go to Oslo to",
          "I couldn't stop myself. Bergen is a very calm city (Don't stay more than two nights). I study art history so I made time to come here two days in a row. It is very fun. I spent all afternoon. Getting there is very easy and I suggest you stop by the plaza in front of the museum.",
          "KODE is comprised of 4 galleries along the edge of the park. The entry fee at our time of visiting was KR100 per adult, which gets you into all three open galleries for two days. KODE 1 containing the silver and porcelain collection is currently closed for refurbishment.",
          "Normally I am not a super fan for Art Museums since I usually could not understand the so called drawings. I visited KODE just because that I had no place to go when it rained and it was near. To my surprise, the drawings about the Norway nature got my interests and",
          "Lovely little museum, and definitely worth it for the Munch alone. Close to central downtown area. Good on a rainy afternoon.",
          "I was not planning on visiting KODE but lived across the street from it so decided to pop in before heading to the hills :). There are 4 buildings, one was closed. The expositions are not very big, Munch is great, I also enjoyed Astrup. There were other Norwegian painters -",
          "Beautiful museum with a fantastic Munch exhibit. I really loved this museum. The gift shop was really fun to peruse as well.",
          "They have so many paintings here by Munch I was in 7th heaven. Fantastic museum, several buildings but we only had time to look round the main one centred round the Norwegian high lights.",
          "Saw works I have never before seen. Enjoyed seizing the evolution of Munch and Dahl. Very informative.",
          "An extensive art collection within a historic building allows you to learn and enjoy the surroundings. The one ticket will allow you to visit all 4 KODE buildings for 48 hours.",
          "Was quite excited about visiting Kode for the Munch exhibition which was wonderful, wven though there is only a sketch of The Scream. I really enjoyed the very informative guided tour which focused on several key paintings and gave context to the whole exhibition. Also",
          "I toured 3 different buildings that are part of the KODE Art Museum. I enjoyed it very much. There are a lot of beautiful works found here. The museum is across the way from one of the most beautiful parks and small lake in the town of Bergen.",
          "When viewed across the lake Kode 2,3 and 4 are singularly uninspiring ... 1930s factories spring to mind. Please grow the lakeside trees to hide them! It's worth going in, though, if only to see the Munch collection (Kode 3). There are only a couple of rooms but they offer a",
          "We have seen only Kode 3 and 4 but that's quite enough to be amased. It was not easy to stop taking photos. You can get aquainted with the Norwegian art of XIX century: Askevold, Isaachsen, Tidemand, Heyerdahl, etc. The collection of Munch drawings, lithographs, woodcuts,",
          "It was suggested that this would be a good activity for a rainy day, and it was ... for the most part. The downside of coming here on a rainy day is that the collection is spread between four buildings and they are not conected by any water-repellant means. For starters, I had",
          "We visited all three open KODE, 2-4. It's a great place for art lovers or people hiding from the rain, you might accidentally stumble on something fascinating. I liked a lot their collection of Picasso paintings as well as of the local Nicolai Astrup and Munch works. All KODE",
          "Went for the Munch more than anything else.Glad to say that I was not let down with what was on show. There was also some great art by more Norwegian artist on show,good enough to investigate more in the coming weeks. For 100NK this gets you into buildings 2,3,and 4. I myself",
          "Of course we went for the Munch, but were pleasantly surprised by the well curated and explained exhibits showcasing the development of fine art in Norway and the interaction of this development with the rest of Europe. Throughout the museum, excellent informative commentary",
          "Offers a lot of different exhibition and a good mix of both Norwegian and international artists. I strongly recommend to join one of their tours presenting the exhibitions. Good museum shop and cafe in the restaurant.",
          "This is one of the most fabulous part of Bergen. One square has the entire bank of the museums! We bought a Bergen card and thank goodness for that. All entries were free. We went primarily for the Munch exhibits but ended up with a fabulous history and art lesson on Norway's",
          "Four art galleries all close together and you can visit three on one ticket. Ranging from classical to contemporary but each a showcase of Norway in the art world.",
          "The museums are divided into different sections/categories, and depending on your taste some are more interesting than others - I can't add much more than others who have already commented here, but entry is good value and the cafe does some delicious open sandwiches! The shop",
          "The Kode is housed in 4 buildings, of which 1 is closed this year for renovations. I went to buildings 3 & 4 which hold the older painting, scupture, furniture and some china. They have a few Picaso and similar, plus many Norwegian artists whoes work is worth viewing.",
          "You will need around an hour and a bit to see art in each building. There are 4 building here but Kode 1 is being renovated. There were so much to see at Kode, so it is a great place to visit whether it's a rainy day or not.",
          "KODE is the largest art institution in Bergen. There is permanent installations of Edward Munch and Nikolai Astrup and other famous painters. They are also very innovative. A must in Bergen. Have a good time.",
          "We were virtually the only visitors in KODE when we dropped in on a drizzly March afternoon so were able to get up close to the fantastic art on display. The highlight was the work of Munch, including a sketch of his famous piece The Scream. We were less impressed with the",
          "Incredible collection across 3 large buildings. Definitely take a look. Closes at 4 pm and you'll need at least 2 hours to breeze through it all.",
          "KODE is made up of several museums, one fee gets you access to all of them. Each building specializes in particular periods, if something doesn't suit your taste move onto the next. Great E. Munch collection.",
          "If you have time while in Bergen, and an interest in Norwegian art, this collection of galleries is certainly worth visiting. Everything from Romantic style landscapes with some stunning paintings through to Avant Garde and Munch in between.",
          "What a great complex of museums even with one of the four closed for renovation when we went. We saw 2 of the museums and ran out of time so they let us return the next day on the same ticket to see the third. The split between them was good and they are well thought out as",
          "We liked building 4 the most with Munch, Picasso and other heavyweights. Building 1 was closed during our visit. Building 2 was contemporary art that we had no use for. 3 was a bit more eclectic with period pieces, but worth a look.",
          "You might be tempted to run straight to KODE 3 to see Munch, but spend time in all galleries. This really is a fantastically accessible museum with a punchy little collection.",
          "Housed in 4 buildings in the centre of Bergen by the side of the lake, the KODE houses a number of collections. We were most interested in Norway's art so we headed to KODE #3 and saw a fascinating collection of various artists, with Munch being our favourite. It is fascinating",
          "What a find! Our 6 year old had an amazing day out there (with us!) yesterday. So many things to see, the children's gallery was interactive and interesting. Staff were brilliant. A truly wonderful experience, thank you!",
          "The fee for this museum is very small and has a lot of wonderful art. It is attached to other wonderful exhibits. Worth a visit while in Bergen",
          "The Munch\u00b4s early years are shiny, comparable with french impressionists in Orsay. But as you go further, the oils are darker and darker ... till the death.",
          "Kode4 Art Gallery has few buildings. They are not big, but you can appreciate nice paintings. It is worth to visit.",
          "Absolutely worth a visit if paintings is of interest! Women in three phases is worth the trip by it self",
          "I had a Bergen Card which gave me access to Kode 2, 3 and 4 for free (Kode 1 is closed at the time of writing), so I visited them over two days. The 3 buildings house a fascinating variety of mainly Norwegian art including works from the 1800's through to very contemporary art.",
          "Small by English standards, but quiet and some great artwork on show. City centre location so definitely put this high on your list of must do's when visiting Bergen.",
          "This is a centrally located collection of art. Pieces by Munch and other well known painters. Used to be part of a private collection donated to Bergen. Situated near the pond in a building which was a mansion previously",
          "Many of the greats names from art history, surprising in this provincial gallery. Well worth a visit.",
          "To stroll around ,large collection of paintings gives you a flavour of the Art of the country .I enjoyed a drink and snack in the cafe while my friend did it in more detail.",
          "Terrific art and history of the artist Edvard Munch is included in the collection in Kode 4. From the included timeline I learned about this master's life and his view of life like scenes. Don't miss this featured artist!",
          "An interesting collection of paintings highlighting the norwegian painters from the 19th century. A unic collection",
          "this gallery surprised us with its depth and variety of Munch paintings. Seemed more than were on display at the Oslo gallery. One building was devoted to modern art and had some wonderful innovative sculptures, textiles, paintings. The cafe was lovely, excellent food, pleasant",
          "Our time was limited we attended a free exhibition one evening. If we had longer we would have bought a ticket and used it for all three buildings",
          "The Munch collection here gives you a feeling for who Munch really was, and it wasn't just The Scream. But there's also paintings by other Norwegian artists including a huge one of Winter on Loftofen by Otto Sinding in a beautiful frame of traditional design, and a room devoted",
          "We visited 3 of the 4 KODE museums. Here's the scoop on the 4 museums. #1 is closed for renovation. #2 is a contemporary art museum - don't bother if you are not into contemporary art (like recycled clothes in a pile being art). # 3 is great - with the main feature being the",
          "We went on a beautiful sunny morning (when 2 cruise ships were docked) and were shocked to see that there were only a couple people in the exhibit. It is well curated with signage in English. A nice variety to the Rasmus Meyer collection.",
          "I spent a rainy afternoon enjoying the wonderful taste of the man who amassed this collection. Some known and some unknown artists, but still very good",
          "I visited the Edward Munch exhibition and joined the guided tour. This was extremely interesting and the guide was very knowledgeable about her subject giving I sights into his personal life and loves and mentors. All the tour tides are very knowledgeable about the particular",
          "We liked the variety of paintings in Kode4 Art Gallery. They had a strong emphasis on Norwegian painters and scenery - which was very nice. They also had a section which contained the donation of a variety of artists from a single donor - including Picasso, Munch, etc. The",
          "A modern atmosphere, their own free WiFi, extensive descriptions of paitings, and one pass for three museums. KODE is worth a visit.",
          "Very nice collection and a good way to spend a rainy day. I especially liked the layout and colors - quite modern.",
          "If you visit this as part of visiting all the Kode museums it is good but I would not recommend it as a solo act. Also, 260 rainy days in Bergen so why not be inside?",
          "I visited this with my kids on a rainy day and we all enjoyed it! Children under 16 are free so it was also a reasonably low cost activity which was an added bonus!",
          "We visited the Bergen Art Museum on one of the hottest days of the summer and it was truly a Fantastic experience!! Very few people looking at superb art!! Most people were enjoying the rare sunny day I suppose. We had the museum almost to ourselves and could admire the",
          "One of the best Museum from Scandinavia, with a lot of paintings from national or abroad collection, Munch paintings are better then in Oslo",
          "The art is mostly way out there, but the themes and descriptions of the exhibits make viewing more pleasurable and informative. There was a women's fabric art exhibit when we were there in August that was most surprising and beautiful. The food and atmosphere in the cafe are",
          "Very interesting contemporary exhibits, representative of the last few decades of art in Norway, excellent caf\u00e9!",
          "Lots of interesting art, historical, comprehensive and diversified, situated at the central little lake, bang smack in the centre of Bergen.",
          "Everybody can find something interesting there. It is an amazing place worth visiting . All Kode galleries are worth visiting as one can find there an array of pieces of art.",
          "Well worth spenning a few hours in Bergen , this consists of four different galleries in the city centre , showing many forms of of art around otherwise the Norwegian artist ,E Munch and many,other World renound artists Not just for art lovers interesting for all ,",
          "In retrospect, I get the various KODEs confused, but my favorite is as I recall, KODE 3 where one finds the Rasmus Meyer Collection with what may be the most comprehensive collection of Edvard Munch--I liked these galleries even more than the Munch Museum in Oslo. The",
          "The museum is housed in four buildings, mostly grouped on one side of the square. The collection is not huge, but is beautifully presented and contains a true breadth of art from all ages. It's nit overwhelming like the big galleries in London, Paris etc..., and can be seen in",
          "A great collection of his wood cuts and some of his paintings make this a must visit for Munch followers. And, if you are not a art person, just skip it and go for a walk on the streets nearby",
          "I may have my kodes mixed up but the munch section was fantastic. In a way it has a better overview that the munch museum in Oslo. Definitely check it out.",
          "If Munch is your thing, this little gallery will offer a broader dimension to the artist. The rest are worthy but basic, some interesting pastoral scenes and rooms decorated in the era of each artist shown.",
          "Give yourself the time to read the information on the walls and to look at all the work, not just the Munch. It helps to give more of a background and a context to Munch's work AND to celebrate other work perhaps less familiar to you. We saw a bigger exhibition of Munch's work",
          "I appreciated how this museum was kind of cheap, 100 NOK, and also gave you the possibility to spread your visit over two visits. It spans over 4 buildings, KODE 1-4, with different time spans of the art and a specific children part (my favourite!). I also liked the",
          "If you like art, specially paintungs, than you are on the right place. Not a big but a very nice collection.",
          "This is a private collection with beautiful works. Bergen has the second largest Munch collection, as Meyer began very early to collect Munch's work.",
          "If you like Munch and Picasso you have yo go there. The second biggest exhibition of Munch in the world. Few masterpices of Picasso. Other paintings are also worth seeing.",
          "Kode 2, 3 & 4 are open for visit, all on one ticket. Kode 1 with applied arts is temporarily closed. The collection is lovely, featuring a full overview of Norwegian artists with focus on Munch, Astrup, Cobra, the 70ties Bergen scene and more. Right now they feature an",
          "Amazing to have visited the fjords the day before and then to see them again through the eyes of Norwegian landscape painters! Beautifully curated.",
          "We first had coffee in building 2 (good quality) and browsed in the museum shop. Then we visited building 3. On the ground floor there is classical norwegian furniture and some very nice paintings by Dahl. On the second floor there is an impressive collection of Norwegian",
          "i love museums and can spend hours gazing at painting, etc you can't see everything in one day, so ask how long the tickets are good for...",
          "Loved them all. Beautifully located along the lake area. Well organised, great variety, excellent museum shops and great exhibitions.",
          "Conveniently located in central Bergen, this museum presents a a wide variety of artists and styles. Discovered Christian Krough and Norwegian artists that captured the beauty of the region. Due to a minor physical limitation, I appreciated the courteous staff suggesting a",
          "There was great variety in this show that made us prying which gave us great dividends for the expressions exhibition wanted to present.",
          "A remarkable private collection of the works of great Norwegian painters (including Munch) now made public. Definitely worth a visit whether one is an art-fundi or not!",
          "Spread out among four buildings, this museum has a good collection of both Norwegian art -- from its masters to the present. The buildings are all clustered together so moving around from one to the next is easy. The Bergen Pass allows you into all of the museums.",
          "The Muench was particularly good, with excellent text. Ambience in the museum was great; not terribly crowded. I strongly recommend this collection, and prefer it to Oslo's Muench museum.",
          "One of the four buildings is closed in this treasure of art next to the lake. According to your taste you can try one of the three that are open and they range from Norwegian romantic right up to international contemporary. Superb collection of Munch pictures and drawings.",
          "These galleries border a lake in the central Bergen area,a variety of exhibits are presented and one ticket is good at all galleries.Strolling around the lake,enjoying the art and beautiful flowers around the lake make for a lovely few hours.",
          "Unfortunately, I had only one full day in beautiful Bergen. The Rasmus Meyer Collection in Meyer's former mansion [now Kode Museum 3] was the highlight of my visit. I loved the rooms displaying old Norwegian furniture, as well as a range of Norwegian artists. I found it",
          "I'll be honest I only popped in here because it was on my Bergen Card. Boy was I glad I did. A welcoming chap on the front desk who appeared so delighted to see me he seemed like some shipwrecked sailor set the tone. Munch, he of the Scream, is easily the best known and his",
          "This is a superb collection of the greatest Norwegian artists, well displayed and briefly, but informatively summarised in Norwegian and English in each room. Norwegians are very proud of their artists, rightly so, but probably rather too reluctant to admit the influences of",
          "Kode 3 & 4 were enjoyable. Discovered two painters we'd never heard of. Nikolai Astrup & Johan C.C. Dahl. And, of course, Munch. If you are an art museum person, this is worth a trip. With the Bergen Card, it's free.",
          "We stopped off on our tour at these galleries and had a really interesting few hours. Many interesting pictures but the Munch pictures were the gems. This a really fascinating insight to a great artist. You must visit if in Bergen.",
          "Please visit this museum if only to see the Astrup gallery. Astrup was a fantastic artist and printer who is little known outside of Norway. However his paintings are just beautiful. The only disappointment was that the gallery has not produced a book of the exhibition because",
          "We did all the museums in one day because it was raining and this was one of my favourite. The best part for me is the Munch exhibition. Like most people I was aware of 'The Scream' but was not too familiar with other paintings. This place has several rooms of Munch, displayed",
          "The most beautiful collection of Munch's paintings even better than Munch museum in Oslo. The permanent exhibition is very educational. When you leave the museum you feel like you've been to school of art!",
          "KODE museums are some of the best in the world. They have the most impressive Munch's paintings. It is also the only cheap activity you can do in Bergen. With only 100 NK you can see all the 4 museums.",
          "Of the 4 buildings this was our favorite. We are both fans of modern art so it worked well for us. If looking for Picasso head to 3rd floor.",
          "We had one day in Bergen and filled our time with a pre-planned visit to this excellent art gallery. Not only does it house an excellent display of works by Munch but many other Norwegian painters. These vary in their execution trending from the confused - while trying to find",
          "There are currently 3 out of 4 of the galleries open showing a diverse range of primarily Norwegian painters. The contemporary art was a little difficult to get my head around but the more traditional was enjoyable. Compared to other museums in Bergen it is expensive (100 NOK)",
          "The Kode art museum comprises 4 separate buildings. Building one was closed so we could not go there. I asked one of the admission staff what 'Kode' meant and he said - nothing!!!. A brand name?? Firstly we went to Kode 2 building. This was contemporary Norwegian art in 2",
          "The exhibits are well displayed, although the lighting may be a bit low and not uniform in some places. The exhibits are very good and it's incredible to see them in such historic settings. The staff are super nice and interested in answering questions about the art.",
          "You buy one ticket and that gives you access to all 4 buildings which is valid for 2 days. We only managed to get to one of them though (number 4) unfortunately. There was some nice art and exhibits in there but it wasn't the most interesting of places. There are some Munch",
          "This is a very fine Collection of Norwegian paintings - C19th and early C20th. The Munchs are stunning.",
          "Almost missed this museum and glad that I did not. One could spend a leisurely half day exploring the four buildings that make up the museum. Great decorative arts in building one, Contemporary art in building two, Edvard Munch in three and Dahl & Nikolai Astrup in four.",
          "The Kode museum comprises four buildings, more or less next to one another, beautifully located in the centre of the city, facing a little park and a lake. Each building has its own exhibition, very different from the other exhibitions. The Rasmus Meyer collection, which shows",
          "The Kode galleries occupy 4 buildings in close proximity in a splendid tree lined street with adjacent parkland. Within easy walking distance of downtown Bergen, they offer some relief from the bustle of the tourist areas and house a nice collection of Norwegian design, craft",
          "We dashed in as it was one of the last places open in the day (till 4pm off-season) so only looked round KODE 1. We did it using a Bergen card but if you have longer, 100NOK for all 4 KODE museums seems good value. I enjoyed looking at the exhibits, which ranged from",
          "It's not a big museum - just one part of the Kode Museum. But the Munch collection is more than enough to satisfy the visitor. And because it is not that sprawling, you don't get tired and overloaded as in large museums. A nice visit.",
          "I\u00b4m sorry, this is not a travellers review, only a very strong recommandation from a Bergener: KODE (Bergen Art Museum) consists of 4 museums in the centre of Bergen: KODE 1: Arts and crafts, KODE 2: Contemporary art and temporary exhibitions, KODE 3: A very good collection",
          "Something for everyone. I had to rush round but really needs to stay a week and do them over a couple of days. Bergen is a fabulously bustling place.",
          "The Art galleries are situated along the Lille Lungegardsvann - a beautiful open space with plenty of seats and gardens to sit in and admire the centre piece fountain.",
          "KODE (Bergen art museum) offers a good combination of art from Norwegian and international (Picasso being the biggest name) artists. A good place to stop if you are interested in art. Just leave enough time in your planning, as this basically consists of 4 museums and will it",
          "The 4 Kode museums are all included in one 100kr entry fee and are immediately adjacent each other. 1 is a design museum. Exhibit on Norwegian silversmithing plate and beautiful furniture were highlights. Much less so was room with ceramic plates. 2 is modern art",
          "Your ticket pays for entry into 4 related art museums, for design, modern art, Norwegian art, and one other. We loved the design museum and the Munch exhibit in the Norwegian art facility. Modern art one did not do much for us, but personal taste. The Children's Art Museum in",
          "Bergen has many rainy days, and you should spend a couple of hours in a gallery that appeals to you on one of them.",
          "If you have any extra time during your visit to Bergen, the Art Museum (KODE) is worth your time. The museum is walking distance from anywhere in Bergen and offers a nice collection of Norwegian artists. You may spend a pleasant hour or all day.",
          "Give the #3 museum at least an hour, maybe more. Great for Munch paintings.The four different buildings are confusing.",
          "Nice collection of Norwegian artists, museum not so large as to be overwhelming. Munch and Dahl were prominent. Pleasant way to spend a rainy morning.",
          "Loved the Munch, in fact the range of art on view and a rare treat - work by Asger Jorn from the Cobra movement.",
          "Still if Bergen isn't capable to compete with Oslo's galleries, you'd certainly be surprised with the collection KODE holds. Astonishing review of Astrup, Dahl and Munch (buildings 3 and 4). Worthiest museum in Bergen.",
          "For those who already have some sort of interest in art. As far as my little perception of art goes there was little a could enjoy here but I do recognize this is entirely my fault. Seeing some of munchs early work was surprising and interesting but I did not get to enjoy much",
          "If you choose the Rasmus Meyer Collection from Kode 1,2,3 or4, the Bergen Art Galleries, you have a chance to see 4 rooms of paintings by Edvard Munch. The painting of The Scream is not there but there is a good print that Munch did of the head in The Scream and several hands",
          "I don't often go to Art Galleries but I was determined to see this one because of the Munches. The Scream is very well known but I had never seen any of his work \"in the flesh\". Now I understand him much better. They have a very good collection of his paintings from early to",
          "There are 4 rooms of Edvard Munch's works here which I had not expected. We also enjoyed our introduction to the paintings of, among others, Harald Sohlberg and Erik Werensjiold who painted a portrait of Ibsen.",
          "wished there was some works by impressionists, but none to be seen. but great variety from old to new. mostly by scandinavians. lots to learn about . there are 4 buildings adjacent to each other. also called KODE museum, and includes Rasmus Meyer collection. As things go",
          "We visited tis art gallery on a one day trip to Bergen. Lovely place to spend time as there is so much different art to view. Friendly staff and a good cafe serving excellent coffee at a good price. Will defiantly visit again when next in Bergen.",
          "The KODE Museums are worth a visit for the interesting collections. If you like museums that are small to moderate size and varied as we do you will definitely enjoy the experience. We loved the silver and gold displays as well as an installation by a Finnish photographer. We",
          "Went to Kode 1 to 4 and enjoyed them all in their diversity. Shame part of it was closed but I believe it re-opened the day we left. Certainly worth a visit it to catch the wider look a Munch range.",
          "We went to all the available art museums with the Bergen card. Many of the museums had exhibits closed or in transition. Those that did, there was little to see. It's possible they are getting prepared for the summer season. I would have been more upset had I paid out of",
          "the art museums are the same world over. good if you like art. good selection of works for all tastes. well set out and not too big to overdose on it.",
          "This Museum is now Kode 1 and has an outstanding collection of Silver. It was closed on the day we were in Bergen. However, the staff kindly opened the Silver Room just for us! The silver dates from the middle ages until the present day and is a wonderful collection of the",
          "It is a bit confusing as there are four different museums/galleries under this heading. Kode 1 is a European design and decorative art museum. Lots of interesting 20thC furniture/jewellery/objects. Kode 2 has temporary exhibitions and modern art. Kode 3 has probably the widest",
          "This is a very high quality gallery which is a must-see in Bergen, and is included with free entry with the good-value Bergen Card. The gallery is actually split over four buildings along one street with each building covering different styles/periods. Each building has a",
          "I was very excited about seeing some of Munch`s work and wasn't disappointed. Fascinating to see the journey of his art. I also really liked the other works on display which I wasn't expecting to - there were some that really struck my core and I am not usually an art",
          "Bergen Art Museum, KODE - four different buildings with different scopes. I recommend visitng all of them, with the Bergen Card it's free. Munch collection was amazing, the same Astrup and Dahl. Picasso was closed in February :( i quite enjoyed the silver and public use objects",
          "If you have time I would suggest you go to this. I would love to go again and will differently get the book",
          "If you are otherwise in Bergen this museum warrants a visit. But for many it would probably not be a destination museum. It is unevenly curated. Predictably and pleasingly strong on Munch and Astrup, with some very nice 19th and 20th century French and Spanish works",
          "There is a row of Art Galleries with differing themes - all of which are interesting in their own right. There is an excellent colelction on Munch paintings and, perhpas more suprisiingly, of Picassos.",
          "This is among other things a Munch museum of world class. Do not hesitate to visit this place which will remind you of greater cities than Bergen. You will have the impresion of a monumental well presented art collection which seems hidden in a town village in the outskirts of",
          "Art from old to new with local and international artists represented and well presented. I've been twice (once on a Sunday) and both times, it waa fairly quiet - always a pleasant experience in a museum. If you're in Bergen and the rain comes down (as it's sure to) you could do",
          "The museum was in four separate modern buildings, the exhibits I wanted to see were in 3 and 4, I went into number 3 first, I was unsure if I was allowed to use my camera so left in locker with my backpack, I later noticed others using theirs, but did not wish to go back at",
          "It's a bit hard to rate this attraction as it is divided into four separate buildings with differing contents. We visited three of them, KODE 1,2 and 3. KODE 3 with the golden Norwegian painters (esp Munch) was a four rating, KODE 1 a 3 and KODE 2 just a 2 (temporary exhibitions",

          "Free entry with Bergen card. The museum buildings are by a lovely park and are small and accessible. We just looked at the late 19th/early 20th Century stuff and it was great; Picasso and Munch especially.",
          "KODE, the four buildings of the Bergen art museum, face onto a lovely park. Each building has a distinctive feel, from contemporary Norwegian art to historical Norwegian art to wonderful international modernism, as well as sections for children. We spend a rainy afternoon",
          "I enjoyed the local art here. There are a few big names to see, but it was something different for an afternoon. Some of the four sections are only allowed light for a short time each day, so check the hours before you pay the fee. Plan on spending the most time at KODE 3,",
          "If you're an art fan (or even if you're not!) this collection is well worth a visit. It's a part of the Bergen Art Museum, and apparently this collection within the museum has been recently refurbished, so it's beautifully presented. The highlight is absolutely the Munch",
          "If you can get past the ridiculous 4 hours per day opening duration (you do get a 2-day ticket by default), it's a very cool look at Norway's various painters from the 18th to the 20th centuries as well as some European artists in a separate building.",
          "Some ineresting pictures, a permenant collection on Munch, and a good audio guide. But very hard on the legs.",

          "A good selection of art from different places in Norway but there is also a nice part where General Munthes collection from China is exhibited. Due to a break in the exhibition is a little limited but the museum is worth a visit. After a reorganization the museum is a part of",
          "Good collections but contemporary lost on me but I try. More traditional stuff fine but my favourite was the design part. One admission gets you into 4 buildings and again s part of Bergen Card makes value sense.",
          "They still charged 100 NOK for entrance, but about Munch they said... \"come back later. We shall have everything in one building, then.\" Well, I guess once that happens it will be great, but what about in-between?! There were some other fine paintings on display, though.",
          "I would rate this museum five stars if I wasn't a bit confused about what was what. One of the museum buildings was closed during our visit, and I don't know whether what we saw in the other was all inclusive or not--hence my waffling. Still, there was a very interesting",
          "You get a ticket for all four museums, except that, when I went, the modern collection was closed. Some interesting exhibits, including an installation by Ai Wei Wei. However, the design museum is worth the price of the ticket alone. Good caf\u00e9s.",
          "There are 3 galleries in close proximity, the other 2 being the Rasmus Meyer which has several Munch, and the Stenersen which has temporary exhibitions and we went for a coffee. The large gallery has a ggod collection of Norwegian and other art over the centuries. We tend to",

          "The gallery collection was spread through a number of separate buildings. Sadly when we visited in the summer of 2012, the main building was closed. However the remaining gallery spaces were worth the visit-one was a deco style building and the other a modern space. The art",
          "We were disappointed with the Bergen Art Museum - several museums in a cluster, as several were no longer open and the staff of one in particular was most unhelpful and disinterested. We ended up in the Atrium after finding a place to put our coats and umbrellas ourselves",

          "This is a museum with so much to offer in classical and modern art of Norway that you could call it 'Norwegian Art in a Nutshell', to borrow from the famous 'Norway in a Nutshell' tour of the fjords and mountain passes. I especially liked the Rasmus Meyer Collection of Munch's",
          "Lots of fine Munch of course - the 'Morning Yawn' a nice antidote to 'The Scream' - but also Picassos, Danish Golden Age painting, Klee. All calmly displayed. And the B\u00f8lgen & Moi restaurant is in the same building for an excellent lunch.",

          "We liked the Norwegian art building, which provided a nice chronology of Modern local art.The other buildings were nice but not the most comprehensive collection, even compared with Oslo. On a nice day, I would stick to seeing the Norwegian nature.",
          "Not a huge museum but well worth 1 or 2 hours. NOK 100 entrance fee. Plenty of local Norwegian art which I enjoyed very much.",
          "A huge range of art, spread through several buildings; a bit difficult to find some of them. A full day is needed, and opening times were a bit limited in March. Too many exhibits were away on loan so check if you have a particular interest.",

          "Comparing the museum in Bergen to those in Oslo is probably unfair. But if you're a tourist, I'm sure youll have seen those in the capital too. The Bergen museum for us took about an hour to visit. It was really nice but wasn't as amazing as the National Gallery or Munchmuseet"

        "wiki": "Hanseatic Museum and Sch\u00f8tstuene (Det Hanseatiske Museum og Sch\u00f8tstuene) is a museum in the city of Bergen, Norway.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe main part of the museum is located in Finneg\u00e5rden, one of the conserved wooden buildings on Bryggen in Bergen, Norway. The museum covers the  Hanseatic League period of time in Bergen. The German guild of merchants had created an overseas office at Bryggen by 1360.\nDuring the following four centuries, the site consisted of assembly halls for the Hanseatic merchants. It was forbidden to use fire in the other buildings on Bryggen, hence all cooking of food took place at Sch\u00f8tstuene, for which the museum is also responsibleThe present building was put up after a fire in 1702 when most of the city centre of Bergen burned down. The museum was started in a building owned by the merchant  Johan Wilhelm Olsen  in 1872. As the collection increased, another building,  Murtasken, was constructed from a drawing by the architect Conrad Fredrik von der Lippe (1833\u20131901) . There is an authentic trading room in the museum including a merchant's office, sleeping places for the boys and a guestroom.All the items in the museum are original and were initially collected from Bryggen or from various surrounding farms by Johan Wilhelm Wiberg (1829\u201398). His son, Christian Koren Wiberg (1870\u20131945) later built up the museum which became the responsibility of Bergen municipality in 1916.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEuropean Hansemuseum, in L\u00fcbeck\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Other sources ==\nNedkvinte, Arnved (2013)  The German Hansa and Bergen 1100-1600 (Cologne: B\u00f6hlau Verlag)  ISBN 9783412216825\nSchulte Beerb\u00fchl, Margrit (2012)  Networks of the Hanseatic League  (University in Mainz: Leibniz Institute of European History)\nTrebbi, Marco  (1996) Det Hanseatiske museum og Sch\u00f8tstuene (Bergen: Sch\u00f8tstuene) ISBN 8299079454\nWelle-Strand, Erling (1974) Museums in Norway (Oslo: Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs) ISBN 8271770039\n\n\n== External links ==\nHanseatisk museum (Kulturminnes\u00f8k)",

Anyway, our impressions (in 30 min or so) were that",

          "You really should educate yourself about the history of this famous area of Bergen and the museum is a perfect place to do that. Bergen was an important seat of the Hanseatic League and this museum is a fine example of how they lived. (It reminds me of the Tenement Museum in NYC",
          "This museum is in two buildings several hundred yards apart. The main part is a reconstruction of a Hanseatic house. It is interesting and informative though in the interests of authenticity the rooms are small and dimly lit. There was a tour group during our visit and things",
          "We visited the Hanseatic Museum during a stop in Bergen on a recent cruise. Prior to this trip, I didn't know much about the Hanseatic League and how it shaped Europe, but this museum took care of that. It preserves a League merchant's home. I found it fairly interesting. The",
          "Great place to see first hand what life was like working and living in a wooden building with the Hanseatiske merchants. Your truly feel transported to the past . I think the guide with you makes the difference in your experience. The stories of the way of life, the work and",
          "If you want to understand Bergen and its past, you should not miss this museum. The ticket, 160 NOK, includes the access to Schotstuene merchants rooms and also to the Norwegian Fisheries. Basically, the Hanseatic museum consists in the visit of a very old wooden merchant house,",
          "Everything is old the furniture, floors, walls, and artifacts. So authentic it is creepy. Get a guided tour or you will rush through and miss things. The stairs are challenging. Nice gift shop; staff is great and they sell beverages. I learned many things and am constantly",
          "This is a small museum based in a house which was offices and warehouse for Hanseatic merchants in Norway. The building itself is interesting being entirely timber construction and gives a feel for what many of the pre-modern buildings here must have been like. There are",
          "It's a place to get a quick overview of the History, Small museum though. they also provide a ticket to fisheries museum including free bus ride",
          "Good museum with lots of information and detail put in... Although one room smells bad due to the fish that had been dried for decades. Overall good experience",
          "Great overview of how the city became what it is, from 600 years ago! Well preserved building with an amazing history, worth far more than the hour needed to see it.",
          "Not much to this at all. Good museums tell a story, this one and only displays artifacts without much context.",
          "It would be easy to overlook this modest building on a corner of the busy Bergen wharf. Don't. It's a fascinating look at the early days of northern european commerce, showing how people lived and what they did. Very well done.",
          "This is worth a quick visit while in Bergen. We gained an appreciation for what our Bergen on the map. The building is well-preserved and the displays are informative.",
          "A fascinating insight into the history of Bergen and the lifestyle of the people. A guided tour is essential.",
          "1.An exceptional museum design and a presentation of the historical exeptional data. While waiting for the guided tour, you can read important information about the Hanseatic League as it appeared and evolved. The guide will take you and provide mukte details. You will see",

          "A must visit spot in Bergen to discover the major role of the German Hanseatic league in the development of Bergen. Situated in the original and restored buildings of the Bryggen it tells the story of the league as a major trading group across Europe with Bergen as one of its",
          "You will get a look into what a Hanseatic Merchant house would look like. Take the walking tour from the museum. You are allowed into some other sites w/ the tour. Try to avoid mid-day if there is a cruise ship in town.",
          "Learned a lot about the Hanseatic League and fisheries in Norway in general. This was a good lesson in efficient trade for both fish from the North and the other items needed from Europe such as grain and hardware. It was a hard and dangerous but rewarding life.",
          "Recommend a tour when you visit this Unesco heritage site. This museum bills itself as the best preserved Hanseatic house anywhere. The Hansa was a German trading organization in seaports of Northern Europe and this outpost was active from the mid 14th to mid 18th century.",
          "The museum gives you a good insight in the history and the trade the Germans did with the Bergen people. Good place for when it\u2019s wet and cold outside.",
          "We had read about the Hanseatic league before our arrival in Bergen and found the museum so interesting and it brought everything we read to life. The history is fascinating how Bergen and the rest of Norway were essential for fish trade in the Baltic countries. Great for",
          "I knew nothing of the Hanseatic League and this is the perfect place to learn about it. History is tied to place, and here you learn about the importance of Bergen in international commodities trading. Documentation is provided in English.",

          "This museum provided trade history among the Baltic countries and northern Europe, and the importance of Bergen in that trade, Great displays and excellent English explanations. It was very interesting for those who like ancient history. The rooms showed us how it was really",
          "Walking around is like going back to the 14th century and how the commerce between Norway and the continent was done. It is time that this museum shall be renovated. They need it very much.",
          "Definitely worth it to get a handle on the history of Bergen. The Hanseatic league and some of the information you get from the tour, will really help one appreciate Bergen and what made it the city it is today. Seeing the city without an understanding of its rich storied",
          "This is an interesting little museum that explains how Germany traded with Norway in medieval times. The guides are quite good.",
          "We didn't know much about the Hanseatic era before entering this museum but, let me tell you, we certain did we when left the museum. The exhibits are very well done and quite thorough in their explanation of what the Hanseatic League was, how it formed, its purpose, etc., etc.",
          "This isn't a museum built to house history. The building and its contents are the history, and it's fascinating. Sadly, it isn't very accessible because it's centuries old, which also means you need to watch your step on uneven floors and stairs, and doorways aren't all",
          "This museum is very easy to locate in Bryggen, and if you have the Bergen Card, you will get a discount on admission. It was fascinating what has survived for us to see today. Before visiting this museum, I was not aware of the history of the Hanseatic League or Bergen, so it",
          "A rather small museum and you won't learn much, but it's very pleasant to visit the historic interiors.",
          "We like learning about the places we visit - especially historically. This museum in a home from the first decade of the 1700s provided a great view of what the wharf looked like during the 400 years when fish were the primary export. The organization, numbers, and lives of",
          "My husband,the history buff enjoyed this a bit more than I did, but it made for a pleasant day. We took advantage of the 3 parts.....the Assembly house and the Fishing museum as well. They give complimentary free bus service between the 3 buildings which made a a nice respite",

          "Had a great guided tour around the museum. Lots of interesting history to see and our guide was excellent telling us all about the people who had inhabited the houses. Would say this one was a must.",
          "Intact venue from the days of Hanseatic merchants. Plenty of artifacts, and beds built into cupboards. A wonderful glimpse into the past. Staircases may be too difficult for some",
          "For someone not familiar with trade among the Baltic countries and northern Europe, and the importance of Bergen in that trade, this museum covers all the bases. Great displays and excellent English explanations. It was fun and informative for history buffs but probably not",
          "We ventured upon the Sch\u00f8tstuene site not realizing it was part of the museum, after seeing the red wooden houses during a motorcoach tour. Once entering the first museum site, we bought the pass for the 2 sites (and also received two free passes to the fisheries museum, which",
          "We did two of the three affiliated sites of this museum (we ran out of time for the one on fishing). The Assembly Rooms did an excellent job of capturing the look and feel of what it would have been like at the time. There\u2019s not a lot of text about the rooms, but enough to",
          "Fascinating look at life during the time of the Hanseatic merchants. Get there while you can - just heard it will be closed 1 Oct 2018 for six years for restoration! Your ticket also gets you to the Sch\u00f8tstuene just a short walk away.",
          "Really good museum about the Hanseatic League's role in the history of Bergen. Lots of information and well presented in an authentic wooden building. I would have like a bit more info on the background of the Hanseatic League in general; I would say it leans on the Bergen",
          "The most interesting thing about the museum is the building itself. It gives one a perspective on life in the times prior to the 17th century. Provides information on how the Hanseatic league worked. The furnishings are original.",
          "This is a well done and authentic museum. It can get somewhat crowded and you can feel a bit cramped but the experience is worth it.",
          "I have read the histories and visited a goodly number of Hanseatic League cities over the years. This place made it all come to life in my imagination.",
          "After watching a film in the basement of the Bryggens museum about life as a Hanseatic merchant, this museum was a great representation of the way of life of the members of the Hanseatic League. As soon as you enter the museum, you can smell the cod. I loved seeing the boxes",
          "In total it was interesting to visit this place. Rooms are very tiny. If more than 10 people inside then very difficult to move on to the next room. Very old building, older than 300 y",
          "The Hanseatic Museum is housed in an original 16th centuary merchants house and tells the story of the international dried cod trade. It is a warren of small rooms and very steep stairways and is definitely not disabled friendly. For the price of entry, you get 'free' tickets",
          "This museum does a good job of explaining Bergen\u2019s importance as a trading centre, especially as it related to the Hanseatic League. German traders established a thriving merchant class, largely dealing in \u201cstock fish\u201d (most typically cod). The building originally was used to",
          "This museum is split between two sights. The main museum and stylish gift shop is facing the main harbor, at the end of Bryggen. The second part of the museum, the assembly halls, are at the far end of Bryggen, near the fortress. Your 150NOK admission is good for both sights.",
          "This museum gives you an appreciation of Hanseatic times, especially the fish trade. Photos of the mountains of cod, barrels of cod liver oil, and the instruments of the trade gave us an insight into the times. The living quarters upstairs gave us an idea of the cramped living",
          "Great museum - it's based in the old surviving warehouse where you traverse across the building from the storage floor to the living quarters. You really get a sense what it was like being in the old Hanseatic city!",
          "This museum was next door to our hotel. It was fascinating! It was very informative and was a self-tour so we could take as long as we liked at each exhibit. It was a great way to learn the history of Bergen.",
          "As you wander through the old warehouses, make sure you go through this museum. Excellent preservation and insight into the merchants who made the Hanseatic league the dominant power in northern Europe for many centuries.",
          "A museum that charges $20 US per visitor- just to see an old merchant's house with ld relics of the time. Skip this place and use the money to buy cocktail on the wharf.",
          "It was very ancient and authentic, the inner decorations and structures. Quite an unforgettable experience!",
          "To really see what life was like \"back then\" you should take the time to visit the Hanseatic League Museum. It's a self-guided tour. And you can smell the history.",
          "Bryggen always looks nice from the outside and this museum really offers you the opportunity to explore the inner structures. Recommend!",
          "Take the free tour, our guide was excellent and pointed out many of the small details we would have otherwise missed. The rooms are furnished and a very interesting walk through.",
          "Takes you back in time, very cool and you're allowed to access most of the rooms with helpful staff. I'd definitely recommend checking it out the whole area around the museum has a enchanting charm",
          "We absolutely adored the Bergen wharf area and the Hanseatic buildings. They are beautifully maintained and offer a unique and special glimpse into a bygone era. There is no reason not to visit the Hanseatic museum if you are at the wharf. It is pretty small, and you can get",
          "If you have the Bergen card, there is a 20% discount for the tickets to this museum. This is a very informative place, where we got to understand better about the history of the Bryggen houses and their purposes. The interior of the museum is lightly modified so that it could",
          "It was a cold day in Bergen when we visited the museum. The entrance and gift shop area was super warm but step inside the museum and it was like a fridge! I know the type of building it is but they could have put heaters in there! We rushed through the museum. There are two",
          "The museum preserves two old tenements used for trading stockfish. It's important to both preserve the relics and tell the story of the Hanseatic era. It's a small museum but worth a visit if interested in history. Worth knowing the museum is kept as it was, so it is dim and",
          "brilliantly done to give you the experience of being part of the fishing industry's history, the geographical importance of it and other european counties influence on the Norwegians",

          "only had time for the house museum. good information boards with just enough information to keep reading.",
          "No National Trust Warders here! Just a polite Please Do Not Touch on ancient ledgers laid out in the House part of the museum. A lot of reading about fish on the ground floor but the apartments upstairs are charmingly rickety and spartan. \u00a312 per person, but these buildings",
          "This is probably only an hour max. It's interesting however to see the history of the building and the harbour.",
          "This is an interesting visit. Built in 1702 the. Building is beautiful and full of character. It is a reading heavy museum. Small In size. Cold due to the nature of the old building. Also expensive but if you're in Norway you must be expecting that!",
          "We visited on a cold day, and it was even colder inside, but so interesting. Lots of history about Bergen and the Hanseatic trading times and some beautiful rooms. Definitely worth a visit for an hour.",
          "The presence of German-based Hanseatic traders during the Middle Ages is so integral to the development, and even the identity, of Bergen that this museum is probably the one absolutely essential cultural-historical sight to see. Most European cities have a castle or fortress, a",
          "Great way to spend a couple of hours on a rainy day! The is so much character in this tiny wooden fish trading museum. It has been preserved so well and really gives an insight into life in Bergen circa 1700. The uneven floors, secret doorways from the wooden bunk beds and a",
          "Bryggen Old Town is a beautiful, fascinating, authentic area that begs for exploration. Don't waste a second of your time in that neighborhood on the Hanseatic Museum -- a warren of rooms dedicated to perhaps to the most eye-wateringly boring merchant network ever produced in",
          "We had an enjoyable visit to this museum while spending a day in Bergen on a cruise. The museum goes into a lot of detail about the Hanseatic League, how they developed and expanded and their processes including handling stockfish. The old buildings are very interesting and the",
          "Around 1350 a Kontor of the Hanseatic League was established at Bryggen and became the centre of the Hanseatic commercial activities in Norway. During the following centuries, the site consisted of assembly halls for the Hanseatic merchants. The warehouses were filled with",
          "Visitng any place in Norway in December and it's bound to be a little dark, a little cold but no lines. The Hanseatic Museum lies smack in the middle of town. Opening hours depends on time of year. Lots of steps to climb and the floors slope more than a ship's deck. But lots of",
          "This is a small but very informative museum giving a detailed look at the German and Hanseatic League. The exhibits deal with the history of the merchants and their lives, and their history with Bergen and the Bergen Harbor. There are great displays and authentic pieces dating",
          "The museum is not heated to give an idea of what life was like during the trading period. I went in December and wore my jacket, hat, and gloves in the museum. The displays were interesting and I would definitely recommend.",
          "Please visit this museum and avoid the rain while in Bergen if you are interested in history. The first room downstairs has all the historical information about the history Bryggen, The Hanseatic League etc. which is good to spend around 20 mins reading. Then go to the rooms",
          "I had a couple of hours to kill in Bergen and this museum was just the ticket (took about an hour). Very well presented, reasonably priced and a great insight into the period.",
          "An excellent portrayal of a critical period of Northern European history. The museum recreates the living quarters and fish storage warehouse of a typical Hanseatic trader of the 1700's. The dim lighting and the drying cod give you a good sense of the living conditions of the",

          "We visited here on a weekday morning in October. The museum was suprisingly busy even then indicating that it is a popular venue with visitors. Something to be aware of perhaps if planning a visit. The interior is very atmospheric and with plenty of interpretation in English as",
          "Excellent museum with rooms and furniture from the time period. Really gave us a great appreciation of life in those times and how Bergen became a successful trading port. Don't go look at the fish market or the colorful houses and wooden buildings without visiting this",
          "The museum is worth a visit to understand the history of Bryggen and how life was back then. Good signage in main languages.",
          "This museum has preserved not only a very important trade building, but also a lost way of life. It really brought the whole concept of the Hanseatic League to life. I enjoyed learning about a whole aspect of early European trade that I hadn't known existed. Do visit it, and",
          "I really wish that this had been our first port of call during visit to Bergen. It explains the layout of Bergen and it's unique style so well as the Hanseatic League effectively ran Bergen for several hundred years with Teutonic efficiency and planning.That which we admire and",
          "This is partly a conventional museum, with items on display and informative text near them -- but it's also set on the grounds of where much old Hanseatic trade went on, in the old Bryggen wharf neighborhood. Its rooms are dark and atmospheric and you get a bit of a sense of",
          "Really interesting to get some understanding of how important fishing links were with German ports. It also shows how the people lived in those times.",
          "We're lucky that one man had the foresight to preserve this building for future generations (most people thought he was crazy to save it). It gives good insight into the life of the Hanseatic traders. The beds are something else--more like cupboards. Be careful on the steep",
          "People slept pretty much in a semi-sitting up position. Who knew? That's just the way things were. The museum is a rare time capsule of life back in the 1350-1750 time frame. Not wanting to split hairs and create unintended controversy, the \"Schoetstuene\" was the",

          "This museum gives good insight into the history of Bergen and its relationship with the Hanseatic League. Don't miss the kitchen and social hall visit included in the ticket.",
          "We went to this museum on Culture Night in Bergen (september 8) and they were getting ready to do a reenactment of some sort. There were a lot of young kids roaming in period costumes. Since it wasn't clear when that started, we walked around the museum. The museum is in one",

          "Our group of 4 adults purchased a combo ticket for this Museum, the Assembly Rooms (Schotstuene) and the Norwegian Fisheries Museum. The tour at the Hanseatic Museum was especially interesting. Between the late 1300's and the mid 1700's the Hanseatic merchants from Northern",
          "The Hanseatic Museum is a great place to visit, especially when it's raining. On our visit, like pretty much everyone else's, it was raining. We lucked into walking in just as a tour was starting, so we got the inside scoop. There is a lot of history tucked away. I couldn't",
          "It was an interesting Museum about the German traders and Fishermen who came to Bergen. The Museum itself shows the rooms in which they slept with the history of the people living there. Interesting read.",
          "The museum is centrally located near the fish market and was a easy walk from Hotel 13 where we stayed. It shows Bergen when \"Cod\" was the king of industries.The layout was well thought out and I would give it a \"must see\" while in Bergen.",
          "This is a small area of old buildings in Bergen inscribed on UNESCO heritage list. We walked through narrow passages of trading medieval houses almost 2 hours. Then we have visited Hanseatic museum. Today it is very difficult to understand how people in old times could survive",
          "the building has had many functions over its history and now preserved as it would have been in 1500s to 1600s to oversee the harbor and fishing. Every detail was recorded on what was coming in and going out. Imports and Exports were taxed of course and some officials became",
          "Great old wooden building devoted to explaining the trade carried on by the Hanseatic League in Bergen. A must see. The ticket is a combination ticket. Skip the fishery museum if you are short of time.",

          "We visited at a busy time (it had started to pour rain just as we arrived, so lots of people also decided it was a good time). Once we'd left the gift shop area it was a climb up narrow stairs to the first floor. This was absolutely amazing - it was like the building had been",
          "I didn't know what to expect from this museum but I really enjoyed it. It was very comprehensive for a small museum and very cool little rooms upstairs set up the way the houses would have been. It doesn't take that long to go through depending on how much information you read",
          "Very central, well set out and excellent history ,worth a visit to understand about the tough sea faring people and Hanseatic League.",
          "Great learning experience. We had not studied this part of history previously. We took the walking tour first. Our docent was well versed and had a great sense of humor which made the tour enjoyable and not boring. It was interesting to go through the various living & working",
          "Not to be missed. To really understand the history of Bergen, you must make the time to visit. (You get 2 other museum entrances with your ticket). Learned so much!!",

          "Decided to visit this place because of the rain. Great choice with 3 museums offering. Suggest to take a self walk thru the main museum (45mins) and then join a free English guided tour (30mins) with some extra interesting facts about the people, place n culture. Check with",
          "Pure history about the Hanse trade organisation. The Museum is a replica of the 1704 building. You should attend a guided tour and you will get a lot of interesting information about this building, the life of the Hanse people and how they were organised. The guide was really",
          "Loved the uneven floors! Like being in a pirate ship. Cool old building and even the young kids enjoyed doing the quiz. The information was imparted in writing which is a bit monotonous. Would have been nice to have some interactive displays such as video and audio. Overall",
          "Really liked going inside one of the old Hanseatic buildings and seeing what life might have been like. Learned a lot about the Hanseatic league, found it very interesting. It is a small museum, but you get 3 museums for the price of your ticket",
          "Well presented the historic past of the city. Definitely worth the visit. Plan on spending about an hour. Two if you want to visit all three parts of the museum.",
          "By touring the small spaces, and handling authentic artifacts, and the adjacent buildings, you are in a time warp machine, back to the middle ages.. This illustrates exactly how people lived. This cannot be visualized any other place I have visited. Highly recommended for all",
          "You should probably stop at this museum while in Bergen if you'd like to have a good orientation as to the historical significance of the city. The museum is well done, even if not \"exciting\", and the 40-minute tour very clearly explains the history of Bergen and that of Norway",
          "If you want to see how Hanseatic merchants lived 400-500 years ago, this museum is great. It is an actual merchant house/office with period furnishings that you can wander through.",
          "The Hanseatic Museum & the nearby Sch\u00f8tstuene are together the single most important history museum in Bergen and bring to life the era when Bergen was an affiliate of the enormously wealthy & powerful Hanseatic League. The rooms in the Hanseatiske Museet are mostly small &",
          "Excellent exhibition, beautiful preservation. Interesting exhibit of the Hanse League workings. Beautiful museum shop. But.... If you buy something and tell them it is a present they will ask you if you need a bag. No, I am paying you to give me service. Pack the presents! It",
          "Well done on many levels; great building for it, interesting information well presented for multiple language speakers. Learned a ton and had fun",
          "We were doubting to go in because it looked so small, but once inside you immediately feel back into the old days of fishing and trading! The museum did a good job keeping that atmosphere. Intriguing to see how people lived back then.",
          "Interesting presentation of life during the historically important life if the Hanseatic league. Clear and informative text in several languages, including English-- both on the walls and in pamphlet.",
          "Very interesting tour to get a feel for the port's history. Never knew about the trading organization known as the Hanseatic League.",
          "I had never heard of the Hanseatic League. Fascinating to learn about a 400 year reign by a merchant power so far from their headquarters. Actually seeing the building makes the information much more meaningful. Apprentices were locked in their beds all night long.",
          "A ticket to this museum also gets you into the Assembly Rooms further down the wharf and into the Fisheries museum about a mile away. All are connected by a shuttle service that runs half-hourly. The Hanseatic Museum offers a look at the interior of a German trading house as it",
          "Smelly with mold and fish and that's the charm of this well maintained German merchant house. Really authentic stuff. Limited English mention of what is what, but enough. Worth a look for history and ethnology buffs",
          "Spend an hour exploring this authentic historic site. You'll get a real sense of how the German Hanseatic merchants and their apprentices lived. Steep narrow stairs, dark unheated rooms (due to fire hazard), and no women allowed. The poor apprentices slept two each in box-like",
          "Go on the half hour tour offered and learn the history of this interesting area with the Museum being an exceptional and important part. The day we visited was the 145 year old birthday.",
          "Worth a quick tour as part of the walking tour of Bergen. At first I walked by this not realizing how much history I was walking by. Amazing treasure to have such a preserved museum. It taught me a lot about the German merchant history, life during the 1400-1500's and how the",
          "Has been only a trading house and then a museum so not much has altered. Very good lady guide with excellent English. Very interesting. Only downfall we had to wait until 1545 to visit as before then tickets were only sold as a package of 3 museums and we didn't want to go to",
          "I really loved visiting this museum. It is well done and you will understand the importance and influence of the Hanseatic League in the fishing industry. The location is in Bryggen in one of the oldest buildings. It is a glimpse into the old trade houses with authentic",
          "While the building is authentic and interesting to visit the experience felt a bit like a tourist trap. That said it was interesting to see how the hansa lived and traded and treated their apprentices. Worth a visit but you may wish to combine this museum with a tour of others",
          "We had seen the fish hanging to dry in the Lofoten Islands before we came south to Bergen, This museum nicely completed the history of the fish trade. We joined the English language tour at 4pm so we did not have to pay for 3 museums. The guide was most informative & explained a",
          "I usually prefer to go through museums at my own pace as I like to linger in some spots and not in others I happened to arrive just in time for an English tour, and I'm glad I stuck with them. The ground floor has all you need to know about the Hanseatic League and Bergen;'s",
          "We decided to visit this museum which is close to historical Bryggen on our final day in Bergen. Unfortunately there was no discount on the entry fee with a Bergen Card. The museum, which is housed in a conserved old wooden building, is furnished in the 18th century style. It",
          "This museum, although sometimes crowded in small rooms, is worth a visit not only to learn about the Hanseatic League and the great importance of the dried fish commodity but to see how the men and apprentices lived. It doesn't take very long to tour the building. I thought the",
          "As we arrived there was an English tour just starting. Excellent guide, Monika, who lead this group and taught me so much about the Hanseatic league in northern Europe. Maps orientated from a Norwegian perspective were hugely helpful in understanding the trade routes at the time.",
          "The museum is interesting but if one had read about the place prior to going, it was an expense 10 minute viewing. It's a small place with not that much to see.",
          "To learn more about the interesting history of Bergen do not miss this museum which focuses on the fish trade and the economical effect of the German merchants of the XVIII and XIX centuries, not only in Bergen or Norway, but also in Europe. Through the fish stock smelly rooms,",
          "Start your visit in Bergen with this museum to gain the knowledge you need to understand Bryggen. Well done exhibits and just so interesting to learn about this part of Norwegian/Bergen history. Ticket includes a shuttle to two other museums.",
          "We bought a ticket to the museums which give you access to the three museums and a mini-bus ride to all three. The first one we went to was the Norges Fiskerimuseum with its still faint smell of fish. The museum details the fishing industry in the Barents, North, and Norwegian",
          "We really enjoyed visiting two of the museums on the pass. The shuttle between them is really useful too.",
          "We had very good walk around the museum and were surprised by lots of things and facts there. Worth a visit thats for sure!",
          "Very interesting museum. Quite expensive, but worthwhile. Situated in the centre of Bergen, a mini bus links this with other museums.",
          "A well presented and very informative museum giving the history and importance of the port of Bergen. Well worth a look.",
          "Fascinating building where drying, weighing, & trading of cod took place. U can still smell a bit of fish in the place. Full of scales, tools, desks, even beds, it really immerses u in the business. My only complaint is that some parts are too dark to see clearly, & no flash",
          "The tour of this museum gave so much more meaning to our trip. I had no idea of this history! Highly recommend.",
          "I came here as part of the Bryggen museum tour and really liked it. I liked seeing how everything was set up like it was hundreds of years ago and learning how people used to live.",
          "This turned out to be a terrific window into Bergen's trade past. Take advantage of the guided tours every half hour or so (depending on the language), which are very informative. We learned a lot and were impressed with the original furnishings and equipment. Very worthwhile.",
          "We visited this museum as part of our tour from Bryggens guided tours programme. Our guide was a young chap who spoke english, very knowledgable and joked from time to time. The Hansa museum still has thousands of drien cod in the weighing room so is a wee bit stinky but not",
          "Visitors to Bergen who take an interest in the city's history will undoubtedly hear a fair bit about the Hanseatic League. This German-dominated federation of merchants' guilds that was the dominating force in seaborne-trade centred around the Baltic Sea between the 12th- and",
          "Unique historic asset with a wonderful atmosphere and excellent overall interpretation. They have chosen to keep room cards and other info out of the rooms, and this should be reviewed. Overall,a brilliant historical experience.",
          "We decided to visit this museum and were pleasantly surprised. Highly informative and done in a way that made it \"real\" for us to Feel how the lives of those living in those times were like. Would recommend. It is a small museum, so will be done in an hour at the most.",
          "If you are interested in the history of Bergen then these two buildings are a must. Not wheelchair friendly. Some steep steps involved but worth the effort. If you go after 3.45 you get a discounted entry fee for the two. There is also a mini blue which contexts them and the",
          "Great museum, makes history come alive. Buildings are so old, restored, takes you way back in time. Unbelievable that people had to live and work in those conditions.",
          "An enjoyable way to learn not only about Bergen's history, but also about European history and the significance of the Hanseatic League (1150-1650). It may even help non-Europeans better understand the present-day European Economic Community. The museum is three museums in one",
          "Do go here, you will learn so much of the history of life in these times. I wish high school history was as interesting. Life was tough and so were the people. The architecture of the building was fascinating!.",
          "I almost didn't visit this museum as the person who served me at Tourist Info said that the Leprosy Museum is the most popular. However, I didn't realise that the Leprosy museum was only open from 11.00 - 15.00 so I missed it and went here instead. It is an interesting place",
          "Did not plan on visiting this museum, but stopped in for a quick look and decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did, it was pretty interesting to the German influence in the early history of Bergen and the trade industry. The ticket includes 3 museums, the Hanseatiske, the",
          "My partner and I had the chance of visiting the Hanseatic Museum and we are glad we did. We both didn't know much about the Hanseatic League before hand, so it was interesting to learn about their influence throughout northern Europe and of course within Bergen. The Museum is",
          "Having one of the original market buildings still maintained as if still in use was wonderful. You could really imagine the fish market life as you wandered the rooms and found where the managers and workers slept and worked, then later visit the separate building where they ate",
          "Det Hanseatiske Museum is essential not only as regards Bergen's history, but also as far as European history is concerned : after all, the Hanseatic League was the first European Economic Community !",
          "This museum was of interest to me until we walked into the door. Through this entry we found ourselves in the gift shop, which was fine with us. We looked at some very unique products, many of which we had not seen at the more touristy places. We purchased a few items, and",
          "If you have an interest in what formed Bergen, the Hanseatic Museum is good. If you are interested in seeing actual old buildings from the 1700s, this is also good. Loved seeing the painted cabinets and learning how fires (candles, fireplaces) were completely forbidden here",
          "Although the Hanseatic Museum may seem a bit dull at first, it's isn't. The hyper capitalist Hanseatics built Bergen and influenced language and culture right up to Second World War Nazi occupation. The quaint and colourful buildings hide a dark homopathic cult of brutal",

          "We thought this was the best of the museums in Bergen. Gives you a good look at how the merchants lived. Includes original home and business. Well well-organised and easy-to-follow. There are some steep steps.",
          "As this attraction is not fully covered by Bergen card (only 20%), we initially had some reservations, but eventually decided to go after reading reviews. Glad we did it, and it was an absolutely gorgeous place. Well-preserved rooms and full of history. The ticket is valid for",
          "There was a lot of information about the fisheries and related things. Personally I would have liked to know more about their day to day lives. How did they do the cooking? What about hygiene? A lot of the men were not allowed to associate with the opposite sex, but in reality",

          "I went to this museum during a visit to Bergen. The museum tells the story of the Hanseatic merchants who traded fish and other items from 1350 to 1750. The museum is very dark inside, but contains many interesting items, well worth a visit. Like most things in Norway, it is",
          "To me the store is a leading hint to what you will find in the museum itself. Carefully selected craft ship in all products reflect the history of Bergen. From the stick game purchase , which was created in Bergen , you can play the traditional game. Norwegian weaved items",
          "A very well planned museum showing how life was in early Bergen. It is on a few floors with stairs, so may not be suitable for all.",
          "A well laid out museum with plenty of history. Small and reasonably priced. Good for a morning or afternoon visit.",
          "Cold, dark and fishy! The museum is set up as a trading house, so that we got a good sense of the life of the people who worked and lived there. Very atmospheric. The lady at the counter was very informative and helpful.",
          "This historical museum is located in a 1704 building which used to be the headquarters of the Hanseatic League. Inside you learn about the German Hanseatic merchants who facilitated trade between Norway and Europe. It's quite intriguing and unique, gives great perspective on",
          "If you have very little time and need to prioritize, add this to the top of the places you visit in Bergen. It was so interesting and educational! They don't heat the place, so you get to experience the cold just as the merchants would have back in the day. The exhibits were",
          "Not included with the half price offer from Brygges museum Well preserved trading house-kept cold and dark to preserve it. Great smell of fish throughout for effect! Interesting to see how people lived",
          "Interesting and informative museum. I learned much about the impact of trading fish and grain. It's good how they don't have heaters during the winter to replicate what it was like when the Hanseatic merchants lived and traded in Bryggen. It's too bad that there were some places",
          "A wonderful capture of the old way of living in Bergen. 100NOK entry seems fair to me to see a building and items from the early 1700's. I learnt a lot! I recommend going here if your into a bit of history.",
          "This is a small but interesting museum. You will learn about Bergen's past, the fish trade and the ways of life back when they were smoking or drying fish in the attic. You can also walk through a typical \"hanseatic\" house as it was centuries ago and admire the old objects and",
          "we didnt get in but outside you can sit if you dont want o buy a ticket, buy souvenirs, free wifi, and friendly staff",
          "Had time to kill before checking into our cruise, it was cold & raining and round the corner from our hotel so thought would pop in. Very pleasantly surprised- an excellent overview of the history of Bergen. The museum is in one of the old wooden trader houses over 300 years",
          "Simple and easy museum. Nothing grand, but quite decent. Has a stench of fish that was dried on the attic which we found kind of nice to experience.",
          "Since the day was a rainy one, I figured I'd explore a museum. This was a great one as I learned about the history of trade in the area (and the importance of cod oil). Walking through such a historic building gave a lot of insight into that time period as well.",
          "We began our first full day in Bergen at this museum. As advertised, it gave us a greater understanding of the history of Bergen and its vital role during the Hanseatic league. We were the only two visitors in the museum on this December morning, meaning we could take our time",
          "The museum was closed to me while a guide was escorting a group, so I walked around the exterior. Somewhat disappointed that they were likely short-staffed that day.",

          "Very interesting museum - shows the centerpiece of Bergen and its trade with the rest of Europe. While it is a bit on the expensive side, it was very in-depth exposure to the living and working conditions of the era. There are a number of pieces of history through-out the",
          "We spent 45 mins here and paid 100NOK to go in - so on the pricier side for a museum. There is very little explanation after the first room of what you are looking at - but the building itself is fascinating. You really get a sense of what it was like 100s of years ago and",
          "It is not a typical museum, as there is not that much background information required. Nevertheless, it is so much fun to wander through the house with all the details out of its original time. Everything is really well-preserved and a good impression is given of the life of the",
          "The museum was super interesting and explains the history of Bryggen and the German Hansa at all and especially in Norway. The whole history is presented in a nice way and the location therefore is perfect as the museum is in one of the typical wooden houses in Bryggen. I would",

          "The museum provided fascinating insight to the activities of the Hanseatic League -- how they lived and worked -- and the importance of the stock fish trade. Our English speaking tour guide was excellent and we enjoyed seeing the warehouse built in 1703 and the assembly rooms.",
          "It's well worth spending an hour at this tiny but significant museum on Bergen's vibrant waterfront. Try to take the free guided tour as this brings out much of the lifestyle of these wealthy and rather narcissistic merchants. Also, catch the 15minute video playing in the small",
          "This is a small museum and it does allow you to see into eh lives of some historic figures but overall not a \"must see\" for Bergen. I preferred the hikes and outdoor activities.",
          "This museum was okay if you have a rainy day, but it was expensive and our English tour was very poor. The building itself was interesting, with all the twists and turns of living spaces of 400 years ago. The museum did a very thorough job of showing the importance of cod.",
          "Interesting info on Hanseatic League as well as living and working conditions in Bergen then. extra characters",
          "We explored two of the buildings that make up the Hanseatic Museum complex in Bergen. I'm a sucker for museums, and for architecture, and it was really the buildings that fascinated me the most. Bergen has an old residential quarter filled with wooden houses, packed tightly",
          "This museum really takes you inside the Hanseatic world. Alot to see and everything has an English explanation. Take a look at the secret cupboard door that lead to a bedroom upstairs.\ud83d\ude09 Make sure you visit the meeting rooms on a nearby site too.",
          "We took the tour that was lead in English which was very good in explaining the history of the Hanseatic League and the importance of cod. Very interesting to learn of what must have been a difficult way to earn a living.",
          "We bought a museum pass and started our visits with this one. We booked an English tour which lasted 45 minutes and got a better understanding of the history of the area. You can smell the dried fish through the building!",
          "A very enjoyable view into the local history of Bergen. The museum follows trough multiple rooms showcasing how people used to live like here.",
          "The excellent English guided tour was critical to bringing to life the history of Bergen and influenced the rest of my stay. Highly recommend!!! It brings the past to life!",
          "Situated at the end of Bryggen world heritage site you will easily see the Hanseatic Museum...a rough timber building where you can learn about the merchants, the journeymen and the apprentices who lived here and who were responsible for the storage and processing for overseas",
          "Really enjoyed this place that provided context of Bergen's foundations and history, as well as the important stockfish trade. The old buildings were carefully preserved. The entrance is small and on the side though, so a little hard to find..",
          "Centrally located in Brygen. Gives you a view of what it was like to be in a guild or to be an apprentice (apprentice sleeping quarters were the size of a dresser drawer). Old furniture, old building.",
          "It is a small museum and you have to spend maybe less than an hour, but do not miss it if you have even a modest interest to history. You will refresh your memory about the Hanseatic League organisation and power. You will imagine the curious bits of manners and specific way of",
          "Well worth visiting. Take the time to read all the multilingual story boards when you first enter. They tell the amazing story of the Hanseatic town, how it operated and traded. You then tour the house and see how they lived and then go over to the Hanseatic Rooms where they",
          "Some old rooms with some old stuff in and that is all great until you look at the price. Not so great.",
          "Too bad it's not included in the Bergen pass. It's small but full of history about the Hanseatic trade. Definitely a must see.",
          "Seeing this on the tail of the walking tour from the Bryggens museum brings it all together. Plenty of stairs (3 floors) though.",
          "I never realized that dried fish could be so lucrative and so interesting! Excellent presentation on the life of Hanseatic merchants in Bergen. Very authentic atmosphere with a fascinating narrative.",
          "Very interesting museum which explains the history of the German merchants in Bergen, but the house itself is fantastic.",
          "Don't waste your time to visit since there's nothing worth to see or buy !very touristic and crowded with no reason at all !",
          "The main site is well laid out and one should take time to read the boards in Norwegian and English. They explain the history of the commercial activities well. The ticket price includes transfer by boat or bus to the fisheries museum. It also includes the assembly house of the",
          "I though the museum was priced a bit high and with the crowds, it made the experience not too good. There are many museums in town, catch this one if there's an ebb in traffic.",
          "A little boring if I am utterly honest and much of it could probably be gleaned quite readily from a book or good website on the subject. However for those interested in the drying of fish and the history of bergen and why they have a fish on their number plates its interesting.",
          "Interesting to see the old structures and reconstructions of life in the old days. Seemed a bit touristy, but worth seeing.",
          "Excellent museum, it is walking through history. I had heard of the Hanseatic League, but had no real idea of what that meant before visiting this museum. It shows what the trade house looked like during the 18th and 19th centuries. They even keep it dark, as candles were not",
          "Great opportunity to see how the tradesmen lived and worked in this area. A little crowded by tour groups, which can be a challenge as the tour guides don't want you to join in, while you get overrun by the groups in the small rooms.",
          "Had no idea that German merchants had come to Bryggen hundreds of years ago. Really interesting building and historical artifacts.",
          "We followed the guided the tour of which the tickets you can buy at the bryggen museum. During summer its everyday at eleven am. The tour takes about 2.30u. They guide you through the museum and take you walking to the hanseatic houses. I really recommend to take the tour. It",
          "Entering through a very modern ticket area, you are unprepared for walking straight back several centuries. It was good to see so much was still original, and get a sense of how these merchants lived.",
          "One of the last surviving places from Hanseatic times and they have a great guided tour conducted by this lady who was simply superb. She conducted the tour in English and I would recommend anyone to take this tour because it is totally worth it and gives a whole different way",
          "The tour includes a guided tour of one of the remaining houses used to board the German interns who were sent to learn the business. It includes a visit to the site of a herring packing plant. Both tour guides we had were very informative and enjoyed showing us the living and",
          "This tour was well worth the time we spent. Bergen was established by the Germans. The wharf buildings represent this historical industry. The tour shows the residence and space occupied by the tradesman for the industry of fish import and export. The museum space brings",
          "Both museums are really interesting and give a fascinating insight into the lives of the Hanseatic fish traders in Bryggen. If you can, go on one of the tours - the guides know lots of interesting facts and really bring everything to life! Our excellent guide was Marta. We went",
          "The Hanseatic Museum and Fisheries Museum (included in the ticket) were a great introduction into the area we were visiting. We enjoyed learning about the history, and the Fisheries Museum (although farther away-- a free tram or a decent walk) was more interactive and helpful",
          "this is a nice museum easy to see in a short time-so authentic worth a visit to main house not so sure of other two nice staff",
          "This museum is right in the harbor and its main theme is the cod trading. Its a bit expensive but also includes the visit to the Hanseatic Assembly Rooms Museum and the Norwegian Fisheries Museum Bergen (which was a very nice surprise) and the shuttle. I would recommend doing",
          "We were lucky to lean about the walking tour which starts from this museum. Our guide provided with lots of interesting details about the Hansa merchants.",
          "This was an interesting place to visit as it gives a glimpse into the lives of the fishermen and merchants of the bygone ages. It is also a testament to the hard lives faced by those generations. I was also amazed to find out from the info there that despite the lack of modern",
          "Brilliant! It was well presented, good video presentation in the foyer with English subtitles about the Hansa merchants. Gabriela took us round the tenement and spoke faultless English as she explained the details of the old building, answering questions very knowledgeably. It",
          "This was an interesting historical journey into the fishing industry in Norway. There are three separate buildings to visit. It is the story of experience of an apprentice in the fishing trade and how they lived. It also shows how they dried the stockfish. You can still see",
          "Interesting museum with dried cod hanging from ceilings, tiny bunk beds, small dark rooms, bookkeepers office, etc. Gives a good picture if the life and times of the fishermen and the Hanseatic era. Lots of steep, narrow stairways and low doorways - so watch your step and your",

          "Housed in an old (surviving) wooden warehouse from the mid-1700s, this museum tells the story of the cod fishing industry that was controlled for decades by the Hanseatic League. The museum is fairly dark, and the steps are steep and narrow. You get to see processing rooms,",
          "Good knowledge of the history city and the real royal of the crown: cod! Nice picture of the germany history in norwegian city...the old town is incredible.",
          "Great story of preservation. A charming museum and a great way to escape bad weather. The displays will explain a lot about Bergen of old.",
          "For us, this museum was not the favorite of the day. It gives you an insight to how the cod fish liver oil industry worked many years ago and the importance of the trade industry but if you don't have time to do it all, this can be an add-on. It was interesting though and had",
          "I was surprised at how much I liked these museums. It was really well curated - the exhibits were minimal but still very informative.",
          "Had heard of the Hanseatic League but knew nothing about them. The museum is in fact a restored merchants building, hence it being dark inside, but you get a real sense of the history of the league and what the building would have been like. Good visit, but take your reading",
          "We bought a three site ticket at the Hanseatiske Museum for access to that museum, the Fishery museum, and the Common Assembly building for about $18 each. Shuttle bus to the other sites included. The most interesting was the Hanseatiske. where we saw the living conditions of",
          "We liked this museum best of all we visited in Bergen. The well-preserved 300 year old building gives an excellent sense of how the merchants, journeymen, and less-fortunate initiates lived during the heyday of the Hanseatic league. Take time to also visit Schoetstuen a few",
          "Very interesting museum. We followed a guided English speaking tour with a very pleasant, well-informed guide. Gives a good historical background and a feeling of what life must have been like for merchants and their workers.",
          "The staff at the museum were very friendly, helpful and quite willing to explain the building and related separate museums (the Hanseatic Museum, Sch\u00f8tstuene and The Norwegian Fisheries Museum) time and again to different visitors. The main floor is very interesting if you take",
          "We were keen to visit as we were in Bergen for the Hanseatic Days festival. We live in a Hanseatic town in England. We had a very good English speaking guide called Jonas and really enjoyed his tour.",
          "It is worth a visit just to experience the building - the historical information is interesting but the building is very cool. You get a ticket for three museums and there is a shuttle that takes you to all three. I would have said to go late and skip the other two museums (the",
          "Beautifully restored Hansa era warehouse, that does a lovely job of telling the story of the Hanseatic league. The museum is small, and a bit expensive (after all, this is Norway) but worth the visit",
          "Did this museum as part of a tour starting at Bryggens Museum 150 krone which included entrance into three museums that day. Good value. Tour guide excellent. This museum was once owned by a single person who refused to sell out - he collected all sorts of memorabilia and kept",
          "This museum offered a picture of life as a fish trader in the 1700s. It makes you see how awful conditions were for the workers during this time period. We are happy we took the guided tour which offered further insights.",
          "My sister and I loved our beautiful room with twin beds. This hotel had a good breakfast and friendly staff. The layout is quirky and charming. It was a very convenient location for the sightseeing we wanted to do in Bergen. They have complimentary soap, shampoo and lotion which",
          "Museum is well organised, easy to reach and a place to spend one hour and half, Another advantage is shuttle bus ticket included to museum visit in Bergen, and you can go to 2 more museums free by using Shuttle Bus to go. Tickets have validity of 48 hours to use shuttle bus",
          "Went here in Dec 13, it was the highlight of the trip, if you love history this is the place to go, you get a real feel of what life was like then.",
          "Well worth the 150kr to see the inside of this museum that takes you back in time 300 years plus take the free minibus to see the Fisheries Museum just 5 minutes away.",
          "Good depiction of the fishing trade in the league. Lots of English translations unlike other museums. Nice to do at your own pace. Enjoyed going to the assembly rooms and fishing warehouse that most people skip.",
          "Great museum to learn about the Hanseatic League which flourished here for 500 years. Lots to see, good exhibits well marked on English. Puts Bergen in perspective.",
          "I went with a walking tour but I recommend going alone or with a small group as the rooms are tiny...there are some interesting artifacts and you get a good idea of what the living conditions were back in the days...",
          "The museum showcases the living conditions of the members of the Hanseatic League in the Bergen office. You get some info about how the Hanseatic League operated and the role of the Bergen office in the organization. The function of each room is presented shortly. The atmosphere",
          "We learned a lot here, fascinating place that preserves true local history. You get to see how the men who worked the wharves here in the 1800s and earlier lived and worked.",
          "Just the right size for a museum. Not too much, not too little. Good sense of atmosphere (offices, sleeping quarters) and intelligent explanatory displays. Strongly recommended.",
          "Well done. Gives a real picture of Hanseariske history. We enjoyed the visuals, the structure of the building, and the explanations. Very informative.",
          "The ticket covers not only the Hanseatiske Museum but also the Schoetstune (5 Min. walking distance) and the very new Fisheries Museum (30 Min. walking distance or shuttle bus/boat).",
          "I have never had opportunity to be in such a tippy, tilty, twisted building as this. Walking is no challenge, but I swear that standing still it feels like the buildling is rocking like a boat. My husband didn't feel it, but I heard others mention it. I have a feeling that",
          "The museum contains lots of information on the Hanseatic period and many of the rooms are still as they were then. It is very dark inside however.",
          "If you only wish to see this museum ask for the single admission ticket. Otherwise you are paying for 3 museums. Very interesting museum set up to recreate the times of the Hanseatic trading team. Short but good.",
          "When you buy a ticket it includes three museums, we only visited one of the three. The positives were that you got a little bit of history and a sense of what life was like in that area during that time. The building was interesting to walk through but the whole thing could be",
          "The museum tries to show you what life was like inside the old wooden houses in the 18th and 19th centuries. It's perhaps good to get an impression but we didn't think it's really worth it and wouldn't recommend spending more than15-20 minutes.",
          "They will try to sell you a combined ticket with the Norwegian fisheries museum. However, if you ask, there is currently a cheaper option without this. For me, this was the most interesting museum in Bergen - restored/reconstructed hansa merchant's storehouse/shop/residence.",
          "Great representation of life in the Hanseatiske times, complete with the unheated rooms typical for its inhabitants. Visit early during a Bergen stay and sights around Bryggen will be more meaningful. Good value with the 3-museum NOK150 ticket, also with the Bergen Card if",
          "Museum was interesting. No guided tours, which were suggested, due to being short staffed. Worth the short visit to understand the history of Bergen.",
          "This museum costs 150 NOK, but includes the entrance on two other musems (Schoetstuene and Norwegian Fisheries Museum), and also the shuttle between these 3 sites, running every 30min, so it's a good deal! You can visit all the sites in one morning or afternoon. If you don't",
          "With its historical lighting (very little) and authentic decorations (dried fish hanging from the ceiling) this museum might be avoided by sime travellers. This would be a mistake. Despite not having the information of a NT property (the trustees believed that panels in each",

          "What lovely service and well worth a visit. The shop is very good and the young lady serving was so friendly and helpfull",
          "Very interesting to learn a bit about the industry and see how the men and apprentices lived during the time of the Hanseatic trading - bleak indeed. Apparently I missed a 'second part' and unsure where some people read some of the things they did, as I only saw information to",
          "One of most informative museums... small but full of info especially on fish trade and role of Hanseatic traders in Bergen, showing their lives Learned a LOT AND it is open in the winter which is a big deal",
          "The museum is cold because that's what life was like in the days of the Hanseatic League. The building is extremely well preserved and gives a very good account of what life was like for the merchants and apprentices of the day, and an interesting insight into the importance of",
          "While I didn't find this to be \"wow\"-worthy, it was interesting nonetheless to see how merchants lived and slept. So many people fit into one room... No wonder this town also became an international center of leprosy! Some neat old things to see, and a bit quirky as dried fish",
          "Easily reached at the \"entry\" to the Bryggen area, this is an appropriate, eye-opening, knowledge-expanding, thought-provoking way to begin one's exploration of Bryggen. The opportunity to take in an UNESCO World Heritage Site warrants time and effort to better understand",
          "It is unbelievable that everything in the old wooden warehouse/fishermen boarding home appears to be unchanged in hundreds of years. You get the feeling the inhabitants just left. A house museum at its best. A must do for history lovers and the curious.",
          "This is an authentic warehouse and home for the famous hanseatiske traders from Germany who occupied the wharf of Bergen for 400 years. This is old wood that squeeks when you climb up the stairs to the aprentices bedrooms. You can still smell the dry cod. Learn about the strange",
          "Didn't realise how extensive the hanaeactic league was at all until came to bergen. This museum is a good introduction -for example with an impressive collection of seals from many of the cities involved but upstairs on the brygge is not much refuge from the cold on a winters",
          "As we visited it in the winter, we certainly experienced how dark and cold a medieval building would be, this certainly made the visit atmospheric. Very informative: I now only have another 196 Hansiatic cities to visit!",
          "Winter gives you a big advantage to imagine, how the aprentices been living here, in dark, cold, sleeping in \u201esleeping lockers\" to keep the warmet temperature thera - and sharing the \"bed\" with colleagues to keep the place warm aroundf the whole day.",
          "Very interesting museum painting a good picture of Bryggen, and a general section of Norwegian history. Information in English, Norwegian and German (as in much of Norway).",
          "I loved this entire museum and I loved how they've preserved everything. It was so interesting to see the wall paintings faded and worn, the beds, the set up, and learn more of the history behind what life in Bergen was like. I recommend about an hour here, maybe a little less.",
          "Small museum set in a historical merchant house. Each room describes an aspect of the merchants' life in old Bergen. Very interesting",
          "This is a great museum to learn about the history of Bergen and Norway in a fun way. You walk through an old fishing industry building and get to experience life at that time in Bergen. The text and exhibits also teach you about the history of Norway as a whole and how the",
          "A museum reflecting the life of a past Bergen This museum is extremley well set out whilst being informative. I could also feel the cold and despair of those living as apprentices in houses not allowed heat or light in those bygone days",
          "The museum is easy to tour and has a lovely gift shop. I didn't take the official tour but was able to hear some of the tour guides as I walked through. It is just a matter of how much time you want to spend. The guided tour does give a lot of information.",
          "It tells the history of Bergen and cod liver oil and Hanseatic League. Situated in a historic building with sloping floors, steep and uneven stairs, it was as authentic as you could get. But it is small (which might be ok - sometimes we are overwhelmed by too large museums).",
          "This is an interesting museum but I expected more. It displays original furniture and household items from Hansa times in Bergen, but nothing terribly special would recommend it. The very limited opening hours (11-15) and high Norwegian admission fees (90 NOK) are no incentives.",
          "Enjoyed this museum very much. I liked the way they preserved the original feel of the building. I also liked the way they let you wander around and explore. It was easy to imagine the merchants living and working there. A sign in the first room says that they have",
          "Really enjoyed this museum. Did not know the impact of the Hanseatic League on the countries and peoples of it's time. Great exhibits. Need a guide to get the most out of this museum. Ours was great. Loved the stories.",
          "An interesting insight into the life of merchants in Hanseatic Bergen. The museum has authentic displays of furniture and household goods.",
          "A new little of the Hanseatic League until I visited this museum. It was done in one of the oldest buildings in this part of Bergen. The guide we had was very informative and did a great job. This is well worth a visit.",
          "Really interesting museum, fascinating to learn about early commodities trading in C.14 in Europe and the Hanseatic Trading League.",
          "This very historic and old museum, should be visited wit a guide so that you have the history of the Hanseatic guild. We had the tour from the Bergen Museum in English which was excellent.",
          "Original buildings with furnishing from the period. Beware that the floors are uneven and unchanged. Walk around the the area and down the alleys to see other old buildings/",
          "Look at this attached picture. From the left, only three of the lower windows are the space inside. There is a dig around the corner of more interest",
          "Very interesting, beautiful restaurated museum, in the heart of Bryggen (Unesco heritage). It shows how merchants operated in the fish industry in Norway. Worth to visit.",
          "My wife and I visited the Hanseatic Museum in Belgium today and found it very interesting. It is an early eighteenth century building which reconstructed one from centuries earlier that had been destroyed by fire. It contains the old furnishings and layout with English",
          "This original building clearly showed how the merchants operated in the fish industry. The displays were written in English as well, so easy to understand. We spent a hour or so here just marvelling at the incredible history.",

          "Incredible museum focusing on Bergen's Hanseatic history. Last of the 18th century buildings left intact with it's original functions apparent. Rainy day in Bergen? Head t this museum of an enlightening 2 hours. Guided tours end in September but the brochure provided by the",
          "We went to both parts of this museum - they are several blocks apart and included in one admission fee - and cannot really recommend either one. Going on a self-guided tour, there isn't much to see and little even worth photographing. It was somewhat interesting to see how the",

          "A well-preserved dockside merchant house with museum displays and a gift shop. Incredible that it survived to today. Buy a ticket at the Bryggen Museum for the Walking tour and this museum is included. It was useful in bringing historic Bergen to life.",
          "I had not really thought about the Hanseatic League and its impact on the history of Western and Central Europe since I took my high school's Moses-to-MacArthur history course decades ago. This wonderful museum certainly remedied that failing! The museum is housed in the",
          "Fascinating view into the actual locations these traders used to extract unwarranted profits from the local farmers and fishermen. Be sure to visit the banqueting hall that is part of the museum, located about 200 yards from the site of the trading house.",
          "We had an excellent tour of this old, authentic museum. The place makes your imagination spin as if you were living there. Nice enough gift shop.",
          "Fascinating look at the buildings as they existed centuries ago. Well maintained. The English-language tour was very enlightening and provided us with a lot of detail we would not have picked up otherwise.",
          "One admission for entrance to two sites. Visit the Hanseatic Museum first -- no lights, no heating, no fire were permitted in this storehouse building, Schoetstuene is the complement to the storehouse and is several streets away so if it burned the storehouse would not be",
          "We opted for the 30 min. guided tour, which is a must in my opinion. The tour guide was able to offer details and anecdotes not evident in the museum/house itself. It was a fascinating glimpse into a truly unique time and place. It will certainly make you appreciate almost any",
          "The first room gave info to put the museum into context. However on the way round no further info was available. We overheard a tour, and wish we had heard about it as part of the tour- would have learned more.",
          "My favorite museum in Norway so far. The reason is that the museum was in the original building used by the Hanseatic league and you were able to tour most rooms. The signage was good. I especially liked the original decorations painted on the wooden walls on the 2nd floor.",
          "The assembly room (Schotstuene) is a few blocks from the Hanseatic Museum and included in the cost of the admission to the museum. There was an English led tour group going through when we visited, so was able to get a feeling of what we were seeing. Otherwise there was no",

          "This was a highlight of our trip, as it gave us a real sense of what life must have been like to live and work in Bryggen in its heyday. We felt all the more amazed by our visit when we learned from our very knowledgeable tour guide that the museum will be closing in 2015 for",
          "This museum explained everything you didn't remember about the Hanseatic League from high school history, but in a way that you'll never forget it now. It was so so interesting! Check out the beds with the trap doors to spy into the next room . . .",
          "Good to visit if you are interested in the Hanseatic German merchant's league. Otherwise missable & probably unintelligible unless guided through as there is not much English signage.",
          "This is a fascinating museum, with plenty of information about Hanseatic League history available on stands, to supplement the well-preserved interior of the office/house/warehouse. You can join English-language tour at several points a day, or explore on your own. The entry",
          "This is a must see in Bergen. Originally considered strange the owner of this location collected wares from closing down warf locations. Now it's a museum and you can get an authentic glance at the lifestyle of hanseatiske traders in the 1600s.",
          "If you're wandering around the bryggen, you should understand its history. This museum, in a preserved market house, does an excellent job of explaining the Hanseatic League and how the merchant system worked. The displays did an excellent job explaining the process, but get",
          "We spent an hour exploring the wooden museum. 90kr for an adult. All boards have English sections. Fine way to pass an hour.",
          "We visited Hanseatic museum as part of the Bryggen walking tour. The guide was fantastic and the history of the Germanic trade was clearly and cleverly explained. The museum is a wonderful living exhibit and essential part of a visit to Bergen.",
          "The Hanseatic Museum is a collection of rooms that were used by traders in the Baltic area in the 1700's and later. The spaces are crowded and the walls and stairs are not always straight but it does give a good sense of what it might have been life to live and work in this type",
          "It's very dark lit and small, but that gives you a taste of how it was back in time when this placed was originally used. There are lots of information on the walls to read about the history. Part of the entrance fee is entrance to Sch\u00f8tstuene, less then 5min walk away.",
          "I've lived in Bergen for 9 years and often play tour guide, but this was my first trip to the Hanseatiske Museum. I thought the ticket price was a little high at 90 nkr ($11), but we had a 50% coupon from visiting the Coastal Museum in \u00d8ygarden the day before. Paying full price",
          "On a rainy morning (plenty of those in Bergen), we chose to meander through the Hanseatic Museum. Fascinating history of the time in a well preserved 300+ year-old building meant an easy hour of learning and enjoyment. My 6 year-old son had fun and the museum offers a quiz for",
          "We walked by this museum many times before we decided to visit. It is bigger inside, and our tour guide spoke perfect English. We knew nothing about the Hanseatic League so found the museum very interesting, especially how the young German apprentices lived. It is very small,",
          "Brilliant museum. A must for any visit to Bergen. Wonderfully done and quite unique. Need to be a little nimble though so not for disabled tourists.",
          "Really cool museum, fun to walk through. take your time as it isn't that big and really soak it in. Lots of information and it is interesting, especially the stuff about the drying of the fish. Watch where you step as it is dark and the floor is uneven.",
          "I like to see bits of history that preserve an idea of what everyday life would have been like. This museum does a great job of explaining life for a Hanseatic trader, which is something that is far more interesting than I ever would have guessed.",
          "This museum offers both self-guided & guided tours. We chose the well done self-guided approach. The restored wooden building provides an excellent overview of the life style & origins of the German trading masters of Bryggen. The posters provide English summaries of the history",
          "A very interesting museum in an old house which was occupied by the Hanseatic traders and their apprentices dealing with the cod export. A great view of the tough life in the middle ages where people were sleeping in cupboard type beds to avoid being eaten by the rats. Nice",

          "The pretty and colorful Hansa house along the wharf give you an overview to life in Bergen. You can wander around in some very old buildings, see how the sailors live and their bunks etc. A must in Bergen.",
          "This museum is very well done and easily manageable in size if you are looking for something to do while in Bergen. They put on multiple guided tours throughout the day, and it was well worth stopping by early to reserve a spot since the tour guide did a great 30min overview of",

          "We did the Hanseatic Museum self guided tour. There are also guided tours. The brochure provided with your ticket is easy to follow and there are sufficient information panels throughout to add value to your visual experience. There are 400 years of history to cover and spending",
          "Be sure to get one of the guided tours. The museum is really intimate and contain a lot of objects so you might have questions to ask. Notice that there are almost no straight angles in any of the houses. Walking on the floors fells like being on a boat.",

          "Centrally located on the Bryggen, this is the former base of the Hanseatic trading league Norway. This is an excellently restored and curated house and factory in which fish were traded, prepared, and sold. Wonderful collection of original tools, clothing, beds, etc. There",
          "You really get the feel of life for the merchants and boys who worked the fish industry here three hundred years ago. What it must have been like in winter with no heating, even for the boss! Excellent guide told us all we wanted to know about collecting fish and furs in the",
          "What a great little museum! Take the guided tour to learn all about the Hanseatic League and the life of those who worked in the fish trade. Lots of good information and interesting artifacts. Admission to this museum gets you into some others.",
          "Right by the harbour in Bergen this delightful museum housed in an old merchant's home is the perfect way to learn of Bergen's history. We did go round with a guide and that may have helped but even if you don't there are guide books and you will just marvel at a perfectly",
          "You get a good feel for how the Hanseatic league operated and what life was like in Bryggen at the time. Note that the musuem is not included on the Bergen Card.",

          "Wonderful museum. I've been here many times with family and guests of our city. It's very authentic. The ticket allows you to visit museums and other groups Museum News (Sch\u00f8tstuene, Fiskerimuseum, Kystmuseet etc) for free or with a discount of 50%. The ticket is valid 1 year.",
          "A great walk in history is this1700s living and working quarters of a Hanseatic Trader who dried, pressed and packed Norway's fish for export, while living with apprentices in these working quarters. To avoid the threat of fire, cooking and eating could only be done in Communal",
          "You are back in time. Fantastic journey to the time when modern technology was not even a dream. Craftmanship, buildings from Hanseatic times, museums giving you an outlook from time 1500. Do not miss it when you are in Bergen!",
          "The main building of the museum is well worth a visit - with lots of information about the life of merchants and workers in the trading houses as well as the fishing processes and boats. The interior is remarkably well preserved and feels a bit like a ship! I most enjoyed",
          "Fascinating place. It was a bit smelly in the downstairs rooms, but you got use to it. Explained how the fish were processed and stored with the implements and barrels used. Also history of the Hanseatic League. Upstairs were the sleeping quarters, it was just like being on",
          "This museum and the Schotstuene assembly rooms were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is one of the oldest trading houses in the old part of Bergen. The museum gives you an opportunity to see how the merchants and the workers lived in the 1700's. The Hanseatiske Museum",
          "There were 2 tours in English -- at 11:00AM and Noon. The guide was informative, and it was a great way to learn about Norwegian history. Definitely take the tour, as without a guide, I would imagine, it is a ho-hummer!",
          "Interesting look into the Hanseatic League in bergen. If you have the time, it is definitely worth seeing.",
          "We really liked this museum and seeing the inside the office and living quarters of days past. Check it out.",
          "The two museums are at opposite ends of Bryggen, but are both part of the same story - Bergen's role as a Hanseatic port, and the importance of fish to its economy. They are a fascinating glimpse into the past, and the living and working conditions of merchants of the time.",
          "An amazing museum -- kept dark and cold as were the homes and businesses along Bergen's Bryggen (no fires or candles for fear that the wooden structures would burn down -- as they did seven times between the late 13th and mid twentieth centuries. Much to be learned and wondered",
          "This museum is a great opportunity to see exactly how the merchant/traders lived 300 years ago. The rooms in which they slept, ate and worked. Very nicely presented and preserved.",
          "I really enjoyed this museum. I learned a lot about the Hanseatic League and life in those times. Well worth it and one of the best museums in Bergen.",
          "So much of the city of Bergen was related to the Hanseatic history. Therefore an understand of the way of life of the Hanseatic merchant is very crucial as the visitor stroll through the city. Amazingly the Hanseatic was related to the German and their network in controlling",
          "This museum gives a real insight into the lives of the Hanseatic merchants and their apprentices. Be careful because the stairs are steep and the ceilings low but it's just as it would have been hundreds of years ago.",
          "....and entrance to this museum is included. It's a tremendous value for 120 kroner. You get the walking tour and entrance to the Hanseatic Museum and the Bryggens (meeting point) museum (next to the Radisson hotel. Entrance to both museums together is 160 kroner alone, so to",
          "Well worth doing, though quite pricey. Ticket entitled you to free entry to an associated part of the museum a short walk away. A guide (person) was available, though still interesting without. Gift shop expensive and not very exciting.",
          "This museum is fascinating in terms of helping you to understand the commercial history of Western Norway and Bergen as part of the centuries-long Hanseatic League. We saw the museum as part of the walking tour that starts at the Bryggen Museum--our guide really added value to",
          "This museum is very well planned. You get to see what it was like during the Hanseatic period and what was going on in Bergen at the time. It has a great primer on the Hanseatic League and then you go up into what the living conditions at the time were like. Hint - very tight",
          "This is a very interesting museum with English information throughout. All is well displayed & informative. Think it should be part of the Bergen Card discount scheme.",
          "Interesting stop as part of our tour, but I can't imagine visiting this museum without a guide. There's not really much signage, and the stories are a big part of understanding what you're looking at in the museum. Be sure to check out the fish market across the street for",
          "Museum gave a good insight into the trading system in the 14th century and the tough life the merchants and their apprentices lived. Well worth the visit.",
          "We found this museum fascinating and enjoyed it very much. We were however a little frustrated by the lack of information to put the place and rooms into context even with the Hanseatic Museum Guide book. Later we visited Bryggen, the Bryggen visitors centre and we read Bryggen",
          "In college, I double majored in Economics and History...I'm a nerd for this sort of stuff. If you're not, its probably more of a 3 or 4 star kind of museum for the 90kr/$12 entrance fee. Walking around this old fishing building was like stepping back in time...if I could turn",
          "We enjoyed our walk round the museum, it killed half an hour (at a slow pace, reading pretty much everything) waiting for our train. Wouldn't really recommend people do it as a main attraction though, I got a little bored. But if you've got interest in the subject then it's",

          "Lovely place and you can really immerse yourself in the time and place where the Hanseatic org is still operating with the sight, smell and feel of the museum. Pity there is no English tour when we went but the receptionist was kind enough to lend us an English language book",
          "The authentic (really old) interior of this museum is way cool. We arrived at opening time, so we were all alone on our visit. It was like stepping back in time -- the crooked walls, faded paint, and worn corners seemed to tell the story of the old merchants here. I liked it.",
          "We were looking for a museum to go too so we checked out the description in the guide book. Admission was about $10 US per person. What an awesome building. This museum gives a history of the fishing in Bergen and the relationships with the Germans. You can see how these",

          "Definitely try to time your visit with availability of English language tour. Not for accessibility challenged, lots of steep narrow stairs. Also pretty dark and close, so not for claustrophobes. Interesting to learn about the lifestyle of a typical Hanseatic trader. While I was",
          "There are so many stories that bring this area to life. Our guide Nina presented a good background to the area by wandering through lanes at the back before we entered the museum. This was worthwhile as it put the museum into context. If you have problems with stairs or dark",

          "OK, I do appreciate that some might find this a bit dull, don't go expecting a multi-media song and dance display but we were enthralled by a journey around this building. It gave us a real feel for what it must have been like in the old wooden structures of Bergen. The nice guy",

        "wiki": "Fl\u00f8yen or Fl\u00f8yfjellet is one of the \"city mountains\" in Bergen, Hordaland, Norway. Its highest point is 400 m (1,300 ft) above sea level. The name could originate from fl\u00f8ystangen or a weather vane that was set up to indicate the direction of the wind for sailing ships. The view of the Bergen peninsula makes Fl\u00f8yfjellet a popular attraction among tourists and locals alike. It has a funicular system called Fl\u00f8ibanen that transports passengers from the center of Bergen to a height of 320 m (1,050 ft) in roughly eight minutes.\n\n\n== Hiking ==\nThere are several hiking options on Fl\u00f8yen itself, or one can continue further on to Vareggen or over Vidden to Ulriken. Fl\u00f8yfjellet provides signed hiking roads to Bl\u00e5mannen, Rundemannen, and Sandviksfjellet. At midtfjellet at the foot of Bl\u00e5mannen there is a kiosk called Brushytten.\nThe roads and paths down from Fl\u00f8yen are floodlit in the winter months and are popular for sledding.\n\n\n== Fl\u00f8ibanen ==\n\nFl\u00f8ibanen is an 850-meter (2,790 ft)-long electric cable funicular that pulls two wagons between Fl\u00f8yen and the station at Vetrlidsallmenningen in Bergen city centre. It also has three stations: Promsgate, Fjellveien and Skansemyren and it was opened in 1918. Since the opening Fl\u00f8ibanen has carried over 48 million people to and from Fl\u00f8yfjellet. Over the past few years passenger numbers have averaged 1 million per year. Over the years, Fl\u00f8ibanen has cemented its position as Bergen's most popular tourist attraction and according to the Norwegian Council for Tourism, Fl\u00f8ibanen was Norway's fourth most visited tourist attraction in the 2001 summer season. Most of the traffic occurs in the summer months from May to September.\nFl\u00f8yen station is 320 m (1,050 ft) above sea level and it is the last stop at the top. There is also a viewpoint. In 2002 the site was rebuilt for 46 million NOK, the viewpoint was extended and is called Fl\u00f8ytrappene. This is a broad staircase which goes from the station stop to Fl\u00f8ien Folkerestaurant. There are countless hiking paths, and there is one road intended for cars.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Floyen.no\" Company site of the Funicalar company.\n\"Bergenbyarkiv.no\" \"Encyclopedia about the history in Bergen.\nWalks and hikes on Fl\u00f8yen",

          "We used this as part of a tour. It was great excellent views, but we were lucky to have sun, so could see everything below. Well worth the trip.",
          "The journey on the Funicular was great, amazing views going up the mountain and didn't have to wait long for the next train to arrive. Loads to do at the top for all ages, loved it",
          "A short walk up the hill from the port to buy tickets and get onto the vanecular. Nice views on the journey up and once at the top. A shop and cafe to visit at the top. Not sure if the hotel was open.",
          "This is a must when in Bergen the train is fun and the views are amazing. We went up twice once at night luckily it was a clear evening and once during the day. We then went on a hike which was amazing. We followed a trail from our phone and it was easy to follow. Beautiful",
          "This is a must see when in Bergen. Don\u2019t need to go up the funicular as there is a nice 3km (each way) walk up and down. Views from the top are spectacular and would recommend to go up by day and night.",
          "We had a one day Bergen card that gives one return trip on the funicular. We did not have to queue but at the top it was very cold so we did not stay up there long. On the return we were the only passengers.",
          "This is a must-do when in Bergen. The Funicular is great, very regular and reasonably priced. The views from Mount Floyen are absolutely stunning. We didn't have the best weather and still enjoyed it, I can imagine in the summer on a clear day it would be even better.",
          "It is a very nice and popular place. You can get there by the funicular or you can walk. The view of the city is nice and the surroundings on the top are fine as well. You can go from the top of Floyen to the peek of Rundemanen that provides even more amazing views the whole",
          "When it was raining in town, a quick trip up the funicular led us to a snowing, snow covered paradise, especially when you walk away from the main tourist areas. A must to do at night, as well as during the day",
          "100nok each for a cable car ride for great views over Bergen. It was f f f freezing up there! Despite that, children played on the equipment. It doesn\u2019t take a lot of time to enjoy the experience then it\u2019s a short ride back to town.",
          "Fabulous way to spend a couple of hours - walking around in the snow admiring the beautiful views with an ever changing day - snow, clouds, clear, bit of sun peaking through. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience.",
          "Great little funicular but very steep. Climbs circa 2,500 feet. Great views from the top all over Bergen and the walk down is about 3km which takes about 40 minutes. Good test for your knees! A must do if in Bergen.",
          "Taking the funicular to the Mount Floyen only takes 10 mins and cost you 50 NOK one way which makes is one of the cheapest tourist things to do in Bergen. From the historic Mount Floyen you get a real good overview of the town and there is a classy cafe/restaurant at the top",
          "Spectacular views, especially at sunset/sunrise. For the mere cost of the train I would definitely recommend the quick trip up. Nice nature walks, coffee shop and gift shop at the top as well.",
          "A must do in Bergen ! Even in winter the view at the top is spectacular ! Reasonably priced as well at 100Kroner for a return trip. Easy to find and carriages leave at regular intervals so no long wait !",
          "The view from Mount Floyen is simply stunning and well worth making the trip up in the modern Funicular. Don't go if the cloud cover is low as you won't see anything. We loved it.",
          "Don\u2019t get too carried away. Great thing to do on a sunny day whatever the season. We went up the funicular and took some snacks with us. Amazing how much fun you can have in a snowy troll garden and a long and winding path back down to Bergen. Great way to spend an afternoon.",
          "My partner and I took the funicular up Mount Floyen in January. Gave you an amazing view of the city, so amazing in fact we went up twice (at night then the next morning)! The funicular was so easy to use. We pre bought our tickets so everything was ready to go!",
          "We were excited to take the funicular to a beautiful spot above the city to enjoy the view! We purchased tickets on site and were lucky to have front row seats as we traversed through tunnels and up the steep incline ! There are viewing platforms and restaurants up top as well",
          "Very efficient service and great was to see Bergen. We were lucky to have a clear day. Highly recommend",
          "While expensive for a short ride. The experience is beautiful . We saw it before sunset through rain and shine in 30 minutes. The view is really special . There are a couple of stops and many trails to explore the beautiful area.",
          "The ride from town to the top of the mountain on the Funicular was wonderful. The view from the top was spectacular. I was last in Bergen fourteen years ago, and it showed me just how much the town had grown in that time. It was not very busy when we went up, so we could walk",
          "with the short (5 mins) rail track, you have a superb view over the city of Bergen. From the top, you can walk around in the woods. Attractive shop and restaurant.",
          "This is a popular attraction, even in winter, we were lucky as it was fine weather and reasonably clear. Would love to visit another time and hike back down the mountain. We did enjoy a wander through some of the park land and play ground area.",
          "Highly recommend in any weather as the trail is straight forward and easy to follow. The view from the top was absolutely stunning with some classic Norwegian Troll statues to greet you at the top.",
          "This is a 'must do' on any trip to Bergen. We went in the early evening so had a wonderful view of all the lights over & around Bergen. Once at the top there are some great walks and breathtaking scenery. Not to be missed!",
          "It was a nice experience to climb here, the view was good, at the top there was a nice souvenir shop, cafe and a small lake. The nature in Norway is realy beautiful. I\u2019m happy about this trip but do not expect something fabulous there\ud83c\udfde.",
          "We did two trips up the railway, one at night time and one in the morning. It is worth doing it in both lights to see the view. Tickets aren't very expensive, around \u00a38 GBP per person and can be booked very easily on the Floibanen App, then scan the QR on your phone at the",
          "A great way to see Bergen. There are great views on the way up and down and when you are up the top you get to see all of Bergen. You can then walk around the lake and forest and you can walk back down to the centre. The Funicular is a great attraction and there is a gift shop",
          "I LOVED this so much! It's no wonder it's Bergen's top attraction! The funicular was lots of fun to ride, both up and down. You can buy tickets from the ground station but I bought them from the Floibanen website. It was super quick and easy and you get tickets emailed to you",
          "There is so much I love about the Norwegian Way of life. And travelling up the Floyen captures pretty much everything in one visit. Here we have a fantastic tourist attraction that gives superb views of the city of Bergen, the surrounding mountains and even as far the the North",
          "We were heading to this attraction and they told us that in this period having one of those Bergen card will make it free. Brilliant news! We jumped into ond of those things that took us on the top. I would definitely recomand to stay by the right side when you go up and to go",
          "To avoid the crowds one sunny day we waited until the late afternoon to take the funicular up to Mt Floyen. Recommended for wonderful views over Bergen. The cable car ride up is scenic and fun; there are enjoyable walks at the top...we even saw a few goats wandering near us.",
          "nice place where you can see the city of BERGEN from the top you will find coffeeshop do not mess it it is worth it",
          "Had only one day in Bergen and the weather was freezing but dry Took the trip up the mountain and really enjoyed it Disappointed not to get a cuppa at the top everything was closed due to New Year but still loved the view and will definitely be back in the summertime",
          "We went up the mountain as we purchased the Bergen card which gave us x2 return tickets each. Views were stunning, didn't have to wait long for the cable car up and back. Probably would only do it once. There's some walking trails and a cafe up the top - however we just took the",
          "The view from the top is beautiful. It\u2019s so picturesque. Bergen itself is a beautiful town with its surroundings and mountains and it\u2019s harbour. This is one of the places in Bergen that you Must visit!",
          "When you get off from the Fl\u00f8ybanen you automatically see an amazing view from Bergen that you won't believe your eyes",
          "Best to check the weather before buying any tickets up. If the weather is bad, you see nothing. We were greeted with fogs at the top after taking the funicular up, no view of the city and with the cafe closes we were out of the place by the next ride down.",
          "This should be on your to do list when you visit Bergen. A beautiful view. If you are afraid of heights, You might experience some unease when you\u2019re on the top.",
          "Used this as a return journey twice this break and it\u2019s been fantastic! We purchased a Bergen card at the airport which covers the Funicular, so we\u2019ve enjoyed it a few time\u2019s and planning another trip in the morning (snow up top!).",
          "We have some free time and so took a cable car up . I didn\u2019t expect much but have no regrets. The view is fantastic and it\u2019s more than just a viewing place. There are parks and playgrounds etc . Really nice.",
          "This funicular up to the top provided an excellent vista of Bergen, one of the best in the world. There was a troll garden, some short hikes, some mountain goats. The weather changed pretty quickly up here so good idea to have a rain coat handy.",
          "Great way to view Bergen, I recommend going near the end of the day to view Bergen in both daylight and then later light up at night. Funicular ride is nothing special, just a means of getting to the top which is well worth it. Heaps of fun playgrounds for kids at top as well as",
          "Great way to get an introduction to Bergen and get your bearings. Wonderful views and lots of hiking options from the top. Good cafe and shop too if you need it. My suggestion is bring a picnic, walk and enjoy.",
          "We originally wanted to go to the other cable car, but it was closed so decided on this instead. This was actually the better one in reality for what we wanted: stunning views, good distance from the centre, not too busy and a place to warm up with a hot drink at the top. No",
          "Beautiful views over the city of Bergen from the top after taking the cable car to the top. Stunning alpine walks to come back down into the city which transport you into another world.",
          "Very pleasant, straightforward outing with a lovely and substantial; walk down the mountain afterwards. We only took the Funicular up, and walked down. If it is dry (it usually isn\u2019t in Bergen!) its a nice thing to do",
          "When staying at Bergen we went to Mount Floyen and the funicular. The view was awesome and the place is very nice and clean. It's a must stop. There's a souvenir shop were you can find interesting and different things.",
          "By the time we got to the top it had started raining again (we need to light more candles for the weather gods). But even with rain and a bit of fog we could still see the harbor. (The funicular mugs are a hoot)",
          "Great view, we went up to see the amazing bergen's sunset, from this point the view is awesome. You can also enjoy a good hot chocolate cup in the store. Very nice forrest to go hiking!.",
          "We took an amazing Viking cruise that ended up on Bergen. We took the funicular up Mount Floyen and the view was OUT OF THIS WORLD! We had such amazing weather, and everyone seems to be in a great mood. It was a memory I will cherish!",
          "When in Bergen a must trip on the Funicular railway to the top of Mount Florentine\u2019s has to be done.The views are spectacular and a photographers delight. A nice cafeteria and walks",
          "Amazing views from the top of Bergen, make sure you check the weather before going up. My visit in the winter was on a good day of visibility and you could see the whole harbour! Great for photos and seeing the town as a whole! I chose to walk down and it was amazing!",
          "Floibanen is very popular attraction in Bergen for all people. Locals like the upper station of the funicular line as the starting point for hikes. We enjoyed panoramic views from the top",
          "The rail is inexpensive. Views from all areas no need to fight for front row as it is a steep climb. Take your time at the top then wander back down-- spectacular scenery.",
          "We loved Mount Floyen so much that we went up the funicular twice during our weekend stay. The views over Bergen from the summit are stunning and there are lots of woodland trails that you can follow including a couple of trails that lead down into the city.",
          "Took the Fl\u00f8ibanen cable car to go up Mount Floyen. The view going up is stunning especially if you are at the bottom car. Restaurant cafe, walking path, goats at the top, its worth the view. You can also walk up or down but since we decided to walk our way to Ulriken (13km),",
          "Beautiful views and lots to see and do. Great gift shop, playground and very friendly staff. Well worth the visit.",
          "The funicular is a good experience. Once on top of Mount Floyen, you are treated to beautiful overhead views of Bergen and the surrounding countryside and the seas. You can also take walks on their good walking trails.",
          "I took the furnicular up to the top (return ticket is 95NOK). It was beautiful from up there. There were Advent candles still light and a small playground next to a Boutique. Do visit!",
          "The weather was unexpectedly super nice so we could enjoy the sunrise view from mt Fl\u00f8yen.The view from the top is amazing if you are here in sunny days! In winter, you will need to be well dressed up.You can see this amazing view as well coz it is opened early mornings !",
          "The funicular railway is a must do whilst in Bergen for the best views in the city. I'd recommend standing in the bottom carriage for good photo opportunities on the way up. We decided to walk back down to the bottom of the mountain. It is quite slippy on the way down, so",
          "The viewpoint is worth visiting and there are plenty of activities to choose from once you are up there!",
          "Worth it just for the weird railcar going up there, but then at the top there isn't a cooler view of Bergen. Go just before sunset to get the coolest view!",
          "We went on the funicular (tickets purchased online which allowed us to walk straight to the entry gates) for 5min ride to the top. The funicular stopped on 3 other stops along the hill for access to stops along the hill. Great lookout platform at the top on Mt Floyen. As we",
          "We came up the funicular twice during our three night stay in Bergen and absolutely loved the walks at the top. The views are amazing and it\u2019s a great walk with views back down to the city. Was great even in December. Bring good walking shoes if you want to follow some of the",
          "We took the floibannen faniucular from its station in bergen city centre with a return ticket for 85 NOK per person twice through our trip as the view was most fabulous. On the second time we went all the way to the top then walked down to the next faniucular station and back to",
          "It is just a few minutes walk from the \"Bryggen\".The short 5 to 6 mins funicular ride took us to Mt Floyen, a fantastic area on earth with beautiful natural surroundings and walking/hiking paths. Amazing views from the top of Mt Floyen.",
          "Fantastic place to visit with families. Children playgrounds/ plenty of walking tours/ grill/ wonderful view and lake",

          "The funicular ride is not very long but does take you up to a spectacular viewing area. We got free tickets to do the ride as part of our hop on-hop off bus ticket. I can understand why this is such a popular activity and it is just a few hundred metres from the central area and",
          "Bergen is a beautiful city, seen on the ground. To see the lay of the land and witness the city in its beautiful location you need to get up high and the Floibanen makes that possible in the shortest amount of time. From the top of Mt.FLoyen you get to see the Big Picture. We",
          "Absolutely loved heading up to the top of Mount Floyen. The views were beautiful and when it was raining down in town it was snowing up the mountain. We went for a long walk in the surrounding alpine forrest which was beautiful and completely empty. We felt like we had entered",
          "This was such a fun, unique experience, with spectacular views over Bergen from the top of the mountain, even on a wet, overcast day. There were lots of opportunities for hiking and canoeing that we didn\u2019t take advantage of due to the weather, but the trip up for the views was",
          "The funicular ride to the top of Mount Floyen takes about 10 minutes. The view from the top station is spectacular. We were lucky to experience a beautiful sunset from there and watched as the city lights gradually came on as it got darker. You can easily spend 2-3 hours just",
          "Riding the Mount Floyen funicular is a must to do during a Bergen visit. The views are spectacular and the hiking is great too. The woods make you feel like you\u2019re in a Hans Christian Anderson childhood story. The hike down is easy and brings you through some very interesting",
          "Took a trip with Fl\u00f8ibanen and it was a fantastic experience. Beautiful veiw over Bergen. Good service and very accesible with wheelchair, a lot of space.",
          "This is a great way to get an overview of the lovely city of Bergen as the comfortable and modern carriage lifts you up the mountain and the view opens out below. We really enjoyed looking down on the fireworks to celebrate the Festival of Light, marking the start of the",
          "This was a treat & the last part of our tour group's collective outing. Thankfully the heavy rain stopped & the sun came out before arrived here. The view of Bergen below was enchanting. I walked a bit on lovely, wooded hiking paths - they extend back to the city, to the",

          "Easy to get to by the funicular. Nice to walk back down. And if you have time, take a walk into the mountains behind Fl\u00f8yen. Enjoy.",
          "The rides for both up and down is worthy of pictures taking. It is my personal opinion that the last cabin is the best for photography shots. There were nice restaurant as well cafe with cake and coffee. Toilet is free, next to the cafe.",
          "A must do when you come to Bergen. The funicular railway takes you to the top of Mount Floyen in under ten minutes and reveals a fantastic vista as it ascends from street level. The views are spectacular over all of the city with added bonus of a cafe and restaurant. For the",
          "Worth taking the funicular all the way up for the great views. There are also some billy goats that are very docile and willing to let humans take photos. There is also a play area for kids and short walking trails. There is a lake but it looked quite muddy and had probably seen",
          "The view from the top of the funicular was gorgeous, but what I really loved was the nearby lake - it's a short stroll away, but feels a world away, and on summer evenings it's filled with locals enjoying the long days. I was there in June just before peak season, there's wasn't",
          "We were hiking last summer up the Fl\u00f8yen. Nice path roads. Very nice view from the top overlooking Bergen Sentrum. Good hiking activity for the whole family. Has a big playground at the top. Also went further to Rundamanen Tower one nice summer day ago. Bring a good camera!",
          "Taking a trip up the funicular to the top of Mt Floyen is an absolute must when in Bergen (you could walk, but...) The journey only takes 5 minutes and is well worth the 95kr ticket. The views from the top are outstanding, offering a panorama across the city. Once at the top,",

          "Actually I went up the path to Store Tindevatnet and Rundemanen radio tower. If it wasn't dark, I'd have probably goe further into the mountains or made a roundtrip to Ulriken. Awesome views and nature!",
          "We sent in September and even though we arrived early with prepaid tickets there was an incredibly long queue to board the funicular. It was jam packed when we finally made it into a car and taking photos was very limited on the way up because of being so tightly packed into",

          "The funicular made our trip to the top of Mount Floyen much easier. It was a little crowded but we went in July (to be expected). But the park at the top was fun for our 9 year old son and 2 teenage boys like the forest hike. Its a paved path which I'm sure is welcome for",
          "Going to the Funicular was part of a very busy day so we didn\u2019t have a great deal of time to explore it properly. On arrival we were fast tracked through to go up but it\u2019s very popular and we did spend half an hour queuing. At the top there is a great veiw of the whole town. I",
          "We caught the funicular. It is an easy walk from where the ship docked.This is a must when visiting Bergen. The views are amazing. Make sure you walk to the lake when at the top. We had read that it gets very busy so we left the ship straight after breakfast. We spent a few",
          "The ride up to Fl\u00f8yen is comfortable. The view from the top is amazing and gives you a great photo opportunity. The restaurant has a varied menu and the food is great. Fun shop with lots of knitwear and souveniers. Play area for the kids and a fantastic hike. Well worth a visit.",
          "We had one evening in Bergen and we didn\u2019t expect much. The woman at the hotel suggested we take the funicular before sunset and then walk down. The ride up was nice, and the views of the city at arrival were stunning. BUT the walk down was the icing on the cake. It was a",
          "Wonderful photo opportunities. Go it alone if you are on a cruise liner - save yourself \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3's. Go early and miss the crowds - it is easily walkable and so much cheaper! If you are on a cruise ship you would have to walk back anyway. Lovely walks at top and a small area for",
          "The bottom station is only a short stroll from the main harbour area, and it is a simple case of queuing for your ticket and waiting for the next available trip up. Although the total journey isn't that far, it is a steady old journey up, with several stops on the way. Once at",
          "Take the funicular from town center to the mountain. At the top station you'll find woods and hiking paths to fit enyone. After half an hour walk you'll be in the high mountain with scenery you'll never forget, if the weather is at your side. In special weather conditions you",
          "On a family trip to Norway, our first stop was in Bergen. I'd read about the funicular ride, and suggested it to my family as we wandered around the city. We took it to the top of Mount Floyen. The ride was short, but it was fun to watch our journey up the mountain from the",
          "wasn't sure what to expect, but the 8-10 minute ride on the funicular gave pleasant views down into Bergen. very beautiful on the clear bright day we had. The view from the top is great, and there are easy walks through the woods at the top. There are food and gifts shops too",
          "On clear days, you can see all the way to the ocean. The view over the city is priceless. The last years, they have upgraded the area, and you can find nice gravel roads to walk, or go by bike. There is a restaurant, a cafeteria and a souvenir shop. For the kids, there are",
          "The walk hike up Floen is both enjoyable with a slight healthy challenge along with the natural beauty . Then the view from the top of the vast beauty of the area along with a wonderful restaurant tops it off.",
          "This is a nice but steep trip. You can walk up in most kind of shoes but would recommend to drop high heels. The view over the town is really nice. And if you feel up for it, there are lots of hiking tracks in the area.",
          "Best time is to get just before sunset and see it n day light and wait a few minutes more for sunset. When it's dark, the whole city lits up. G on a sunny day otherwise it can be quite muddy for hiking.",

          "If you\u2019re keen to catch a bird eye view of Bergen, then I would recommend this. If you think you\u2019re fit enough to get up there, then you may consider walking up which probably takes about 45-min or there\u2019s also an option to cycle up. Else, you can pay NOK50 per person for a one",
          "We caught the cable car up to the top for 45 NOK on line which was a slight saving and also to gain time better spent walking around the top area. The information centre was closed so we couldn\u2019t get a map but phone coverage was good so we knew where we were and felt safe. Heaps",
          "So beautiful. It gives a panorama view of the fjord and city of Bergen. The walk up is magnificent with parks, small water falls, trees...",

          "You have to go up Mt. Floyen if you are in Bergen. And if like us you have little ones in tow or do not have enough time and energy for a hike, definitely take the funicular. The ride in the little glass cubbies of the funicular itself is a lot of fun. We were lucky to get in at",

          "We thoroughly enjoyed this Funicular. We hiked around up top and visited the goats. There were a lot of people the day we went up as it was a rare blue sky day. Go early if the weather is nice. By the time we came down the lines were massive.",
          "My friend and I visited in September and had a sunny, warm day. Nice spot for a beer, took funicular. Many hikers walked up.",
          "great activity, with gorgeous view from the top, and pretty serious climb up. Going up with funicular and walking down is an easier option if you are not into hiking.",
          "We weren't sure what the weather had in store, so we decided to take the Funicular up to the top and hike around before making our way back down to Bergen. After a very minor amount of rain, we had a beautiful, sunny day with great views of Bergen and also spotted a rainbow!",
          "Outstanding view of Bergen harbor while riding on the funicular and from the top. Interesting goat use to maintain the hills and goat hut was very interesting to see. The restaurant at the top of mountain was good and had excellent views as well.",
          "We went late afternoon and we weren\u2019t disappointed, the views were amazing, we went too late to try the cafe or the restaurant so I can\u2019t say what they were like, but well worth a visit if only for the fantastic views.",
          "Amazing views of Bergen and the Harbour on the way up and when you get to the top. Definitely need to come up here on a clear day to take in the views. Walk was great, fresh air and amazing views. One for all the family to enjoy. Walks are well sign posted. Highly recommend.",
          "We visited as part of a tour with Cruise & Maritime! Heading up the Funicular is a great experience and you can see everything with windows all around you! At the top there are incredible views of Bergen, as long as you have a clear sky, and your guide can point out some famous",
          "The destination at the top was not especially scenic. The best part of the experience was the winding walk down. It is paved and easy for all abilities, with changing views of Bergen's waterfront.",
          "It was a cloudy rainy morning so I checked with the ticket office before purchasing tickets. They have cameras to check the views, which were good so we purchased and went up. We stayed a short time because the weather turned and any plans to hike down were dashed. But the",
          "Getting the funicular up Mount Floyen is well worth doing! We decided to get the funicular up but walk back down which was a really lovely walk with beautiful scenery.",
          "This is a beautiful way to get a perfect view of Bergen. As others have said, buy your tickets online in advance to skip the line. Although it was crowded at the top of the hill, once we walked away from the main area 5-10 minutes, there were lots of hiking paths at different",
          "Modern funicular, great journey up and down, fast and frequent, great views from the top and not too long waiting at either end. Like everything in Norway, not cheap but that's life. Tip: go 2pm or so - morning queues up have gone and coming down has a short wait",
          "This was exciting little trip. You have a nice view from the funicular but also beautiful view from the top. We decided to walk back down which was really good idea as it is downhill and not that long anyways. For photos best place is of course on the front (down window) of the",
          "Enjoyable, relaxing ride up Mount Floyen. Great views and trails to walk at the top. Everything was well maintained and the staff we met were all helpful. Loved riding on the funicular going down for the great views of the city.",
          "Prebook your ticket online if you can (we did) - otherwise theres a long queue to buy the tickets. We took the Funicar up & thankfully it wasn't pouring with rain so we walked down, which was a beautiful, peaceful walk. Worth doing.",
          "A highlight of our tour's visit to Bergen was a ride on the funicular to Mount Floyen. Fortunately, it was a nice, warm and sunny afternoon with good visibility; the view from the top was great, providing many photo opportunities, particularly of the harbour. Souvenir shops and",
          "The return tickets for the Floibanen was 95 NOK when we visited in mid-Oct. The Floibanen leaves for either direction every 15 mins in the afternoon, and stops along smaller stations along the way. The restaurant building was undergoing renovation works, while the Cafe and",
          "It was a pleasant trip with good coffee and pastries at the top. The view of Bergen is pretty awesome.",
          "Very fast funicular railway and lovely walks at the top. Goats are a bonus! We recommend you got at the weekend as the big restaurant is open serving 4 kinds of soup which were all delicious( we tried them all!) you buy a bowl and have as many servings as you like!",
          "On a sunny day plan to get to the Floibanen before 10 am to beat the crowds. We got there at 9:45 am and it wasn't too crowded. In the afternoon as we were coming back down, we saw that it was packed to the gills with people standing in line and waiting to ride up Mt. Floyen.",
          "The lines are long but the view at the top is worth it. Wish we would have purchased tickets ahead of time to make the wait a little shorter. You can also grab a bite to eat at the top so it doesn\u2019t have to be a quick up and down. If you have more time you could hike down.",
          "I've ben on funiculars before and worried that they were old or not well maintained. This one is the opposite- clean, modern, efficient, and makes one confident that they are it all in order. quick and fun way to get up and down the mountain.",
          "Our group took the funicular (floibanen) both ways. The ride was well-organized and it was fascinating to see the sites on the way. Arriving at the top provided an amazing view of the city. We happened to choose a sunny, warm day which added to the quality of our little",

          "I took the train up Mount Fl\u00f8yen, stopped for a coffee, then walked through the moss covered forest back down to Bergen. The train has fast & cheap (for Norway). At the top there\u2019s choice of places to eat & drink. There are two main routes down the mountain. One on tarmac, one",
          "A must when visiting Bergen ,for the view alone . We visited at night and the views were superb . The cost is \u00a310 or 100 kr depending if you want a return journey as you can walk down ,weather permitting .",
          "We were lucky to be there on a clear day so the view was quite spectacular. I recommend going early in the day to beat the crowds though.",
          "Nice way to enjoy panoramic Bergen. A nice and quick way to escape city rush. You are in the wilderness within minutes. In summer you can hike in the trails. In winter you can ski. Not to forget all the activities for the kids up there.",
          "This is a definite must do when in Bergen. Don\u2019t miss the troll in the children\u2019s playground and the cashmere goats. Great views!",
          "I was able to visit Mount Floyen via the funicular while in Bergen. Its a great activity for all ages and you can get some great pics of thr city from the top. The cost for one roundtrip adult was 95 NK but you csn buy a one way ticket and walk down although I believe that would",

          "Raining cats and dogs and what seemed like a Force 9 gale did not deter us from riding the Floibanen, a must-do on our one day visit to this lovely city. Despite the weather the clouds thinned from time to time and we caught glimpses of the city laid out in front of us. The",
          "Must do activity in Bergen; fun little ride up and the reward at the top of the incredible view. If you follow the path immediately around to the left behind the cafe there\u2019s a lovely little spot with benches. We went up twice; once in the day - got a 1 way ticket and walked",
          "Took the Funicular train up to Mt. Floyen on Sept 13. The train was jam packed both ways & we had no place to sit but the journey was only about 10 minutes - could see the surrounding better if seated Nothing much to see on the way up or down. As it was raining heavily when we",
          "The ride was fun and the views at the top were beautiful. Sadly for us it was raining the entire time we were there, but it was still a very worthwhile activity.",

          "The cable car ride up to Floyen is fun and interesting if not a bit crouded, but well worth the journey. The view from the top at Floyen is SPECTACULAR in every way possible. The air is clear and crisp and the views of the valley and city below are amazing. I was overwhelmed",

          "The fenicular ride is a train which is pulled to the top of Mount Floyen from which you can get panoramic views over Bergen. To get the full effect, you need to go on a good day with plenty of visibility, rather than when it is raining, which it does a lot in Bergen. If you are",
          "Great view of Bergen and sunset. Closes early so don't expect drinks or dinner at sunset unless you arrive early enough. Worth every bit of the trip!",
          "perfect view on bergen especially on sunny days. use the cable car to go up and make a walk around on the top. nice children playground is also available. A foot-walk back to Bergen is about 3,5 km",

          "This trip up the side of the mountain is a bit thrilling and quite beautiful. When you arrive at the top the views are amazing and there are shops and lots of area to explore. While we were there an organized choir was entertaining. Very enjoyable.",
          "I preferred to deserve the scenery by hiking it up , the trip from city centre is 5EUR one way. Tickets purchased on site, gives a good view over the city",
          "The railway is great and was very busy at the weekend in October. We then spent time admiring the wonderful views of Bergen and then headed off on one of the guided walks that take you higher up the mountains and give more amazing views. We revisited a couple of days later but",

          "We travelled to the top of Mount Floyen on the Funicular. The trip was smooth and you could view some great scenery. At the top of the mountain there is a restaurant, a souvenir shop and another food outlet. You are able to walk down the mountain if you wish ( about 1 hour) or",
          "Great view looking out over the city. Can hike at the top and if you are lucky you get to see the mountain goats. There is a nice restaurant where you can get a snack or refreshment. The restaurant also has toilets and is an excellent place to go if you need to escape the",
          "We paid for one way up only and hiked down from the top. The view of the city is remarkable. They have the essential facilities at the top. Very convenient. It is a 3 kilometer walk down from the top due to the zig zag design of the path. Some parts are rocky and it requires",
          "Over 67 - Senior citizen rates apply Modern- smooth - steep- spectacular- safe - much to see and more",

          "We took the Furnicular railway from the centre of Bergen up Mount Floyen. It only takes a couple of minutes but the queues are sometimes long. Spent an hour at the top admiring the views. A guide showed us the passage our ship took out to sea. Interesting to see the oil rigs and",
          "With the sun shining we took the furnicular to Floyen to enjoy the fabulous views and hike in the woods. Being October the winter return price was only 95NOK each. The wide viewing platform provides panoramic vistas over the city and harbour. We didn't use the cafe, shop or",

          "The funicular was only about 3 blocks from our hotel, but I got lost trying to find it. Because of this, we did not have time to take a hike once we arrived on top of the mountain, which would have been fun. Despite my ineptness, we really enjoyed this activity. The views are",

          "My husband and I love to hike so we hiked the trail up to Mount Floyen instead of using the funicular. The trail is wonderful and very few people. We arrived to the top in about 45 minutes and had incredible views of Bergen. This is one of the top things to do in Bergen and",
          "Pre-purchased our ticket via a hop on hop off tour bus service. Very fortunate as the queue was enormous and the wait must have been over an hour. With our jump the queue ticket we waited a couple of minutes outside the station then started to file through the tunnel to the",
          "Go early to avoid the long lines. After leaving the funicular follow the hiking trails to climb higher for better views and to avoid the crowds. Climbed up to an old radio tower. Definitely worth the extra effort.",
          "We went up the funicular in the evening and stayed up to watch the sunset. The views were amazing. We had a little walk around the mountain while we waited for the sun to set. If it is a good day definitely try to go up for sunset.",
          "Views are beautiful once you get up but the ride up that should have been pleasurable was horrible. We were packed like sardines with few views because there were so many people. In addition the staff were rude. Not worth the money!",
          "We arrived in Bergen by cruise ship on a cloudy morning. We walked around the city for a while but the cloud wasn't liftig so we thought we would just go on the furnicular anyway for fun. We walked straight on and within a couple of minutes we were through the clouds in to",
          "Took this funicular up the mountain, modern cars, well organised. At the top you have beautiful views across Bergen. Also has a restaurant and a cafe, ate in the restaurant which was ok but eaten better places. Plenty of hikes, goats to see and a lake. Worth.the visit",
          "This is an absolute must for any visitor to Bergen! The view is spectacular! The cablecar only takes a few minutes and is very comfortable. Once up on the top, there are a couple of restaurants and lots of activities for the whole family. Highly recommended!",
          "Must do whilst in Bergen. Fantastic view of city and surrounding area. We had light snack a savoured the view. Meet the goats but don't feed them. You can spend the whole day carrying out all the activities.",
          "We climbed the mountain to see the city from the top - totally worth it! Took a lot of pictures and had a cup of coffee before we decided to come down. We will try the trails - so many to choose from!",
          "We decided to go up on the funicular railway. Beautiful views of Bergen and the harbour, Bryggen and the city in general. Short 8 min ride and a few shops at the top. Highly recommended.",
          "If you\u2019re lucky enough to be in Bergen on a bright day with good visibility, this trip is a must. There may be long queues, but two cars run continuously, and with five gates boarding from the car sides, it\u2019s not too long a wait. The view from the top is lovely, highlighting",
          "Walk up and ride down, or vice versa. There are lots of varied views of the harbor, the greater seaport area and the farmlands beyond the city. There are restaurants for refreshment and meals there too.",

          "This funicular is pretty central to Bergen cbd and can easily be reached by foot from there. You will only have to wait about 10 to 15 mins to get a carriage and it is a very steep incline . Because it also takes normal passengers from the houses on the hill it stops at a",
          "The ride up was swift and the view up was nice. But, something felt missing. Instead of being an enjoyable ride it felt like a \u2019cattle call \u2018. The car felt way over - stuffed. There was not much space in the car to turn about and admire the trip up. Once up the views were",

          "This was such a fun way to get some fantastic views of Bergen! The ride up is quick and when you get to the top, wow, it\u2019s amazing! You can have a snack or lunch or walk and visit the goats. We loved our afternoon and are still in awe of the views!",
          "Taking the team up the mountain was incredible. It is well organized as they run every 10 minutes, clean and prompt. Once on top it is hard to decide where to start taking pictures. The view is outstanding. There is a restaurant,where you can sit out side and enjoy the",
          "The ride to the top is well worth the price. Get there early and before any cruise ships offload! We went directly up but an hour later returning home there were thousands lined up for hours.",
          "This was a very quick and easy way to get a wonderful view of Bergen and was very reasonably priced. We stopped at the coffee shop and got a very nice treat there. It wasnt lunch when we went but they seemed to have some very nice soups and meals",

          "Great views , a walk at the top and a caf\u00e9, clicks lots of boxes.TOP TIP:At weekends the queue is horrendous so book on line in advance. You may wan to consider a single and bimble down the well signposted paths",
          "Completely worth the trip up for the incredible views of Bergen. We happened to time things perfectly for sunset our first night in Bergen, and it was truly impressive. It would be a great ride up and hike down for active travelers or families as well (likely 1-2 hours depending",

          "We were on a Norwegian cruise and caught the City Sightseeing bus to tour Bergen along with tickets to the Funicular, the route stops right outside the entrance. Queues are massive for the funicular so book in advance! As there is a separate line for pre-booked tickets which",

          "We had pre- booked the funicular but there was still a long wait because of the number of people. When we eventually got onto the funicular it was rather crowded so not very comfortable, however the view from the top was worth the inconvenience of getting there. We had drinks /",
          "The weather was perfect with a sunny day in Bergen. Not sure what the views would be like on a rainy day but definitely worth the cost on a nice day. We didn\u2019t try the restaurant at the top or try any trails.",
          "We had a five-hour window to take the funicular up in good weather, so we took it! The trip itself takes about five minutes, and most people stand up during the trip (there are a few seats for those in need). At the top, there is an amphitheater-style viewing area where you",
          "We walked up AND down Mt Fl\u00f8yen and we didn't regret a second. What a treat when you reach the top and look from above. The hiking trails are mainly in the forest and in the hilly residential areas of Bergen and it's fantastic to see all the beautiful old buildings and endless",
          "The round trip ticket for seniors is 95 NOK and well worth the trip. You get a tremendous view of the town of Bergen and the surrounding area. It is fun too walk around at this top and there is both a cafe and a nice restaurant. It is an easy two block walk from the wharf to",
          "Booked this trip up on line much cheaper than booking up on the the cruise ship, about \u00a38 50 per person on line and \u00a34. 75 for seniors it was worth the money but we had heavy rain still the views were amazing still enjoyed the experience.",
          "The funicular to the top of Mt. Floyen is fun. It is used by residents who live higher on the mountain, but also by tourists looking to get to the top. The views are amazing. There is a cafe at the top with beautiful sitting area. Breathtaking. Definitely go there first thing",
          "A return costs about \u20ac10,00 it\u2019s a fun experience to ride in the fl\u00f8yenbanen, but it\u2019s not more than a ride up and down. There\u2019s a great view over Bergen from the top off the hill. A small but very touristic shop, a restaurant and a small caf\u00e9. For children there\u2019s a small",

          "By all means, do take the funicular to go up to Mount Floyen.I felt excited as a small child when riding up the mountain in the small train. Once on top-the views of the city are simply amazing! There is also a restaurant and I think- a cafe where you can rest and grab something",
          "Walked over from the P&O Ventura berth and got completely soaked. Decided that the fish market was.... just a fish market and so headed to the funicular. Managed to get on quickly, tap into a guided tour and get to the top pretty quickly. Really nice up there, great views, so",
          "We were on a cruise ship that visited Bergen. We bought hop-on, hip-off bus tickets that included the funicular. That way you do not have to stay in the ticket line. It was September, so the wait was not bad. However, we had just been drenched head to foot from the constant",
          "We rode the funicular on a changeable weather day in Bergen, the norm \ud83d\ude09. On our ride up we experienced sunshine and a great view of the city and waterfront. While on the top, it was very nice for about 20 minutes before a big rainstorm. The ride up and down was very nice and",

          "If it's raining in Bergen (and it does 270 days a year) this is a great way to spend some time. Fun ride up the mountain to a spectacular view of the town and the harbor. Some shops, bathrooms and hiking from the top and you can walk to the bottom or take the funicular down.",
          "Just like ALL of the tourist beleaguered waterfront of Bergen, the funicular is dreadfully overrun. With a two to three hour wait to get on the funicular, we waited to board on the first run of the day to avoid the milling crowds. The view is lovely from the top if you can",
          "Usually, such attractions are 'if time permits.' However, Mt Floyen is certainly worth working into your schedule. The fenicular ride is short and picturesque, and the view from above (at 1,000-odd feet, not really high) was totally photo-worthy. It's quite relaxing to just walk",
          "This activity near fish market and great to go up and see bergen and most of the areas around city centre and nice to take photo from the top and nice for walking and hiking so you can take the funicular in your way up and walk to see small lake and you can walk down about 3",
          "My wife and I went to Bergen on a cruise and didn't really know what to do there. The funicular railway to the top of the mountain was fantastic. It's very busy so be prepared to que. It's worth the wait as the views are fantastic from the top. There are also some lovely walks",
          "Fantastic way to see a panorama of Bergen. The cable car takes you up the mountain in 6 minutes to the viewing platforms, and onward hiking trails. Good cafe at the top. Well worth doing",
          "How can you NOT do this if you visit Bergen? Do it early, before you walk the city. It gives you a perfect view of the city, the area around it, the harbor, etc. There's a nice little restaurant at the top at which to have a good (Norwegian) beer. And THEN you go down and",
          "We were able to find an hour of clear sky\u2019s and jumped on. The view was beautiful, we were even gifted with a rainbow. Make sure to ask for the senior price if you qualify!",

          "The funicular can get very busy, with long queues, but the trains come every few minutes. The short journey to the summit gives great views over the town and coast. It is also possible to walk to the top of the mountain, but I would suggest you take the funicular up and walk",
          "Take the tram ride up the hill and reach the station close to the viewing point. You get a beautiful view of the city of Bergen. There are small trails for a short hike as well as a lake where you can do canoeing. The restaurants ensure you are well fed! You can also walk but as",
          "It was late in this rainy day, when the sun popped its head out. Our group of friends jumped on the funicular and rode to the top of Mt. Floyen to enjoy the sunny view. Below us, Phil Collins was performing his Still Not Dead Yet concern amid a \"Blue Haze\"!",
          "The views from the top of the funicular are amazing. There are additional walking trails and a small lake at the top too. It is very busy so be prepared for a lot of people. And don't pay attention to anything online that says advanced tickets aren't necessary. If we didn't have",
          "Worth the trip just for the view alone. Lovely restaurant and cafe at the top. A welcome haven from the very wet weather.",
          "Funicular gives you head start, and you can hike a variety of paths from there. Most are accessory roads or paved sidewalks and there is little challenge. The day we went was rainy (Bergen is the rainiest city in Europe they say) and with brisk winds, making conditions",
          "Floyen was a good way to go up and see the whole town . It was breathtaking from up there . The building s the surrounding water the fresh air. Oh what a feeling. A must do activity. The restaurant up there has a limited options, but sitting there and taking all nature\u2019s beauty",
          "What a great way to see Bergen. After the excitement of listing off from the base ( we were lucky enough to be first in the queue and get a seat at the front window ) comes the panoramic view gradually unfolding, strangely interspersed by going Ned bridges and roads that wind up",
          "We queued for over an hour to get onto the Floibanen and it wasn\u2019t cheap but it was definitely worth it. The ride itself is breathtaking, climbing swiftly up a seemingly impossibly steep track from the centre of the town. The views from the top are spectacular across the whole",
          "We booked our tickets for the Floibanen (funicular) from the tourist office at the Bergen wharf so that we don't have to queue up at the entrance point since the ticket queue at the Funicular station is always huge. Well, as luck would have it, there was some mechanical",
          "It was fun going up and down the mountain on the Funicular. I would recommend planning to go up the mountain only when you get here as the weather is quite fickle in Bergen. I also recommend going early as the lines/queues can be long. The view is spectacular on a good day.",
          "This is a must do for anyone in Bergen! We only took the furnicular up and back down, we didn\u2019t do any hiking. It was a cold and rainy day, and we had just arrived after much traveling. We were able to buy tickets and get right on the furnicular with no lines (also, not sure if",

          "During HOHO bus tour, stopped here, took the tram to the top. Absolutely beautiful! There's a restaurant, cafe, hot dog stand, and gift shop at the top. A must see while in Bergen.",
          "You can save yourself oodles of time by buying your tickets on line. You will bypass a potentially long line at the tourist information centre or at the Floibanen building. With ticket in hand you can simply walk into the terminal. If you want to hike either up or down, buy a",
          "We decided to take the funicular to the top of Mt. Fl\u00f8yen, and I purchased tickets online, which turned out to be a very smart decision. When we arrived at the ticket office and entrance, we encountered a long and very slow line, but they were all waiting to purchase tickets. We",

          "The funicular ride up the mountain gives you a spectacular view across the city and is well worth it for 95NOK (not expensive by Norwegian standards). There is a cafe/restaurant at the top where you can get a snack meal/coffee. Good fun and reasonable value.",
          "We had some great views of Bergen from up here. Also saw the lucky troll and some mountain goats from here. The funicular is quite high and is a form of public transport.",
          "Norway is beautiful, though on the expensive side, the fjords are magnificent and the people are super friendly.",
          "Save time and get a ticket online - you don\u2019t have to queue for so long! The funicular is really fun. The views at the top are amazing. So good. There\u2019s a shop and restaurant and toilets. If you\u2019re lucky you\u2019ll see the goats! The queue to get down was outrageous so we decided to",
          "It was a memorable experience. Weather was perfect. We had our sandwiches and water packed. Because of kids we took the train to the mount Floyen and decided to come back on foot. Comng down on foot was great experience. Kids enjoyed a lot. We did at our own pace. Everything",
          "Well worth the effort. Best to either go early or get your tickets online to beat the ever increasing crowds during the day. We walked down. Path is sealed but does get steep in places. I am glad we did it.",

          "We hiked up Mount Floyen, which took about an hour. However, early in the morning, the wide, gravel path was almost deserted, except for the rare jogger. The huge trees provided a serene environment. Along the way, there were play structures for kids and large troll sculptures.",
          "The funicular itself was a fun and interesting ride. The views from the top of Mount Floyen were beautiful! There were some paths and trails to walk around to see different views of the surrounding mountains and the city! The goats were fun to hang out with as well!",
          "Thus attraction is extremely busy and it pays to turn up early . Can be misty but clouds generally are on the move so can change very quickly . The train is modern but packed with tourists .views are awe inspiring and a walk with the goats or to the lake is available .",

          "Try to avoid the cruise ship times or you will be pipped by flag carrying tour guides. But even so, the funicular has stunning views and lovely walks in beautiful woods behind. Dont forget your umbrella",
          "You won't be sorry if you take the ride up the tram to overlook Bergen and its harbour. The ride is very short (and steep), but once on the top, there's plenty to see and lots of interesting walks. Don't miss the \"belled\" goats which patiently put up with the tourists taking",
          "We took the funicular to the top of Mount Floyen, We did this reasonably early in the morning. At the time we thought the queue was quite long and my husband wanted to come back later. I talked him into staying in the queue as we were there. Just as well as when we returned",
          "Even if you have to endure a long line, the trip to the top of Mt. Floyen is well worth it. You get to see a 180 degree view of Bergen. If it is not raining, the view at night is wonderful. Nice caf\u00e9 and gift shop.",
          "Actually, we went took the Funicular 2 different days. The first day we arrived in Bergen this was our first stop even though it was a bit cloudy the rain held off for us. Later in the week the weather was gorgeous so we packed a picnic to take with us. The first time there",
          "Whilst the funicular scared the hell out of me (fear of heights), the views were amazing... At the top of mt floien there is plenty by to do, for young and old, as well as places to eat and drink.. The views from the top are magnificent, gazing down at Bergen spread out around",

          "You can actually walk up to F\u00f8yen. Out of season, the train up is awesome and hardly any latency. Its a 45-60 minutes walk up. Less people monday-friday of course. You can also buy a one way ticket up, and have a nice walk down.",
          "The path from the rental location starts off rough - straight uphill for a while, but once you make it up there are so many fun trails to bop around on. My wife and I had never been mountain biking before but the guy at the rental shop was super helpful and the map was easy to",
          "I recently visited Bergen with hubby and 5 year old son and had a lovely sunny day free. I had read about Mt. Fl\u00f8yen and wanted to go on the top. The weather was great and we decided to trek to the top. All 3 of us really enjoyed the hike and there was so much to do at the top.",
          "It is essential to prebook your tickets, can be done online. If there is more than one cruise ship in town the queues can be horrendous. There are two separate queues for precooked and to purchase tickets. You can pay by cash or card. Is only a short ride, just over 5 minutes.",
          "We disembarked in Bergen and had 3-4 hours to see the city before taking the 40-minute, $4+ (NOK4.20) tram ride to the city's quite modern airport. After walking in the city center for an hour or so, we walked a few minutes to the base of the funicular, bought tickets, and then",
          "If you ever go to Bergen, make sure you put this in your \"to do\" list. The funicular is a lot of fun. But what matters is what you get once you hit the top. The views are just incredible. Breath taking. Have your camera ready!",
          "I have to be honest, I did not love this attraction. The funicular, even though we bought advance tickets and got right on, was crowded and hot. The view at the top was nice, but after seeing fjords and beautiful views from the Flam railway and ferry, I was not sure the trip",
          "We were recommended this by Martin City Walking Tour - Bergen On Foot and probably didn\u2019t think we had the time during our whistle stop tour of Bergen. This was well worth it. On a 10-minute timetables The 5-minute trip to the summit gave the most marvellous views of Bergen",
          "Used the funicular on the way up and enjoyed a good walk at the top along with the views. If you have time and are able save the money and walk down. We found a little cafe that had opened that day and it added to the good experience.",
          "Took the funicular up and walked back down. We lucked out and the weather was sunny and warm so had awesome views. Even if you don't eat in the restaurant, go take a peak. It was built in 1925 and it is beautiful. Highly recommend.",
          "Funicular was suggested as a must see. The view is great and offers great photos of the harbor. Restaurants were crowded and didn't offer alot of choices. The view is worth a ticket and they have a playground for children.",
          "The ride up to the top on the Funicular is great and once you get up you are being rewarded by the most fantastic views. We spent hours up there, including coffee at the local cafe. If you care for a stroll down the mountain, you can do so in about 50 minutes. The path goes",
          "We took the funicular on a very very wet morning and we were sure we would see nothing at the top but miraculously the clouds cleared and we had a lovely view of the city. Nice cafe, toilets and gift shops at the top too but expensive,",
          "Views were ok even on a rather miserable day, worth the experience, but the coffee shop rather disappointing - cinnamon buns were awful.",
          "We chose a gorgeous sunshiny day to take the funicular up Mt. Floyen. The view was terrific and made for great photos. We also had coffee and pastry at the top, and then walked the short distance to the little lake. The ticket lines can be quite long, so we were glad we go",
          "We caught the funicular up to the top and the views of Bergen were amazing! We wandered around to the lake area which was also a nice walk. There were also goats around, which were very tame. Definitely worth the time to head up here. It does get very busy though, so the",

          "Walked from Stoltzen to Floien. Took under an hour. That walk is with less people in the tracks so it gives you kind of peace and quiet. I would highly recommend this walks since the views are so spectacular. We also walked back down. Considering the pirce to go up&down i",
          "It is just a shame it was raining. I could have spent a lot more time on this mountain, it is beautiful, with an unforgettable view across the city. It is always fun to go on a funicular railway. Highly recommended",

          "On a clear day, this is a must visit place. The ride up the funicular is spectacular, as the harbor, the fjord and the surrounding islands open up in front of you. Unfortunately, we saw none of this, since at the time of our ascent, low clouds shrouded the entire mountain. At",
          "Have you even visited Bergen if you don't take the funicular to the top of Mount Floyen? The trip up & down passes for a mini-adventure and the views from the top are bar none. Plus there are hiking trails at the top to explore if you have time.",
          "I was a bit underwhelmed by this, but it is worth going on if you are looking for something to do. I guess I just am not into looking at cities. I would much prefer to have a nice countryside view.",
          "We took a chance on this in the evening as the weather was dry and rain was forecast for the coming days. We had the Bergen Card so the return fare was reasonable at 65NOK each. We didn\u2019t stay for too long at the top and like a number of other people saw the funicular",
          "A must see attraction when you visit Bergen. The best view of the city. Enjoy a refreshment or snack from the top of the mountain.",
          "Queue to buy ticket was really long. It might took us over 30 minutes to wait for it. Luckily, staff is very helpful. He suggested us to buy via website, so as to cut off the queue and go stright for furnicular. View up there is amazing. There are many things to do up there,",
          "We were in Bergen on a day with perfect weather. Our ship arrived early but we didn't get to the funicular until 9am. We timed it right - we were able to buy tickets within a few minutes. There was probably a 15 minute wait to get on a car to the top. We spent an enjoyable hour",
          "Bergen is one of the nicest cities we have ever been to and Mount Floyen offers breathtaking views of the whole marina and fjord. Hiking in the hills around bergen gives You a great reason as to why we should preserve our planet for future generations.",
          "Busy, sunny day in Bergen? Find yourself some space on Mt Floyen. We took the fenicular train up and walked down . Recommend doing this. Enjoy the view, the trees, the moss, the various trails. If we had prepurchased tickets the wait at the bottom would have been shorter ( these",

          "We went up the funicular in the evening, and enjoyed splendid views over Bergen and the islands just west of it. Thought that it might be crowded at the top - the funicular certainly was - but no problems. Plenty of space as the crowds spread out.",
          "The funicular up to the top usually costs around \u00a310-11 (depending on the exchange rate) and is itself fairly entertaining. The view from next to the station is what a lot of the many many thousands of tourists that visit it flock to but the appeal of Fl\u00f8yen really lies in",
          "Mount floyen is must visit place when u r in Bergen. Can reach Walking or by floibanen. I traveled by floibanen to reach there. View from the top is breathtaking. There r few coffee shops, shopping stuff and a restaurant on top. Visit when weather is clear u will get better",
          "This is one of the absolute must-do's in Bergen. Its very popular so plan to go early to avoid a VERY long wait in line for the cable car. We took the cable car up and walked down which we thoroughly recommend. Fabulous views of course. not to be missed",
          "Seeing Bergen from the top of Mount Floyen puts the city into perspective. The views are awesome. Also riding up on the funicular is fabulous as well",
          "We had a great 3 hours here. Warm, dry weather. Walked uphill to Brusytten cafe and back. Most of the walk was in forest. Great views of Bergen at top of funicular. Impressed by runners and cyclists. Even saw some skinny dipping in Revurtjunet lake!",
          "The scenery on mount Floyen was nice and it would be good to take cable car up and walk down the mount! It was a really nice path and it took about an hour only!",
          "It was really nice to see the City from the high ground. The Funicular ride was cool. The view was wonderfull especially after we had 15km walk all around Bergen ;) .",

          "We took the Fl\u00f8ibanen to the top of Mount Floyen and enjoyed the view. But there is more to Mount Floyen than just the ride in the funicular, which is pretty amazing as well. However, there are quite a few possibilities to hike Mount Floyen, some of the paths are paved, others",
          "We had to wait around 45 minutes before we could get on the funicular. The tickets are not expensive with respect to Norwegian standards, single is about 60 krona and return 120 krona. You can walk back down the trail if you wish. The views at top were awesome but a bit too",
          "I was in line for an hour for the funicular, but the ride was fun and it was a clear day in Bergen so the view from the top is amazing. You have to try to see the view, which is blocked by hundreds of stupid people taking selfies they will never look at again instead of",
          "I advise taking the Funicular but we have previously taken the Funicular and decided to walk this time as we had our dog. Dogs are allowed on the Funicular but it was crowded. It takes an hour + - each way and a nice scenic walk(my photos disappeared). The view is spectacular.",
          "Each time we looked at a long queue to the funicular diminished our desire to use it. We walked in the picturesque streets uphill to the Domkirken and then decided to continue our way to Floyen along a winding streets and roads, amidst a beautiful forest. On the mountain top",
          "The view from the mountain is really stunning. There can be a lot of people, but still it is a \u201emust do\u201c in Bergen. Take the cable car up but walk down, it takes only 45 min and is worth the effort.",
          "Smooth, quick funicular. Very busy at the top, you need to walk quite a distance to get way from the crowds. Not at all peaceful or tranquil.",
          "Great views! No matter the weather it is breathtaking! I\u2019m a senior with limited walking and did okay. Loads of stairs at the top though, I just went really slow!i did see an elevator but not sure if it would eliminate the stairs?",
          "We had free tickets and used them. I've been on several in different places. This was fun, but nothing exceptional. We just went up and down. Friends rode up and hiked down and loved it (and they are an older couple)",

          "And pre book your tickets. Arrived just before 10 and there was a small queue to book tickets, and those with tickets were on the ride within minutes. Came down around 11.15 and the queue to get tickets must have been nearly an hour and even the pre booked ticket queue was long.",
          "We went up with the funicular (almost no waiting time to get our tickets) and chose to go down by foot and enjoy the beautiful views. Also at the top there is a superb panoramic view as well as a restaurant with plenty of seating in or out. Worth mentioning; there is a pretty",

          "Of course if the sun is shining, all the better for the magnificent views. The ride up on the funicular is fun and when you get to the top, there is so much to do. There are paths to walk, playgrounds, a lake, troll garden, restaurant, shops. Plan to spend a couple of hours!",

          "This trip is worth it for the views of Bergen and the walks available. There are numerous play areas for children, biking and canoeing. Something for everyone, a cafe and restaurant too. We thoroughly enjoyed getting out of the city and enjoying the fresh air.",
          "We loved the funicular and the view of Bergen from the top of the mountain. Unfortunately we did our excursion on a rainy day so we didn\u2019t explore too much. We went into one of the restaurants and the prices were expensive. They have cute things in the souvenir shop! We bought a",
          "If you just stop at riding the Funicular, then you will miss so much beauty. The hike is not easy but is magical. The Funicular is amazing as it goes straight up the mountain and through the mountain, but the forest is green and rich with color. Don't stop, keep climbing and you",
          "The views from Mount Florence over Bergen are special. The funicular ride is efficient and a well-operated service. We took the funicular about mid afternoon under threatening skies that meant that we may not have had a view. We were pleased that we did, and we found that there",
          "Amazing view of Bergen - absolutely marvelous. Weather was nice to us. However, even on a rainy day it is still worth visiting. Please be aware of lines. It was unusual to see that people with online tickets had to wait longer than \"walk-ins\".",

          "I got the first tram up this morning as 3 cruise ships were due to come in. It was just me on the viewing platform and an 86 year old local man who walks up a few times a week. Well, that put me to shame. I was so excited about the stunning panoramic view of Bergen that I",

          "Ok, you can walk to the top which takes about 40 minutes or you can take the cable car. During the summer, there are always queues so a tip is to pre buy your ticket. At the top you can go hiking for hours or simply enjoy the views. There are tables and chairs to relax on, a",
          "Good place to go and see the city of Bergen from top of the mountain. Go to this place at sunset or sunrise as the colour shades are magical. The rope way is good and transports you quickly to the top. Walk down to the city is wonderful, takes about one hour from top to the city",
          "The funicular is a must activity, if you\u2019d like an overall view of Bergen and it\u2019s seven mountains. The panoramic views are outstanding, that\u2019s for sure. Plus you have the option of walking down, which we did. Going through the forest was lovely, especially with the giant",
          "We attempted to go on the funicular on day 1 of our Bergen stay, but the que was crazy. So on day 3 we got up early and was in the que by 7:45. Nice short que.......and then came a bus load of people from a cruise ship. Wow didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be up and off the ship so early.",

          "Bergen is a beautiful sprawling city and you can see it all from above at the top of mt. Floyen. It\u2019s definitely worth the trip up. We walked back down which is a nice leisurely walk. For those looking for a strenuous workout and to save money, hiking up is an option too",
          "Recommend taking the Funicular up the mountain and walking back down to immerse yourself in nature and then the beautiful back streets of Bergen. It\u2019s well worth the trip and we were lucky with our timing; once a cruise ship hits the queues can be awful. Go later in the day or",

          "The funicular is a must do, at least one way. Mount Fl\u00f8yen is beautiful and there is so much to do. The funicular goes every ten minutes so you can arrive whenever. The line for tickets doesn\u2019t take long but you can always buy the tickets online beforehand and skip the line.",

          "We hiked up Floyen which wasn't particularly challenging but I did break a sweat. It took us about 1.5 hours to get to the top. There are some nice vintage wooden homes to appreciate on the bottom before you get to a pretty cool kids park with an awesome slide. The incline is",

          "The views of Bergen from this Vantage point is worth seeing. There are floods of tourists, as this is a highly sought after destination. The restaurant is nice, but quite over the top expensive and most of Norway.",
          "The queue to get into the funicular railway building is very long but if you have already bought tickets you can go straight in via the right hand lane. Once at the top there are lots of activities, restaurant, cafe and souvenir shop. Spectacular views over Bergen",
          "Bought tickets online, but the bar codes wouldn't work in the machines, so luckily I found a fellow to get us in...we were there when they started running and by the time we came down the line was probably 2 hours because there were four cruise ships in port. Up top the places",
          "Next time I would walk up the hill and then pay to take the tram down. It took an hour-plus standing in line to buy tickets and then wait for the tram up. Once on top the view is great and there\u2019s lots to do. We paddled a canoe and hiked a bit. Beautiful nature.",

          "Worth a visit. Great views from top. Lots to do once off funicular such as hiking,walking and sightseeing. Several places for food. Funicular moves fast and the line up moves quickly.",
          "Buy your ticket at the Tourist Information center before you go to the funicular. This saves time as you will go right through and not have to wait in line at the funicular to purchase your ticket. (If you go to the TI first thing in the morning, there's little or no wait",
          "Wait till the crowd has left for their cruise or other organised trips and go up the mountain. The view is wonderful, especially when the sun is out. Good idea to treat your kids with ice cream and sit and watch together, enjoying Your ice cream and the view. Your kids could",

          "My wife and I visited Bergen and naturally we were compelled to do this funicular ride while we were in town. As many people suggest, we aimed to get there early, before the ticket window opened. Not least because bad weather was forecast later that day. I'm glad we did as it",
          "We took the funicular up and walked back down. Fantastic views and some great trails to walk around at the top with good facilities. Easiest way to get a ticket is to buy them via the website or app. Tickets come with a QR code you have to scan to get through the barriers to the",

          "It was a beautiful sunny day. Buying tickets was so easy and the queue was not that long. The Funicular ride was so pleasant and comfortable. The view from the top is amazing and there is plenty of place to sit, admire, contemplate and take pictures.There is a nice restaurant",
          "I recommend skipping the funicular and walking up Mount Floyen. It takes around 45 mins and is a moderate level. There are plenty of places to stop and check out the view. There are goats at the top that you can hang out with as well as a lake just around from the summit.",
          "Great place to visit. You have it all upp here . Giftshops restaurants playgrounds for the kids. You have a fantastical view over Bergen city here.",
          "I'm not calling the views fantastic, because we went in the early evening, and with the sun shining from the west it was difficult to get a really good photo of the city below. But it is certainly worth the trip. By going in the early evening there was no queue to buy a ticket",
          "This is a must do in Bergen. The views you get from the top are incredible! We did not take the funicular as we hate waiting in lines, so we hiked all the way up. With frequent stops and at a slow pace this is doable even you\u2019re not the fittest person. It took us about 1 hour",
          "We booked our tickets online before getting to Bergen so we were able to skip the long waiting line. The ride is short and easy. We were very lucky to have a beautiful sunny day. The view from up there is breath taking. You can spend as much time as you like up there. There are",
          "The funicular ride to the top is fun and the view at the top is spectacular. We were with our tour group and had a great dinner up at the top.",
          "The payoff of the views was fantastic but once at the top, not a whole lot to do. We took a walk around the lake (which is about a 10 minute walk from the top of the funicular) and it was very peaceful. If you have children, there is a great playground at the top.",
          "Must do trip if you're in Bergen. Great views from the top and a number of lovely walks from there. We did quite a short one (1.5hr) round the lake and back but you were soon away from the noise and bustle of Bergen and into lovely, quite wooded countryside.",
          "As we were only in Bergen for one night off the Hurtigruten ferry before heading to Oslo, we thought we should take the Floibanen to the top of the mountain and in a similar vein to Tromso, view a panorama over Bergen. Unfortunately our views of the City were cut short by a",

          "I regret going up late in the evening, just thinking to take pictures of sunset. After taking more than 100 from foothill to hill-tops and at different spots on the mountain, I realised the designer had more to offer. Mount Floyen has more to explore, for kids, adults, friends,",
          "worth taking this trip the view from the top is spectacular. But buy your ticket before you go otherwise you will be waiting in a huge queue before you then queue for the funicular",
          "You can take the cart up or walk. I would recommend walking, because the line for the cart might be very long, especially during tourist season. The walk isnt very long, about 40mins at normal pase and not steep. The view is amazing and there's restaurants, icecream shops and a",
          "Highly recommend going. Take the tram up and walk down it's amazing. I would say go early but we went at 10am and walked in. But at 1pm the queue was down the hill. At the top, walk to the lake, see the goats and see the view.",
          "Great view from the top. Do not miss. Big lines for tickets and then bug lines to enter. Better buy ticket online. We did with phone while waiting on line to enter.",
          "We were on an organised excursion from our ship. Sapphire Princess. We were taken by coach to the funicular station. As we started our smooth ascent we were amazed when we passed through a great bank of mist and on arriving at the top it was like being up in an aeroplane looking",
          "We almost missed doing this trip as the queue was very long in the morning with so many cruise ships in. we just spent time around the harbour and sea food market. Later when we decide to return to the ship noticed the long queue were no longer so we took the short trip up",
          "It takes only 3 minutes to climb and during the ascent you can see the beautiful landscape that expands as you climb and discover the infinity of the landscape that reaches the sea",
          "The attraction here is the view, so make sure you go on a clear day. There is a restaurant, a souvenir shop and some goats at the top, all nicely arranged for tourists ;-)",
          "It is worth buying the funicular ticket in advance from the tourist information centre to avoid queuing at the funicular. We took the funicular up to Floyen and the views were stunning. However we continued on and took the trail up to Brushytten which meant you quickly got away",
          "We chose to hike rather than take the funicular. It was steep, requiring some fitness and tenacity, but very enjoyable and short, about 2-3 kilometers. Along the path were great views, lovely wildflowers, and occasional mossy and ferny streams. Once we arrived at the top, there",
          "Don't miss this place if you visit Bergen. You will get chance to view all beautiful scenic views of the city.",
          "Reasonable price to get up, although the queue took 25 mins in the morning (9-10am). Great ice cream stand at the top, and I would recommend walking along to the other viewpoint Sandviksplein (45min each way)",
          "Visit early to avoid lines. Or later like 7. You can also go for sunset but long lines. I'd imagine it is beautiful. Calm and nice up there. Be careful walking bc steps around are very similar in color so easy to trip!",
          "Last time we were in Bergen the queue was to long to take the trip. This time I pre-booked the tickets and got there for 9am. We walked straight on. When we came back down the queue was horrendous, so the morale is book tickets and go early. Its a 5 minute ride, but the views",
          "It was hidden so hard to find but the ride up the mountain was fun. Once up on the mountain, the walk around the top was lovely. I enjoyed sitting in the cafe and having lunch with the beautiful views. The ride down was a little scary cause the furinicular stop had a gap, so",
          "Took the funicular up and hiked around the mountain. The funicular isn't so fun when there is a heat wave and everyone is trying to pack on. If you have claustrophobia, don't take this during peak times! Otherwise it's an easy way up the mountain. There are many hikes to choose",
          "The view from Mount Floyen has to be seen - absolutely stunning! We pre-booked the funicular online and jumped the worst of the queue. Spent 2-3 hours at the top - it\u2019s great for walking, we took a free 15 minute canoe ride on the lake, sat and fed the friendly ducks in the",
          "We lucked out and had a clearing of the storm clouds and got up to the top for a beautiful sunset (and beer from the restaurant up top!). The iPhone app was easy to download and we bought tickets that are good for any time over two days, allowing us to avoid any line at the",
          "Again another wonder spectacular cruise to Bergen. Really the scenery is fantastic. Today had a little bit of a walk into the centre of Bergen, not unpleasant but our cruise ship could not dock as close to the town centre as in other places. Decided to go for the Funicular",
          "I highly recommend this activity if you're traveling with family. The ride to the top is truly a once in a lifetime experience. We took the ride at sunset so the lighting was tricky. I recommend going 1 or 2 hours before sunset. The facility closes at 11pm. Great experience!",
          "This is a must place to visit if you are travelling to Bergen. The funicalar going up/down is a nice experience. Once you reach the top, you have beautiful views of the city.",

          "Go early! Miss the queues. A short but pleasant trip up the mountain on the modern funicular. There is much to do at the top; walks, children's playground, decent coffee, but most of all fantastic views of the city and its environs. Lovely scenery and many photo opportunities.",
          "I bought my tickets online months before my visit so that I wouldn\u2019t have to wait too long. When we got there the queues were huge. As I have limited mobility we decided not to bother but one of the staff realised what was happening and moved us straight through and onto the",
          "Don't go in the morning when the cruse ships are in town. Great views from the top. I didn't know Bergen was so large as we stayed near the old town.",

          "We took the funicular uphill and walked down. Easy hour walk with nice views also on the way. There is a panorama viewpoint and a small cafe/restaurant and you can take a picture with the goats that are up there for some reason. Totally would recommend!",
          "There are litterally tons of tourists for this attraction. And many of them are rude and push to get out of the funicular. Be careful because there are 2 lines for the funicular: one for large groups and one for the rest of us. We didn't know and waited in the wrong line for",
          "Went to bergen, such a wonderful place, lots to see and do, the most wonderful views from the viewing point at the top of the funicular, total panoramic views were outstanding, ride up takes a few minutes, steep enjoyable journey, few stops on the way as its a service for",
          "There was a bit of a wait for the funnicular, but once you get up there it's really nice. You can walk a short distance through the woods to a beautiful lake. Definitely buy tickets online to skip that line at least. I was able to just buy tickets on my phone right outside.",
          "My acquaintances will tell you I have never met a rail based trip I didn't love. The Mount Floyen Funicular is not an exception. Unfortunately due to the free time limits associated with our tour group we could only ride up, take a few pictures and then catch the same cars",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the trip to the top of the mountain to view the city of Bergen the port and surrounding fjord. The view was spectacular! I would recommend purchasing the tram tickets online ahead of your visit to avoid the long line for tickets at the gate. Our queue time",
          "We arrived at about 9:45 a.m. and there was almost no wait to buy tickets. The trip takes only maybe 5 minutes. There is only one car in each direction, and they get filled pretty full. There are seats and standing room. There are steps to climb, and at the top they are",
          "A definite site to see. We had a traditional Norwegian lunch and then walked around the corner to take the funicular up the mountain. We went in the afternoon when the crowds were not too big. We walked right on. The day was clear and crisp and the view stunning. Practically 360"

          "Unmissable tourist attraction in Bergen that involves travelling to the top of a mountain overlooking the city by funicular. The views of the city and surrounding area from the mountain are beautiful. There\u2019s a restaurant at the top and \u2026",
          "Fun ride on the funicular, with great view of and hiking at the top.  Take the walk to the lake... beautiful.  Easy to buy tickets at the base station.  Just up the street from the fish market... very short and easy walk from almost everywhere.",
          "Lovely view. Very nice place to go with family and friends.",
          "The views were amazing. Took the train up to the top, spent some time watching the view. There are several parks to keep children entertained. There is also a herd of goats about. They are ok being near humans so you can get some great \u2026",
          "We had a great family day out at Fl\u00f8yen. We took the train up the mountian and walked down.\nPlenty of walks and facilities for all the family. Shops,toilets , playgrounds and a troll forest playground. \nFantastic views of Bergen city and surrounding countryside.",
          "This place is just wow. Me being an Indian loved the ride to that top with the cable car. The viking statue is there. But when foggy that place is just a waste. If there is no fog. U could see the whole city and that's definitely a \u2026",
          "Very busy on the day we went, but worth the trip up for the views of the city. Neat hikes and a park that would be nice for the family. Didn't try the cafe at the top",
          "Great trip up Floyen. The funicular is busy and a lot of tour groups from the cruises arrive throughout the day. Prepare to queue but it would still be best to buy tickets online in advance. Great views and lots of walks and things to do on the mountain",
          "Such a wonderful place to visit at least once in life time. Beautiful view from top of mountain.",
          "321m that's the height of this most visited mountain in Bergen. On top of the mountain you can visit a coffee shop, buy a souvenir and visit the most visited toilet in Bergen :D",
          "Fantastic view of the city, beautiful grounds to meander around, and well-organized flow getting on/off the tram. The troll garden at the top was novel and fitting given the area's cultural history. Would definitely visit again.",
          "A good one! 10 mins ride to top and then mesmerizing views of the \"state of the art\" city! The sun set looks spectacular with floating clouds and colorful lights of the streets. A small & cosy cafe on top serves all hot stuffs starting from \u2026",
          "Great views! Definitely worth it.",
          "Nice view of Bergen city. Lots of different playground for children. Both restaurants and kiosk that you can buy food. (Very expensive) just saying..its a really nice hike if you walk from the city to the top. I would recommend this trip for everyone. Fit or not\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude2c",
          "The funicular railway is a great attraction. The views are spectacular and there is plenty to do when you are up there. It's very busy in the mornings with cruise ship passengers because when the sun moves to the west it makes photos more difficult. Best visit in the afternoon and avoid the huge queues",
          "Views are amazing. Love the goats :)",
          "I love this place. Great views",
          "Weather or not, this is great place for views of Bergen and to walk around a bit. If the weather is good there are a ton of playgrounds and activities for kids. While you can take the Flohbahn up or down, there are also steep but maintained trails you can use to get up the mountain.",
          "We walked up the mountain after good snow fall. A magical experience.",

          "Do not miss this opportunity when you're in Bergen. You can use tram if you're not feeling about it. But, it should not take more than 1 hour of walk to get here. Beautiful views as a reward",
          "A place with the best view of Bergen and the warmest staffs! My phone dropped down 2-3m to the mountain when I jumped from the ground of the viewing platform. I was really helpless cause there is no way that I can walk out from the viewing \u2026",
          "Best views of Bergen. Even with three ships in port the que moved fast. Buy prepaid tickets you get on faster. And do not go past the ice cream stall at the top.",
          "The trail in itself is not very long coming from the center. Probably 40mins with a good pace. It's a relatively easy walk, not too damaged, where you can take children with you. You go through different type of vegetation, from dense and \u2026",
          "A beautiful view with a easy walk to the top. Not too steep so it\u2019s good for all ages; however it might be long for little kids. Definitely worth the beautiful view at the top though!",
          "This is a special experience to have in Bergen Norway. The tram that takes you to the top is an experience in itself. The ticket office is a short simple walk from the Bergen Fish Market right down town. The ride only takes about 3:30 \u2026",
          "Train brings up to the mountain top. Beautiful view. Places to eat and sit. There's also a playground for children and a walking trail where on occasion goats can be seen.",

          "A must go place in Bergen, best time just before the sunset ...!",

          "Loved this place. This gives a perfect look to whole Bergen city. it was an amazing experience being here. The only thing which I didn't like was there are no currency exchange centre. So please carry enough cash (NOK) if you want to go shopping here.",
          "The best way to see the Bergen city. Peaceful and astounding. Recommended. \ud83d\ude04",
          "Beautiful views of the city (even when it's raining). Recommend one way ticket and walking down the 3km, it's very beautiful.",
          "Great view and the city, the fjord and surrounding mountains. The restaurant and cafe have a decent selection of food for meat eaters but not a lot of options for vegans. Great hiking trails and some activities for kids",
          "Such a wonderful place to visit. The Funicular to the top adds to the building sense of excitement and expectation, and definitely does not disappoint. The views from the top are more than worth the wait to get on board.",
          "Fl\u00f8yen gives you great vistas of Bergen and an over view of the city. It's a good way to understand the city layout before walking about. Had we known in advance that there was a walking trail back to city center, we would have purchased a \u2026",
          "Good place for hiking near Bergen, with excellent views possible. Most of the trails are very well marked, but some are not. I would recommend hike 8 on their website but not hike 9.",
          "It\u2019s an other world experience ...serene",
          "We have visited the view while it was raining and quite cold so the view wasn't too pretty. The trip up the hill in the tram was nice though, lots of nice views around. I'd say that on a nice day the view could be worth 5 stars. There is a gift shop on top with incredibely nice personnel, also a outdoor playground.",
          "Take a funicular up to the top and take a stroll down or hike up and down this very relaxing trail. Many locals can be seen taking a stroll here. However, the journey down can be pretty tough for the kneel caps.",
          "Nice hiking area. Somewhat touristic on top of the Mountain. But follow the trail signs and you'll get on to nice hiking tracks leading you on to splendid scenery on to Bergen city and far West. Enjoy",
          "The view from the top is spectacular, especially on a clear day. We accessed by the Fenicular Railway also a fabulous way to see the city of Bergen and beyond.",
          "When I went up to the view point it was very busy but we'll worth doing because there is a alot of other things to do there other than the beautiful view over the city. There is a big kids play area, walks, a cafe and probably more that I missed.",
          "Completely unique experience to take a funicular to the top of this mountain. Views can't be beat, even if it rains! (It will pass quickly.)",
          "I would say that this was the best view we had of Bergen. The tram takes you to the top very quickly after a couple of stops. It leaves every 15 minutes. Make sure you get the ice cream cone at the top of the mountain. We hiked back down the mountain twice to get the best views. About a 45 minute hike.",
          "Great place to view the sunset. It has hiking/walking trails, goats that can be pet, places to eat and drink. Great view of Bergen.",
          "Bergen at a glance. Definitely the best attraction in Bergen, during summer atleast. \nThere is a train ride up the hill, or if you want you can do some trekking. If you take the train, try to sit in the last seats of the last coach, the \u2026",

          "Beautiful lookout point over the city after a short funicular ride. A lovely 3km walk back down to the city through the woods.",
          "Wonderful view up there!!  Quite easy to go up there. They made a nice road where you can go up to the top. A nice trip to do!!  It's just in the center of Bergen!!!  \u263a\ufe0f",
          "Fantastic views over Bergen from the top. Lots of nature paths and trolls to find. Hop on off funicular railway great experience too. Try and get the front seats for great views. Also go late in the day, open till 11pm in Summer. Less queues and quieter to get around.",
          "Some amazing views of Bergen at the top. You can either take the Funicular (6 mins) or walk up the 320m - it took me about an hour. The restaurant was welcoming with the fire (as it was cold and rainy the day I visited) and the menu choices ok but not overwhelming. A must visit place when you come to Bergen.",

          "one of my favorite mountain in bergen..very nice place ..you should to visit there",

          "This place has a great view and one of the best tourist spots in Bergen. The elevator that takes you at the top is great itself. Good restaurants up there and great place for exploration.",
          "Nice fairly quick trip up and down on the railway. Great views of Bergen but crowded with other tourists when we were there.",
          "Unique place. Worth visiting. It was a huge queue in the morning, probably because of people from cruise ships, but there was no queue after 14:00 or so.",
          "Easy and moderate hikes available, both up and downhill.  The funicular isnt from the Alps, but it offers a stunning view of Bergen.  There are several trails and everything is well signed and clear.  English guidance in abundance.",
          "We've been up here several times when in Bergen in both Winter and Summer and enjoyed the views, having a walk around and a browse in the shop.\n\nCoffee and food is readily available and those views are magnificent, there's no denying.\n\nThe \u2026",
          "Amazing place. We went there during sunset time and everything looked golden from up there. You can go there either by the funicular train or can also hike upto the top. Very beautiful and calm place to be.",

          "Superb view over Bergen! Try to time it so you can see the sunset. It is very beautiful and you can get truly amazing pictures. Remember, even in case you miss last team back, you can still walk down the rosd. Also notice the mountain goats hanging around the top.",

There is a cafe at the hill station too.",

          "Awesome view of Bergen and fantastic moderate to hard hike up from the heart of downtown. You can make it a loop which will bring you through different parts of the neighborhood that leads up to it. And don\u2019t forget to check out the troll garden right next to it!",
          "Needless to say, heaps of tourists at the top,\nwhether they take the funicular are not.\nWe hiked up in maybe half an hour. Not so bad of a hike, didn't really follow \"directions\", just the flow of people , and the peak is usually always in \u2026",

          "Very beautiful view on the city, unfortunately it was cloudy when we went but it's nice to see the sunset from there. We went to Stoltzekleiven and then Floyen but the way up to Stoltzekleiven was very hard and steep so I suggest to do the opposite. Walk up to mount Floyen and then have a 40 min walk until Stoltzekleiven",

Very chilly on cloudy day at the top even in the summer but get a jacket and a tea at the shop and it's ok. There are also toilets, a big troll statue for photos and other trails in the forest.",
          "Incredible views of the city. If you do go up by the funicular railway get there early. When we came down at 11am, the queue was right down the street. You can walk up if you are fit. Walking down can also be murder on the back of your legs as our son found out. A must see when in Bergen.",
          "Ride up with Fl\u00f8ibanen is quite short. Once you get up there you get a spectacular views of the city and if you like you can do some hiking or skiing"

          "A must if you visit Bergen. The oldtown is an outdoor museum and was rebuild and shows very detailed how life was in the past. Actors give small insides about the daily life in old Bergen. The coffeshop in one of old houses offers coffee and cake and invites to rest from a interesting tour during the past.",
          "Really lovely representation of the 19th century (and older) houses. With homes of varying artisans in varying wealth. The actors also play their roles of maids, shopkeepers or landlady's very convincing and accurate. The staged plays in and around the square are also very relevant to the 19th century.",
          "Very inspiring and the actors are awesome, a bit scary for me, they were too good. The disadvantage, in my opinion, was the space. I was expecting maybe something more, since I saw the one in Stockholm and Oslo. But per total very beautiful ",
          "Worth visiting the place if you have interest to see 100 + years old Norwegian life systems",

        "wiki": "Bryggen (the dock), also known as Tyskebryggen (Norwegian: [\u02c8t\u028f\u0300sk\u0259\u02ccbr\u028f\u0261\u02d0n\u0329], the German dock), is a series of Hanseatic heritage commercial buildings lining up the eastern side of the V\u00e5gen harbour in the city of Bergen, Norway. Bryggen has been on the UNESCO list for World Cultural Heritage sites since 1979.\nThe city of Bergen was founded around 1070 within the boundaries of Tyskebryggen. Around 1350 a Kontor of the Hanseatic League was established there, and Tyskebryggen became the centre of the Hanseatic commercial activities in Norway. Today, Bryggen houses museums, shops, restaurants and pubs.\n\n\n== History ==\nBergen was established before 1070 AD. In the Middle Ages, the Bryggen area encompassed all buildings between the sea and the Stretet (\u00d8vregaten) road, from Holmen in the north to V\u00e5gsbunnen in the south. According to the Sagas, the city was founded within this area.One of the earliest pier constructions has been dated to around 1100, and the existing buildings are of a much later date, with only Sch\u00f8tstuene and some buildings towards Julehuset being originals from 1702.Around 1350, an office of the Hanseatic League was established in Bryggen. As the town developed into an important trading centre, the wharfs were improved and the buildings of Bryggen were gradually taken over by the Hanseatic merchants. The warehouses were used to store goods, particularly stockfish from northern Norway, and cereal from Europe.\nIn 1702, the buildings belonging to the Hanseatic League were damaged by fire.  They were rebuilt, and some of these were later demolished, and some were destroyed by fire. In 1754, the operations of the office at Bryggen ended, when all the properties were transferred to Norwegian citizens.Throughout history, Bergen has experienced many fires, since most of its houses were traditionally made from wood. This was also the case for Bryggen, and as of today around a quarter were built after 1702, when the older wharfside warehouses and administrative buildings burned down. The rest predominantly consists of younger structures, although there are some stone cellars that date back to the 15th century.\nParts of Bryggen were again destroyed in a fire in 1955. A thirteen-year archaeological excavation followed, revealing the day-to-day runic inscriptions known as the Bryggen inscriptions. The Bryggen museum was built in 1976 on part of the site cleared by the fire. \n\n\n== Architectural heritage ==\nBryggen was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979, by Criterion (iii): Bryggen bears the traces of social organization and illustrates the use of space in a quarter of Hanseatic merchants that dates back to the 14th century. It is a type of northern \u201cfondaco\u201d, unequalled in the world, where the structures have remained within the cityscape and perpetuate the memory of one of the oldest large trading ports of Northern Europe.\nNotable houses at Bryggen include Bellg\u00e5rden (a 300-year-old building), Svensg\u00e5rden, Enhj\u00f8rningsg\u00e5rden, Bredsg\u00e5rden, Bug\u00e5rden, Engelg\u00e5rden. The oldest and tallest building in the area is St Mary's Church. Streets include Jacobsfjorden. Museums include Bryggens Museum and Hanseatic Museum and Sch\u00f8tstuene.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "By visiting the lower level of this museum, you can visualize the way that Bergan\u2019s wharf looked like in the 1100s, and learn about the succession of fires that burned down the waterfront on several occasions. There is signage in both Norwegian and English, and description",

          "This was really rather awful. Fortunately, free access with the Bergen Card, but we were done in less than 30 painful minutes. The displays are very outdated, not everything is translated into English and the written displays were made many decades ago and they are not easy",

          "We'd seen the excavated building remains in the basement of this museum through the large plate glass windows from the outside and wanted a closer look, so dropped in for a visit. The museum is quite small and fairly modern (on part of the Bryggen site that was destroyed by fire",
          "The Bryggens Museum is right next to the historic Bryggen buildings by the harbour so it is very easy to combine a visit to both attractions ( it is within easy walking distance from the station). The museum holds a wealth of artefacts from when the area was excavated, these",
          "Good learning environment, nice mix of archeological findings and modern exhibits. This museum is pretty small (you can see pretty much everything in an hour), but the entire top floor was closed when i was there, so perhaps there is usually more to see. There is a nice little",
          "Visited for free as it is part of the Bergen Card. This is a really, really good museum and well worth a visit. The exhibits are well presented, the museum is clean and well maintained and there are some very old buildings (at least foundations) to see! We went with our 14",
          "I made an unplanned visit to the Bryggens museum and so didn't take the tour, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. It was my favorite museum in Bergen. With wonderful old buildings to explore, and exhibitions about daily life hundreds of years ago, it gave a real feel for the",

          "Very informative tour starting in the Bryggens museum and finishing in the Hanseatic museum (entry included). We luckily managed to get tickets on the day, but would recommend pre-booking, as people were turned away and there are only two tours at 11.00 and 12.00. About 1 1/2",
          "What a deal this tour is\u2014three tours in one for an incredibly reasonable price. And they limit the size so you can ensure being able to hear and have your questions answered. If you do one thing in Bergen, do this. VERY interesting.",

          "This museum is not big and one can finish it in an hour. But, the guided walk it offers is EXCELLENT! The guide shared the history of the area and interesting details about the people who actually lived and worked there. The guide also took the group to the other two museums",
          "The Bryggens Museum offers a great walking tour that combines that museum, as well as the Hanseatic Museum, the Assembly Rooms, and a walk through the Hanseatic quarter. This was a perfect way to learn and understand the history of trade in Bergen and to see historic buildings",

          "Interesting and well put together museum. We spent about an hour there. They had items dug up from the area along with old house structures and buildings.",
          "This museum was build around an archaeological dig. Not only can you see the history of the Bryggen hansa but there are a number of other displays as well. The top floor has a great exhibit on dating findings and the type of people you lived in Bergen in medieval times.",
          "Sign-up for the walking tour, as it is informational on the history of the city and surrounding area. Nice museum.",
          "We went to this as part of the one hour tour in English from the Tourist office and with our guide walked around here and it was fascinating",
          "This is a \"must do\" visit as it gives an insight into the history of Bergen and Norway, and their relationships with the rest of Europe. The information and the objects are well presented.",

          "This small museum has wonderful exhibits of the foundations of 12th century town, discovered in 1955 during excavations. The descriptions are thorough and give a good understanding of locations, uses, etc. of the buildings. There is also a video as well as a replica of a ship.",
          "The museum is quite small but the tour is great because it also takes you to two other Bryggen museums. There are tours in English and Norwegian at different times but we were lucky that only English speakers wanted to do the tour at the time we wanted. I really liked the",
          "Our first day in Bergen we took the guided tour in English that starts at this museum. The guide was excellent, and we were introduced to the major sites and history in the area. Later we went back to revisit a few things in detail, and we also returned to the Bryggens Museum",
          "Entrance fee of 80 krone ( just over \u00a38.00 ) gets you in. The museum mainly focuses on the actual remains of the earliest buildings in Bergen. These are on view on the original place of building. Fantastic exhibition on the \" Buekorps\" ...the Bergen boys brigade. I loved this",
          "My wife and I took the English tour today. It was very informative. You visit there museums directed by a very knowledgeable tour guide. Ours took almost 2 hours. Time flew.",
          "The exhibits are all from this area with the ground floor part of the dig. Interesting way of displaying exhibits. Very good short video of how archaeologists sort the layers on a dig. Upstairs is a cafe and after that at the moment a very interesting exhibit of heredity traits.",
          "Excellent visit for a rainy day. The experience would vary based on exhibitions st the time. Well organised. Reasonably priced (for Norway). We enjoyed it.",
          "This and the Hanseatic museum are both right in the Bryggens area and not to be missed. You will get great local history, with reasonable English translations. The exhibits really bring older Bergen to life.",
          "This place is a must see! Amazing wooden houses, mediavel atmosphere! It is worth visiting. In the city center, so no need to travel.",
          "Brilliant little museum telling you all about the history of Bergen. There are lots of historical artefacts to see which have been found there. It's definitely worth visiting especially if you are interested in the history of the city :)",
          "This little museum is a gem. How often do you get to see artifacts that were excavated right where you are standing? You can see the foundations of medieval houses, a huge chunk of a 13th century ship, shoes, clothing, message sticks, and more. Though there was no English tour",
          "We stopped in for a short visit on a cold and snowy day in March. The architecture and design of the building itself are interesting to see, and the museum exhibits provide an informative glimpse into the history of the area. It's located just a block from the Bryggen Wharf",
          "This was interesting as it shows a lot of what the older part of Bergen looked like and gives you a new perspective when you pop back up to street level. It was a bit rough for us as they were installing new windows so some of the exhibit was not there. this was also free with",
          "The Bergen history exhibit is interesting although somewhat smaller than anticipated. The temporary art exhibition was average. However, what impressed me more was \"where do we come from?\" It was an exhibit looking at where 3 people had originated from based on DNA and various",
          "I was really interested in this part of Bergen as I love history. It's not something that takes ages either, you can walk round at your pace fast or slow. Went Before Trip Advisor started.",
          "Nice museum bute and my friends were very disappointed because of the lack of English description of many of the monuments.",
          "This is one of the more modern museums in Bergen. Well laid out with a good history of the region. Great section on osteology (research of skeletal remains) learnt a bit from that display myself. Worth a visit.",
          "The museum was about the city remains found below. This was interesting but there was limited signage in English. The best was the ice skate. Enjoyed the runes section but the exhibition and where we are from was not as good as I thought.",
          "We had only 30 minutes left until it was close so we took a quick short walk to see everything here. It can be more interesting if you are interested in history Free with Bergen card.",
          "Beautiful and historic. Wander around the old streets and enjoy the character and charm of the area. Lovely to do on a sunny day and imagine what life would have been like.",
          "First of all, I visited the museum during the week so there was no access to the buildings outside, which was quite sad. The museum itself and also a lot of the interior is from the 70ies or 80ies. There is not much information given on English, and it kind of lacked a \"red",
          "This is a very nice little museum at the north site of the wharf, built where the wharf burnt in 1955. After the fire, there was a 13 year long excavation, and the museum is built over the excavation area where they found remains from the Middle Ages. There's an exhibition of",

          "Bryggens Museum is an interesting place to visit to see the historic foundations of the buildings that are Bryggen.",
          "The highlight of this museum are the artifacts uncovered on the site. This museum has a treasure trove of Viking and newer artifacts in a great state of preservation. They have building foundations and are great display of the fire timelines over the years. A must see in Bergen",
          "We only had time to explore the ground floor but thoroughly enjoyed viewing the foundations of the original buildings and learning about the early history of Bergen. There are lots of exhibits containing archaeological finds. The displays were well presented and had most",
          "Memory of the devastating fire which destroyed the city hundred years back has been kept alive here.It is rightly said that those who forget their past are compelled to repeat the same mistakes in future. A truly heart touching experience!",
          "This 90 minute tour passed in a flash. The lady leading it was very good, being both informative and funny. Well worth the admission price.",
          "This museum is located just opposite the Radisson Blue hotel and behind the oldest church in Bergen which is by the harbour area - just a couple of minutes from the hanseatic wharehouses. It may appear a little bit dry at the beginning and not obstentatious but if you do like",
          "This is an excellent tour for giving you the background and insight into the Bryggen Wharf area. The additional trip into the Hanseatic museum was also fascinating",
          "It would be nice to see on your own but so much more interesting when the history is explained by a local.",
          "This museum is small and nice, but I think it would be difficult to get much out of it (especially for non-natives) without the tour. The tour goes through 3 museums and is very interesting, even in the rain!",
          "This museum has 3 levels and can be covered comfortably in 1-1 1/2 hours. The lowest level shows some of the original foundations and depicts aspects of life St that time, the upper level has a very good display and story boards in English on the great fire of 1916. Very",
          "Quite a small museum but worth a visit on a rainy day if you want to do something indoors for a couple of hours. Gives an interesting history of Bergen. The exhibits are labelled in English as well as Norwegian but not all of the description is translated.",
          "Full of history of the city including info on the horrible fire of 1916. Lots of Viking artifacts and writings. Very interesting and enjoyable.",
          "The permanent exhibitions are small but worthwhile, but the best is the walking tour. This ends up at the Hanseatic museum, also worth a visit. Arrive early enough to redeem your free coffee or tea before the tour begins, and in the summer, the tours fill up. The current",
          "The unique thing about this museum is that it was built on the sight of an archeological discovery. This museum showcases artifacts from the city's Hanseatic past, including both buildings and artifacts of daily life.",
          "This museum is not very large and should be able to cover within one hour. It covers the history of Bergen which was the capital of Norway. It also showed the early language of Runes. Students pay 50% of entrance fee.",
          "There is an English guided tour at 11 am daily , but go there half an hour earlier to get into the group . You can use that pre-tour half and hour of waiting time to go in to see some of the exhibit by yourself . The guide we had spoke very good English ( they all do in Norway",
          "We thorough enjoyed our visit to the Bryggens Museum whilst visiting Bergen. There is a permanent display which includes artefacts from the Middle Ages and it is interesting to know that the Museum has been built over buildings dating from the 1100s. When we visited there was a",

          "A great way to learn the history of the Hanseatic economy. Enjoyed completely. Our guide was knowledgeable & fun. The tour starts at the Bryggen Museum & winds through the Bryggen & surrounds. There is ample time after the tour to return to parts that you want to spend more time",
          "Go when the museum opens, get your tickets for the walking tour that starts later, and you'll have time to see this museum first. Like other posters, I thought the temporary exhibits on runes and the fire were great. And the walking tour will take you to the lower level with",
          "This place is very cool and you can walk all around the buildings as it's still being used as offices and stores. Amazing restoration processes going on which is on display, very neat to see the foundations and rot etc. Imagine living there 7-800 yrs or more ago...",
          "Bergen has such rich history, and this small museum at the end of the bryggen lays it out so well, being relatively cheap for the amount of information. Signage is in both Norwegian and English. It shows the different periods of the harbor area, based on the many fires over",
          "Went to the famous Bryggen and around the site. Looking at the wood to support the buildings is fantastic.",
          "I must admit when we came to the hotel no one told us about the outside part I'm seeing in people's pictures so I think I missed out! I only saw the inside part of the museum but that in itself was very interesting. The photos of the fire upstairs are a must-see and very",
          "The temporary exhibit was on ancient runes, which was pretty interesting and the permanent exhibit was the ancient ruins of the areas. Small museum. I missed the English tour, which might have added to my enjoyment of the museum.",

          "I didn't especially enjoy the museums permanent exhibits, but there was an excellent temporary exhibit about The Bergen Fire (Bergen has has many fires, but as I understand it this is THE fire). Lots of old photography, thoughtful narrations in both English and Norwegian.",
          "We booked the English speaking tour well ahead of time and were glad we did since several \"walk ins\" were unable to join the very popular tour. Our guide, a young lady dressed in period costume was very knowledgeable and gave our group an excellent overview of the history of",

          "An excellent stop during the rain in Bergen with good displays of medieval life in Bergen, runes, and a temporary exhibit about the Bergen fire of 1916. Probably not worth 80 NOK to visit (except in Norway), but we got a half-price entry because of an earlier visit of the",

          "I really enjoyed this museum and our guide was fantastic in explaining the culture & customs of early Bergen. It's not a large museum but we also went through the Hanseatic League museum & the heritage house. It was well worth the time & took about 90 minutes.",
          "We booked the three-museum English tour and thought the young man leading it did a nice job. It was good value for the money, since you can go back to all three museums later for longer visits. We arrived a few minutes past closing on the afternoon we arrived in Bergen, hoping",
          "This is a great museum that tells the story of Bergen's development of time. It presents the destruction of Bergen by fire and rebuilding activities. The museum also contains a fine collection of archaeological items from the Middle ages.",
          "We planned to spend about an hour here and ended up staying for 3 - the part on the runes was awesome! Great museum on Bergen's history - buildings, living conditions, runes used to communicate. What a lovely find :)",

          "The downstairs exhibit including the excavations is pretty bare. If you want, you can just see the excavations for free from the outside. There are some interesting pieces, but it all leaves you feeling that medieval Bergen was a fairly unmemorable and unlivend place. The",
          "There were so much to read and learn about history of Bergen here. We spent about nearly two hours reading about the Great Fire and Runes. Very pleased with how everything was presented. Not to be missed if you are in Bergen.",
          "This museum is really worth going to to understand the history of the Bryggen area and the beautiful buildings. Currently, they have a really fascinating extra exhibition on the largest fire in Bergen - which shaped the city today. The history of the city itself is really unique",

          "This is set up over a few buildings along Bryggen. It would not be accessible if you are in a wheelchair or don't like small spaces. The odd thing is that the Bryggen buildings burnt down in a number of fires over the years so none are the original. In saying that, all have bee",

          "Very nicely done small museum on the history of Bergen and the early formation of the city. It's not huge, 2 or so hours should be good. During our visit there was also a visit on Runes which my children absolutely loved. Not sure if that was permanent or not.",
          "It is unfortunate that this important museum is housed in a concrete bunker utterly incongruous and plain ugly against the lovely old town surrounding it. However, the content is of high quality and extremely interesting. Unless you are told, which we were, you would not know",

          "My partner and I have visited the museum on several occasions now and have always found it very interesting. The lower part of it has excavations to the rear and a cross section of a medieval ship with further exhibits. The guest exhibition upstairs is currently by paper cutter",
          "The top floor had a special exhibit of paper cut out art. Fantastic work by a Norwegian artist. Plan on some time looking at this great art. Rest of the museum is devoted to the archeological discoveries from the town. The dioramas offer good insights into the life in the area",
          "The permanent exhibition provides a history of Bergen and has some quirky items. The collection of runes was cool, but it would have been good to have more translated. The current temporary exhibit upstairs is the paper cutting art of Karen Bit something - absolutely stunning",
          "This museum built over an early settlement has the remains of several houses. There is a clear timeline given of the excavated site beneath and what life was life during the Middle Ages in Bergen. Exhibits of life in a tenement building were very interesting. A movie showing",
          "We had the Bergen card, so it was free admission. The permanent exhibition area was very small and there wasn't too much to look at. There was however a temporary exhibition of art upstairs which was very beautiful. The good thing about this museum is that you don't have to walk",
          "We discovered Bryggen's life in the middle age thanks to reconstructions and discovered a little more about the runic alphabet thanks to their great collection of runes...! Really an interesting visit",
          "This is a very interesting museum, detailing the history of the Bryggen area of Bergen. It contains loads of exhibits from the original layout of buildings to the smallest of pottery finds. Good toilets/lockers and even a little caf\u00e9 on the top floor. Plus you get 50% discount",
          "This is very well done and sits atop the original city of a Bergen, which was destroyed by fire. It is very small but packs a lot into the museum, without being overwhelming. The rune exhibit was very interesting. Go to the second floor and see the AMAZING work of Karen Bit",
          "This is a really small museum which is built round an old Bryggen building. Considering the size of the museum they have managed to fit quite a lot of interesting finds/information in there. The runes exhibit was really good all with English translations. There are lockers",

          "Small but interesting. I particularly loved the exhibit on Runes that have been found in the excavations under the Bryggen. Especially the one from Gyda, who was telling someone it was time to come home! I would have loved some more English translations, especially of all the",

          "Your tour here will be self-guided. The texts on the exhibits are a little old and faded and do not read quickly. It would be nice if they were updated. It was difficult to follow the path through the exhibits. I could tell they were marked at some times, but often it was not",
          "We were on a cruise and were blessed with a lovely sunny day in Bergen and our day started with a short walk to the museum which is easily found s it is just beside the Radisson Hotel in Bryggen, Tours aren't normally available in September but I contacted the museum a few weeks",
          "I am sure it was very informative but there were a number of problems with the displays. There was no flow round the exhibits so it didn't feel as though you were following a logical story. The print, particularly the English version, was very small and difficult to read. The",

          "Fantastic brutalist building houses an in-depth and fascinating insight into the origins of Bergen. An oasis of calm away from the tourist drag, the layout creates the perfect environment to focus on the exhibits and the stories they are waiting to tell. Worth an hour or two in",
          "Resist the temptation to spend too much time looking around Bryggen before coming here. By starting here you will get an overview of what Bryggen is all about and the fight to save it from fires and misguided redevelopments. Guided tours start from here but they are not",
          "We took a walking tour of the Bryggen with the Museum in July 2014, and it was the highlight of our trip to Bergen. The tour guide kept us entertained and was very knowledgeable. We learned a lot and thoroughly enjoyed the tour. Definitely worth the time and money!",
          "This was the best guided tour we had during our 2 weeks in Scandinavia. Thomas was our guide, and if your schedule is flexible, it would be worth calling the museum to see when his next tour will be. The tour starts at the Bryggens Museum, covers the old part of the town, and",

          "You can save 40Kr by just peering through the window into this museum. What you can see are the archaeological foundations of 800 year old building which were an extension of the current Bryggen wharf you can see today. The museum is right beside the oldest church in town",
          "This museum is housed in a modern building at the NW end of the Bryggen (wharf) area for which Bergen is rightly famous. The museum itself is somewhat disappointing and, apart from the charred remains of old buildings that were discovered whilst excavating and were left in",
          "Tucked away is this wonderfull little museum,could easily be missed but make the effort to search it out. Even if this is not your thing the old buildings and narrow alley ways make it fun.",

          "This is a nice museum and some of the descriptions are in English but not all. One floor is dedicated to postcards which are quite interesting. Not amazing but perfectly pleasant. Nice staff.",
          "The remains of old burned-out houses, a jetty and a ship are on display with explanations of the various phases of development, destruction and redevelopment over the last millenium.",
          "Fairly small museum given the size of the building from outside, and the story told could have been more informative and structured for the visitor. An OK visit.",
          "The museum is built round the remaining foundations of 5 or 6 wooden houses from the 12th century. Interesting films of the Bryggen through the centuries and a few artefacts. Expend to spend around 1 hours. The museum has restricted opening in winter time but there was an",

          "Downstairs is all about old Bryggen, informative but pehaps not big enough. Upstairs there was a temporary exhibiton of Audun Hetland, a Bergen cartoonist. It's fantastic! A lot of funny cartoons, illustrations and pictures, it was better for me than the downstairs section. As",
          "Seemed so promising, with some interesting history on the Bryggen area and the rest of Bergen. Lots of artefacts in the downstairs area. It pretty much stopped there though - the second floor was just an art exhibition. Price (without Bergen card) seemed rather extortionate for",

          "Well, I didn't know anything about Bergen or why it was there...until I stumbled into this museum...It's not on the BergenCard (which I did not have) so I choose to go in. It gave a good background to the establishment of Bergen and some of the history of the region. Don't ring",
          "Really interesting the wooden buildings at the Bryggen are amazing to see and the wooden walkways with the buildings are quite close you could understand how in the past fire could wipe out all of the buildings.",
          "This museum features an introductory tour of all the sights on the Bryggen Hanseatic Wharf. It is the perfect place to start your day. Guided walks are given in several languages every hour or so. You learn enough that the rest of your day makes better sense because you are",
          "what a place and I am so surprised that these buildings are still functioning. They are used mainly as shops and galleries. You can explore it yourself and go up the very rickety and crooked stairs and even more crooked and sloping wooden floors which creaked and moved as you",
          "When I visited, I was lucky to see a fun exhibit on the history of Bergen's shoemaking history. Kids will be bored out of their minds, and there isn't really that much to see in the permanent exhibits.",
          "Experience what life was like and how the folks from various social backgrounds lived in Bergen a few centuries ago",
          "Nice combination of guided tour with entry to three museums, and an especially good look into the early period of Bergen's importance as a trading port. Tour guide was articulate and staff in general were friendly and helpful.",
          "Not much to see in this ugly building which jarred with surrounding historic neighbourhood. However, the guided walk which starts from here and goes on to explore the Bryggen itself was fascinating and very enjoyable.",
          "The biggest bonus for an attraction in Norway, IT'S FREE! Also provides much useful information about the preservation and upkeep of the centuries old buildings at Bryggen.",
          "When we bought our tickets for the tour, we were told that we were going to visit 2 other museums as well during the tour, which was a great surprise. The tour lasted about 90 min and took us through the many old parts of the Bryggen area. The girl that guiding our group took",
          "Museum has some interesting exhibits, but the best attraction is actually a tour in english. This tour starts at the museum but then progresses to 2 other nearby museums. It ends at the Hanseatic Museum which is the most interesting of the 3. The tour is 90 minutes and well",
          "This is a free booklet you pick up in the lobby of the museum. There were A FEW (out of 25-30 attractions) that were interesting or perhaps unique. However, this \"tour\" did not discuss a lot of the other beautiful, larger sites in Bergen. Disappointing & we saw WAY more on foot",
          "This is the museum that really tells you about the history of Beregn rather than the tourist themed factoids that you get in the others. And you can get a loyalty card that gets you into most of the other museums half price.",
          "One of the best local arcaeology and interpretation centres I have ever seen, with the excavated foundations of several historic houses in situ. Upstairs is a space used for temporary exhibitions, which is less satisfactory: it had a puzzling exhibition of 1950s shoes when I",
          "MUSEUMS are always high on my list of things to do wherever I am in the world but a visit to Bryggens, while not an outright disappointment, certainly left me underwhelmed. My hideous local council offices look more attractive than this museum's box-like building and the",

          "If the Bryggen is the first port of call for visitors to Bergen then this museum sets out in clear detail how and why the area developed. In truth I was slightly disappointed because at the price I would have expected something perhaps more imaginative. It rains a lot in",
          "Situated at the end of the Bryggen, it looks quite a small place but it actually takes over an hour to tour round. You learn so much of the history of Bergen. My husband & I found it fascinating. We hope you do too.",
          "Fascinated by the story of the Hanseatic League, the importance of cod and the ingenuity of the German trade idea, I visited this museum. The museum is great for history buffs, looking for real items and information about the port and importance of cod in the 1200s to 1400s. I",

          "This museum gave us a really great overview of the history of Bergen, Bryggen Harbor specifically. It packed in a lot of information about the original settlements that we didn't already know and found very interesting. A few of the temporary exhibits we saw were less",
          "The open air folks museum is mostly late 1800 to 1900, which makes it different from most of the earlier farm museums. The guided tour was great.",
          "The museum is built on the first buildings of the city. How impressive it is to go through all the artefacts they have found dating from year 1000. There is a lot to learn about life in those times.",
          "Despite the rain, there is loads to do in this little self contained area. Lots of souvenir shops and a museum that tells you the whole story of the Brygge.",
          "It is not that large. They have some good exhibits. Even if you wander around on your own, I think this is worth the time as you get to see more and hear more of the history and daily life in old Bryggen.",

          "Liked this atmospheric museum, very much. The explanations of the many times Bergen burned down and the way the people there lived in Viking and later times was well-explained by Juliana on our walking tour of Bergen. I'd love to come back... even if it does rain a lot!",
          "The place is OK, but it's not a must. I think Bryggen itself is much more interesting than the museum.",

        "wiki": "The University Museum of Bergen (Norwegian: Universitetsmuseet i Bergen) is a university museum in Bergen, Norway. The museum features material related to anthropology, archaeology, botany, geology, zoology, art, and cultural history.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe University Museum of Bergen was founded in 1825 by Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie, at the time president of the Storting. Founded under the name University Museum of Bergen with the intent of building large collections in the fields of culture and natural history, it became the grounds for most of the academic activity in the city, a tradition which has prevailed since the museum became part of the University of Bergen. The University Museum of Bergen is divided into two departments, the Natural History Collections and the Cultural History Collections and Public Outreach and exhibitions. It is also the caretaker of the museum garden, formerly the botanical garden, surrounding the natural history building, and the city's arboretum.This was the first dedicated museum building in Norway. In its early years, the museum contained numerous art collections, including several works by the painter Johan Christian Dahl, cultural artefacts, and craftwork items. In 1931, the museum moved from its location in the Seminarium Fredericianum building near Bergen Cathedral School (Bergen katedralskole), to a new building southwest of Lille Lungeg\u00e5rdsvannet.The current natural history building was designed by Johan Henrik Nebelong and finished in 1865. Bergen Museum moved in during 1866. The wings of the building were added in 1898 and the botanical garden was laid out between 1897 and 1899. The cultural history department got its own building in 1927. The increasing research activity at the museum from the late 19th century and onward led directly to the founding of the University of Bergen in 1946.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUniversitetsmuseet i Bergen (in Norwegian)\nUniversity Museum of Bergen (in English)\nUniversitetsmuseet i Bergen blir stengt p\u00e5 ubestemt tid (in Norwegian)",

        "wiki": "Fantoft Stave Church (Norwegian: Fantoft stavkirke; Nynorsk: Fantoft stavkyrkje) is a reconstructed stave church in the Fana borough of the city of Bergen, Norway.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church was originally built around the year 1150 at Fortun in Sogn, a village near the inner or eastern end of Sognefjord. In 1879,\nthe new Fortun Church (Fortun kyrkje) was constructed as a replacement for the medieval stave church. Fantoft Stave Church was threatened with demolition, as were hundreds of other stave churches in Norway. Fantoft Stave Church was bought by consul Fredrik Georg Gade and saved by moving it in pieces to Fana near Bergen in 1883. Outside the church stands a stone cross from Tjora in Sola.On 6 June 1992, the church was destroyed by arson; the first in a string of church burnings by members of the early Norwegian black metal scene. At first, the fire was thought to have been caused by lightning or an electrical failure. In 1994, Varg Vikernes of the one-man band Burzum was found guilty of burning Old \u00c5sane Church and Storetveit Church in Bergen, the burning of Skjold Church in Vindafjord, and the burning of Holmenkollen Chapel in Oslo. He was also charged with the burning of Fantoft stave church, although the jurors voted not guilty. The judges called this an error but did not overthrow the whole case. Reconstruction of the church began soon after the fire and it took six years to build again. The reconstruction was completed in 1997, and the church is now surrounded by a security fence. A photograph of the church's burnt shell appears on the cover of the 1993 Burzum EP Aske (Norwegian for \"ashes\").\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFantoft stavkirke website",

          "Great free activity if you don\u2019t go inside.\n\nTip: Just in the tram route so if you buy the 90 minutes ticket you can duck in and out and still be on your way\nTip: not as nice as the one in Oslo",

The forest around the church makes it seem like you aren't in a city. The sign leading to the church is almost impossible to read. It took us a few minutes to find the driveway.",

        "wiki": "The history of leprosy was traced by geneticists in 2005 through its origins and worldwide distribution using comparative genomics. They determined that leprosy originated in East Africa or the Near East and traveled with humans along their migration routes, including those of trade in goods and slaves. The four strains of M. leprae are based in specific geographic regions. Strain 1 occurs predominantly in East Africa, Asia, and the Pacific region; strain 2 in Ethiopia, Malawi, Nepal/North India, and New Caledonia; strain 3 in Europe, North Africa, and the Americas; and strain 4 in West Africa and the Caribbean.\nThey created a map of the dissemination of leprosy in the world. This confirmed the spread of the disease along the migration, colonisation, and slave trade routes taken from East Africa to India, West Africa to the New World, and from Africa into Europe and vice versa.In 1873 G. H. Armauer Hansen in Norway discovered the causative agent of leprosy, Mycobacterium leprae. This was the first bacterium to be identified as causing disease in humans. From the 19th century, European nations adopted some practices of India and China, administering naturally occurring oils. They were given by injection and orally, and were believed to cure some people, but results were often disputed. It was not until the 1940s that the first effective treatment, promin, became available. The search for additional anti-leprosy drugs led to the use of clofazimine and rifampicin in the 1960s and 1970s. Later, Indian scientist Shantaram Yawalkar and his colleagues formulated a combined therapy using rifampicin and dapsone, intended to mitigate bacterial resistance. Multidrug therapy (MDT) combining all three drugs was first recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the United Nations in 1981. These three anti-leprosy drugs are still used in the standard MDT regimens.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word leprosy comes from ancient Greek \u039b\u03ad\u03c0\u03c1\u03b1 [l\u00e9pr\u0101], \"a disease that makes the skin scaly\", in turn, a nominal derivation of the verb \u039b\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9 [l\u00e9p\u014d], \"to peel, scale off\". \u039b\u03ad\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 (Lepos) in ancient Greek means peel, or scale; so from \u039b\u03ad\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 derives \u039b\u03b5\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 (\u039b\u03b5\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2, \"who has peels\u2014scales\") and then \u039b\u03b5\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 (\"leprous\"). The word came into the English language via Latin and old French. The first attested English use is in the Ancrene Wisse, a 13th-century manual for nuns (\"Moyseses hond..bisemde o \u00fee spitel uuel & \u00feuhte lepruse.\" The Middle English Dictionary, s.v., \"leprous\"). A roughly contemporaneous use is attested in the Anglo-Norman Dialogues of Saint Gregory, \"Esmondez i sont li lieprous\" (Anglo-Norman Dictionary, s.v., \"leprus\").\nThroughout history, individuals with leprosy have been known as lepers. In the 21st century, this term is falling into disuse as a result of the diminishing number of leprosy patients. Because of the stigma to patients, some prefer not to use the word \"leprosy,\" preferring Hansen's disease. The term \"leprosy\" is still used by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization.\n\n\n== Historical accounts ==\nHistorians have made persistent claims that symptoms of leprosy are described among skin afflictions in ancient Greek, Middle Eastern and Indian documentary sources. Scholars acknowledge that it is difficult to make retrospective diagnoses of leprosy from symptoms described in ancient writings, but believe that Hippocrates discussed leprosy in 460 BC. Documentary evidence also indicates that it was recognized in the civilizations of ancient China, Egypt, Israel, and India. Leprosy was also described in Ancient Rome by the authors Aulus Cornelius Celsus (25 BC \u2013 37 AD) and Pliny the Elder (23\u201379 AD).Many English translations of the Bible translate tzaraath as \"leprosy,\" a confusion that derives from the use of the koine cognate \"\u039b\u03ad\u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\" (which can mean any disease causing scaly skin) in the Septuagint. While the condition may sometimes be a symptom of the disease described in this article, it has many other causes as well. In addition, ancient sources such as the Talmud (Sifra 63) make clear that tzaraath refers to various types of lesions or stains associated with ritual impurity and occurring on cloth, leather, or houses as well as skin.The Feng zhen shi \u5c01\u8a3a\u5f0f (Models for sealing and investigating), written between 266 and 246 BC in the State of Qin during the Warring States period (403\u2013221 BC), is the earliest known Chinese text which describes the symptoms of leprosy, termed under the generic word li \u7658 (for skin disorders). This text mentioned the destruction of the nasal septum in those suffering from leprosy an observation that would not be made outside of China until the writings of Avicenna in the 11th century; according to Katrina McLeod and Robin Yates it also stated lepers suffered from \"swelling of the eyebrows, loss of hair, absorption of nasal cartilage, affliction of knees and elbows, difficult and hoarse respiration, as well as anaesthesia.\"In 1846, Francis Adams compiled The Seven Books of Paulus Aegineta, which included a commentary on all medical and surgical knowledge and descriptions and remedies from the Romans, Greeks, and Arabs. Descriptions of what is believed to be leprosy are included. A proven ancient human case was verified by DNA taken from the shrouded remains of a man discovered in a tomb next to the Old City of Jerusalem; it was dated by radiocarbon methods to 1\u201350 AD.Skin infections causing symptoms similar to leprosy were likely common in the ancient world. In particular, tinea capitis (fungal scalp infection) and related infections on other body parts caused by the dermatophyte fungus Trichophyton violaceum are abundant in the late 20th century throughout North Africa and the Middle East. They may also have been common in biblical times. Likewise, the disfiguring skin disease favus is caused by Trichophyton schoenleinii, which appears to have been common throughout Africa and Eurasia before the advent of modern medicine.As late as the 17th century in Europe, persons with severe favus and similar fungal diseases (and potentially also with severe psoriasis and other diseases not caused by microorganisms) tended to be classified as having leprosy. The painting The Regents of the Leper Hospital in Haarlem 1667 by Jan de Bray (Frans Hals Museum, Haarlem, the Netherlands) shows a young Dutchman with a vivid scalp infection. It may have been caused by a fungus, but he is being cared for by three officials of a charitable home intended for leprosy sufferers. The use of the word \"leprosy\" before the mid-19th century, when microscopic examination of skin for medical diagnosis was first developed, can seldom be correlated reliably with leprosy as it is understood today.\n\n\n== Genetic analysis ==\nDNA analysis has been applied to the origins and history of leprosy. Geneticists in 2005 used comparative genomics to study these aspects, including the paths of how the disease was spread throughout the world. They determined that leprosy originated in East Africa or the Near East and traveled with humans along their migration routes, including those of trade in goods and slaves. The four strains of M. leprae are based in specific geographic regions. Strain 1 occurs predominately in East Africa, Asia, and the Pacific region; strain 2 in Ethiopia, Malawi, Nepal/north India, and New Caledonia; strain 3 in North Africa, Europe, and the Americas; and strain 4 in West Africa and the Caribbean islands.\nThe researchers created a map showing the dissemination of leprosy by these strains. The disease clearly accompanied humans along their migration, colonisation, and slave trade routes taken since ancient times. Some peoples traveled from East Africa to India, millions were taken in the slave trade from West Africa to the New World, and others traveled from Africa into Europe and vice versa.In 2009 skeletal remains from the second millennium B.C. were discovered at Balathal, in Rajasthan, northwest India. Study and analysis of these remains were documented as the oldest skeletal evidence for leprosy. The scholars who studied these remains suggest that, if the disease did migrate from Africa to India during the third millennium B.C., \"at a time when there was substantial interaction among the Indus Civilization, Mesopotamia, and Egypt, there needs to be additional skeletal and molecular evidence of leprosy in India and Africa so as to confirm the African origin of the disease.\" Evidence for the disease was later confirmed in the human skeletal remains from the archaeological site of Harappa, in Pakistan. The disease was thus present in the urban centers of the Indus civilization before 2000 B.C., further supporting the hypothesis it migrated here as part of the Third Millennium B.C. Interaction Sphere, an exchange network the spanned the Arabian Sea.\n\n\n== Discovery of bacterium ==\nAfter the end of the 17th century, Norway, Iceland, and England were the countries in Western Europe where leprosy was a significant problem. Norway appointed a medical superintendent for leprosy in 1854 and established a national register for people with leprosy in 1856. This was the first national patient register in the world.Mycobacterium leprae, the causative agent of leprosy, was discovered by G. H. Armauer Hansen in Norway in 1873, making it the first bacterium to be identified as causing disease in humans. Hansen observed a number of nonrefractile small rods in unstained tissue sections. The rods were not soluble in potassium lye, and they were acid- and alcohol-fast. In 1879, he stained these organisms with Ziehl's method and noted the similarities with Koch's bacillus (Mycobacterium tuberculosis). There were three significant differences between these organisms: (1) the rods in the leprosy lesions were extremely numerous, (2) they formed characteristic intracellular collections (globii), and (3) the rods had a variety of shapes with branching and swelling. These differences suggested that leprosy was caused by an organism related to but distinct from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Hansen worked at St. J\u00f8rgens Hospital in Bergen, founded early in the fifteenth century. St. J\u00f8rgens is now preserved as a museum related to the history and research of leprosy, Lepramuseet.Hansen's finding was opposed principally by his father-in-law, Daniel Cornelius Danielssen, who considered it a hereditary disease. He had described it as such in his book, Trait\u00e9 de la Spedalskhed ou Elephantiasis des Grecs\u2014the standard reference book on leprosy from 1848 until the death of Danielssen in 1895. While Danielssen's book was a highly used source and provided a solid foundation for worldwide leprosy understanding, it was soon surpassed. In 1867 Dr. Gavin Milroy finished the Royal College of Physicians' Report on leprosy. His work, which compiled data from all corners of the British Empire, agreed with Danielssen that leprosy was a hereditary disease. In addition, he said that leprosy was also a constitutional disease that could be mitigated by improvements to a patient's health, diet, and living conditions.\n\n\n== Historical treatments ==\nThe disease was known in Ancient Greece as elephantiasis (elephantiasis graecorum).\nAt various times blood was considered to be a treatment either as a beverage or as a bath; sometimes the blood of children or virgins was required, suggesting associations of ritual purity. Europeans associated this practice with the Ancient Egyptians, but it appears to have been developed independently in China. This practice was used until at least 1790, when the use of dog blood was mentioned in De Secretis Naturae. Paracelsus recommended the use of lamb's blood, and blood from dead bodies was sometimes used.\nSnakes were also used, according to Pliny, Aretaeus of Cappadocia, and Theodorus. Gaucher recommended treatment with cobra venom. Boinet, in 1913, tried increasing doses of bee stings (up to 4000). Scorpions and frogs were used occasionally instead of snakes. The excreta of Anabas (the climbing fish) was also tried.\n\nAlternative treatments included scarification with or without the addition of irritants including arsenic and hellebore. Castration was also practiced in the Middle Ages.\nA common pre-modern treatment of leprosy was chaulmoogra oil. The oil has long been used in India as an Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of leprosy and various skin conditions. It has also been used in China and Burma. It was introduced to the West by Frederic John Mouat, a professor at Bengal Medical College. He tried the oil as an oral and topical agent in two cases of leprosy and reported significant improvements in an 1854 paper.This paper caused some confusion. Mouat indicated that the oil was the product of a tree Chaulmoogra odorata, which had been described in 1815 by William Roxburgh, a surgeon and naturalist, while he was cataloging the plants in the East India Company\u2019s botanical garden in Calcutta. This tree is also known as Gynocardia odorata. For the rest of the 19th century, this tree was thought to be the source of the oil. In 1901, Sir David Prain identified the chaulmoogra seeds of the Calcutta bazaar and of the Paris and London apothecaries as coming from Taraktogenos kurzii, which is found in Burma and Northeast India. The oil mentioned in the Ayurvedic texts was determined to be from the tree Hydnocarpus wightiana, known as Tuvakara in Sanskrit and chaulmugra in Hindi and Persian.\nThe first parenteral administration was given by the Egyptian doctor Tortoulis Bey, personal physician to the Sultan Hussein Kamel of Egypt. He had been using subcutaneous injections of creosote for tuberculosis. In 1894 he administered subcutaneous injection of chaulmoogra oil to a 36-year-old Egyptian Copt who had been unable to tolerate oral treatment. After 6 years and 584 injections, the patient was declared cured.\nAn early scientific analysis of the oil was carried out by Frederick B. Power in London in 1904. He and his colleagues isolated a new unsaturated fatty acid from the seeds, which they named 'chaulmoogric acid'. They also investigated two closely related species: Hydnocarpus wightiana and Hydnocarpus anthelmintica. By comparing material from the trees, they isolated both chaulmoogric acid and a closely related compound, 'hydnocarpus acid'. They also investigated Gynocardia odorata and found that it produced neither of these acids. Later investigation showed that 'taraktogenos' (Hydnocarpus kurzii) also produced chaulmoogric acid.\nAdministration of the oil was difficult. Taken orally it is extremely nauseating. Given by enema may cause peri-anal ulcers and fissures. Given by injection the drug caused fever and other local reactions. Despite these difficulties, a series of 170 patients were studied in 1916 by Ralph Hopkins, the attending physician at the Louisiana Leper Home in Carville, Louisiana. He divided the patients into two groups - 'incipient' and 'advanced'. He reported that in the advanced cases, 25% (at most) showed any improvement or arrest of their condition; in the incipient cases, 45% showed an improvement or stabilization of the disease (mortality rates were 4% and 8%, respectively). The remainder absconded from the Home, apparently in improved condition.Given the apparent usefulness of this agent, a search began for improved formulations. Victor Heiser the Chief Quarantine Officer and Director of Health for Manila, and Elidoro Mercado the house physician at the San Lazaro Hospital for lepers in Manila, decided to add camphor to a prescription of chaulmoogra and resorcin, which was typically given orally. This was at the suggestion of Merck and Company in Germany to whom Heiser had written. They found that patients could tolerate this new compound without the nausea that had accompanied the earlier preparations.\nHeiser and Mercado in 1913 administered the oil by injection to two patients, with the result that they were cured of the disease. Since the doctors had been using the oil in conjunction with other materials, the results were not clear. Two additional patients were treated by injections of oil alone and appeared to be cured of the disease. The following year, Heiser reported on an additional 12 patients, but the results were mixed.\nResearchers worked to develop less toxic injectable forms of this oil. Merck of Darmstadt had already produced a version of the sodium salts in 1891. They named this sodium gynocardate in the mistaken belief that the origin of the oil was Gynocardia odorata. Bayer in 1908 marketed a commercial version of the esters under the name 'Antileprol'. At the University of Hawaii, the young chemist Alice Ball developed a chemical process that made the oil less hydrophobic and therefore more readily absorbed by the body. Sadly she died before she could see the results of her work: after being treated with the modified oil, 78 patients were able to return home from leper colonies in 1920. Despite the common side effects and continuing debates about its efficacy, chaulmoogra oil remained the best available treatment for leprosy into the 1940s.To ensure a supply of this agent, Joseph Rock, Professor of Systematic Botany at the College of Hawaii, traveled to Burma to procure seeds of the trees. The local villagers located a grove of trees in seed, which he used to establish a plantation of 2,980 trees on the island of Oahu, Hawaii between 1921 and 1922. There continued to be numerous leprosy patients in the islands.\n\n\n== Asylums ==\n\nContrary to popular opinion, people were not universally isolated in leprosy asylums in the Middle Ages. In Europe, asylums offered shelter to all manner of people, including some who would have had skin complaints that included leprosy. The expansion of asylums in England between 1100 and 1250 was not necessarily in response to a major epidemic of leprosy.(346)\nAdditionally, leprosy did not disappear in Europe after the medieval period as a result of a \"great confinement\" of leprosy-affected people in leprosy asylums. In Portugal, for example, there were 466 cases in 1898. By 1938 there were sufficient numbers to warrant the construction of Rovisco Pais, to treat people affected by the disease. This was not only to treat those returning from the New World, but also for rural dwellers infected within Portugal, as the records of Rovisco Pais show. Spain also had cases enough to engage public attention. In 1902, Jesuits Father Carlos Ferris and Joaquin Ballister founded the Patronato San Francisco de Borja, Fontilles. In 1904, there were still 552 cases treated there and more than 1,000 in total estimated in Spain. This documentation affirms the genetic tracking carried out by Monot et al. (2005) that traces exchanges along the trade and slave routes from Africa, to Spain and Portugal, to the West Indies, and back again to Spain and Portugal. At the same time, there was an autochthonous strain that had persisted from an earlier period.\nNumerous leprosaria, or leper hospitals, were founded in the Middle Ages; Matthew Paris, a Benedictine monk, estimated that in the early thirteenth century, there were 19,000 across Europe. The first recorded leper colony was in Harbledown, England. While leprosaria were common throughout Europe in the early, middle, and late Middle Ages, how leprosy was dealt with in the Middle Ages is still viewed through the \"distorting lens\" of \"nineteenth century attempts by physicians, polemicist, and missionaries\" who tried to use \"the past for evidence to support their own campaigns for mandatory segregation.\" The leprosy asylum or leprosarium of the past had many designations and variations in structure and degree of restriction. In the medieval period, it also offered basic support to many indigent people, amongst whom some would have suffered from leprosy. In England, these houses were run along monastic lines and required those admitted to take vows of poverty, obedience and chastity. Those flouting the rules could be expelled. Within the Christian framework, the disease was associated with symbolic significance. Withdrawal from everyday life was considered symbolic of ritually separating themselves from the world of the flesh, as a redemptive action, on behalf of the whole of society.The Order of Saint Lazarus was a hospitaller and military order of monks that began as a leper hospital outside Jerusalem in the twelfth century. It remained associated with leprosy throughout its history. The first monks in this order were leper knights, and they originally had leper grand masters, although these aspects of the order changed over the centuries. From this order was derived the name lazar house.\nRadegund was noted for washing the feet of lepers. Orderic Vitalis writes of a monk, Ralf, who was so overcome by the plight of lepers that he prayed to catch leprosy himself (which he eventually did). The leper would carry a clapper and bell to warn of his approach. This was as much to attract attention for charity as to warn people that a diseased person was near.\nThe leprosaria of the Middle Ages had multiple benefits: they provided treatment and safe living quarters for people with leprosy who were granted admission; they eased tension amongst the healthy townspeople; and they provided for a more stable populace for the authorities to govern.\n\n\n== Modern treatments ==\n\nIt has been said that promin was first synthesised in 1940 by Feldman of Parke-Davis and company. Although Parke-Davis synthesised the compound, it seems certain that they were not the first. In the same year that Gelmo described sulphanilamide (1908), Emil Fromm, professor of chemistry in the medical faculty of the University of Freiburg im Breisgau, in Germany, described another compound related to the sulphonamides: this was diaminodiphenylsulphone or dapsone (DDS). No one recognised the potential of this compound until Buttle and his colleagues at the Wellcome laboratories and Fourneau and the researchers at the Institut Pasteur simultaneously found in 1937 that dapsone was ten times as potent against streptococcal infection in mice and about a hundred times as toxic as sulphanilamide.Until the introduction of treatment with promin in the 1940s, there was no effective treatment for leprosy. The efficacy of promin was first discovered by Guy Henry Faget and his co-workers in 1943 at Carville, Louisiana. Robert Cochrane was the first to use DDS, the active component of promin, at the Lady Willingdon Leprosy Settlement, in Chingleput, near Madras, India. John Lowe was the first to successfully administer DDS orally at Uzuakoli Leper Settlement, in Nigeria, in spite of indications that the drug was highly toxic. Both innovations made it possible to produce a treatment that was cheap, seemingly effective, and could be distributed on a large scale.\nScientists eventually realised that DDS was only weakly bactericidal against M. leprae, and it was considered necessary for patients to take the drug indefinitely. When dapsone was used alone, the M. leprae population quickly evolved antibiotic resistance. By the 1960s, the world's only known anti-leprosy drug became ineffective against resistant bacteria.\nThe search for more effective anti-leprosy drugs led to the use of clofazimine and rifampicin in the 1960s and 1970s. Later, Indian scientist Shantaram Yawalkar and his colleagues formulated a combined therapy using rifampicin and dapsone, intended to mitigate bacterial resistance. The first trials of combined treatment were carried out in Malta in the 1970s.\nMultidrug therapy (MDT) combining all three drugs was first recommended by a WHO Expert Committee in 1981. These three anti-leprosy drugs are still used in the standard MDT regimens. None of them is used alone because of the risk of developing resistance.\nAs this treatment was quite expensive, it was not quickly adopted in most countries where the disease is endemic. In 1985, leprosy was still considered a public health problem in 122 countries. The 44th World Health Assembly (WHA), held in Geneva in 1991, passed a resolution to eliminate leprosy as a public-health problem by the year 2000 \u2014 defined as reducing the global prevalence of the disease to less than 1 case per 10,000. At the Assembly, the World Health Organization (WHO) was given the mandate to develop an elimination strategy by its member states. This was based on increasing the geographical coverage of MDT and patients\u2019 accessibility to the treatment. Novartis produces this medication for free.\n\n\n== Overview of some nations ==\n\n\n=== India ===\n\nThe Oxford Illustrated Companion to Medicine says that leprosy, as well as cures for it, were described in the Hindu religious book Atharva-veda. Writing in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 2008, Kearns and Nash state that the first mention of leprosy is in the Indian medical treatise Sushruta Samhita (6th century BC). The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Paleopathology (1998) holds that: \"The Sushruta Samhita from India describes the condition quite well and even offers therapeutic suggestions as early as about 600 BC\" The surgeon Sushruta lived in the Indian city of Kashi by the 6th century BC, and the medical treatise Sushruta Samhita attributed to him was documented during the 1st millennium BC. The earliest surviving excavated written material that contains the works of Sushruta is the Bower Manuscript\u2014dated to the 4th century AD, almost a millennium after the original work. Despite these earlier works, Europeans believed that the first widely considered accurate description of the disease was that of Galen of Pergamum in 150 AD.In 2009, a 4,000-year-old skeleton was uncovered in India that was found to contain traces of leprosy. The discovery was made at a site called Balathal, which is today part of Rajasthan. This is believed to be the oldest known physical case of the disease. This pre-dated by 1500 years the previous earliest recognized case, dating to 6th-century Egypt. It is believed that the excavated skeleton belonged to a male, who was in his late 30s and belonged to the Ahar Chalcolithic culture. Archaeologists have said that this is the first such example that dates to prehistoric India. This finding supports the evidence of the disease spreading to India by human migration routes from its origin in Africa.\nIn 1874, the Missions to Lepers began to offer support to leprosy asylums that offered shelter to people affected by leprosy in India. Gradually, they instituted a policy of segregating males and females in the institutions. The asylum superintendents believe that this separation was beneficial in order to avoid infecting the children of diseased parents and to prevent further births. At this time, there were still debates about the transmission of the disease. The Leprosy Mission were heartened to find that the separated children did not develop the disease.In 1881, around 120,000 leprosy patients were documented in India. The central government passed the Lepers Act of 1898, which provided legal provision for forcible confinement of leprosy sufferers in India, but the Act was not enforced.\n\n\n=== China ===\n\nRegarding ancient China, Katrina C. D. McLeod and Robin D. S. Yates identify the State of Qin's Feng zhen shi \u5c01\u8a3a\u5f0f (Models for sealing and investigating), dated 266-246 BC, as offering the earliest-known unambiguous description of the symptoms of low-resistance leprosy, even though it was termed under li \u7658, a general Chinese word for skin disorder. This 3rd-century BC Chinese text on bamboo slip, found in an excavation of 1975 at Shuihudi, Yunmeng, Hubei province, described not only the destruction of the \"pillar of the nose\" but also the \"swelling of the eyebrows, loss of hair, absorption of nasal cartilage, affliction of knees and elbows, difficult and hoarse respiration, as well as anesthesia.\"\n\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nIn the 21st century, the rate of prevalence across Indonesia is slightly under one new case per 10,000 people, with approximately 20,000 new cases detected each year. But, the rate is considerably higher in certain regions, particularly South Sulawesi (with more than three new cases per 10,000 people) and North Maluku (with more than five new cases per ten thousand people). MDT is provided free of charge to patients who require it in Indonesia. Several hospitals in major population centers are specifically intended to deal with the medical needs of those affected by the disease. While the early detection and treatment of leprosy has improved over the years, approximately ten percent of patients in Indonesia have already suffered significant nerve or other damage prior to the identification and treatment of their disease. This is because of lack of awareness as well as the pervasive stigma that discourages those with the disease from seeking treatment.PERMATA (Perhimpunan Mandiri Kusta) Indonesia was established in 2007 to fight the stigma associated with leprosy and eliminate discrimination against those suffering from the disease. The organization was founded by a small group of individuals who had all been treated for leprosy. The founders worked to establish links with key figures amongst those suffering from the disease in communities in South Sulawesi, East Java and NTT, the three provinces where the rate of incidence of the disease is amongst the highest in Indonesia.\n\n\n=== Iran ===\nThe Persian polymath Avicenna (c. 980\u20131037) was the first outside of China to describe the destruction of the nasal septum in those suffering from leprosy.\n\n\n=== Japan ===\n\nIn a document written in 833, leprosy was described as \"caused by a parasite that eats five organs of the body. The eyebrows and eyelashes come off, and the nose is deformed. The disease brings hoarseness, and necessitates amputations of the fingers and toes. Do not sleep with the patients, as the disease is transmittable to those nearby.\" This was the first document concerning believed infectious aspect of the disease.\nJapan passed leprosy prevention laws in 1907, 1931, and 1953 that were based on segregation of persons with the disease; this approach intensified leprosy stigma. Lepers were seen as being incurable and infectious. Males admitted to leprosaria in Japan were sterilized, and females found to be pregnant were forced to have abortions. These extreme actions were done to prevent children of diseased parents from being born lest they carry the disease. Doctors during this time still mistakenly believed that leprosy was a hereditary disease. The 1953 law was abrogated in 1996. More than a decade later, in 2008 there were 2717 ex-patients in 13 national sanatoria and two private hospitals.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n1877: Lewis, T. R.; D. D.

          "This is a great place to spend an hour or so! If you need English then you are given a card to read so that you can follow everything. For some reason this region seems to have suffered with a huge amount of leprosy....I actually know a bit more about the disease now. Also they",
          "I read a bit about this place and decided that we must include it on our visit to Bergen, and was definitely not disappointed. If you have the slightest interest in history, medicine, science or even social history, you would be interested in this place. It's well laid out,",
          "Some elements of a house of horrors only because it was true. But the museum is lovingly restored and maintained. Slightly off the beaten path with a welcome absence of most of the tourists. The buildings were a testament to the country and staffs care for all their citizens",
          "When I think of leprosy, I never thought of Norway. But it turns out that in the 18th and 19th century, Norway had one of the world's highest incidences of the disease and western Norway was particularly hard hit. This museum is located in an old hospital for patients with the",

          "Learnt a lot about leprosy especially in Norway. The guide was informative, friendly and interesting. The museum itself was quite basic but worth the 9 pounds entry on a rainy day. Didn't take long to look round and I feel more could've been made of it, with regards artefacts",

          "We learned so much on our visit! Our young guide was enthusiastic and so knowledgeable. Such a crippling disease, this hospital was a major player in finding a cure for Leprosy. It was mind losing to learn statistics and to see how the townsfolk responded so well to those",
          "This hospital has a very interesting history. At one time 3% of Norway's population was infected. Dr. Hansen, who discovered that it was caused by a bacterium, worked at St. George's, hence the name Hansen's Disease. The hospital complex is as was decades ago. I strongly",

          "Amidst Bergen\u2019s beauty there is another side of the coin: through the late 19th century, Norway\u2019s west coast had an incredibly high prevalence of leprosy. This is the story, both of the disease and the search for the cure. Worth visiting, both to learn and to get an appreciation",
          "We walked for about 20 minutes on an unseasonably warm day to get here. There was no signage to indicate where the entrance is. There are multiple buildings, but the museum is in only one building. We paid our fees and asked for an English guide. We were given a notebook with",
          "This was quite an unexpected find and only cost about \u00a34 entrance fee. Unfortunately we were not able to get a guided tour as there was a school party due but we were given informative printed and laminated sheets written in English. Although they didn't always seem to relate",
          "Interesting to see an old hospital where leprosy patients lived. Many stories of patients and how they were treated before coming to the hospital. Sad but informative.",
          "Although the site is small it is filled with great information which helps to give a greater understanding of the history of Bergen. I wouldn't say visiting this place is a must but its worth checking out if you have time",
          "Take a guided tour so that the remaining buildings have meaning to you.The hospital where lepers were housed are on display. Interesting to learn about the history of patient rights.",
          "The last leprosy patient died in 1973 (yes nineteen seventy three). The museum is in the wards where leprosy patients spent much of their lives. Displays are mainly in Norwegian, but English translation \"books\" are available and good. Nice and helpful staff.",
          "Spent a couple of hours at the Leprosy museum on a rainy weekend day and learnt plenty about the challenges of leprosy, the origins of the disease and the way people were marginalised in society. Most of the exhibition is presented through reading of panels in the various rooms",
          "I took my camera one after noon and I passed the Leprosy Museum, I found some really good spot ideal for photography",
          "While this was not open in October it was still of interest. The premise belies its history. The building is quite weathered and aged. The spire is a through back to its earliest days as St George Hospital. However as with any museum it will tell its very own story. Wait till",
          "Located right in the heart of the city this is a fascinating museum. Housed on the site of the 18th Century hospital, this museum is really atmospheric. The fascinating and moving excerpts and exhibits tell the story of leprosy in Bergen and the determined efforts of physicians",
          "We got very lucky to see this. It had closed for the season August 31, but on September 8, Bergen had a culture night and many museums reopened in the evening and were free of charge! This museum was one of them, so we added it to the top of our list. This museum does an",

          "I have never had the opportunity to visit a leprosy museum before and I found it really interesting if a little gruesome. They provide a guide in English and you can wander at leisure.",
          "The people of Bergen were helping lepers centuries before other Europeans, as this hospital attests. Dr. Hansen (leprosy also known as Hansen's disease) discovered the leprosy bacillus. The museum is a historical museum, has English-language written guide one can borrow as you",
          "And worth the visit to see what this town went thru in the 1800's with this horrible disease. In an old hospital with original rooms and beds. Remarkable!",
          "We ran in here to get away from the crazy rain. But we were glad we did because otherwise we never would have gone. The church was amazing with a great wooden feel. The guided tour is worth every penny because the guide is incredibly knowledgeable about leprosy even telling us",
          "We found this an interesting and unexpected diversion. It gives you a window into a real piece of Norway's history and the unusual and informative short biographies of real people help to relate to this museum at a very human level. You can just imagine the experience of keeping",

          "I'm guessing that few of us think of Norway when we think of leprosy. The Leprosy Museum (Norwegian: Lepramuseet) reminds us that leprosy was not confined to Ancient Israel and Bible stories. Dr. G.A. Hansen was born in Bergen and is the one who identified the bacterium",
          "We visited the Leprosy museum during our stay in Bergen. An interesting insight of how leprosy sufferers were isolated in these hospitals and yet treated with dignity and respect. The hospital even has its own church in which the patients could worship. Each inmates cell had",
          "This is an incredibly interesting site. If you get there for 12 they will open the church and give a bit of the history of it. While free with the Bergen card they will charge you 20kr for a guided tour. No need to take it just ask for the english translations and you will",
          "The buildings and rooms are presented in their \"worn\" state which adds to the impression needed to create the atmosphere of what it must have been like to have been incarcerated here. It also invokes the compassion of those caring for the leprosy sufferers. It is worth visiting",
          "We wanted to come here more out of curiosity than anything after looking for top attractions in Bergen. Seemed odd that one was a museum dedicated to leprosy so it had to be payed a visit. It's a low key affair and you're given a set of laminated information sheets to guide you",
          "Much more interesting than we imagined. We needed to use our GPS on the rental car to find it and parking is only on the street. We had a nurse with that has been in third-world countries that could explain for us. Most script was in English as well as Norwegian. Pay close",
          "Charming place now which hides a grime if fascinating history. The herb garden is delightful and access to the church at 12.45. The museum shuts at 3pm. Some stairs involved",
          "We had 4 hours in Bergen and this was one place we wanted to visit. It was a wet day but we walked along trying to pace our time. We arrived at the Leprosy Hospital only to be told it was closing at 3 pm, which only gave us 10 minutes. We tried to persuade those on the desk that",
          "The history of leprosy and how it was treated is fascinating. Exhibits are good and respect the history.",
          "I went to this museum as my father worked for The Leprosy Mission for many years. I was really impressed with the sensitivity of the museum. It is really worth a look.",
          "A very interesting and thought provoking museum. I learnt a lot about how leprosy was treated. Try to get into the church - a fascinating place.",
          "I thought, for sure, with this trip that I would be able to visit this museum b/c some of the literature I viewed before arriving in Bergen stated that opening dates were from May 1. Upon arrival, and after a stop at the Information Center, I learned that the museum did not",
          "This mediavel hospital is an amazing place. We can learn about leprosy illness, and the fight of Norwegian doctors against it. The place was a hospital from the Mediavel Ages. The little chapel beside the hospital is also amazing.",
          "This is the very building where lepers lived the rest of their lives, the last person died here in 1946. The adjacent wooden church, St. George's, is part of the museum,and there is a small herb garden. The museum is situated in the city centre and is well worth a visit",
          "Every year we tried to visit, but the opening hours are restricted and we kept missing the chance. Finally we made it and it was fascinating. This is a quirky old building, set off in a peaceful courtyard off a main road. The whole atmosphere is very moving and sympathetic to",
          "This visit was surprising not only for the amazing history that surrounds this place, but also because of the amazing exhibition that transports you to a time where life was hard and suffering. A really nice place to visit, especially with a guide. You have at least two",
          "The first time we hear about St. Joergen(St George`s) hospital is approx 1408. This is before the Reformation in the kingdom of Denmark-Norway and at this time the hospital was governed by the nuns of Nonnesaeter Monastery, situated approx where the railway station of Bergen is",
          "Small museum with a good number of rooms to explore. A paper guide was provided with English translations for the poster exhibits, but the guide was quite flimsy and difficult to navigate. Still worth a visit, though. After all, where else can you see a museum dedicated to",
          "A most interesting place to visit. Lovely church and a historic leprasorium. People often don't realize that leprosy is not just a tropical disease. Norway had some 5000 lepars in the 19th century ( the last lepar in Norway.died in the 1940s ). It was here that Armaur",
          "This little museum is a gem. It is very interesting because it is a one of a kind and \"the real thing\", not a modern construction, showing the condition for the early breakethrough treatment of leprosy. It is also quite small, so you can easily take it all in.",
          "This is where the leprocy patients were sent to in Bergen and the surroundings, for several hundred years. Most of them lived there for the rest of their lives. We can see how they lived - their rooms and how their daily lives uesd to be. There is also a lot of documentation in",
          "In many parts of the world leprosy is commonly known as Hansen\u2019s disease, after the Norwegian physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen who discovered the leprosy bacillus in Bergen in 1873. This museum tells the story of in an informed way and is one that should be known.",
          "This was first hospital to help the lepers in Norway. It has a fascinating history and is well worth a visit. Does not cost very much to go in and they do a conducted tour also if you wish.",
          "This is a great history of the discovery of a preventative for leprosy (but not a cure). Actual patient rooms are shown, with pictures. Not for the faint at heart.",
          "Bergen had a huge leprosy outbreak and this museum reminds about the suffering of these people. It's a must see. It's haunting.",
          "An interesting stop for a rainy day in Bergen. The museum catalogues the history of Leprosy in Norway. Some may find the photos of the patients disturbing.",
          "If you have an interest, this is a well done museum. This museum resides in a Bergen leprosy hospital because leprosy remained in Norway longer than in other European countries. It described not only the steps made to improve outcomes, but lives of sufferers and medical",
          "When our husband took us here, we all looked at each other, \"A LEPROSY museum?\" But it was interesting in its own way. It gave great insight to the struggles of the past and the brave people who endured the disease, as well as honored those who gave their lives to treating it.",
          "Well preserved hospital close to where we were staying. Asked re an English speaking tour and only had to wait a little time. We visited the back 'herb' garden, the church next door (and heard it's history as well) and found out about the life of those who lived there. Was good",
          "This is a very unusual, moving museum. A lot of people don't even know that leprosy was once endemic in West Norway and that the leprosy hospital in Bergen only closed in the 1970s - nor that Hansen, who worked there, was a pioneer in discovering facts that helped to end the",
          "Have tried several times to visit the Leprosy museum which has limited opening times/season. It's small and can be visited in a short space of time. There is a good written English translation document provided. Take the opportunity to visit the on-site church. The guides",
          "Leprosy hospital since 1400's, caring for victims of an isolating vicious disease. Norway had a surprisingly high infection rate, due to long period of low economic conditions long after other parts of Europe had managed to rid themselves of leprosy. Touching glimpses of church",
          "The museum itself is interesting, more so that we expected but the pedestrian street just beyond has some of the best shops! The \"kitten\" shop has wonderful prices and scarves.",
          "Highly recommended if you are interested in medical/ diseases. Tour guide offers a tour for about 40minutes of the outside/ surrounding buildings and herb gardens. Very knowledgable about the history of the buildings. Good representation of life as a leprosy patient. It's",
          "Interesting and full of information about this original building. Lots to learn about the patients, doctors and medical advancement with leprosy nursing. The wooden church next door is open at certain times. Make sure to ask what the times are.",

          "This small museum which lies near town, but is often forgotten is well worth a visit. The museum is in the actual hospital where the lepers were looked after. It gives a sad but realistic view of how terrible their lives were at that time.",
          "The small church and wooden buildings encircling the cobblestone courtyard is low-key an near-to anonymous. However what remains of this more than 400+ years hospital and hospice is a true relic in the world-history of medicine. No less! The old wooden halls and tiny rooms",
          "Immaculately preserved building, fascinating to see it and read about it's history. The only thing I was disappointed with was I'd researched a fact they had there about leprosy in Europe and it was a off by a small amount. Well worth a visit though and offered a very good",
          "We dived into this muesum to avoid the rain really and was so glad we did. Very atmospheric and so informative. We were really lucky also to be allowed to go into the little church. Thank you.",
          "Not easy to see, but so interesting and well done, the small Leprosy Museum is well worth a visit and be sure to see the church as well. Don't miss the door handles/",
          "This 18th century building (built on the site of earlier hospitals that had burnt down) offers a fascinating view of early modern European hospitals. Although all the signs are in Norwegian (with interesting pictures) the very helpful staff have English guide-sheets which you",
          "This is only a small museum with little in the way of displays. If you are English speaking there are laminated sheets available. I found it an awful lot of reading - don't get me wrong it was interesting but I could just find a seat and read all the info without moving around",
          "Only recommended if you do not mind reading a lot of information and seeing some rather gruesome pictures. It was very enlightening though.",
          "You get an overview how leprosy was perceived over the centuries and how the discovery of bacterium that causes it happened. The museum doesn't have much on show except for giving you an idea of the conditions in which the patients were kept. Anyway, it provides a setting for",
          "Just opened for the season today 15 may. I used my bergen card so had free entrance. Only a small museum but worth a visit and it really encapulates what it must have been like for those poor lepers living in their small rooms in this former leprosy hopital",
          "Even if they are closed (from mid-September until mid-May), try to contact them via email or phone, and they will try to arrange a schedule for you to visit (80 NOK). Totally worth the visit. The captions are in Norwegian, but there is a translation on a binder you can use. This",
          "It isn't a very large museum but it does pack quite the educational punch. The museum was the hospital where they kept the lepers thereby making the living situation of those people all the more real. Everything is done very tastefully and each room serves as a talking point,",
          "I'm glad we took the time to visit this small museum, in the former Leprosy Hospital. Whilst the displays are in Norwegian the helpful staff gave us a set of laminated notes in English that helped us to work our way around and understand what we were looking at. The personal",
          "If you go you should try and get the guided tour as it in its self if not that amusing without the history being told. In the peak season guided tours are quite regular.",

          "A former leprosy hospital but now museum, does not perhaps seem to be a place to visit whilst on holiday, but this small museum is beautifully set out. You almost feel that the former patients have gone out for an afternoon stroll. Make sure to visit the on site chapel The",
          "A dark piece of history and sadness. I could feel their sorrow and pain. The hospital is kept as it was when used. I thought the church room to be very special.",
          "This museum may seem a bit macabre, but it is really well curated and truly fascinating. One can not only walk through the rooms where so many suffered from leprosy, but learn the history of the disease. Next door is a church that is also very beautiful. The staff is really",
          "The Museum is housed in the old leprosy hospital and you can walk around the rooms and read about leprosy in Norway, stories of those who were treated at the hospital etc - most of which are terribly sad because of the stigma associated with the disease. Much of the information",
          "This museum is a must for medical educated personel. Armauer Hansen is given the honor of discovering the cause of leprosy which was a serious disease. This is today not a health issue which is uncurable in prensent Norway",
          "Interesting, small museum about the history of leprosy & the folks who lived at the home. Small church adjoining is wooden & beautiful. Worth a visit if you like unusual topics and getting a sense of the smaller aspects of the place you're visiting",
          "I was intrigued that a leprosy museum existed in Norway but was glad i took the time to visit My knowledge of the disease was limited to biblical stories from childhood so i learnt a lot. The building is also lovely and well preserved. Take a few minutes to sit and enjoy the",
          "This is a museum that will bring you back in time - to when the world was a little worse. Still - it is worth spending a while imagining the smells and the sights and the sounds that were once in there. Why not use a rainy Bergen day learning something new? I think we paid",
          "First patient to successfully sue for malpractice was here when Hansen injected a patient with leprosy bacteria in the eye, in front of an audience. Still the museum steers away from the shock and horror tactics focusing instead on the life of those who lived here, shunned by",
          "A small museum a little way from the Fish Market. Not a lot to see but interesting to discover how this disease was treated.",
          "I like unusual museums and it was good to find out there is a museum dedicated to leprosy in Bergen. You can walk around a place which was once a hospitals for leprosy patients and read interesting materials including touching stories of individuals affected by the sickness. It",
          "A little unsure about busing,quite an insight into their sad lives. Walk around museum so you could feel and see how they must have lived",
          "This is a really interesting museum with lots of fascinating stories about Bergen's leprosy sufferers and their treatment by the hospital and society in general. Some of the stories are heartbreaking. The artefacts are fascinating and the building is really rather beautiful",
          "This is a very small museum in a building with an interesting history. They are very welcoming and provide extensive translations for visitors of different languages (unlike many other museums in bergen). It's a small museum, just a couple of rooms, and only open a few hours",
          "Do not miss this museum. Excellent guide with impeccable knowledge and command of English. We didn't know a lot about Leprosy before our visit but it gave us a real insight into the blighted lives of those unfortunate enough to have suffered it. Like others have said; it was",
          "We arrived as a tour was beginning. The guide was excellent- very knowledgable and enthusiastic. English translations of the info were available. Well worth a visit",
          "They provide sheets with information about the museum. You are able to visit to main areas - the sleeping area and the kitchen. Learned some about the disease and the progress they made over the years for the cure. Would not go out of my way to visit.",
          "This place was where people with leprocy were hidden away from sociatey, and where important research was done which resulted in a cure in the end. For these reasons, and because it is a very moving place, it's an imporatnt place to visit.",
          "I found this one of the most interesting places I visited. Don't let the name put you off it is facenating. I was lucky that the church was opened for 5 minutes during my visit and it is an outstanding church if it is open don't miss it. Thanks to all for creating a Museum that",
          "Entry for us was free as we had purchased 24hr Bergen cards. Information sheets were given to us on entry and the pack was very well explained to us and relatively easy to follow. A very interesting insight into the Leprosy condition and the hospital.",
          "Museum offers free guided tours. Our guide was knowledgeable about the disease and history of museum. Museum provides insights into patients sufferings and information regarding leprosy. Worth a visit.",
          "Great little museum that describes the experiences of patients suffering from this disease through many centuries in Bergen. We arrived at opening time and caught the first tour of the day where we were given a good basic insight into the history of the hospital. We then",
          "As a recently retired doctor, I had a particular historical interest in leprosy. The actual hospital and pictures were certainly interesting, but a major part of the visit is reading the handouts. Fascinating circumstances and disturbing social ramifications of this disease.",
          "Such a terrible disease. It was a very interesting tour, call for time with the language you speak, although they do have nice handouts. So sad to think of the years of suffering theses people ecperienced before they died. Even as they suffered they tried to contribute to",
          "Wanted to see this as I had some interest in Hansen's disease (leprosy). It was fascinating and only closed in 1946 when the last inmate died. The wooden buildings were atmospheric and you could view a patient's room as it had been in the 1800s. A detailed history in English was",
          "This museum has a weird feeling, I've never gotten the heebie-jeebies in a museum but here I did. There are free short walking tours and our English guide Hilda did a good job of giving us context of each piece of the museum. Definitely worth a go, it isn't open for very long",
          "Who knew that Bergen was a hot spot for leprosy? After visiting Dr. Hansen's house opposite St. Mary's Church (now reopened and also worth a visit) - a private home, but there is a plaque in English outside and a bust of Hansen in the garden area in front - be sure to visit this",
          "Find out when the tours are. We arrived 20 mins before it closed and paid half price to walk around and read the English guide. Would have been nice to have a tour and hear more about the history of the hospital. REally interesting.",
          "A visit to this place will remind one about the dreadfulness of this disease. As the posters/exhibits were in Norwegian, laminated English translations were given to me. One can sense the gloom and sickness that was in time past as one walks along the corridor and peaks into the",
          "We were a group of Doctors originally from India and it was great to visit the hospital where Hansen did much of his work. Very stark reminder of the stigma that Leprosy carries. Our only regret was that a lot of the exhibits did not have English explanations.",
          "The museum was certainly interesting, but you're out of there in about 15 min. They could have done a lot more to talk about the research, the underlying issues in history of medicine; alternatively, they could link it up with, say, Ebola research, or HIV research. I would not",
          "We had to persuade our friends to go to this museum but we were all glad we went. Housed in the buildings around the leprosy hospital its gave a fascinating insight into the history of the disease and how sufferers had to live and were treated. Some of the photos and drawings",
          "In the modern era one might expect gory tableaux or unemployed students sans limbs but this museum, small and unassuming as it is, very much sticks to the facts and the stories and in your mind that is perhaps more powerful. Its in a lovely setting but the tales you're told as",
          "Worth visiting when free with Bergen card. Not sure I would want to pay to visit though. You are provided with reading material, which is interesting, and seeing the inside of the building adds to the impact. Museum is in back streets and could easily be missed.",
          "The museum is small and unassuming, but the inside is well thought out and has lots of information. I particulary liked the mini-histories on the patients who lived there",
          "I was not expecting to be effected by this museum, and when I entered it looked simple, like an empty hall. But inside each room are boards with information (you get given an English translation on your way in). This information starts off as educational and very interesting.",
          "This is a basic museum with a lot of reading. You can go through the whole thing very quickly. It is a great old building, but not necessarily something I would go out of my way to see. It is included free in the Bergen Card, so that makes it worthwhile.",
          "Very interesting and informative museum. Well worth a visit. Check the dates and times of opening as not open all year.",
          "Certainly worth visiting when in Bergen as it gives a glimpse not only on the history of leprosy but on how life was in Bergen at the time when the hospital was open. The guided tour (tours are free with entrance and given every hour) is recommended; the museum guides are very",
          "It was poring with rain and so we used our Bergen card to visit all the museums. We were really glad that we visited this place. It does not take long but is very interesting. The buildings are lovely from the outside and on the inside. It is a sad place but world-famous",
          "My wife and I visited this museum thanks to our curiosities about medicine and medical history. This is a great little museum that explored the history of leprosy in Norway and how it was diagnosed and treated in the country. The entire museum is in Norwegian, but they provide",
          "Learned so much with excellent English speaking guide. We were offered printed sheets but she was so much better! No charge for \"live guide.\"",
          "This is a small museum, but significant in it's authenticity. You understand what it would have been like to live isolated ( and so close) to the outside world. The church is wonderful - note the pews with pee-holes so the afflicted could watch the sermon without being seen. I",
          "the father of leprosy was here. its interesting to see how far we have come but also surprising to see how much unethical things there were in medicine. Hansen and his coleague did great things but also horrible things. the museum still \"smells\" the old time. great place to",
          "A small and hidden museum, yet a very interesting attraction. Here you can see the old enfermary and rooms of the old hospital, as well equipments of Dr. Hansen himself, the great mind responsible for the leprae's bacilum discovery. Do not miss!",
          "While a student with a public health major, this was a must see on a tour of Norway. I coerced my traveling companions to accompany me to this off-the-beaten track attraction. It is a somber place but historically interesting.",
          "We had seen this as an attraction a few months before our trip. Where else do you get to see a leopracy museum? We were so excited to visit as it was very different than any other museum we had been too. We made the 10 minute walk from the center of town and found it was",
          "I was curious, what special can be in place like this. I went there in the evening, and it was a good choice. This place has amazing atmosphere, when it's dark outside. You can fell almost breathe of the history there, and you can be also a little bit scared, when you thought",
          "The place is and old leprosy hospital. It was interesting and thought provoking reading the information posted on each room. The atmosphere was sad and gloomy. You can help but feeling sad for the people that confined there.",
          "A really interesting look at how people with leprosy lived and was treated in the past. Though-provoking and sad.",
          "The museum is the old leprosy hospital. It is very emotional to see the tiny rooms where two people who had leprosy lived out their lives. Reading the information posted in each hospital room helps the visitor to learn about leprosy and how beliefs about the disease changed. You",
          "This is a gem, and gives a good impression of how frugal and simple life in Norway was like for its less-advantaged citizens before it 'got rich' on oil. However it was very humane - sad but dignified.",
          "We didn't have a lot of time to spend here and when we arrived the tour which goes on the hour was nearly finished. So we went round by ourselves and heard a little bit of the tour along the way. We felt we didn't really get the most out of the place not having gone on the",
          "Such sad stories. Small hospital turned into a museum. Informational stories of former patients are displayed in each room. All in Norweigan but handouts in multiple languages are available. Very interesting items on display especially if you are interested in disease and",

          "I can't improve on Expl0rer007's review, just want to mention that if you are visiting the Domkirken on Kong Oscars Gate, Korskirken and the Old Town, then the Museum is just down the road and well worth a visit. It rains a lot in Bergen so this makes a nice visit on a rainy",
          "I must confess that, prior to my visit here, I did not realise just how appalling an affliction leprosy is. Sure, I was familiar with the passages in the Bible concerning Christ's healing of the lepers, but it is not really until you come face-to-face with the enormity and the",
          "If your taste runs to the history of medicine / disease you will find this fascinating. The Norwegians were pioneer in this field and this tiny hospital / clinic has been well preserved / restored to tell the story. Even my children found it interesting to see how medecine has",
          "We visited this museum, which is tucked away near the station, a couple of days ago, following the suggestion in our Rough Guide. Sunday in Bergen is always very quiet, away from the harbour, and this corner of the town was almost deserted. The museum is set in the old",
          "This museum tells you a lot about leprosy in Norway and how it was managed. I thought it was a tropical disease but I was wrong. The museum explains the history of theories about it and tells you what the modern view is. The museum used to be the place where lepers were kept",
          "We luckily entered just as the tour in English was starting. Highly informative and well done, although the tour guide could probably cut the narration down by 20% without losing anything. We learned that 3% of Norwegians had Leprosy at one point, and that it is bacterial in",
          "This museum traces the history of the treatment of leprosy - before and after the discovery that it is transmitted by a bacteria. All signage is in Norwegian - they give you a laminated guide with (most) translated into English - other languages available as well. A sad place,",
          "Interesting visit. We were lucky and managed to time our visit for when they had a guided tour. This made it much more interesting then if we had just read the English information on our own.",
          "No one questions, nor should question, the need to visit a concentration camp museum, or national monuments dedicated to the many lives given in honorable causes, Normandy Beaches, cemetery at Srebrenica, Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, ... Paying homage to such places is important",
          "A very interesting but sad place - dark and dingy. Most of the museum had an accompanying English transcript so it was easy to gain the knowledge into the disease, it's research and change of the cause. Specially good for those with an interest in the medical field. Beware of",
          "We work in the health field, so for us this was especially interesting, but anyone would be moved by seeing this old leprosy hospital now turned into a museum and reading the history and stories of patients - until this visit I had not idea that leprosy had been a big problem in",
          "I felt like a voyeur peeking into these small and barren rooms where folks ill sith leprosy were treated. I found the atmosphere suffocating and had to escape outside. The museum is well done, don't get me wrong, I just find the subject hard to deal with.",
          "...and the lives it forced its victims to live. The museum is interesting from a purely scientific POV, but all tells the human story of the disease quite well. Worth a stop, but not for the squeamish.",
          "Sad but very informative. It showed the conditions provided and told of the attitudes towards these unfortunate souls. It certainly made me appreciate my life",
          "It might seem odd to enjoy a museum about leprosy, but I did. It's an interesting and heart-breaking piece of our collective human history, and especially Bergen's. People with leprosy were castigated in all societies, and this former hospital in Bergen sheds light on what",
          "Who knew that Norway was once the leprosy centre of the world? This museum (free entry with the Bergen card) gave a fascinating insight to the lives of those living with this terrible disease through the ages and to the work of doctors based here who were instrumental in finding",
          "Nowadays the hospital looks charming with its small wooden houses, but all the information inside can give you quite another feeling. It was a terrible faith to get this illness.",
          "As museums go it is pretty rubbish at educating you about anything to do with the disease, the culture of it or the hospital itself. Itself, however, is its main and best exhibit as the museum is the old hospital. As other reviewers may have noted, there is a strangeness to the",
          "Ask for an English guide to read as you follow the displays through the museum. Excellent experience: 500 years of history about the care/treatment (or lack of) of leprosy in Norway and specifically the hospital in Bergen. I was grossed out by some of the pictures, wax masks,",
          "We,ve read a lot about leprosy, so wanted to see this museum. Probably not many people know or would like to visit this museum, but its very informative. We had a good chat with the curators and learned even more on the subject. They have info on many languages and it is located",
          "It is consistently a challenge to find museums that both parents and our three teen/pre-teen kids appreciate. We typically enjoy hip interactive science museums and aquariums; we also have a slight preference for art and cultural museums. Surprisingly, the Leprosy Museum met",
          "Beautiful church from 1702 and 1700-century hospital buildings with herb gardens. The exhibits and the history of leprosy is horrifying, and we have so much to thank the doctors who discovered the true facts, so that the disease is now gone. The stories of patients whose",
          "As others have said here, the strength of this museum is in the tour at the top of each hour. The written materials and actual exhibits are sparse.",
          "I'd say it's mostly for medical people, 'cos the views of wax faces touched with the leprosy can be frightening and disgusting (I judge by my non-medical friends' reaction). Personally I was deeply interested. Actually, the causative agent for leprosy was discovered by Hansen",
          "Very interesting, and free with a Bergen card which was nice. Lovely little place that's worth a visit",
          "A well presented museum but such a depressing subject. Worth going if you can get a half price card from the Bryggen museum.",
          "The guides are exellent, even though there's some unanswered questions in the research. A really well-kept place. Worth a visit!",
          "Interesting in a historical point of view but nothing to really see. Just give it a try, at least for the historical informations.",
          "This small museum was really interesting. The lives of the people who were forced to stay at the hospital were brought alive by the stories outlined in the original rooms. There was an excellent translation booklet available free. The building has a unique position in the",
          "This hospital/museum was a short walk from our hotel. We opted for a private tour at 60 NOK each (approx. $10pp) and we were not disappointed. Martha gave us an informative and interesting tour throughout the premises. After explaining about the history of the site and the",
          "If you short of time in Bergen, there are other things to see first. If you have a lot of time, it is interesting as a lower priority site. Open from 11-3. You will learn more about leprosy AND learn about what a vintage 1890 hospital is like.",

          "This museum centres around the building itself. There are not many actual artefacts, but each small room tells a story. I visited on my own and came away feeling great sadness for the people who had seen out their days here. However, history is a valuable lesson and I would",
          "This got my attention as I'd never been to a museum like it before. It was well done & interesting. just a short walk from center of Bergen. Glad I visited it.",
          "It was a rainy day, so I decided to make it a museum day. Since the Leprosy Museum was right behind my hostel, I decided to go there and take a look around. It is housed in the old hospital which gave me a good feeling of how the patients lived during that time. The museum",
          "who could have imaigned that a clean neat place with splendid views aurrounded by pristine waters had a major leprosy hospital.Its an easy hour and convenient",
          "This is a very interesting museum, especially for any healthcare students or practitioners - particularly those interested in infectious disease, dermatology,  or the history of medicine. Western Norway was a focus of leprosy in Europe long after more southern countries had",
          "Quite small, but gives a feeling of how terrible life was for these poor people...Does not take to much time, and is located very central",
          "The museum is based in the hospital where leprosy patients were treated up until 1946. The wards have been restored to 19th century conditions when scientists were beginning to get a clue about the disease's cause. Very interesting",
          "This museum is housed in an atmospheric building which gives you a real insight into what must have been a very claustrophobic environment for its inmates - reminiscent of a prison. Its busiest period was the nineteenth century, but a few patients were still there as late as",
          "This was a short walk out of the more busy areas of Bergen, but it was very interesting to see the old leprosy hospital and learn more about the disease and how its sufferers used to be treated.",
          "The place is small and in 45 minutes max you should be able tyo see everything. The guides are good and it's free if you have the Bergen Pass.",
          "as it says on one of the boards in the museum, who'd have thought that clean-living, wholesome Norway would be a hotspot for leprosy? This is definitely education rather than entertainment, but it does set you thinking about a disease which, though largely conquered in the",
          "I had no idea that Norway was the Leprosy capital of Europe until I visited this Museum. It does not take much time out of your day but will leave you much better informed about the disease and the stigma it carries.",
          "This is a spartan museum providing a lot of insight about a stigmatizing, horrifying, disfiguring and often fatal disease. What may be lacking in terms of things to see is made up for in terms of information. Behind to sadness and terror of the disease, the museum tells the",
          "This ancient hospital was the primary care facility for leprosy patients in Norway, going back several centuries. The facility operated until the 1950s whe drug therapy made such a facility unneccesary. The physical facilities have been restored to their appearance when the",

          "Interested in history, you shall go there. Easy impressed by pictures , dont go there.",
          "This hospital was founded in the medieval ages, but the current buildings are about 300 years old. You can still see what a life the patients led here.. and this is where the Bergen doctor Armauer Hansen found the Lepra bacillus and made it possible to cure people from Leprosy.",

        "wiki": "St Mary's Church (Norwegian: Mariakyrkja, Mariakirken) is a parish church in Bergen municipality in Vestland county, Norway. It is located in the Bryggen area in the central part of the city of Bergen. The church is part of Bergen Cathedral parish in the Bergen domprosti (arch-deanery) in the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin.The construction of the church is believed to have started in the 1130s or 1140s and completed around 1180, making this church the oldest remaining building in the whole city of Bergen. There have been a few fires that burned the church, as well as several renovations and reconstructions, most recently in 2013.\n\n\n== History ==\nSt. Mary's Church is the only remaining of the twelve churches and three monasteries that were built in Bergen between its beginnings during the reign of Olav Kyrre (1066\u20131093, traditionally 1070) and the end of the twelfth century. Excavations have revealed the remains of an earlier stone church on the site, but it was probably never completed. Commissioned jointly by the king and the citizens and merchants of Bergen, the construction of St. Mary's Church began in the 1130s or 1140s. The exact year of completion is unknown, but the church is mentioned in Sverris saga as where the rebels of the Birkebein Party sought refuge when attacked by a peasant army in 1183. St. Mary's Church is likely to have been built by craftsmen from Scania, then part of Denmark. The church's style is  reminiscent of that of Lund Cathedral in Scania.St. Mary's Church was significantly damaged in the town fire of 1198, caused by an attack on the city by the Bagli Party, enemies of the Birkebein Party. The rebuilding resulted in several architectural changes. Bergen burned again in 1248, in a fire which caused an even greater degree of destruction to the church than the earlier fire. As part of the reconstruction after this fire, the towers were heightened and the chancel lengthened. The church was damaged in several later town fires, but never again destroyed to the same degree as in the fire of 1248.\nHistory\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nAlthough having been built as a parish church for the Norwegian population of Bergen, St. Mary's Church was taken over by the city's large German population in 1408 after which it was popularly called \"the German church\" (Tyskekirken). The merchants of the Hanseatic League were centered on this part of the town. By belonging to the wealthy Germans, St. Mary's is richly adorned and escaped the fate of being turned into a ruin, unlike several of the other churches in the city. Not until 1874, long after the German domination in the city had vanished, did it again become an ordinary parish church, even though sermons were held in German until after the First World War.From 1863 until 1876, the architect Christian Christie (who would later supervise the restorations of Bergen Cathedral and the Haakon's Hall) oversaw a major restoration of the church. The church was again closed from January 2010 until 2015 for another major restoration work. Since then the church was made available to the Bergen Anglican Church, offering English language services for residents and tourists.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nSt Mary's Church is a two-towered, three-naved, mainly Romanesque-style church. The eastern part of the choir shows some Gothic influence reminiscent of the Haakon's Hall, likely caused by the reconstruction after the 1248 fire. The church is constructed mainly in soapstone, the oldest parts being built of the highest quality soapstone. Shale is used sporadically. At least three different types of soapstone is used, and it is likely that the stone comes from several different quarries in the region.\n\n\n== Media gallery ==\nExterior\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nInterior\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of churches in Bj\u00f8rgvin\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMariakirken - St Mary's Church",

          "Located just behind the Bryggen, this place is made of stone. The church is still being used and worth a drop by. Watch out for the statue outside that commemerates the resident group equivalent to the boy scouts.",
          "We visited at the wrong time and on the wrong days so only got to see the outside, but it is still a very pretty church. I would love to have seen inside.",
          "This beautifully restored 13th century church is a gem! I was finally able to get in on my fourth trip to Bergen. Be aware it is only open 12-5 on Tuesdays and Fridays. And it is often closed for weddings and other events. But it was well worth going back for and waiting to get",
          "This church has a great history and docents to tell you about it. It is absolutely beautiful inside with magnificent Norwegian craftsmanship exhibited in every aspect of the construction. It is spectacular but not daudie.",
          "Still provides Lutheran worship services, and museum. There is an admission fee, to help maintain this beautiful stone building. Curator was very helpful, in giving us some order of services and information on the history.",
          "We were highly disappointed when we entered St. Mary\u2019s and saw the sign, \u201cNo photography.\u201d We have taken inside pictures in such famous churches as St. Peters, Milan, St. Paul\u2019s, Haarlam, Uppsala Cathedral, Roskilde and both Notre Dames in Paris and Montreal to name a few",
          "just one of the places we visited on a tour of Bergen, amazing, beautiful place lots of quaint shops, house, bars and restaurants",
          "This church was built almost 1000 years ago, so it is the oldest standing building in Bergen. Over the centuries, it has been damaged by fires and wars, but each time, it has been reconstructed, remodeled and repaired. The most recent remodeling was completed in 2013. The stone",
          "St. Mary's Church looks very special. It is difficult to say if the overall feel is related to the church's history that goes bach to the XII century. The church looks very impressive and has a bit unusual small cemetery next to it. Please note that there is a fee to visit",
          "Interesting old church near the Hanseatic wharf. Impress altar screen and very ornate pulpit. One of the oldest buildings in Bergman. Unusual for the twin towers.",
          "Just a short walk from the harbor, up a small hill and past the Bryggen Museum, stands this oldest building in Bergen. Originally built in the early 1100s over the remains of a prior church, it has endured several fires and reconstructions. Made from several kinds of soapstone",
          "Bergen\u2019s oldest structure dates from the 12th c. You are struck by its solid stone columns. It has little decor, reflecting a medieval church. The triptych is beautiful, in leaf gold. Stay in the church long enough and you will feel the coolness due to the stone. The pulpit is",
          "You will need to pay to go inside. A small cemetery along side the church. The church dates to the 12th century but has burnt down several times. The latest renovation was completed in 2013. It is pretty inside.",
          "Expensive. Only saw it because we had the Bergen Card, so it was free. Otherwise it costs 100Nkr! Quite a good history about the church, which was in german hands until the late 1800\u2019s. No cameras allowed!",
          "Just at the end of Bryggen, was small, a fee to get in, about 75NOK. A small cemetary in the grounds too.",
          "Historically this church is so important and it\u2019s good to get in. However having taken money for entrance you need to make some compromises. The ban on photography is unreasonable in the circumstances. Ban flash. Ban selfies. But if you want the entrance fees you have turned",
          "Staff not welcoming at all. We were rushed round. We were on an organised trip so entrance fee paid but not worth the \u00a37 fee.",
          "It was next to our hotel so we paid a quick visit. Happily it is free with the Bergen card or else you pay 75 NOK for admittance. I don't like that in an active church. It's not a museum, it's a church and should be free, but that is my opinion. Anyway go to see the triptych",
          "This richly adorned church is truly spectacular. We were fortunate to catch an a cappella concert - eight voices of superb quality, which sounded even more superb in the excellent acoustics of the ancient church. Highly recommend a visit to the church - but check online for",
          "The interior of the church is beautiful, with many statues and paintings. The painting of the beheading of John the Baptist is quite gory. The angels carved on the pulpit were amazing. The church recently underwent a restoration, so they do charge an admission fee. Sadly, you",
          "Very impressive outside and in, but I must confess to an aversion to paying to enter a church. We would be happy to contribute of our own volition.",
          "Despite the beautiful altar, pulpit and medieval art works the NK75 entrance fee is way over the top and the whole experience ruined by the photo police aggressively shouting at people to stop taking photos.",
          "This ancient church is a real gem. It hosts an International Anglican congregational for English language services.",
          "We felt really at home and welcome at your Sunday service. Pity that tourists are allowed in around service time tho. Thank you \ud83d\ude42",
          "I admit that I have visited too many churches during my travels and am a little jaded. But I am glad I wandered into St. Mary's in Bergen. It is not grand or awe-inspiring. But it is very interesting. In the first place, the pulpit is quite interesting and unique in Norway. It",
          "Seemed very odd that they charged a fee to look inside a church and even if you did pay the entrance fee, photos were not allowed. We opted not to go in and just walked around the lovely outside,",
          "An interesting place to visit, may be an hour will do it. Very near Bryggen. Renovations very evident, the pulpit is one of the most decorative that I have ever come across. Free entry with the Bergen Card.",
          "Known once as the German church up until WW2 as it was frequented by the Hanseatic league, living for a period of 400 years in the Hanseatic wharf, known as Bryggen.",
          "Generally, I like old churches - the architecture, the art, the stained glass. This one did not disappoint. The stonework is remarkable in its beauty, as is the woodwork and artwork on the interior (the stations of the cross are particularly notable). You need not spend a long",
          "Our tour was able to walk around the exterior of the church and also viewed some artifacts in another building. The interior itself was closed. Nevertheless this was an interesting sight.",
          "We could only admire the outside of this old church as it was closed due to water damage during our visit. It was built between 1130-1170 and recently restored. There are guided tours in Norwegian at 3 pm and English at 3:30 pm Monday to Friday, tickets cost approx NOK 75.",
          "I have been to dozens of,old stones churches in Norway. If you are visiting Bergen, this is a good example of a historic old church that is still in use. Recently cleaned the outside, but the inside is un touched. Definitely worth a stop by anyone visiting Bergen.",
          "This small church is not open every day. However, on one of my days in Bergen, it was open. It reflected Norwegian Architecture dating back to the 12th century. From what I learned, it may be the oldest building in Bergen. It is definitely worth the visit.",
          "As our tourist guide said this is the oldest stone church in the city. You have to pay entrance fee 50NOK. Sometimes concerts are held there",
          "There is an admission charge for visiting this church, but it is well worth it. There are incredible centuries-old paintings and carving on view. Photography is forbidden.",
          "This Church is the oldest building in Bergen and has been lovingly restored. It is a beautiful example of romanesque architecture. My only complaint is the very limited schedule of open times in the off-season, but it was worth the visit.",
          "Too bad it was closed when we tried to visit. We read it was renovated but it will have to be our next trip to bergen to try to see it. No explanation why it was closed, probably as we entered October already, and October in Brgen means tourist season is over.",
          "A beautiful and historic church in a pretty neighbourhood. Easy to visit as it is near the Bryggen and other interesting sites.",
          "This is a very old church right in the heart of Bergen. I would suggest viewing it from the outside. The inside is nothing specatular and it costs 50 NOKK to get in and no photos allowed",
          "We came here last year but there was a wedding going on so we could not see inside. This year, no wedding! The Mariankirke is a 12th century church and has a 15th century carved altarpiece and a pulpit with statues of the virtues. We were much taken by 1675 painting comparing",
          "The church was very beautiful. We loved spending a little time here in prayer. They have some small items for sale and a pamphlet with the history of the church in it. The staff was very kind and informative as well.",
          "Outside is lovely but it was not open even though all information said it would be. Frustrating for all",
          "Little to see, no information provided, and they charge admission. Save your time and trouble, and skip the inside of this church. Happily, our Bryggen Museum walking tour guide gave us a brief history of the church from the outside; that was perfect!",
          "This old church is a nice, peaceful place in the town. Shows the importance that the city had in history. In these days where you have almost not been at a place without at selfie taken, it is a bit peculiar, that it is forbidden to take a photos. A ban on using flash should to",
          "It's tucked away behind a large museum and it's a real treasure. Spend a few minutes enjoying the amazing art in a quiet setting.",
          "We paid $75 NOK per person for a 25 minute guided tour in English. Well worth the price. We learned so much about the church's history, including the art and wood carvings. The alter piece is amazing. There is so much detail we would have missed without a guide explaining it",
          "Unless you love churches and want to help support the upkeep, it\u2019s not worth the entrance fee. Interior pictures on the internet have the lights on so you can really see the beauty of the restoration. They were not on during our visit so it was very dark. Understandably as a",
          "We enjoyed walking the grounds and trying to read the ancient gravestones even thought the church building was locked and the rain was falling (yuck). I was hoping to find a list of the graves in my quest to find Norwegian ancestors.",
          "Like most days in Bergen it started to rain as we approached the church which I guess is very normal for a day in Bergen. The architecture is very old church like and has a cemetery on one side. There is a cost to enter and they do not allow picture taking inside. It's quaint,",
          "Built in 1100, this church was used exclusively by the German merchants of the Hansa. Indeed inside the church there are many paintings depicting prominent and rich merchants. The pulpit itself was donated by Lubeck merchants and is a real masterpiece with 12 small sculptures",
          "We walked especially to visit St Mary\u2019s church as a typical 12th century church with some grave stones in the front. It costs 50NOK to go in and they do not allow photographs to be taken inside.",
          "So I love church yards and look forward to seeing other people's tombstones only these were not in English and some were less than a hundred years old. The church itself is still in use and a gentleman eating his lunch told me he was baptized in it 62 years ago. The Norwegians",
          "Amazing! This old church, that has a rather simple architecture keeps a baroque secret with its pulpit. Whereas the church is of an early gothic architecture the pulpit is of an enigmatic baroqueness. Who made it? Why are the texts in German, and why are there Asian influences",
          "I didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but arriving at the church on a Sunday afternoon was perfect. A man was taking down the \u201cno photo\u201d sign and closing the church for the day, but gave us a few minutes to take some photos with no charge. Dating from the early 12th century, it is",
          "Our tour guide started the walking tour of Bergen here. We did not go inside because there was a charge. It's very close to town as are most things.",
          "Worth the 40 kroner to view this old chuch in Bergen with its detailed pulpit and naive area, and interesting paintings. Regards Gary Saunders",
          "Not a bad place to visit is you have time. Ordinary Lutheran church with no special features or distinitive attraction.",
          "It costs about about $12 to get in to this church and no photos are allowed. Presumably money goes to it's upkeep and it is very interesting inside.",
          "Oldest church in Bergen,only a couple blocks from the wharf and easy to find. Has guide leaflets in English which was good. We wish they would have let us take some pictures, but they said no even without a flash. But, definitely worth a visit for history..",
          "Oldest building in Bergen made of stone which meant it survived the fires that destroyed the wharf close by. Charge to get inside and no photos allowed. However impressive because of history and boats from the ceiling. Also had a number of very old grave sites that always",
          "walked to this on a day walk through Bergen. Did not go inside, just walked around the outside. I enjoyed seeing the very old headstones.",
          "It never ceases to amaze me that Norway can have 1,000 year old buildings and the US can't seem to keep almost any buildings in repair for even 300 years. Churches like this are awe-inspiring and educational. One criticism is that they don't allow photos. Other historic",
          "My wife and I walked over from our cruise ship dock and easily found the church. It has gone thru a recent renovation and given its age is in great shape. There is a fee to get in and no discount for seniors but the interior is interesting and beautiful. We usually try to visit",
          "Oldest buidling in Bergen, right in centre of town, so easy to find. Has guide leaflets in English which was good. Sadly you couldn't take photos at all (not even without flash) which was disappointing. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "We toured the grounds and enjoyed our visit to this wonderful old Lutheran Church. We did not pay the fee to enter, as we were heading to tour other parts of the city. However, as a visiting Lutheran, it was a great opportunity for some nice photos.",
          "This is a Lutheran Church although it host's the Anglican Church as well made of stone in round the 12th century it could not be buried down like a lot of rest of Bergan homes then made of wood. The church has an enter charge & does no allow photos it has a lovely carved pulpit",
          "This church is the oldest building in town having survived a fire because it is stone. It\u2019s a nice old church and has an old grave yard outside of it. It\u2019s a short walk from the wharf and is very nice to see. There are guided tours.",
          "Mariakirken (St.Mary's church) is the oldest building in Bergen and one of the oldest in Norway. It was built in the Romanesque style in the mid-12th century. The exterior is fairly simple and undoubtedly also constructed to be defensible as it was one of very few stone",
          "Entry 50/40Kr Open Mon - Fri 9 - 4. No photos. Anglican services also held there (11 a.m Sundays.) Not a lot to see except the amazing golden reredos behind the altar and the beautifully carved pulpit, but it's in its age that is the interest, being the oldest building in Bergen",
          "I went on a guided tour around Bergen it was well worth it don't know the cost as it was in the package, Emma our guide was very good and knowledgeable",
          "This is the oldest extant building in Bergen and one of the oldest Christian churches in Norway. The altarpiece is especially noteworthy, as is the elaborately carved pulpit. Although Lutheran, the church also hosts Anglican services on Sundays.",
          "This gorgeous, ancient church is situated between Bryggen and the fortress, right opposite the Hanseatic Assembly Halls. This church was originally founded by the Hanseatic merchants and has recently been renovated. There is an old cemetery around the perimeter of the church.",
          "interesting and somewhat dominant building in the old city of Bergen. Recently renovated I think and now conducting church services. NOT HUGELY DECORATED INTERNALLY BUT STILL WORTH A VISIT",
          "This church has been renovated in the last years, and it's finally opened. It is the original German church of the Hanseatic representants in Bergen, and judging from the inner of the church you can tell. For a Norwegian church to be, it is very nicely decorated, with lot of",
          "Very interesting old building. Practically has no windows - it is like from middle ages drawings. Outside it has timetable of church services.",
          "Mariakirken (St Mary's Church) is the oldest building in Bergen. The construction of the church is believed to have started in the 1130s or 1140s and completed around 1180. It is not allowed to take pictures inside.",
          "We visited St. Mary's for their Sunday Anglican service and to see the inside of the church. This is the oldest building that remains in Bergen, and it has recently restored. It is absolutely beautiful inside, with it's stone structure, carved wooden altar and unusual pulpit",
          "This is a very historic church with some very interesting wood paintings. It has an amazing pulpit, and despite it sage, it is in good order. No photography is allowed, but when I was there, a professional photographer was commandeering the altar area, up on a high ladder",
          "We went in here for a quick visit, as it is only open at certain times of the day for short periods. It is free to enter and you can make a donation if you choose. It is a beautiful church and was worth a quick visit. The interior is serene and peaceful.",
          "This is another beautiful stone church where pictures are not allowed. The first thing that draws your attention is the ornate pulpit and chapels. Behind the pulpit is a magnificent and imposing alter of gold, blue and red with an awe inspiring gold icon.The ceiling is",
          "A really old church of the early christianity in Norway. Long time covered in plastic because of restaurations it is finally possible to visit it again since a time now. The pictures of german merchants on some of the walls, reflects the history of Bergen and shows how much",
          "It\u2019s a sin Beautiful churches and they close by 2 pm. Touring is shut out. Why can\u2019t a Church remain open?",
          "St. Mary's Church is the oldest existing building in Bergen, their brochure told us. The church does have traces of medieval frescoes that are difficult to see, but there. Many of the paintings that have been restored over the years are dedicated to the memory of past citizens.",
          "Visited this place almost by accident whilst waiting for some jewelry to be made. What a place Hanseautic museum also close. Both well worth a visit",
          "It's a nice old church, twin towers, and all the bells and whistles that go with these things. The setting is attractive and is in close proximity to other tourist attractions. We did not go inside, the fee was a bit too costly for us.",
          "We were put off by the fact that there is an entry charge, but we returned for a concert later in the evening and saw it for free. Wonderful old building, magnificent side portal.",
          "The interior of this church has some unusual features, a ceramic pulpit and intercepting artifacts, it is worth the charge to go inside.",

          "As we found a lot in Norway, things close early. You would think that an area HEAVILY dependent on tourist trade (I mean there are always two or three big cruise ships in port) that they would stay open to like 6:00 or 7:00, when the sun is up until 10:00 pm. If you think that",

          "Marvelous example of a midieval architecture and arguably the oldest structure still in use in Bergen. Fortunately, it's 5-year restoration ended in n2015, so it is in great shape. The pulpit alone is worth examining, but just the structure and the paintings on the side walls",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "H\u00e5kons Hall, sometimes anglicized as H\u00e5kon Hall and Haakons Hall, is an arena located at Stampesletta in Lillehammer, Norway. With a spectator capacity of 11,500 people, it is the largest handball and ice hockey venue in the country. H\u00e5kons Hall is regularly used for handball and ice hockey tournaments, concerts, exhibitions, conferences and banquets. The venue is owned by Lillehammer Municipality via the subsidiary Lillehammer Olympiapark, which owns all the Olympic venues in Lillehammer. The Norwegian Olympic Museum is located in the arena, which is located next to the smaller Eidsiva Arena.\nThe hall opened on 1 February 1993 having cost 238 million Norwegian krone (NOK). It was built to host the ice hockey tournament at the 1994 Winter Olympics, and has since hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 1994 Winter Paralympics, the 1999 IIHF World Championship in ice hockey, the World Women's Handball Championship in 1993 and 1999, the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2004, the 2008 European Men's Handball Championship and the 2010 European Women's Handball Championship. Lillehammer IK has occasionally played ice hockey matches at the arena.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nLillehammer received its first indoor ice rink in 1988, with the opening of Kristins Hall. That same year, the town was awarded the 1994 Winter Olympics, which required the construction of a larger venue for the Olympic ice hockey matches. The naming of the arena was decided by the Lillehammer Municipal Council in October 1988, as part of a broader branding policy, based on the history of the Birkebeiner. H\u00e5kons Hall is named for Haakon Haakonarson, a medieval king of Norway who as a child was transported across by mountains by skiers. Kristin and H\u00e5kon became the mascots for the Olympics, and the twin arenas at Stampesletta were named accordingly. Protests were made in Bergen, as local patriots felt it was not suitable that a sports venue had such a similar name to H\u00e5konshallen, a medieval hall in Bergen.\n\nIn June 1989, the municipal council voted to locate most of the Lillehammer venues in the Stampesletta area, and to place H\u00e5kons Hall adjacent to Kristins Hall. This was controversial and many councilors voted for the original decentralized plan, with the venues spread out through the municipality. The application for the Olympics called for building up to five ice venues in Lillehammer. For post-Olympic use, Kristins Hall was designated as the main ice rink for Lillehammer, while it was planned that H\u00e5kons Hall would be used for larger events. On 8 December 1989, the International Olympic Committee rejected two demands from the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) for the ability to host a minimum of 12,000 spectators in the larger ice hockey venue and for a women's ice hockey tournament.The decision about the location of the ice hockey venues was made on 10 October 1990. H\u00e5kons Hall would be the main venue, supplemented by Gj\u00f8vik Olympic Cavern Hall in Gj\u00f8vik. The proposal to have figure skating at H\u00e5kons Hall was rejected, and instead it was to be held at Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre in Hamar. In 1990, the Norwegian Cycling Federation recommended H\u00e5kons Hall as one of several possible places to build a velodrome for the Union Cycliste Internationale's  1993 UCI Track Cycling World Championships. The same year, H\u00e5kons Hall was proposed to supplement Oslo Spektrum as a venue for a proposed pan-European professional ice hockey league. Construction was approved by the Parliament of Norway in April 1990, including funding. Original design plans called for a simple hangar-like design, and original cost estimates were for NOK 191 million. However, in March 1991, the municipal council decided to increase spending on the venue to make it more aesthetic. The re-design also included telescopic stands and better acoustics, to allow for more flexible use after the Olympics.The main contractor was Veidekke and construction cost NOK 238 million. Grants were given from the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate and SINTEF for energy economization. The work on the hall was concluded on 1 February 1993. It was the 27th indoor ice hockey rink in Norway.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\nThe structure is dug out of the ground so it does not appear monumental in size from the outside. The roof consists of four sections held up by double trussed beams in glued laminated timber, with lengths up to 85.4 meters (280 ft). The hall is 127 meters (417 ft) long and has a total surface area of 23,000 square meters (250,000 sq ft). The main hall has a floor area of 3,500 square meters (38,000 sq ft), with an activity area of 76 by 44 meters (249 by 144 ft). The maximum ceiling height is 40 meters (130 ft), and there is a direct drive-in entrance to the hall for exhibitions. The venue has a capacity for 11,500 seated spectators. The stands are flexible and telescopic, allowing for flexibility in hall use and seating capacity. The arena can be configured with a 330 square meters (3,600 sq ft) stage. The hall can be set up to serve 2,000 people at a banquet, or divided up to serve smaller groups. The venue also features a cafeteria which can seat 200 people. For trade fairs, the venue offers 3,500 square meters (38,000 sq ft), in addition to the VIP and lobby facilities. The same area can also be used for conferences, and the venue can be split up into section to create group rooms, theme rooms and banquet rooms.H\u00e5kons Hall Sports Centre is part of the complex which supplements the main hall with a recreational training facility. It can make use of the main hall for two handball or football courts, or six volleyball or badminton courts. In addition, there is a permanent health club, a climbing wall, an aerobic room, a golf center with two golf simulators and a putting green, and two badminton courts, all served by 13 changing rooms. The venue also features a 370 meters (1,210 ft) long running track. The cooling and heating systems for H\u00e5kons Hall and Eidsiva Arena are connected, allowing them to function as energy reserves for each other.\n\n\n== Events ==\n\nDuring the 1994 Winter Olympics, H\u00e5kons Hall hosted the ice hockey tournament along with Gj\u00f8vik Olympic Cavern Hall between 12 and 26 February. H\u00e5kons Hall hosted 21 games, including the final which saw Sweden beat Canada in a penalty shootout. In the 1994 Winter Paralympics, H\u00e5kons Hall was used for the opening and closing ceremonies.The first major international tournament in the hall was some matches of the 1993 World Women's Handball Championship. Lillehammer IK plays its home matches at Eidsiva Arena, but in 1995 the play-off match between it and neighbor town rivals Storhamar Dragons was played at H\u00e5kons Hall. The match saw more than 5,000 spectators, the record for Lillehammer IK. In 1995, the award ceremony for Spellemannsprisen, Norwegian music's highest award, was held at H\u00e5kons Hall.Norway hosted the 1999 IIHF Ice Hockey World Championship in Oslo, Lillehammer and Hamar. H\u00e5kons Hall featured Group D, consisting of Russia, Finland, Belarus and Kazakhstan, as well as the semi-finals, the bronze final and the final. Tickets were sold as twins, with two games being staged with a one-hour interlude on the same ticket. The same year, H\u00e5kons Hall was one of seven venues used for the 1999 World Women's Handball Championship. In addition to group stage and play-off matches, it was awarded the final. Oslo Spektrum was also considered to hold the final, but with only 8,500 seats and a higher rent, H\u00e5kons Hall was preferred.H\u00e5kons Hall hosted the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2004 on 20 November 2004, won by Mar\u00eda Isabel with \"Antes Muerta que Sencilla\". Norway was the host of the 2008 European Men's Handball Championship; the group stage games were played in four other Norwegian cities, while the play-off and final was played in H\u00e5kons Hall in January 2008. The final saw Denmark beat Croatia in front of 9,052 spectators. In 2010, Idrettsgallaen, a show to honor the past year's Norwegian sports and athletes achievements, was hosted at H\u00e5kons Hall. Norway and Denmark co-hosted the 2010 European Women's Handball Championship in December 2010, with the matches played in Norway being at H\u00e5kons Hall and Arena Larvik. Lillehammer featured Norway's group in the first and second group stages, while the knockout stage was played in Denmark.On 18 November 2017, a match between rivals Lillehammer IK and Storhamar Ishockey took place in H\u00e5kons Hall, this match was marketed as the \"Hockey Classic\" and was a huge success. The game was watched by a record setting 10,031 spectators in the Norwegian GET-ligaen and a new Hockey Classic is set to take place on 17 November 2018.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to H\u00e5kons hall at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial site",

          "It was fun to tour this old royal entertaining hall dating back to the thirteenth century. It is nicely restored and is still used for its original purpose, entertaining official guests.",
          "You see all you need to see of this from the outside. If you have a Bergen Card, by all means go inside. There is not much - a few walls and a heavily restored Great Hall which is very striking but completely fake.",
          "Haakon's Hall is nearly 800 year old. It is a great historical artefact. All current activities (renovation, etc.) may impact the overall impression, but not the history behind the hall.",
          "Visited and viewed the outside. Did not enter the building. A lot of restoration being carried out in the area.",
          "The hall was closed when we visited so we only saw it from the outside but the Haakon hall is a structure inside a fortress which is close to the port. There is a small cafe there that was open but it was expensive and there are some lovely views over the port/harbour. Worth a",
          "We didn't pay the entrance fee to see inside but from the outside this is an impressive building with a real sense of history. The setting is great, inside a walled park with a quadrangle of other more modern but still delightful buildings. Well worth finding but I suspect",
          "Haakon\u2019s Hall is a stone structure inside a fortress from medieval times (restored several times), but really, there\u2019s not much to see. It\u2019s a large, empty hall. It was once a royal residence and feasting hall, and is used today for ceremonies and concerts. The most",
          "I love seeing architecture of days gone by, but even $11 was too much for this \"museum\". There is nothing in it except chairs and tables from the 1980s. No history, no artifacts, just an empty hall. It's a beautiful hall, but not worth the time or money. Seeing the outside",
          "There wasn't too much to see here in my opinion. The hall was lovely and a lot bigger than I expected, but that was about it.",
          "A beautiful old hall that is perfectly suited for a performance. Great acoustics and a vintage setting for a concert.",
          "The impressive walls remain from the 13th century structure. The building was heavily damaged during WWII when a munitions ship exploded in the harbor. The building was restored in the 1950\u2019s with a new roof, floors and ceilings. It\u2019s a worthwhile visit and awe inspiring to",
          "Well worth the visit, the main hall is beautiful. Quite a few stairs to negotiate if you have mobility issues.",
          "The actual hall is magnificent and the ceiling particularly so. However, I did think the 1950 renovations were out of keeping with the medieval heritage. Staff were incredibly helpful and informative.",
          "This is one of Bergen's oldest buildings that dates back to the 13th century. Expereincing the history of any city makes my travel expereince more meaningful. This is worth the visit.",
          "A definite visit, if you are here for a day or a week. The guides were very helpful and the history is enlightening. Interesting to visit",
          "I had expected just a hall, but there's more to it than that, and the information provided helps you to understand what you are looking at.",
          "Bergen is Norway\u2019s second biggest city and at one time was its capital. There are several historical attractions here but Haakons Hall was my favourite because it has medieval and modern history.It was built in the 1100s as a reception hall for those who sailed into Bergen\u2019s",
          "The building is steeped in history, but due to renovations there isn't a great deal to see other than an ornate banqueting hall. Authentic and easy to find ... but rather pricey for what you get.",
          "I would suggest avoiding this because for the entry fees that you pay, you don't get to see much as most of the parts are closed for renovation.",
          "This ancient building sits right on the edge of the harbour keeping watch for centuries. It is authentic, aged and wonderful. It is easy to get to and surrounded by park like setting. Very much worth the time and effort.",
          "Although much of this is under construction, the tour of a 900ad castle and its ruins were interesting. Its expensive though, and no discount considering much of it is closed and the self-guided tour was somewhat confusing and disoriented. I'd perhaps see how far along things",
          "Such a fun self-guided tour through the labyrinth of different rooms and floors, and a great insight into many facets of Bergen history. Worth it.",
          "This area and building is interesting to visit and provides an awareness of the significance Bergen has played in the history of Scandinavia and the world.",
          "Nice grounds around this place, but not much to see. A lot more to do in Bergen besides this unless you have lots of time.",
          "It was devastated by a blast in 1944 if I am not mistaken, reconstructed now which is obvious, but you can easily imagine how huge it was (and still is) when it was built. Below it is also amazingly large area with lot of tables and chairs, presumably for some large events",
          "This is worth a short visit. The hall is named after its first builder King Hakon Hakonsson. My visit included a tour guide who gave us a short history of the hall including the changes it went through over the years.",
          "A lot of it is big rooms with chairs but the last room was worth it a huge banqueting room with large window",
          "This would be a pleasant venue for a special event, but there is very little to see, for which you will pay $10-$20, depending on your age or if you have already paid for another Bergen museum. Save your $$$.",
          "Make sure you do the tour. They will explain you the history of the hall and some stories around it.",
          "Same as the Rosenkrantz tower o.k. if you have extra time otherwise skip it.Not as many stairs or as steep as the tower.",
          "Fairly pricey to see one large hall where only sidewalls remain from a few centuries ago, so not medieval. Got to listen in to guide which made it more interesting.",
          "Visited the fortress and decided to take a tour through Haakon\u2019s Hall. Informative tour and knowledgeable guide who talked us through the history of the former capital\u2019s fortress and main hall which was used for banquets and other meetings. It is close by the fish market and",
          "Had to see this Hall, partly for the history of political meetings and partly for the romantic ideas of huge Renaissance banquets. But the pictures I thought left so much out actually were quite accurate and there isn't much left to see, but the building, nice building some",
          "Great hall, nicely preserved, loved the linen (?) wall hangings. Could imagine all the upper crust walking around the hall.",
          "I find it very odd that they charge everything in the fortress seperately, but where the Rozenkratz Tower was interesting and they made an effort to make it interesting, Haakon's Hall is literally just an empty hall, like an event space. Considering its one of the more",
          "Magnificant hall preserved and restored. Still in ude today for government affairs and special events. Wood and stone work very interesting.",
          "This old hall is very nice. It was heavily damaged in the Second World War but was rebuilt. It doesn\u2019t take a long time to look at and was very near my hotel. It\u2019s nice.",
          "The Hall is imposing and beautiful, but there is little else to see. It appears that the facility is mainly used for large banquets and perhaps weddings now. We had a Bergen Card, so this was still worth it for us, but probably would not be if purchasing separately.",
          "This area was damaged during WW2 when a ship exploded. H\u00e5kon\u2019s Hall was built between 1247 and 1261 by H\u00e5kon H\u00e5konsson. It was the largest and most imposing building in the area during the 13th-century. It is impressive and only takes 15 minutes to visit. But, if you love",
          "The special even was the night before our visit and in an adjoining building (We stayed in a hotel adjacent to Bergenhus and saw part of it). We didn't care about the adjacent building. The exterior of the Hall looked very impressive, but we could see impressive exteriors",
          "H\u00e5kon\u2019s Hall was built between 1247 and 1261 by H\u00e5kon H\u00e5konsson. It was the largest and most imposing building of the royal residency in the 13th-century when Bergen was the political centre of Norway. I have wanted to see it, but it was closed. They had some important guests",
          "The explosion of a ship in the nearby harbor during WW2 caused huge damage so what you see is mostly reconstruction but the air of an ancient hall is preserved. The guides are informative and speak English",
          "Enjoyed visiting Haakons Hall as the displays were very well done and provided in English. The grounds were immaculately kept and a nice place to wander and enjoy the view.",
          "This is the main draw when visiting the fortress complex. This hall is not always open, and when it\u2019s closed, the Rosenkratz Tower is open instead. Even if closed, like the day we visited, stop by to soak in the medieval majesty on display here.",
          "This beautifully restored ancient hall is well worth the entrance fee. It is tastefully refurbished and having been almost totally destroyed and incident in WW2 has come to life again. It is a very large area worthy exploring and steeped in history.",
          "This was a trip to see the old Hall built by King Hakon in the 1200s. Muchos it was destroyed by an explosion in the 1940s but it has had restoration work to turn it into a museum. Only really one large hall with a magnificent timber beamed roof to see. We had finished within",
          "A beautifully preserved building with interesting displays inside, including artifacts, furniture, and tapestries. Well worth a visit.",
          "This old crowning and festivity hall of the middle ages, has an amazing history with several reconstructions. Being a grainsilo aswell it was destroyed the last time during WW2 and is today a concerthall, museum and royal festivityhall again. If you like architecture or history,",
          "The hall is neat to see, you can just imagine royalty there. The basement is where you are directed first but there isn\u2019t much there \u2013 go straight to the hall. It\u2019s about a 10 minute visit but worthwhile. More worthwhile is the neighboring Rosencrantz Tower, and you\u2019ll get a",
          "Gothic in style, it was the king's home and governmental seat during the Middle Ages. For 3 centuries, it served that purpose and then, mid-1500's, was used for storage. In 1944, a German munition ship exploded in the harbor and the Hall was damaged; only the walls remained.",
          "Beautiful wood and stone structure. You can picture the meetings that took place there during the Middle Ages. Damaged during WWII but was beautifully restored.",
          "Inmpressive building with interesting history. Worth visiting as part of a visit to the complex of museums in this area.",
          "Nothing to see here. As others have advised, the lower levels have tables and chairs for functions and the upper level is just a bare hall with absolutely no decorations anywhere. No signage, just nothing to see. Look at the outside, view the info about the wartime explosion in",
          "The main attraction is the main hall which was majestic but largely empty. The lower levels were filled with... contemporary tables and chairs...? Visit this hall and the neighbouring tower together with the Bergen card. Otherwise, it isn't worth it to pay just for both places.",
          "You can see Haakon's Hall from the main road, but I really recommend you to walk passed the Rosenkrantz tower and take a closer look at this building. The side facing the main road is the most beautiful and I stood there for 10 minutes absorbing the beauty of this building.",
          "It's a nice experience if you're interested in history. There's no much to see, bit it's very atmospheric and can set you to imagining the past.",
          "It's good for a walk, the area is big, and if you get some piece of information about the structure you'll enjoy it. A nice view to the city as well. Not a breath taking visit, but worth it if you're staying in town.",
          "Very disappointed in this attraction. Again, unless you arrive at 10 or 2 there is no guided tour. And, like the Rosenkrantz tower, no audio guides or other information are available. 80 NOK stand-alone but included on the pricey Bergen Card. We were directed to start on the",
          "Haakon's Hall is an impressive structure on the waterfront in Bergen. However, the inside is a yawner, unfortunately. There is the one large meeting room that is worth seeing but the rest of the structure is like visiting a furniture store selling only one kind of chair and",
          "I took part in a reception hosted in the Hall for conference participants and must say the food was both traditional and innovative, well presented and served, and the setting outstanding.",
          "Very clean castle. Interesting history, great view of the harbour. Was the only one there, so had a nice stroll around unhindered.",
          "This building is part of the fortress up near the port and it's the site of where the Norwegian kings were crowned, we were told. Unfortunately it was closed when we were there. The exterior does look nice though.",
          "Admittedly, the buildings that make up Bergen's castle district aren't anywhere close to the impressive grandeur of the palaces in many other cities. Nevertheless, what they do possess is a collective history that is important to the current generation. To that effect,",
          "Worth seeing but not a must see in my opinion. Staff nice and polite and happy to answer questions and offer wee bits of information",
          "Historic site rebuilt after the war due to damage. Hosts concerts during the Festspillene-The Bergen Arts Festival.",
          "The size of this banqueting hall is impressive but it is mostly empty. Those with an interest in medieval history or architecture would find it more interesting. I will say that the gentleman at the information desk provided us with some background information that we found",
          "The fortress is worth visiting, and this is one of the interesting buildings to see. The history of this place is quite interesting, although there's not a lot to see. We enjoyed walking around the grounds and seeing these buildings up close. It was a real trip back in time.",
          "This place is not so big, so you can easily do it in 20-30 mins. Good introduction to the Norwegian medieval history (from the well-known Vikings). The introductory documentary that visitors can watch at the beginning of the tour was very helpful.",
          "This was the coronation/feasting hall of King Haakon built around the mid 1200's. It is an impressive building for the period in which it was constructed and has been lovingly restored after serious damage in WW2.",
          "Interesting history from when it was built in the 1200s until it sustained severe damage from a harbor explosion in the 1940s. That said, it's fairly overpriced even by Norwegian standards, being that there isn't a ton to see and the fact that the hall itself was filled with",
          "My group met here daily in this beautiful old structure, lots of history and lovely example of an old fort... Nice, park like grounds. Recommend taking a walk around.",
          "The Haakon's Hall is located inside the Bergenhus Fortress and was built between 1247 and 1261. It is spectacular to visit and even more so to hear the stories behind this huge hall. Unique place which is a mst see.",
          "A wonderful building constructed with stone and wood. With no pillars to support this massive hall is unique in more than one way. Coronation place of yesteryears.",
          "The Haakon's hall is one of the oldest buildings in Bergen and is well worth a visit if you are interested in learning about the history of Bergen and Norway in general.",
          "It's near Rosenkranz tower and must see. When you enter the hall, it's just wow. It's a spectacular, majestic room with other areas to be explored. A must see",
          "We got the Bergen pass and went in for free. It is a large empty hall but the history around it is interesting especially if you also visit the town museum nearby. There are still about 150 civilian people working around the fortress surrounded by a little park by the harbour.",
          "A very old tower which has been rebuilt and renovated. Quite steep stairs and passage ways around the tower between the various chambers \u2013 without any real \u2018signposting\u2019 to lead one through it all. Part of the Bergen castle and hall structures. Worth a visit if you are into",
          "I was most impressed by the great hall. I stepped inside when no one else was present & a \"wow\" escaped my lips. Having a guide relate the history of the building adds to the experience.",
          "Went to the hall as a package with the tower. Worth a visit, great to read about the history, fire in 1944 and the subsequent renovation but truth be told, it is a very basic hall. Good to tack on to the tower visit and with a cafe put stop thrown in, you would be mad to",
          "If you see this along with the other museums in that group you pay full-price for one and half off the rest. It's a good deal. Worth seeing this hall. Only takes a short time but it is very old. It's right next to the tower so definitely do both.",
          "Imposing building from the outside, but it doesn't take long to see the inside. Great big room still used for ceremonial purposes. The building dates back to the 13th century, If you don't have a lot of time in Bergen, you can afford to miss seeing this. There are better things",
          "This is perfect for history lovers as it was built in the 13th century, has ties to WWII, and still serves as a venue for important national functions. The hall is beautiful, but really doesn't take very long to see. Nice way to spend a little time if you're in Bergen.",
          "Amazing that they charge 80 NOK to visit this refurbished fortress that\u2019s nothing more than meeting rooms with almost no explanation. Our ticket did come with a free coffee, though, and a 50% discount at other Bergen City Museums. The tower was open, but the access to the roof",
          "Haakon's Hall and the Rosenkrantz Tower are the two most imposing structures in the Bergenhus Festning. The hall was built in 13th century for large celebrations and royal gatherings. Unfortunately the day we were there, it was closed to the public. It seems they alternate",
          "We went in because it was included in the Bergen Pass. The hall was an unusual design and had been partially rebuilt after a fire.",
          "H\u00e5kon's hall was named after H\u00e5kon H\u00e5konsson and built in mid 13th century. It was most imposing building in royal residence and often used for celebrations. Later on it was used as storehouse in 1680. In 1944, the hall was gutted in a massive fire due to the explosion of a",
          "Walked through when visiting the fort area. Enjoyed the big room, but not much to see. Enjoyed touring the grounds and the lookout over the harbor more than Hakkon's Hall.",
          "This is part of the larger fortress. Not a lot too see, but worth a visit. Interesting because of the history.",
          "You will not need much time to visit, even if you walk slowly. The hall itself is an impressive space, but that's it. The vaults under the Hall are also impressive, but filled with modern tables and chairs which was a little strange. Finding the entrance to the Hall can be",
          "There is almost nothing - stony walls and ship-like constructed roof. But the atmosphere there is great! You sit, hear silent old music and feel the history. For 80 NOK....",
          "Maybe it's because I was there off season, maybe it was because they weren't offering a tour of the building, or maybe it's because there was no brochures with stories and history to really glean from, but aside from the the fact that I was there alone, it was very lack luster.",
          "Haakon's Hall adjoins the Rosenkratz Tower and was all part of a larger fortified area. The main thing to see here is the very large \u201cbaronial\u201d hall, but there is also access to the rooms in the under-croft. The building was badly damaged when a German ammunition ship exploded",
          "The tour is very helpful in understanding the history of this site. The facility is still in use for certain royal functions.",
          "The hall itself is quite beautiful, but there is not a lot of history to read/learn about and most of the time is spent walking through the rest of the building, which is basically a nice/historic conference and events centre. Rosenkrantz Tower is more interesting - and you get",
          "11th century building with some modern refurbishment We love walking around places like this, nothing like it wherever live. Nice to wander through and soak up the historic atmosphere. Entrance was 70 Nok each",
          "Unfortunately, there isn't much to see here. Besides the hall itself - which is interesting but can be taken in in a short time - the other rooms are forgettable. If you visit the hall on a self-guided tour don't expect too much information. They provide a booklet and there are",
          "It was big, but there wasn't much to see in it. Lots of modern office chairs around tables in most of the rooms, for some reason. I read that it's much more interesting with a guided tour.",
          "Would have been more informative if more info had been provided in each room/floor- perhaps even just a notice saying what the room was used for. Eg like the rosenkrantz tower",
          "I really enjoyed my visit to the hall of the medieval king of Norway. Beautiful building, good guides, and an interesting museum. The view from the Rosenkranz Tower is stunning!",
          "Our ship was along side this. Pleasant visit but could contain a bit more for tourists, it is more a huge function hall now.",
          "The hall is quite stark on the inside with various levels and many are set with long tables with chairs suggesting it is used a lot for functions. At least it is interesting architecturally and historically and it takes only a few minutes to see all there is to see. Small",
          "Entry was free as we had purchased a 24hr Bergen card. We were given a free booklet guide to read as we looked around and which was ours to take away. Some very interesting architectural points to be noted. We even managed to tag onto one of the free guided tours! Short but",
          "The hall(s) is small and there is not much to see. It's interesting history wise, but easy to skip if little time.",
          "We walked in this area and enjoyed this medieval fort. This site is right by the cruise terminal. A large hall built by King Haakon. Destroyed and rebuilt several times. Don't use too much of your time for this building.",
          "The first builder was King Hakon Hakonsson, who began construction in 1247, completing the works in 1261. The hall was built for great occasions, but apparently it also had practical daily use. Our guide explained the hall's history as we moved from one area to another. In",
          "I was lucky because we had a city reception in the King\u2019s banqueting hall. It was perfect place for such an event and at the same time we received some historical information.",
          "While the history of Haakon's Hall is interesting and beautiful, the actual visit was unremarkable. The space is largely an event space, and without a guided tour, we admittedly probably missed some of the significance. That being said, we had read up on its history and could",
          "This hall was interesting, but a little missable. If you don't have much time, skip this and check out the tower next door. We did enjoy looking around and reading the brochure, but probably would have gotten more if they had offered us a tour when we arrived. We noticed",
          "Went at first opening to the hall, got the Bergen card which covered it and hopped on the English guided tour which leaves on the hour and lasted under an hour. It covered both this and rosenkrantz tower. Great with the tour would have been super lame without, she told",
          "We had a very lovely tour here and we're very impressed by the hall and how it's still in use in contemporary times. Well worth exploring if you get the chance.",
          "We enjoyed walking around this area and soaking in the history. We didn't get there until they were almost closed, so we didn't go in. And it was raining. So things were a little stacked against us. But despite that, we enjoyed wandering around and seeing the size and style",
          "Lots of history to be found in Bergen including the museum - well worth a visit - harbour and shops too",
          "Long live the kings and queens of Sweden. I must say the tradition of the place is very well kept with all the items and souvenirs in order. I must also admit that this place is also well maintained to fill in tourist. A free entry with a Bergen card fills the day by entering",
          "Free entry with a Bergen Card, otherwise I would skip the interior and just walk around the grounds.",
          "After entering into the hall you place yourself back in time and try to imagine the different functions and events that might have graced these walls. If you have the Bergen/pass card use it here to enhance your purchase. Make sure you stroll the grounds surrounding view the",
          "The remarkable \" The Stone Hall \" for the great occastions in the history of the monachy. Before you reach the main hall, you have to pass the reception pillars. I love this room with arched stones. However, the Stone Hall is so amazing; just simply grand, old wooden floor",
          "Nicely restored hall which is interesting to read the history in the leaflet you get on entry, in a choice of languages. Doesn't take long but worth a stop if you have a Bergen card. Could be combined with a visit to Rosenkrantz tower.",
          "The hall is definitely a sight to see. It can easily be used in a medieval feast scene in a movie. However, there is only the one room to see, so do not bargain on spending too much time here. We had a Bergen pass and entered for free, but I'm not sure if it would be worth",
          "The Hall started life as a royal reception facility and still is today although it has had several other uses in its very long history. It is not a museum and there are no exhibits. However we opted for a guided tour and were glad we did. The guide provided the info we needed",
          "The absolute highlight is its massive reception hall with a wood ship hull style ceiling. To give you a concept of the hall\u2019s size, a Danish Princess was married in the late 13th century and they had over 2000 guests in this hall !",
          "This site is right by the cruise terminal, so we went in for NOK 50 each. A large hall built in the 1200's by King Hakon, it has been destroyed and rebuilt a few times (last destroyed in WWII). The current renovation is excellent and the hall is impressive for what it is. A",
          "Hakon's hall was built by King H\u00e5kon H\u00e5konsson in the 1200's. It is a huge banqueting hall with impressively large windows at either end and a soaring wooden roof. Make sure you go down to the undercroft below. Even today it is occasionally used for royal functions. Entrance is",
          "When you walk into the actual hall of H\u00e5kon's Hall you'll be stunned by its beauty. The towering cathedral ceilings are quite breathtaking, and you can only imagine what it must have been like during a giant royal banquet hundreds of years ago. As an empty room, it doesn't",
          "The main hall is very impressive and is still used for functions by the royal family. There are lots of stairs and different rooms to explore which are set out with wooden tables and chairs. Visitors can go right down to the cellar level which is very interesting.",
          "We were able to have a free guided tour of the Hall together with the Rosenkrantz Tower. The tour was very informative and gave us a good idea of life during medieval Norway. The tour however lasted only about 40 min, which was a bit short when you visit both buildings. Like",
          "There are quite a few positives about our visit. The young ladies at the reception were friendly and good fun. However, the exhibit itself is just a let down. As a museum, I would expect extensive explanations about the building and its vaults. The hall itself is large and",
          "The original hall was built in the 13th century when Bergen was the capital, but what you see today is a reconstruction from the 20th century. The hall is very well done, and the main room is certainly beautiful, albeit simply with just the vaulted ceilings and basic tapestries",
          "Unfortunately it wasn't open during my visit to Bergen, but I did walk around outside. Very well preserved event hall close to Bryggen. If you walk the length of the Bryggen shop area, you may as well hit this up.",
          "Hakons hall is a restored mediaeval hall with many vaulted rooms beneath. It is open as a museum but also used as a venu for concerts etc. I think the acoustics would have been amazing! Tickets came with free refreshments in the cafe next door where they served delicious",
          "My mother has difficulty with steps and as the entrance has a staircase of approximately 15 steps, we asked if there were more in the hall. After being assured there were not many inside, we were shocked that there were over 100 steps to go up/down throughout the hall. Aside",
          "I did a tour of hakons hall and rosenkrantz tower with njordis. She made the tour so worthwhile. Full of knowledge and no script. Interesting story of the hall when Bergen was top of the world. I don't know what I would have felt if I saw the hall on my own but she created",
          "Randomly closed during the International festival--despite thousands of tourists being in town. When buying the Bergencard, we factored in a visit to Hakon's Hall in order to make the card worth it. Bc the closure (which the tourist info office didn't mention), the card wasn't",

          "There are three levels each of one room, but the bottom two are full of modern chairs and look just like waiting rooms at an airport. The top floor has a mildly interesting room, but we are talking ten minutes and 10NOK value, which since it is 50NOK means this is one you should"

The first floor, on the other hand, would greatly benefit from a renovation, as there really isn't too much to see there. It really does the exhibition on the second floor a great disservice.",

        "wiki": "The West Norway Museum of Decorative Art (Norwegian: Vestlandske kunstindustrimuseum) was established in 1887 at the initiative of Johan B\u00f8gh. In 1896 the museum moved into a permanent exhibition building, a Renaissance Revival structure designed by Henry Bucher (1864\u20131944). The building caught fire during the 1916 Bergen fire but was saved.\nThe collections include older local works in silver, furniture, glass, porcelain, and textiles. Upon its opening, the museum received substantial donations from the merchant Christian Sundt.During the first years, the Bergen Art Gallery occupied the top floor. The collection was then moved from there to the former power plant building (Norwegian: Lysverksbygget) after it became available. The Fisheries Museum also occupied the ground floor.\nAfter merging with Bergen Art Museum, the museum has been a venue for more temporary exhibitions. Its emphasis remains on crafts from the past 500 years, and also its Chinese Collection, a unique assembly of Chinese art. This is mostly a bequest from Johan Wilhelm Normann Munthe (1864\u20131935), who lived in China from age 22 until his death in 1935.\nThe museum was also responsible for the Alv\u00f8en site and Damsg\u00e5rd Manor, but this has now been taken over by the new Bergen City Museum.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Bergen (Norwegian pronunciation: [\u02c8b\u00e6\u0300\u027e\u0261(\u0259)n] (listen)), historically Bj\u00f8rgvin, is a city and municipality in Vestland county on the west coast of Norway. At the end of 2019, the municipality's population was 283,929, and the Bergen metropolitan region had about 420,000 inhabitants. Bergen is the second-largest city in Norway. The municipality covers 465 square kilometres (180 sq mi) and is on the peninsula of Bergenshalv\u00f8yen. The city centre and northern neighbourhoods are on Byfjorden, 'the city fjord', and the city is surrounded by mountains; Bergen is known as the 'city of seven mountains'. Many of the extra-municipal suburbs are on islands. Bergen is the administrative centre of Vestland county.  The city consists of eight boroughs: Arna, Bergenhus, Fana, Fyllingsdalen, Laksev\u00e5g, Ytrebygda, \u00c5rstad, and \u00c5sane.\nTrading in Bergen may have started as early as the 1020s. According to tradition, the city was founded in 1070 by king Olav Kyrre and was named Bj\u00f8rgvin, 'the green meadow among the mountains'. It served as Norway's capital in the 13th century, and from the end of the 13th century became a bureau city of the Hanseatic League. Until 1789, Bergen enjoyed exclusive rights to mediate trade between Northern Norway and abroad and it was the largest city in Norway until the 1830s when it was overtaken by the capital, Christiania (now known as Oslo). What remains of the quays, Bryggen, is a World Heritage Site. The city was hit by numerous fires over the years. The Bergen School of Meteorology was developed at the Geophysical Institute starting in 1917, the Norwegian School of Economics was founded in 1936, and the University of Bergen in 1946. From 1831 to 1972, Bergen was its own county. In 1972 the municipality absorbed four surrounding municipalities and became a part of Hordaland county.\nThe city is an international center for aquaculture, shipping, the offshore petroleum industry and subsea technology, and a national centre for higher education, media, tourism and finance. Bergen Port is Norway's busiest in terms of both freight and passengers, with over 300 cruise ship calls a year bringing nearly a half a million passengers to Bergen, a number that has doubled in 10 years. Almost half of the passengers are German or British. The city's main football team is SK Brann and a unique tradition of the city is the buekorps. Natives speak a distinct dialect, known as 'Bergensk'. The city features Bergen Airport, Flesland and Bergen Light Rail, and is the terminus of the Bergen Line. Four large bridges connect Bergen to its suburban municipalities.\nBergen has a mild winter climate, though with a lot of precipitation. From December to March, Bergen can be, in rare cases, up to 20 \u00b0C warmer than Oslo, even though both cities are at about 60\u00b0 North. The Gulf Stream keeps the sea relatively warm, considering the latitude, and the mountains protect the city from cold winds from the north, north-east and east.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe city of Bergen was traditionally thought to have been founded by king Olav Kyrre, son of Harald Hardr\u00e5de in 1070 AD, four years after the Viking Age in England ended with the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Modern research has, however, discovered that a trading settlement had already been established in the 1020s or 1030s.Bergen gradually assumed the function of capital of Norway in the early 13th century, as the first city where a rudimentary central administration was established. The city's cathedral was the site of the first royal coronation in Norway in the 1150s, and continued to host royal coronations throughout the 13th century. Bergenhus fortress dates from the 1240s and guards the entrance to the harbour in Bergen. The functions of the capital city were lost to Oslo during the reign of King Haakon V (1299-1319).\n\nIn the middle of the 14th century, North German merchants, who had already been present in substantial numbers since the 13th century, founded one of the four Kontore of the Hanseatic League at Bryggen in Bergen. The principal export traded from Bergen was dried cod from the northern Norwegian coast, which started around 1100. The city was granted a monopoly for trade from the north of Norway by King H\u00e5kon H\u00e5konsson (1217-1263). Stockfish was the main reason that the city became one of North Europe's largest centres for trade. By the late 14th century, Bergen had established itself as the centre of the trade in Norway. The Hanseatic merchants lived in their own separate quarter of the town, where Middle Low German was used, enjoying exclusive rights to trade with the northern fishermen who each summer sailed to Bergen. Today, Bergen's old quayside, Bryggen, is on UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites.\nIn 1349, the Black Death was brought to Norway by an English ship arriving in Bergen. Later outbreaks occurred in 1618, 1629 and 1637, on each occasion taking about 3,000 lives. In the 15th century, the city was attacked several times by the Victual Brothers, and in 1429 they succeeded in burning the royal castle and much of the city. In 1665, the city's harbour was the site of the Battle of V\u00e5gen, when an English naval flotilla attacked a Dutch merchant and treasure fleet supported by the city's garrison. Accidental fires sometimes got out of control, and one in 1702 reduced most of the town to ashes.\nThroughout the 15th and 16th centuries, Bergen remained one of the largest cities in Scandinavia, and it was Norway's biggest city until the 1830s, when the capital city of Oslo became the largest. From around 1600, the Hanseatic dominance of the city's trade gradually declined in favour of Norwegian merchants (often of Hanseatic ancestry), and in the 1750s, the Hanseatic Kontor finally closed. Bergen retained its monopoly of trade with northern Norway until 1789. The Bergen stock exchange, the Bergen b\u00f8rs, was established in 1813.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nBergen was separated from Hordaland as a county of its own in 1831. It was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The rural municipality of Bergen landdistrikt was merged with Bergen on 1 January 1877. The rural municipality of \u00c5rstad was merged with Bergen on 1 July 1915.\nDuring World War II, Bergen was occupied on the first day of the German invasion on 9 April 1940, after a brief fight between German ships and the Norwegian coastal artillery. The Norwegian resistance movement groups in Bergen were Saborg, Milorg, \"Theta-gruppen\", Sivorg, Stein-organisasjonen and the Communist Party. On 20 April 1944, during the German occupation, the Dutch cargo ship Voorbode anchored off the Bergenhus Fortress, loaded with over 120 tons of explosives, and blew up, killing at least 150 people and damaging historic buildings. The city was subject to some Allied bombing raids, aimed at German naval installations in the harbour. Some of these caused Norwegian civilian casualties numbering about 100.\nBergen is also well known in Norway for the Isdal Woman (Norwegian: Isdalskvinnen), an unidentified person who was found dead at Isdalen (\u201cIce Valley\u201d) on 29 November 1970. The unsolved case encouraged international speculation over the years and it remains one of the most profound mysteries in recent Norwegian history.The rural municipalities of Arna, Fana, Laksev\u00e5g, and \u00c5sane were merged with Bergen on 1 January 1972. The city lost its status as a separate county on the same date, and Bergen is now a municipality, in the county of Vestland.\n\n\n=== Fires ===\nThe city's history is marked by numerous great fires. In 1198, the Bagler faction set fire to the city in connection with a battle against the Birkebeiner faction during the civil war. In 1248, Holmen and Sverresborg burned, and 11 churches were destroyed. In 1413 another fire struck the city, and 14 churches were destroyed. In 1428 the city was plundered by the Victual Brothers, and in 1455, Hanseatic merchants were responsible for burning down Munkeliv Abbey. In 1476, Bryggen burned down in a fire started by a drunk trader. In 1582, another fire hit the city centre and Strandsiden. In 1675, 105 buildings burned down in \u00d8vregaten. In 1686 another great fire hit Strandsiden, destroying 231 city blocks and 218 boathouses. The greatest fire in history was in 1702, when 90% of the city was burned to ashes. In 1751, there was a great fire at V\u00e5gsbunnen. In 1756, yet another fire at Strandsiden burned down 1,500 buildings, and further great fires hit Strandsiden in 1771 and 1901. In 1916, 300 buildings burned down in the city centre, and in 1955 parts of Bryggen burned down.\n\n\n=== Toponymy ===\nBergen is pronounced in English  or  and in Norwegian [\u02c8b\u00e6\u0300r\u0261n\u0329] (listen). The Old Norse forms of the name were Bergvin and Bj\u01ebrgvin (and in Icelandic and Faroese the city is still called Bj\u00f6rgvin). The first element is berg (n.) or bj\u01ebrg (n.), which translates as 'mountain(s)'. The last element is vin (f.), which means a new settlement where there used to be a pasture or meadow. The full meaning is then \"the meadow among the mountains\". This is a suitable name: Bergen is often called \"the city among the seven mountains\". It was the playwright Ludvig Holberg who felt so inspired by the seven hills of Rome, that he decided that his home town must be blessed with a corresponding seven mountains - and locals still argue which seven they are.\nIn 1918, there was a campaign to reintroduce the Norse form Bj\u00f8rgvin as the name of the city. This was turned down - but as a compromise, the name of the diocese was changed to Bj\u00f8rgvin bisped\u00f8mme.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBergen occupies most of the peninsula of Bergenshalv\u00f8yen in the district of Midthordland in mid-western Hordaland. The municipality covers an area of 465 square kilometres (180 square miles). Most of the urban area is on or close to a fjord or bay, although the urban area has several mountains. The city centre is surrounded by the Seven Mountains, although there is disagreement as to which of the nine mountains constitute these. Ulriken, Fl\u00f8yen, L\u00f8vstakken and Damsg\u00e5rdsfjellet are always included as well as three of Lyderhorn, Sandviksfjellet, Bl\u00e5manen, Rundemanen and Kolbeinsvarden. Gullfjellet is Bergen's highest mountain, at 987 metres (3,238 ft) above mean sea level.Bergen is sheltered from the North Sea by the islands Ask\u00f8y, Holsn\u00f8y (the municipality of Meland) and Sotra (the municipalities of Fjell and Sund). Bergen borders the municipalities Meland, Lind\u00e5s, and Oster\u00f8y to the north, Vaksdal and Samnanger to the east, Os and Austevoll to the south, and Sund, Fjell, and Ask\u00f8y to the west.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nBergen has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), with plentiful rainfall in all seasons; with intermittent snowfall during winter, but the snow usually melts quickly in the city. Average annual precipitation during 1961-90 was 2,250 mm (89 in). This is because Bergen is surrounded by mountains that cause moist North Atlantic air to undergo orographic lift, yielding abundant rainfall. It rained every day from 29 October 2006 to 21 January 2007: 85 consecutive days. The highest temperature ever recorded was 33.4 \u00b0C (92.1 \u00b0F) on 26 July 2019, beating the previous record from 2018 at 32.6 degrees, and the lowest was \u221216.3 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) in January 1987. Bergen is considered the rainiest city in Europe, although it is not the most precipitous \"place\" on the continent.Bergen's weather is much warmer than the city's latitude (60.4\u00b0 N) might suggest. Temperatures below -10 \u00b0C are rare. Summer temperatures sometimes reach the upper 20s, temperatures over 30 \u00b0C was previously only seen a few days each decade. The growing season in Bergen is exceptionally long for its latitude, with more than 200 days. Its mild winters move the plant hardiness zone to 8b in most coastal locations.\nThe high precipitation is often used in the marketing of the city, and features to a degree on postcards sold in the city. Compared to areas behind the mountains on the Scandinavian peninsula, Bergen is much wetter and has a narrower temperature range, with cool summers and mild winters. The old sunshine hours data was from the met office in the city; at this location sunlight is obscured by mountains, especially by Ulriken. A new sunrecorder was established at Bergen Airport in December 2015, and this records from 1450 to 1750 (2018) hours of sunshine.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the end of Q4 2019, the municipality had a population of 283,929, making the population density 599 people per km2. As of 1 January 2017, the main urban area of Bergen had 254,235 residents and covered an area of 96.71 square kilometres (37.34 sq mi). Other urban areas, as defined by Statistics Norway, consist of Indre Arna (6,536 residents on 1 January 2012), Fanahammeren (3,690), Ytre Arna (2,626), Hylkje (2,277) and Espeland (2,182).\nEthnic Norwegians make up 84.5% of Bergen's residents. In addition, 8.1% were first or second generation immigrants of Western background and 7.4% were first or second generation immigrants of non-Western background. The population grew by 4,549 people in 2009, a growth rate of 1,8%. Ninety-six percent of the population lives in urban areas. As of 2002, the average gross income for men above the age of 17 is 426,000 Norwegian krone (NOK), the average gross income for women above the age of 17 is NOK 238,000, with the total average gross income being NOK 330,000. In 2007, there were 104.6 men for every 100 women in the age group of 20\u201339. 22.8% of the population were under 17 years of age, while 4.5% were 80 and above.\nThe immigrant population (those with two foreign-born parents) in Bergen, includes 42,169 individuals with backgrounds from more than 200 countries representing 15.5% of the city's population (2014). Of these, 50.2% have background from Europe, 28.9% from Asia, 13.1% from Africa, 5.5% from Latin America, 1.9% from North America, and 0.4% from Oceania. The immigrant population in Bergen in the period 1993-2008 increased by 119.7%, while the ethnic Norwegian population grew by 8.1% during the same period. The national average is 138.0% and 4.2%. The immigrant population has thus accounted for 43.6% of Bergen's population growth and 60.8% of Norway's population growth during the period 1993\u20132008, compared with 84.5% in Oslo.The immigrant population in Bergen has changed a lot since 1970. As of 1 January 1986, there were 2,870 people with a non-Western immigrant background in Bergen. In 2006, this figure had increased to 14,630, so the non-Western immigrant population in Bergen was five times higher than in 1986. This is a slightly slower growth than the national average, which has sextupled during the same period. Also in relation to the total population in Bergen, the proportion of non-Westerns increased significantly. In 1986, the proportion of the total population in the municipality of non-Western background was 3.6%. In January 2006, people with a non-Western immigrant background accounted for 6 percent of the population in Bergen. The share of Western immigrants has remained stable at around 2% in the period. The number of Poles in Bergen rose from 697 in 2006 to 3,128 in 2010.The Church of Norway is the largest denomination in Bergen, with 201,006 (79.74%) registered adherents in 2012. Bergen is the seat of the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin with Bergen Cathedral as its centrepiece, while St John's Church is the city's most prominent. As of 2012, the state church is followed by 52,059 irreligious  4,947 members of various Protestant free churches, 3,873 actively registrered Catholics 2,707 registered Muslims, 816 registered Hindus, 255 registered Russian Orthodox and 147 registered Oriental Orthodox.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe city centre of Bergen lies in the west of the municipality, facing the fjord of Byfjorden. It is among a group of mountains known as the Seven Mountains, although the number is a matter of definition. From here, the urban area of Bergen extends to the north, west and south, and to its east is a large mountain massif. Outside the city centre and the surrounding neighbourhoods (i.e. \u00c5rstad, inner Laksev\u00e5g and Sandviken), the majority of the population lives in relatively sparsely populated residential areas built after 1950. While some are dominated by apartment buildings and modern terraced houses (e.g. Fyllingsdalen), others are dominated by single-family homes.\n\nThe oldest part of Bergen is the area around the bay of V\u00e5gen in the city centre. Originally centred on the bay's eastern side, Bergen eventually expanded west and southwards. Few buildings from the oldest period remain, the most significant being St Mary's Church from the 12th century. For several hundred years, the extent of the city remained almost constant. The population was stagnant, and the city limits were narrow. In 1702, seven-eighths of the city burned. Most of the old buildings of Bergen, including Bryggen (which was rebuilt in a mediaeval style), were built after the fire. The fire marked a transition from tar covered houses, as well as the remaining log houses, to painted and some brick-covered wooden buildings.\n\nThe last half of the 19th century saw a period of rapid expansion and modernisation. The fire of 1855 west of Torgallmenningen led to the development of regularly sized city blocks in this area of the city centre. The city limits were expanded in 1876, and Nyg\u00e5rd, M\u00f8hlenpris and Sandviken were urbanized with large-scale construction of city blocks housing both the poor and the wealthy. Their architecture is influenced by a variety of styles; historicism, classicism and Art Nouveau. The wealthy built villas between M\u00f8hlenpris and Nyg\u00e5rd, and on the side of Mount Fl\u00f8yen; these areas were also added to Bergen in 1876. Simultaneously, an urbanization process was taking place in Solheimsviken in \u00c5rstad, at that time outside the Bergen municipality, centred on the large industrial activity in the area. The workers' homes in this area were poorly built, and little remains after large-scale redevelopment in the 1960s-1980s.\nAfter \u00c5rstad became a part of Bergen in 1916, a development plan was applied to the new area. Few city blocks akin to those in Nyg\u00e5rd and M\u00f8hlenpris were planned. Many of the worker class built their own homes, and many small, detached apartment buildings were built. After World War II, Bergen had again run short of land to build on, and, contrary to the original plans, many large apartment buildings were built in Land\u00e5s in the 1950s and 1960s. Bergen acquired Fyllingsdalen from Fana municipality in 1955. Like similar areas in Oslo (e.g. Lambertseter), Fyllingsdalen was developed into a modern suburb with large apartment buildings, mid-rises, and some single-family homes, in the 1960s and 1970s. Similar developments took place beyond Bergen's city limits, for example in Loddefjord.\n\nAt the same time as planned city expansion took place inside Bergen, its extra-municipal suburbs also grew rapidly. Wealthy citizens of Bergen had been living in Fana since the 19th century, but as the city expanded it became more convenient to settle in the municipality. Similar processes took place in \u00c5sane and Laksev\u00e5g. Most of the homes in these areas are detached row houses, single family homes or small apartment buildings. After the surrounding municipalities were merged with Bergen in 1972, expansion has continued in largely the same manner, although the municipality encourages condensing near commercial centres, future Bergen Light Rail stations, and elsewhere.As part of the modernisation wave of the 1950s and 1960s, and due to damage caused by World War II, the city government ambitiously planned redevelopment of many areas in central Bergen. The plans involved demolition of several neighbourhoods of wooden houses, namely Nordnes, Marken, and St\u00f8len. None of the plans was carried out in its original form; the Marken and St\u00f8len redevelopment plans were discarded and that of Nordnes only carried out in the area that had been most damaged by war. The city council of Bergen had in 1964 voted to demolish the entirety of Marken, however, the decision proved to be highly controversial and the decision was reversed in 1974. Bryggen was under threat of being wholly or partly demolished after the fire of 1955, when a large number of the buildings burned to the ground. Instead of being demolished, the remaining buildings were restored and accompanied by reconstructions of some of the burned buildings.Demolition of old buildings and occasionally whole city blocks is still taking place, the most recent major example being the 2007 razing of Jonsvollskvartalet at N\u00f8stet.Billboards are banned in the city.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nSince 2000, the city of Bergen has been governed by a city government (byr\u00e5d) based on the principle of parliamentarism. The government consists of seven government members called commissioners, and is appointed by the city council, the supreme authority of the city. After the local elections of 2007, the city has been ruled by a right-wing coalition of the Progress Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and the Conservative Party, each with two commissioners. The Conservative Party member Trude Drevland is mayor-on unpaid leave since 1 September 2015, while conservative Ragnhild Stolt-Nielsen is the leader of the city government, the most powerful political position in Bergen.\nIn the 2015 election, the Labour Party won the Bergen election with a landslide, and got 37,8 % of the votes, up 9 percent from 2011, while the Conservative party lost 12,8 % and ended up at just 22,1 %. The Labour Party formed a new centre-left city government with the Liberal Party and the Christian Democrats. The Labour Party is now holding both the mayor office and governing mayor office. After the 2015 landslide elections for the Labour party, Marte Mj\u00f8s Persen (Labour Party) is the new Bergen mayor, and Harald Schjeldrup (Labour Party) the new Bergen governing mayor. The Labour Party has formed a new centre-left city government including the Labour Party, the Liberal Party, and the Christian Democrats.\nThe 2007 city council elections were held on 10 September. The Socialist Left Party (SV) and the Pensioners Party (PP) ended up as the losers of the election, SV going from 11.6% of the votes in the 2003 elections to 7.1%, and PP losing 2.9% ending up at 1.2%. The Liberal Party more than doubled, going from 2.7% to 5.8%. The Conservative Party lost 1.1% of the votes, ending up at 26.3%, while the Progress Party got 20.2% of the votes, a gain of 3% since the 2003 elections. The Christian Democratic Party gained 0.2%, ending up at 6.3%. The Red Electoral Alliance lost 1.4%, ending up at 4.5%, while the Centre Party gained 1.2%, ending up at 2.8%. Finally, the Labour Party continued being the second-largest party in the city, gaining 1% and ending up at 23.9%.This is the political party breakdown of the current and historical city councils:\n\n\n=== Boroughs ===\n\nBergen is divided into eight boroughs, as seen on the map to the right. Clockwise, starting with the northernmost, the boroughs are \u00c5sane, Arna, Fana, Ytrebygda, Fyllingsdalen, Laksev\u00e5g, \u00c5rstad and Bergenhus. The city centre is located in Bergenhus. Parts of Fana, Ytrebygda, \u00c5sane and Arna are not part of the Bergen urban area, explaining why the municipality has approximately 20,000 more inhabitants than the urban area.Local borough administrations have varied since Bergen's expansion in 1972. From 1974, each borough had a politically chosen administration. From 1989, Bergen was divided into 12 health and social districts, each locally administered. From 2000 to 2004, the former organizational form with eight politically chosen local administrations was again in use and from 2008 through to 2010, a similar form existed where the local administrations had less power than previously.\n(Pertaining to the table above: The acreage figures include fresh water and uninhabited mountain areas, except: 1 1 The borough Bergenhus is 8.73 km2 (3.37 sq mi), the rest is water and uninhabited mountain areas.2 2 The borough \u00c5rstad is 8.47 km2 (3.27 sq mi), the rest is water and uninhabited mountain areas.)\nFormer borough: Sentrum\nSentrum (literally, \"Centre\") was a borough (with the same name as a present-day neighbourhood). The borough was numbered 01, and its perimeter was from Store Lungeg\u00e5rdsvann and Str\u00f8mmen along Puddefjorden around Nordnes and over to Skuteviken, up Mt. Fl\u00f8yen east of Langelivannet, on to Skansemyren and over Forskj\u00f8nnelsen to Store Lungeg\u00e5rdsvann, south of the railroad tracks.The population of the (now defunct) borough, numbered in 1994 more than 18,000 people.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThere are 64 elementary schools, 18 lower secondary schools and 20 upper secondary schools in Bergen, as well as 11 combined elementary and lower secondary schools. Bergen Cathedral School is the oldest school in Bergen and was founded by Pope Adrian IV in 1153.The \"Bergen School of Meteorology\" was developed at the Geophysical Institute beginning in 1917, the Norwegian School of Economics was founded in 1936, and the University of Bergen in 1946.The University of Bergen has 16,000 students and 3,000 staff, making it the third-largest educational institution in Norway.

The university has a broad range of courses and research in academic fields and three national centres of excellence, in climate research, petroleum research and medieval studies. The main campus is located in the city centre. The university co-operates with Haukeland University Hospital within medical research. The Chr. Michelsen Institute is an independent research foundation established in 1930 focusing on human rights and development issues.The Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, which has its main campus in Kronstad, has 16,000 students and 1800 staff. It focuses on professional education, such as teaching, healthcare and engineering. The college was created through amalgamation in 1994; campuses are spread around town but will be co-located at Kronstad. The Norwegian School of Economics is located in outer Sandviken and is the leading business school in Norway, having produced three Economy Nobel Prize laureates. The school has more than 3,000 students and approximately 400 staff. Other tertiary education institutions include the Bergen School of Architecture, the Bergen National Academy of the Arts, located in the city centre with 300 students, and the Norwegian Naval Academy located in Laksev\u00e5g. The Norwegian Institute of Marine Research has been located in Bergen since 1900. It provides research and advice relating to ecosystems and aquaculture. It has a staff of 700 people.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIn August 2004, Time magazine named the city one of Europe's 14 \"secret capitals\" where Bergen's capital reign is acknowledged within maritime businesses and activities such as aquaculture and marine research, with the Institute of Marine Research (IMR) (the second-largest oceanography research centre in Europe) as the leading institution. Bergen is the main base for the Royal Norwegian Navy (at Haakonsvern) and its international airport Flesland is the main heliport for the Norwegian North Sea oil and gas industry, from where thousands of offshore workers commute to their work places onboard oil and gas rigs and platforms.One of Norway's largest shopping centres, Lagunen Storsenter, is located in Fana in Bergen, with retail sales of 2,8 billion Norwegian kroner, and around 4.6 million visitors in 2018.Tourism is an important income source for the city. The hotels in the city may be full at times, due to the increasing number of tourists and conferences. Prior to the Rolling Stones concert in September 2006, many hotels were already fully booked several months in advance. Bergen is recognized as the unofficial capital of the region known as Western Norway, and recognized and marketed as the gateway city to the world-famous fjords of Norway, and for that reason, it has become Norway's largest - and one of Europe's largest - cruise ship ports of call.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nBergen Airport, Flesland, is located 18 kilometres (11 mi) from the city centre, at Flesland. In 2013, the Avinor-operated airport served 6 million passengers. The airport serves as a hub for Scandinavian Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Wider\u00f8e; there are direct flights to 20 domestic and 53 international destinations. Bergen Port, operated by Bergen Port Authority, is the largest seaport in Norway.\nIn 2011, the port saw 264 cruise calls with 350,248 visitors, In 2009, the port handled 56 million tonnes of cargo, making it the ninth-busiest cargo port in Europe. There are plans to move the port out of the city centre, but no location has been chosen. Fjord Line operates a cruiseferry service to Hirtshals, Denmark. Bergen is the southern terminus of Hurtigruten, the Coastal Express, which operates with daily services along the coast to Kirkenes. Passenger catamarans run from Bergen south to Haugesund and Stavanger, and north to Sognefjord and Nordfjord.\nThe city centre is surrounded by an electronic toll collection ring using the Autopass system. The main motorways consist of E39, which runs north\u2013south through the municipality, E16, which runs eastwards, and National Road 555, which runs westwards. There are four major bridges connecting Bergen to neighbouring municipalities: the Nordhordland Bridge, the Ask\u00f8y Bridge, the Sotra Bridge and the Oster\u00f8y Bridge.

The Norwegian State Railways operates express trains to Oslo and the Bergen Commuter Rail to Voss. Between Bergen and Arna Station, the train runs about every 30 minutes through the Ulriken Tunnel; there is no corresponding road tunnel, forcing road vehicles to travel via \u00c5sane or Nesttun.\nBergen is one of the smallest cities in Europe to have both tram and trolleybus electric urban transport systems simultaneously. Public transport in Hordaland is managed by Skyss, which operates an extensive city bus network in Bergen and to many neighbouring municipalities, including one route which operates as a trolleybus. The trolleybus system in Bergen is the only one still in operation in Norway and one of two trolleybus systems in Scandinavia.The modern tram Bergen Light Rail (Bybanen) opened between the city centre and Nesttun in 2010, extended to R\u00e5dal (Lagunen Storsenter) in 2013 and to the Bergen airport Flesland in 2017. Extensions to other boroughs may occur later. Fl\u00f8ibanen is a funicular which runs from the city centre to Mount Fl\u00f8yen and Ulriksbanen is an aerial tramway which runs to Mount Ulriken.\n\n\n== Culture and sports ==\n\nBergens Tidende (BT) and Bergensavisen (BA) are the largest newspapers, with circulations of 87,076 and 30,719 in 2006, BT is a regional newspaper covering all of Hordaland and Sogn og Fjordane, while BA focuses on metropolitan Bergen.

In athletics, the city is dominated by IL Norna-Salhus, IL Gular and FIK BFG Fana, formerly also Norr\u00f8na IL and TIF Viking.\nBergensk is the native dialect of Bergen and a variation of Vestnorsk. It was strongly influenced by Low German-speaking merchants from the mid-14th to mid-18th centuries. During the Dano-Norwegian period from 1536 to 1814, Bergen was more influenced by Danish than other areas of Norway. The Danish influence removed the female grammatical gender in the 16th century, making Bergensk one of very few Norwegian dialects with only two instead of three grammatical genders. The Rs are uvular trills, as in French, which probably spread to Bergen some time in the 18th century, overtaking the alveolar trill in the time span of two to three generations. Owing to an improved literacy rate, Bergensk was influenced by riksm\u00e5l and bokm\u00e5l in the 19th and 20th centuries. This led to large parts of the German-inspired vocabulary disappearing and pronunciations shifting slightly towards East Norwegian.The 1986 edition of the Eurovision Song Contest took place in Bergen. Bergen was the host city for the 2017 UCI Road World Championships. The city is also a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the category of gastronomy since 2015.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nBergen has been the home of several notable alternative bands, collectively referred to as the Bergen Wave. These bands include R\u00f6yksopp and Kings of Convenience on the small, Bergen-based record label Tell\u00e9 Records, as well as related side-projects, such as The Whitest Boy Alive and Kommode, on independent labels. Other internationally well-received artists also originating from Bergen include Sondre Lerche, Magnet, Kygo, Boy Pablo and Alan Walker.\n\n\n=== Street art ===\nBergen is considered to be the street art capital of Norway. Famed artist Banksy visited the city in 2000 and inspired many to start creating street art. Soon after, the city brought up the most famous street artist in Norway: Dolk. His art can still be seen in several places in the city, and in 2009 the city council choose to preserve Dolk's work \"Spray\" with protective glass. In 2011, Bergen council launched a plan of action for street art in Bergen from 2011 to 2015 to ensure that \"Bergen will lead the fashion for street art as an expression both in Norway and Scandinavia.The Madam Felle (1831-1908) monument in Sandviken, is in honour of a Norwegian woman of German origin, who in the mid-19th century managed, against the will of the council, to maintain a counter of beer. A well-known restaurant of the same name is now situated at another location in Bergen. The monument was erected in 1990 by sculptor Kari Rolfsen, supported by an anonymous donor. Madam Felle, civil name Oline Fell, was remembered after her death in a popular song, possibly originally a folksong, \"Kjenner Dokker Madam Felle?\" by Lothar Lindtner and Rolf Berntzen on an album in 1977.\n\n\n== Neighbourhoods ==\n\nThe traditional neighbourhoods of Bergen include Bryggen, Eidemarken, Engen, Fjellet,\nKalfaret,  Ladeg\u00e5rden,  L\u00f8vstakksiden, Marken,  Minde,\nM\u00f8hlenpris, Nordnes, Nyg\u00e5rd, N\u00f8stet, Sandviken,\nSentrum, Skansen, Skuteviken, Strandsiden, St\u00f8len, Sydnes,\nVerftet, V\u00e5gsbunnen, Wergeland, and Ytre Sandviken.\n\n\n=== Grunnkretser ===\nThe various addresses in Bergen, each belong to one of the various grunnkrets.\n\n\n== International business ==\nEach year Bergen sells the Christmas Tree seen in Newcastle's Haymarket as a sign of the ongoing friendship between the sister cities.

        "wiki": "Troldhaugen is the former home of Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg and his wife Nina Grieg. Troldhaugen is located in Bergen, Norway and consists of the Edvard Grieg Museum, Grieg's villa, the hut where he composed music, and his and his wife's gravesite.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe building was designed by Grieg's cousin, the architect Schak Bull. The name comes from trold meaning troll and haug from the Old Norse word haugr meaning hill or knoll. Grieg is reputed to have said that children called the nearby small valley  \"The Valley of Trolls\" and thus gave the name for his building as well. Edvard Grieg himself called the building \"my best composition hitherto\".\nEdvard and Nina Grieg finished building Troldhaugen in 1885. Edvard and Nina Grieg lived in Troldhaugen when he was home in Norway, mostly in the summer.  Troldhaugen was the home of Edvard Grieg from April 1885 to his death. After the death of her husband in 1907, Nina Grieg moved to Denmark where she spent the remainder of her life.  Grieg's and his wife's ashes rest inside a mountain tomb near the house.Troldhaugen is a typical 19th-century residence with panoramic tower and a large veranda.  Grieg's small composer's hut overlooks Nord\u00e5s Lake. Grieg immortalized the name of his home in one of his piano pieces, Wedding Day at Troldhaugen, Opus 65, No. 6.\n\n\n== Edvard Grieg Museum Troldhaugen ==\nTroldhaugen and its surroundings are now operated as the Edvard Grieg Museum Troldhaugen, which is dedicated to the memory of Edvard Grieg. In 1995, a museum building was added, with a permanent exhibition of Edvard Grieg's life and music, as well as shop and restaurant. In the villa's living room stands Grieg's own Steinway grand piano, which he was given as a silver wedding anniversary present in 1892. Today the instrument is used for private concerts, special occasions, and intimate concerts held in connection with Bergen International Festival. In addition, the noted Norwegian pianist Leif Ove Andsnes has recorded an album of selections from Grieg's ten volumes of Lyric Pieces.\nTroldsalen, a concert hall,  offers concert series in the summer and autumn months, as well as many other concerts and events. Troldsalen, which was completed in 1985, is an elegant and beautiful concert hall, with excellent acoustics. The floor-to-ceiling windows behind the stage provide the audience with a lovely view of the composer's hut and Lake Nord\u00e5s.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nAustralian experimental folk metal band Troldhaugen take their name from the home, as well as incorporate excerpts of Grieg's music into their own.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of music museums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Other sources ==\nTorsteinson,  Sigmund (1978) Femti ar med Troldhaugen: Glimt fra museumstiden 1928-1978 (Gyldendal)\nTorsteinson,  Sigmund  (1960) Troldhaugen med en kort biografi om Edvard Grieg (John Grieg)\nKayser, Audun  (1980) Troldhaugen: Nina and Edvard Griegs home  (John Grieg)\nNordhagen, Per Jonas (1992)  Bergen Guide & Handbook  (Bergensia-forlaget) ISBN 82-91104-01-8\n\n\n== External links ==\nEdvard Grieg Museum Troldhaugen\nTroldhaugen Picture Gallery",

          "Great place to visit if you are a fan of Edvard. The museum was great to see even if you have never heard of Edvard. When listening to some of his music playing in the museum I realised that I actually had heard some it before, I just never knew his name",
          "A fantastically beautiful place: the situation, high above the lovely city of Bergen, the house itself, full of treasures, and a lovely concert-hall (with a lovely concert). From the latter one can see the little wooden hut where grieg composed. All-in-all, totally magnificent!",
          "We thoroughly our trip to Troldhaugen. My daughters have played some of Grieg\u2019s music and I know his music through his collaboration with Ibsen. The guide to Grieg\u2019s house was extremely knowledgeable and answered all our questions with real insight and enthusiasm. Grieg\u2019s house",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the Edvard Grieg home. Interesting bits to look at throughout the inside. We especially enjoyed the concert in the beautiful concert hall on the grounds. Returning to Bergen this year and plan to visit again.",
          "The home of the man whose music almost defines Norway... think \"Morning\" and picture drifting over the Fjords.",
          "Very nice trip including visit of museum, park and 30min concert. Lovely experience enjoyed by all family including our children!",
          "Though I had never heard of Edvard Grieg before flying to Norway, I was interested in hearing more about the country's famous composer. Now that I've done it, I can say that Troldhaugen is far and away one of the best ways to dip into this element of Norwegian history. We",
          "Do you like Norwegian music? Do you like to immerse to local spirit in sounds and to get information about great composers? Then Troldhaugen is for you. You can go to the lunch concert after guiding tour. Concert hall with sod roof is very impressive",
          "This is a very interesting museum presenting both a history of Edvard Grieg and showing how he and those like him lived in 19th century Norway. My only regret was that we were not able to attend one of the concerts which I understand are just excellent.",
          "We enjoyed both excursion and lunch concert there. Edvard Grieg is the best Norwegian composer in my opinion",
          "Be sure to have a detailed walking map from the train station to the museum. There are no signs at the Hop train station indicating which direction to start the trek to the museum. It is a long walk,(30 minutes) but we enjoyed being among the locals and view the pretty homes",
          "We have visited Edward Grieg wooden hut in Hardanger in the small village of Lofthus. So, in Bergen we also decided to visit his villa and enjoy a concert there. Great master!",
          "Nice little tour in and around the house of Greig. Amazing scenery at the lake. The custodian was very friendly and informed us on the history of the house, Grieg and his wife.",
          "Conveniently, the Tourist Information Centre in Bergen had a tour where you could get the bus directly to the museum. Well worth the extra cost above the admittance as the tour guide was outstanding. You felt like you knew so much about the man and his music before you even",
          "This was part of Odysseys Unlimited Tour. The location was gorgeous and the house is beautiful. The little hut where Greig composed his music had breathtaking views. We were treated to a piano mini concert. The music and location was beyond words. The little cafe was great too.",
          "After visiting this museum, I bought some Grieg CDs, which is what at its best travel does for the soul. The estate is a ways outside of Bergen, but the tour through his home, the visitor's center, and the little composing studio on the water provides a great sense of his",
          "This is a place for people who like Peer Gynt and other Grieg masterpieces. The setting is very petty, no wonder he picked this place to build his home. It is not an easy place to get to on public transportation. DO NOT take the light rail as everyone in Bergen tourist office",
          "My friend and I when traveling seek out classical concerts. This did not disappoint. We had a package which included the bus from Bergen. Not knowing anything about Grieg, I found this tour very interesting as our guide shared many stories. The house is well preserved, and",
          "It was actually a rainy day, but that did not matter. As we arrived I could hear \"Wedding at Troldhaugen\" ringing in my memory. I do love Grieg's music, so perhaps i am biassed. The site is gorgeous. The performance was lovely. Best of all we had a tour of the museum led by a",
          "I was very satisfied with this visit. We bought tickets for the concert in Troldhaugen concert hall. Lunch concert lasts only 40 min, but with music I got wide knowledge about Edward Grieg talant",
          "This is the old home of Edvard Greig and his wife Nina. It is very well preserved and has some items of theirs inside. Also you can walk around the grounds and get great pics of the lake around it. The museum has some nice souvenirs but they aren't cheap, and there is also a",
          "Even without knowing much about Grieg before going to the museum, we enjoyed our time at Troldhaugen very much. The museum is small but comprehensive and the tour of the house was enjoyable and informative. The staff person at the reception desk gave us a delightful 5-minute",
          "The well-organized tour of Edvard and Nina Grieg\u2019s private home on Troldhaugen is a rewarding experience not only for Grieg fans. An insight into culture of Northern Europe 150 years ago. Very authentic and well preserved. The piano concert hall is unique and in perfect harmony",
          "We visited this museum as it was included as part of a cruise package we were on. Coach transport was included, which was good as it was a long way out of town. However the museum was interesting, although sadly we didn\u2019t have much time. We enjoyed what we saw & there are good",
          "The museum is a short taxi ride from downtown. The home was inteesting and there were many photos of the diminuative Grieg and his wife, along with some original, hand written scores. We enjoyed walking down to the edge of the fjord. There we found the Greig's grave carved",
          "We were able to enjoy a piano recital here before our guided tour of the residence. Wonderful just wonderful! The concert hall overlooking the place where Grieg got some of his inspiration was perfect! The hall itself is so very lovely! The tour afterwards was so informative",
          "Enjoyed a terrific piano recital in the gorgeous concert hall that looks out onto the water. Then a visit to Grieg\u2019s house, which is smaller than I had expected, but nonetheless quite attractive and well maintained. There is a fairly long walk from the parking lot to the center",
          "This tour was such a memorable experience, we will never forget it. We bought tickets in advance online and were glad we did as the bus was full. After a drive through Bergen, we arrived at a beautiful setting after a walk through the woods. The house is like a fairy tale",
          "Any music lover should not miss a visit to Troldhaugen, home of Edvard Grieg. We took the excursion offered from the tourist information office (book ahead) and it was a nice afternoon out. The concert of Grieg's music was a sublime highlight, the Villa charming, the setting",
          "Great combo with bus transportation, private house tour and then 30 minute concert by a very accomplished pianist who played Grieg's renown Peer Gynt, later works and one of his romantic serenades. Gorgeous day, setting, music hall and music! What a wonderful way to appreciate",
          "I perform in a symphony at home and am embarrassed to say that I have never been to a composer museum. So, Grieg's was my first experience, and I'm so glad it was! We took an English-speaking tour of the house's downstairs area, which was filled with photos, some manuscripts,",
          "We took the organised tour from the Tourist Information office situated near the Fish Market in Bergen centre. The total cost for transport there and back, entry with guide and lunchtime concert was around NOK 280 (\u00a325) per person. Worth paying for the hassle free factor. The",
          "Our Bergen tour guide/fellow Rotarian said we were going on a tour and a ONE HOUR CONCERT! It was a fabulous bus ride through the city of Bergen to Grieg Museum and concert hall. After touring Edvard Grieg's home, we were surprised to hear a renouned local pianist perform some",
          "Beautiful museum with all his compositions and records. Brief history of composer. Lovely house and garden. You can make a day out of it if you go on a day there are performances. Usually a Saturday afternoon half hour piano recital by an up and coming artist.",
          "Well worth the ten minute ride outside Bergen town centre. You see and walk around the composers lovely house, his tomb, overlooking the tranquil lake, and we even had a small piano concerto of some of his works. A small gift shop and cafe complete the visit.",
          "We visited Troldhaugen as part of a Gate 1 tour. Our bus had to park about 1/4 mile from the compound. The compound consists of a museum / cafe / gift shop, various out building, including the little garden building where he did most of his composing and his villa. The latter is",
          "Booked tickets at Bergen tourist information inc travel to Troldhaugen. Spectacular scenery and the lunchtime concert was refreshing. Lots of Grieg's piano pieces, but Sibelius opus 5 as an encore was wonderful! Even if you're not a classical music geek (and I am!), it's a",
          "a nice place to visit! nice museum but not something very very special! it is calm and cozy place!!!",
          "By far the most wonderful experience of our time in Norway was our visit to the Summer House of Edvard Grieg, where he composed much of his music. The Museum itself was full of interesting items connected with his life. Next door a small concert hall had been built and there",
          "A beautiful home in the city overlooking the water. This composer could pass as Albert Einstein or Samuel Clemons. Now you know what his profile looks like.",
          "If you are a Grieg fan, this is an absolute must. If you are a classical music fan but don't know much about Grieg, you still must go. And if you don't know a lot about classical music but would enjoy some history in an incredibly peaceful setting, I strongly encourage you to",
          "This is part of Bergen's Art Museum complex. It includes Grieg's home, converted into a museum which houses all the original furnishings, the isolated hut where purportedly Grieg composed his lovely music, the villa they used for relaxation and the graves of Edvard Grieg and his",
          "Worth a visit -- for a glimpse of life in 19th century Bergen but also for a glimpse into what inspired a talented composer.",
          "We were very lucky to be guided by Sophia whose English and expression were perfect. We enjoyed the piano concert and were very fortunate to visit on a sunny day to see the house and views at their best.",
          "Interesting house and grounds with a lunchtime piano recital. Not far out of Bergen but a scenic and well maintained location.",
          "We booked online for a tour and miscue performance as one of the highlights of our visit to Norway. A lovely good value tour with a pick up/return to the bus stop next to the Bergen Tourist Office. Lovely location, nice house museum and superb small modern concert hall built",
          "Knowing virtually nothing about classical music or Edvard Grieg in particular...it was still an enjoyable visit to his summer home. I was quite surprised to be told that he was only 4'9\" tall! That would explain the very small statue of him outside his concert hall in Bergen!",
          "Great stop. We were able watch a performance in the beautiful theater with the harbor in the background. Also, found the tour very interesting concerning the life and times of Grieg.",
          "This old home of classical Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg is worth the short drive out of Bergen to visit. Nestled along the water, there some nice views and a concert hall that offers two 30-minute piano concerts by a very talented pianist performing some of Grieg\u2019s best",
          "Pretty outdoor setting with a collection of artifacts and music by this \u201cNational Composer\u201d and his contemporaries. A short film is informative and his music is available for purchase in gift shop. Although there is a small cafe you can bring a picnic and enjoy the outdoor",
          "The house is about a five minute walk from the parking area. Nearby is a small museum and cafe with free toilets. The house is charming and filled with furniture and artefacts related to the composer. Outside are lovely views over the fjords. Definitely worth visiting if you",
          "Beautiful old house, in a beautiful setting with a small museum but the highlight has to be the 30 minute piano recital!",
          "Visiting the home and museum were great. The highlight was the lunchtime concert where artists play some of Grieg's music. These artists are very gifted and clearly enjoy playing music for the audience. The additional cost is quite small to include the concert.",
          "We booked a package at the tourist information centre in Bergen. This gives you coach travel to Troldhaugen from Bergen, a guided tour of the house and entry to the lunchtime piano recital which runs for 30 minutes. I was worried that the pianist might be some journeyman",
          "What a beautiful place, you can just imagine how inspiring it must have been to work here. The tour around the house in English was brilliant and very informative. Afterwards we wandered around the beautiful estate looking at his composing hut and where Greig and his wife were",
          "We had been to another music museum on our tour of Norway, it was sooo boring so we almost didn't come to the Grieg Museum. So glad we did. Although we weren't familiar with Edvard we found the tour of his house interesting, the setting lovely and the concert with the pianist",
          "We wanted to visit the Edvard Grieg house and museum while in Bergen but heard that it's not easy to get to. We were glad to see that we could purchase a package tour from the TI. The package included a bus ride to Troldhaugen, departing at 11:00 a.m. from the TI near Bergen's",
          "The bus tour package was first rate. The tour started at 1100 near the Bergen Tourist Information office where you got a sticker to wear. The bus ride to the site was 20M, the host providing some commentary on Grieg and pointing out other touristic matters along the way. After",
          "The concert Sunday evening in Trollhaugen was incredible. I have never in my life heard a better pianist, and I have heard many. Sound, artistry, technique and interpretation was just completely amazing by this norwegian-russian-asian woman. Cool mix. Interesting to experience",
          "We had a very interesting experience. We had a guided tour of the house and the grounds and we could walk down to the little house that Grieg wrote in overlooking the water. We were treated to a concert of his music in the small hall they had on the grounds. Be sure to sit on",
          "The tour started to the information centre, Bergen where we were met by a very lovely young guide. We drove by bus last Bergen conservatory . The house where Grieg spent his summer months is well worth the drive. The 45 minute concert by the pianist was awesome. This tour was",
          "Grieg chose well when he picked this location for his home. It\u2019s beautiful. But know this: it\u2019s a haul to get out there without a car or arranged tour on the bus. We got there on our own, taking the tram (about 20 min) then walking almost 30 minutes To get to the house.",
          "The visit was an organised trip by bus from the tourist office in Bergen, with an English speaking guide, who was very good. The house itself is an interesting period property, and the detail we were given inside added to the enjoyment. I certainly wouldn\u2019t put anyone off seeing",
          "We first did a tour of Edward Grieg\u2019s house. Then we walked around the beautiful grounds. This was followed by a concert of Grieg\u2019s music by a very talented pianist. Enjoyed our visit.",
          "Going to the Grieg Museum is a worthy excursion from Bergen city center. It's lovely to get outside Bergen and see the-well maintained home and gardens.",
          "Goosebumps abounded as I made my way up the wooded lakeside hill to summer residence and adjacentmhutnof the music immortal, Edward Grieg, in Bergen, Norway. Touring the site is as much about the love and emotion for Grieg as well as the beauty for the place. This is a no miss",
          "Took an arranged trip from the Tourist Information Centre to Edvard Grieg's house which included coach transport there and back, an English speaking guide, a guided tour of the house and an evening piano recital in the purpose built concert hall in the grounds. The guide was",
          "Our second visit to the Grieg Museum. Interesting tour that talks about his life and his music. Most days there are also concerts in the small concert hall.",
          "We took the trip from the Tourist Office which includes bus, house tour and lunchtime half hour piano concert. All excellent. We knew from a previous visit that it\u2019s a bit of a walk from public transport and we are now 10years older. So this worked well for us.",
          "Went to the museum and then to the Concert hall and had a short concert by a local pianist Jens Harald Bratlie and it was really very nice and very well done.",
          "We visited the Edvard Grieg Museum and home, where we were treated to an inspiring concert of Grieg's compositions. The concert hall overlooks the water and is close to the building in which Grieg wrote many of his compositions. The visit was both enlightening about Grieg and",
          "Interesting house, but good to have a guide to bring it to life. Concert hall beautiful, worth catching some live music there.",
          "While Grieg\u2019s house is worth a visit in its own right, it also boasts an amazingly beautiful setting. Take the tour arranged through the Information Centre, which includes the return bus, a guided tour of the house, and a spectacularly professional lunchtime concert of Grieg\u2019s",
          "Although the tour of the house was not terribly interesting, the 30-minute concert was lovely and made the trip a worthwhile excursion. The shuttle bus from the TI made it very easy to enjoy to enjoy a short concert and to learn about Grieg\u2019s sad life.",
          "This wonderfully managed home of composer Edvard Grieg is a must-visit in Bergen. The entrance building has an excellent overview exhibition of Grieg's life and work, along with a cafe and gift shop. Visit his cozy house and walk down to his composer's cabin next to the water. A",
          "We took the concert and tour with bus transport from the Information Center to Grieg's home outside of Bergen. One could easily get there by car. Set on the shores of a peaceful lake, he could find the solace he needed to create such beautiful music. A 30 minute piano concert of",
          "The Bergen Card made this museum and concert well worth it. I took the light rail to Hop then walked 15-20 minutes to Troldhaugen. The exhibition in the ticket/cafe building was very nice. The garden, writing cabin, gravesite and waterfront were all so beautiful. The house tour",
          "Finally made it to Edvard Grieg\u2019s place outside Bergen, Norway. I was disappointed that little more than one room is open for viewing in the house itself and we were rushed through to accommodate the crowds. Even so, the entire lakeside campus was beautiful especially on a warm",
          "You have probably heard Edvard Grieg\u2019s music but don\u2019t known who he is\u2014so come here to learn a bit about his life and see 3 rooms in his little house. At 1pm they have a 30 minute piano concert playing his music too that you can buy tickets for. Otherwise there is a movie",
          "It was annoying to have paid to see the house - the house is what most people want to see, after all - only to get to the house to find dozens of people outside, who were unable to get in because there was a recital going on to which we hadn't got access. Everyone had to wait",
          "We took the tour which included house tour, museum and concert. Wonderful couple of hours exploring Grieg\u2019s headland home with stunning views. The 30 min concert was beautiful. Easy 20 min bus ride from town. A highlight of our stay in Bergen.",
          "We visited Troldhaugen on a trip to Bergen. It was interesting to learn a bit about Edvard Grieg and see the area where he spent his summers. You can just imagine the composer working in his small shack while enjoying the peaceful serenity of Norway. The museum is well done.",
          "Grieg home at Troldhaugen was excellent. Didn\u2019t now anything about him...and was quite taken with what we learned. Really an inspiring individual, between overcoming personal physical challenges, and attempting to fulfill his own purpose in life. Made a major contribution to",
          "We were lucky to have been able to catch the lunch time piano concert today. We also took the 20 minutes English tour. A must see!",
          "Time your visit so you can attend a lunchtime recital. They take place every day. Behind the stage is a huge window with a magnificent view. Well worth it.",
          "The journey here from Bergen took about 20mins. The museum and cafe have been built in a discreet position, not very far from the house, which overlooks the lake. The tour of the ground floor of the house was most interesting, quite homely, and peaceful, and much of the",
          "This is a lovely place to visit, and you can see how the composer took his inspiration from working in his small cabin.The walk through the gardens down to the share is worth the effort",
          "What a beautiful tour - from Thomas greeting us on the sidewalk outside the Visitor Centre, his very knowledgeable talk, the little gem of a house with the amazingly concealed concert hall. The acoustics were excellent, the performance top notch, and the tour was very good",
          "This is very important to come to this museum with experienced guide. Our guide Ole from Vinol Tours was a big encyclopedia if to speak about Edward Grieg, his music and life story. Very important to buy the ticket that allows you to go to the lunch concert that is available",
          "I recently took the organised bus trip from the tourist information office to Troldhaugen and thoroughly enjoyed my couple of hours there. The tour guide who showed us around the house was friendly and informative and we learnt so much about Grieg, his life and his works. We",
          "We bought our tickets in advance at the Bergen Tourist Office. The bus left at 11 AM sharp for a 20 minute drive to the site. There is a 5 minute walk from the parking lot to the museum. There was a brief tour of the property and the Grieg homestead. We then went through the",
          "I visited this house by bus and participated in a tour, where we got to see a few rooms on the ground floor of the house. Know ahead of time that you have to take a short (5 minutes or so) walk through a wooded area to get from the bus parking lot to the house. It was lightly",
          "Fantastic place a few km outside Bergen. Located on the side of a fjord this is a lovely trip. There is a small museum, a caf\u00e9 and Grieg's house to visit. There is also a concert hall where there is a daily piano concert at 1pm. The concert we visited was exceptional.",
          "We visited the house and grounds which were all very nice. On a tour with Tauck and we had a private concert of Mr Grieg\u2019s music. Absolutely exceptional!!!! We came by bus. There was ample parking, but we did have a distance to walk from the bus parking. The concert was well",
          "Been here before but still a delight to visit the museum and enjoy the Grieg concert. The views are stunning, the location only a few kms away from Bergen city.",
          "During our stay in bergen, we visited the villa of Norwegian composer Edward Greig and it was a very pleasant experience. You can take day trips from bergen tourist office which includes the concert also or can go by yourself using the bergen light rail. The villa and composer's",
          "I went on a P & O cruise excursion to the Edvard Grieg villa and Museum which are both small but interesting. The concert was excellent with a beautiful view of the lake and Grieg's studio from the concert hall. If you are a fan of classical music you will love the excursion",
          "Visited the Troldhaugen, the Edvard Grieg Museum, as part of a Viking ocean cruise that was docked in Bergen, and I highly recommend it for music aficionados. Our private piano concert was wonderful, and the grounds were quite picturesque. Our guide, Torgen, provided us with a",

          "I enjoyed the visit to the Grieg museum and having the opportunity to understand more about the life of this composer. Looking toward the water as one sits in the concert hall to hear a recital provided a fitting, evocative setting for the music. The piano was played too hard",
          "Historical Summer cottage of Edvard Grieg and his wife rustic on the lake with gorgeous views of Bergen. Concerts throughout the year at Concert Hall and Museum. Worthwhile visit !",
          "No wonder Greig could write in this beautiful, serene setting. It was magical to visit this Summer house where the composer and his family escaped and entertained. Our guide was very knowledgeable and was very helpful. The only thing which would have made this tour better would",
          "What a tribute to a great man....!! He lived a simple life. Contributed to the humanity with his work of art. He is immortalized with his compositions. Life well told. Don't miss the museum where his music is played for you to quietly enjoy. Spend a few minutes there. The",
          "It was magical to attend a concert in the lounge of Grieg's home. I had 2 Japanese guests with me. In the autumn concerts are smaller and take place in the house instead of the concert hall I have been here many times but it was especially nice to see the house a d grounds",
          "Visited here and came out with lot of knowledge. It\u2019s museum but encyclopaedia on Edward Graig. U must visit here. I don\u2019t know how to express what felt being there. Wanna know bergen then it\u2019s must visit place.",
          "The actual house and cottage where edvard Grieg wrote music. The museum also tells the story of the Hardanger Fiddle. Very interesting instrument with a unique sound. Beautiful place to visit in summer.",
          "If you're a fan of classical music, this could be a cool little pilgrimage. If you're not, the views are ethereal in the winter. Basically there's something for everyone. This place was Grieg's summer house, basically. It is pretty cold in winter (the lake literally freezes",
          "Although a reasonable walk from the required bus stop, it is not out of reach for an average person. I enjoyed spending time in his home and wandering down to the lake where he had built a composing studio/hut. Gorgeous in winter and probably very pretty in summer.",
          "Throughly enjoyed the Grieg Museum and house and the views afforded from the composer's hut. We had a knowledgeable guide and were lucky that the sun did unusually shine basking the inlets in sunshine. The exhibition was informative and the film about Grieg's music stunning",
          "Edward Grieg is famous Norwegian composer. I was surprised that he had not only Norwegian but also Danish and Scottish roots. Villa gives facts about his life. This is possible to buy tickets for the lunch concert almost every day",

          "We bought our tickets at the tourist office in Bergen, so met the bus and guide right there. (We got a senior discount) There was a short walk to the house and concert hall in the rain from the bus, but it was beautiful and not difficult. The house that the Griegs built was",

          "Grieg is a renowned Norwegian composer. I really know nothing about classical music, but even I recognized some of his more famous pieces. Having said that, this is nothing more than a small old historic home in a pleasant garden setting. Unless you are a Grieg groupie, there",

          "We visited the Bergen Tourist Information Office, and one of the tours they offered was a tour & concert at Troldhaugen, the home of Edvard & Nina Grieg. My childhood was full of music by Grieg thanks to my mother, who loved the composer and ensured most of her piano students",
          "It's better plan 3 hours there that you can have enough time to immerse the whole surrounding( house, composer's hut, lake and his final resting place), plus enjoy a live concert without rushing. The house has many Grieg's personal photos and paintings on the wall, as well as",
          "This is a small museum and the tour is short. This was the home of the famous Norwegian composer Edward Grieg.. The highlight of my tour was my attendance at The International Piano Competition that was held while I was visiting.",
          "The museum is relatively small, and there are just a few rooms in the villa to see, and only one of those is furnished. The walks to the composing hut and grave are both steep and slippery if wet. I had googled info about this place before arriving, and it was helpful - there",
          "Loved it. Taken by bus on the 20 minute drive to the summer house. Beautiful and atmospheric with interesting tour of house, giving interesting details about Grieg, his wife and life; followed by 30 minute concert. We were told the hall was built to provide excellent acoustics",

          "We are not Edvard Grieg afficionados, although I knew his Per Gint work, but this was a welcome change to schlepping in and out of museums and shops. Our actual concert was in the Troldhaugen home of Grieg, due to the international piano contest, and the setting was so intimate",
          "We are on a tour and had a local guide for a city tour and also for this home/museum. Really nice to have someone give you the inside scoop on things you are seeing. I just loved the interior of the home, the curved staircase, wood ceiling and detailed crown molding, just",
          "My husband and I were part of a small group to tour the house of Edvard Grieg. He is so well known and it was insightful to visit his home and learn more about him and who were his contemporaries. The museum was also helpful in providing information about Grieg. There was a",
          "The tour was excellent and you got a real feel for the man and his music. You only see the downstairs of the house but it was very interesting. The grounds are wonderful to walk around even on a damp rainy day. The walk down to the lake is a little steep but worth the effort.",
          "Loved visiting this place though it was pouring with rain and it is not all indoors The concert was fab and the tour of the house really interesting.",
          "Did the tour from city center that includes bus transportation, guided tour of the house and a piano concert by a music professor. The guide was informative, the concert was excellent. From the concert hall, you have a view on the fjord, very scenic!!",
          "We had visited BERGEN 3 YEARS ago and had done The mountain walk and covered The city and wanted something different. We booked online ahead of our cruise and paid for The tour and concert direct via this trip advisor suggestion. We were not dissapointed. We were dropped off",
          "We loved visiting the house where Grieg lived and seeing the studio where he composed many of his works. The house is lovingly furnished and seems almost as if he just left today to go for a walk. The guided tour included lots of personal stories which added to the enjoyment.",
          "If you are not a classical music nerd, this place is unlikely to interest you. If you are one of us, well...this place is much nicer than most of the famous composer must-do tourist spots that you visit around the world. Museum was quick and interesting. His house and views are",
          "Visited the place on a gloomy day but the house of Edvard Grieg, which serves as an important part of the museum, is nice as it takes you back into Grieg\u2019s time. The view (photo) is still great and it is no wonder that beautiful pieces of music were composed here. It is",
          "I am far from a great music expert but do appreciate the talent it takes to excel in any form or aspect of music...Edvard Grieg was a true music master and led an interesting life in a beautiful city. His home site museum is a fitting tribute to his contributions. This is",
          "I booked a visit to the museum as part of an excursion on a recent cruise. At first, this was just to fill some time in a city I was not familiar with. However, it turned out to be quite fascinating. You have almost certainly heard Edvard Grieg's work whether you realize it or",
          "Top-notch museum. Lots of interesting artifacts presented in a professional manner. We really enjoyed the lunchtime concert as well!",
          "If you want to get there, take the Light Rail tram from Byparken (near the octagonal lake) and get off at the Hop stop, it takes around 25 minutes. Then, you have to walk for 25 minutes following the clear signposts. The visit is interesting: at the Welcome Centre where you buy",
          "An in depth experience regarding the home, life, and family of Edvard Greig. This will not only give you a sense of his environment but also a window into his creativity. Very worthwhile for Greig enthusiasts.",

          "My parents loved Grieg\u2019s Peer Gynt Suite so I couldn\u2019t resist going to this museum which is the composer\u2019s summer house. As you would expect, it has original furnishings when the composer and his wife lived there. A great little gift shop where you can buy little souvenir",
          "We had a guided tour of Edward Grieg\u2019s summer house. Excellent display and exhibition. The lunch time piano recital at the concert hall was excellent. Just piano pieces from Grieg. Worth the visit",
          "Every Classical music buff should visit here, if in Bergen! My (non-musical) husband even loved it. Grieg\u2019s home is in magnificent condition, the artefacts and paintings are excellent. We gained great insight into Edvard Grieg, with one of the highlights being a young pianist",
          "Troldhaugen is a combination museum, historic site (Grieg's summer home and composer's hut), and concert hall. It also has a nice little cafe. It was fascinating to see the views of nature that helped to inspire Grieg. The museum is small, but jam-packed with information",
          "The Museum was enchanting and full of atmosphere.The Guides were very informative and created a picture for us of Edvard Grieg's life. We then had a piano recital in the new concert hall next to the museum.A Professor from Bergan University not only gave a wonderful selection",
          "The house and hut are interesting and it\u2019s great to see the view that inspired the composer. There is a small museum & gift shop as you arrive which are interesting, particularly if you\u2019re not very familiar with Griegs personal background. The highlight for me though was the",
          "The museum itself was good and well done. You could visit his house and the hut next to the lake where he created his music. The real amazement was the concert hall where you have a modern pianist playing some of his pieces. It lasts for 30 mins and is breathtakingly beautiful...",
          "Very interesting to see how the Griegs lived. House and grounds well maintained and interesting tour.",
          "If you follow the music of Grieg then a visit to his home where he composed is a must. There is the main home and the composing hut. There is also a very steep path where he is buried with his wife who was his cousin. The house has beautiful views down by the water. The statue",
          "We loved this 1/2 day trip to the Grieg museum. Our guide Alejandro was knowledgeable and fun. The highlight was a performance of Grieg's music in a small chamber music concert hall on the property. The glass wall in back of the stage provided a view and great light. The",
          "We visited the home of Edvard Grieg on a visit to Bergen in May. The house museum was quite charming. We were surprised to learn that everything in the house is original including the piano in the living room that was used by Grieg. A highlight of the visit was a concert",

          "I am not a big classical music fan but this was an interesting place to go. Set back in the woods by a charming lake with plenty of opportunities for photo ops. I love any kind of history and this included a museum, his home, burial site, and workshop where he composed. Worth",
          "The museum tells of Grieg's life. It was very interesting. Entry fee includes the museum, the house and grounds. There are sometimes short concerts in the concert hall too. The house and grounds are stunning. Well worth a visit.",
          "The Edvard Grieg Museum is not very large. You will admire some personal items, piano, furniture, piano, bed. Near the ticket sale point there is an exhibition with many information about the composer's life and activity. If you descend a little below, you will find your",
          "This tour was well-led by a personable guide. The grounds and Grieg's home and composing studio were interesting and well-preserved. The highlight was the mid-day recital by a pianist who was simply extraordinary in her mastery of Grieg's most popular works. A bargain if only",
          "This really should be a wonderful experience, but they just aren\u2019t prepared for tourism crowds. We bought tickets in advance for the bus, tour, and concert. The bus was 100% packed full, so many people could not sit with their travel partner. Warning #1, get on the bus early",
          "This was part museum displays, part garden and part house visit. The scenery was delightful, information was presented in an engaging manner, and staff were knowledgeable. Very good value for money. For an extra cost you can attend a live recital as well. Easy access from",
          "What a lovely visit we had to Grieg\u2019s house today. My two teenage children and myself got a real feel for the atmosphere Grieg lived in. The concert was an absolute pleasure. I loved that the pianist took risks - particularly with the transcription of the Hall of the Mountain",
          "Such pianoplaying I have never heard before. I got tears and happiness in my Soul of this lunch Concert. Grieg in all colors, and the full hall was absolutely stunned. The Woman on the piano was Fantastic! Thanks Troldhaugen. I will be back. Netherlands do not have such piano",
          "A lovely well organised guided visit to Troldhaugen. We enjoyed a splendid lunchtime concert in the beautiful setting of Troldhaugen. Left Bergen at 11.30 and was back by 14.30 a lovely way to spend a few hours.",
          "Went as part of a cruise tour , our tour guy was an arrogant German student , awho thought any questions were funny , he knew almost nothing and was as useful as a chocolate tea pot . The flow of visitors through the house was like a sausage factory production line , no time to",
          "The thing that made this otherwise, just pleasant, museum, was that our Tauck group was treated to a concert for 30 minutes of several pieces of Grieg's music, by a renowned pianist. The concert hall and view we're also amazing.",
          "Highly recommend a tour for insight into Grieg\u2018s life and the history of the house. Our tour guide was engaging and interesting - he brought Grieg\u2018s passion to life. In the summer they have concerts at 1pm- reserve before you go to avoid disappointment. One look at the",
          "It would be worth the visit to Troldhaugen even if you know nothing about Grieg. You will learn about his life and listen to some of his music. The setting is beautiful: the house and his composing hut both enjoy stunning views of the water. The garden has nice flowers. The",

          "A very popular spot to visit while in Bergen. You can get there from the town center by using their light rail and walking 15-20 minutes. We really enjoyed the vistas from his home and they would have been better only if it had been more sunny. The home shows many of Grieg\u2019s",
          "We were there during his 175th birthday celebration, so they had a 30hr marathon of musicians playing his works. Very nice location, with a beautiful view over the archipelago. Grieg did alright for himself!",
          "We booked the morning tour and concert. Visited the house, but it was raining so we ate lunch instead of walking around the gardens. The Concert was one hour and all Grieg music. Much fun.",
          "Worth the visit and the time. The visit to the house can be hard to get into as the entrance is small and some of the tourists are slow to move through the rooms. Interesting look into Grieg's life. Museum was small but fascinating. There is also a small gift shop. Walking",
          "I've always liked Grieg's music. I'm not a huge classical music fan, but I like some things in general, and some for a reason. My original reason for liking Grieg was the Peer Gynt Suite. It just seems to be the ideal music to evoke thoughts of Norway. The Museum here is nice",
          "We went to the museum and Edvard Grieg's home near Bergen, which was interesting, but probably of interest to music lovers. It is in a very scenic location overlooking the water. The highlight of our tour was a 30 minute piano concert by a local pianist playing a variety of",
          "One of the Highlights of our stay \u2013 we booked on the Edvard Grieg Museum organized tour from Bergen and following a short 25 minute bus ride, were introduced to the world of Edvard Grieg. The location of his house which he built and lived in till the end of his life is",
          "Piano concert was the most interesting part of this tour. Only 35 min. When we were there too many visitors came from the cruise ship. Were happy in any case, concert compensated all",
          "Buying the Bergen Cards is a really good idea not only does it give you discounts at museums it gives you use of public transport. The Grieg Museum is a light rail journey and a short walk up the hill to the site. The short tour of the house was helped by a good guide telling us",
          "We had expected a guided tour but for some reason it had been cancelled but we were able to wander around on our own. The house is small so they limit the number of people in the house at any time so we had to wander around the grounds. We visited the museum and the gift shop",
          "The Tourist Information Center sells tickets for an 11:00 am tour and it is well worth it. You get a mini-tour of the city on your ride to the museum. The concert was the highlight - beautiful location and gorgeous sound.",
          "We took the all inclusive Sunday evening bus drive from the town, house tour and concert. It was excellent, well guided and well presented. The concert was stunning. The only slight criticism is that after the house tour and seeing the composer's hut and tomb, we would have",

          "We were on guided bus tour from Bergen Centre. This is the best way to visit the Troldhaugen; transport to the place, guided tour and a short concert in the Troldsalen concert house. I liked the whole package.",
          "I'm a fan of Grieg's work so I took an expensive taxi to his home. They've done a great job preserving his quaint house and there's a museum exhibition cum restaurant there. Very helpful and nice. What was simply outstanding was the 30 min piano recital ar 1 pm. The pianist",
          "We did the lunch time concert and museum tour that leaves from the tourist info center in Bergen. (One could take the tram out there and walk a little bit vs. the tour that takes you directly to Troldhaugen.) Lovely location. The house has many interesting items, the tour guide",
          "It was because of hearing the Peer Gynt Suite 58 years ago in school that my imagination went to the place of the trolls. I retained the wish to go to Norway all those years. Of course I had to pay homage to this man who lit up my imagination! Even though it's far from Bergen,",
          "The home of Norway's most famous composer and his wife. Troldhaugen consists of his private home, the little cabin where he composed, the couple's tomb, as well as a modern museum building and the concert hall Troldsalen. A wonderful and romantic place.",

          "We were fortunate to be on a Hurtigruten trip that included not only a visit to the museum but a short piano recital as well. If you are a music lover, this is a must visit. You will hear many references to Grieg before you leave Norway.",
          "We did the standard tour from the bergen tourist office, so with coach transfer included. All worked extremely well, with an informative guide who gave background during the trip to the museum and then led the tour of the house. The concert hall has excellent acoustics and I'd",

          "Lovely lakeside setting. Getting a concert of Grieg's music in this summer home is a wonderful experience. You can see his composing cottage and some of the influences of nature on his music. Our short tour included a concert. Doesn't take long to see \"everything.\" Well worth",
          "If you have the time take a short trip out to Edvard Grieg's home. Such a beautiful location and if you come at the right time you can hear the piano recital of his music. If the weather is nice take a picnic. There are some beautiful places to sit, enjoy the scenery and",

          "We tour the tour which takes us by bus to the museum, visit of the house, concert then back by bus. I just found that if you are not in love with the guy, it is a bit boring. The guide was hard to hear as she did not wait that everyone was in the room before starting her talk.",
          "Good, short noon hour concert. Grieg\u2019s house is interesting but essentially three rooms. The guides at the house are earnest. His grounds are pleasant regardless of any knowledge of Grieg. The museum is good and informative. The concert hall is lovely and the concert",

          "Grieg's house is in such a beautiful location and although the tour of the house is with a guide you are free to explore the gardens on your own. We also wandered through the house on our own for another look after the guided tour. The lunchtime concert was fantastic,the",
          "Great place to visit. Not only do you get a chance to visit Edvard Grieg villa outside of Bergen, but at 1PM there is a concert available where selected works are presented by the rotational pianists. We booked it in conjunction with the transport (250NOK/person) which we",
          "A pleasant way to get out of the city, see Grieg's very interesting house, and have a min-concert on the piano. It's a lovely setting and seeing how the water looks from his studio, gives some insight into his artistic process. Not overwhelming, but very nice.",
          "There was a moment when I thought I was going to regret signing up for the tour to see the house where the composer Edvard Grieg lived and worked. We were part of a straggling group on a day of relentless rain. I didn\u2019t have a hat or an umbrella and Grieg\u2019s house was a",
          "The museum and its modern part is a nice intro to the villa and its surroundings. Lot of artifacts that will please visitors from many countries as the composer was a true international, promoting extensively his music outside Norway. The villa is still original, so you'll get",
          "Do you like Grieg? Yes or no, you will like the villa where he composed an considerable part of his works. Have lunch in the cafeteria, and enjoy the daily lunch time concert. - If you are in Bergen and not a great walker, the best thing is to take the special bus from the",
          "Not an absolute must. But if you have a couple of hours to spare, or if it rains ( it was the case for us ) it is worth the price. The view of the countryside near Bergen is great, and they have a small concert that we liked very much.",
          "We arrived at this place by accident during an afternoon walk. We paid, and were told that there would be a guided tour of the house in around 10 minutes and we would be told when to go through to the house. We started to watch a video of Norway accompanied by Greig's music",
          "The story of Bergen is the story of Edvard Grieg. For music lovers a visit to his home is a must. Located on the top of the hill, overlooking the sea, this is the place where Grieg composed most of his music. If you can, plan your visit around the time of concerts held in a",
          "Admittedly I had not heard of this museum but it was included in a group bus tour and I really enjoyed hearing the history of this musician. Quite an interesting house and the concert hall is impressive.",
          "A very nice home. Somewhat off the beaten path-took a lot of walking to get here. The grounds are nicely kept. The house looks like he and his wife just left.",
          "Troldhaugen is a the beautiful home to the great pianist Edvard Grieg. He wrote most of his piano music here in the summer months and traveled around the world giving concerts during the winter months. His home is now a fascinating museum. It is small and only about 15-20",
          "Grieg Museum Troldhaugen is the villa of Norway's most famous composer and wife. Edvard Grieg came from an affluent family, and reached commercial success quite early in his life (20s), so their living conditions were not of a struggling artist. The red hut on the property was",
          "In August 2017 we had an unforgettable 3-week trip in Norway. Today, four months later, our memories of countless waterfalls and breathtaking views begin to fade, but we remember the day we visited the Grieg Museum as it was yesterday. We thoroughly enjoyed the small concert",
          "We caught a bus from the fish market at 11:00 and went in with a group. The guide told us to split into 2 groups of about 20 each. Some folks were impatient, and we had about 30 in the first group, and 10 in the second group. Be patient. There's not a lot of room to move, and in",
          "This part of the Grieg family is the history music part. The Grieg-museum is situated a few minutes walk from my residence. So I somethimes walk there together with my visitors. PS! I also are connected to other parts of the Grieg-family.",
          "When Tripadviser ask whether a visit to the home of the Grieg family is \"exciting or dangerous\" then I suppose the answer is 'Yes' - in that seeing the scenery which inspired Norway's greatest composer is exciting, and listening to a recital of his music can put you in jeopardy",
          "So beautiful site there all the horizon view surrounded this place. Its awesome. Historie alone WOW.",
          "A very beautiful house in a fairytale garden. No wonder Edvard and Nina wanted to be buried here. There is a concerthall with a wonderful view in the garden to the composerhut of the great man. If you visit his house you will realise in the living room with the steinway piano",
          "There was a walk from the bus parking bays to the museum but is was worth the small effort required. The museum had much information about Grieg and one room has a video of various places in Norway showing with a background of Grieg's music. With a visit.",
          "The grounds and views are beautiful here. Great gift shop, awesome informative tour, and FANTASTIC piano concert.",
          "With limited time in Bergen I decided to give priority to a trip to the Grieg Museum at Troldhaugen and was not disappointed. There were guided tours of the villa, which has some interesting pictures (eg, Grieg standing next to the burly Nobel laureate Bjornson), furniture and",
          "We visited on a weekday morning - IMPORTANT - during the quiet months, Grieg's house doesn't open until 1200, even though the museum opens at 1000. The museum is small, and takes 30 minutes, so don't go too early! We took the light rail network to Hop (20 minutes from central",
          "The best way to get here is by bus to the lunchtime concert, but I was here too late in the season. It is perhaps a 30 minute walk gently uphill from the light rail stop. With good instructions from the TI and a guidebook recommendation to follow the road signs to Troldhaugen,",
          "This trip by bus or private car, a half hour or so from Bergen, is worth doing, to see the wooden house and lake where Grieg lived, worked and threw parties. There is little evidence of the music per se, but the tour offers a half hour piano recital of Grieg's work",
          "Do not miss this site. My friend and I took the day tour through the Information Office. This was definitely a good choice. The tour provided bus transportation, an excellent guide, and a wonderful mid-day recital in the lovely hall overlooking the lake and woods. Being a",
          "Getting there is half the \"fun\". We took the light-rail from Bergen and got off at Hop. No signage anywhere - had to ask a lovely woman walking her dog (who, of course, spoke English - the woman, not the dog - although, I'd believe a Norwegian dog could speak English). Cross the",
          "The location alone is worth the trip. His house sits on a lake, & I think I could write music in a setting like this! There's a small museum, his house, his \"writing\" shed, & a walk down to the water, where his wife & his urns are set into the granite (?) wall. There's no tomb,",
          "My lord what a magic place and not from this world. Coming here was so unbelievable i hardly find words to describe it. We arrived from the water with a boat and alone the view up to the house was a dream. You walk than along the little house where Grieg the composer got his",
          "Well, if you are into Edward Grieg this is a must on your list when visiting Bergen. There are busses but we took a taxi to the place, situated about a15 min. drive from the city sentre. Located in a picturesc forrest surrounding you can see the place Grieg used to live and",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed visiting this charming home by the fjord where Grieg lived and worked for many years. The setting is beautiful and despite the rain we walked around and took time to enjoy the natural setting. During the summer there are concerts of Grieg's music in the",
          "Absolutely stunning!!! Most beautiful and tranquil place!!! Even out of season, the house is open, for visit. There is an amazing walk inside the house with a very lovely and most knowledgeable guide, a lady called Marion. After the house visit, you have the chance to wander",
          "Troldhaugen is a stunning location on a fjord and is worth visiting. However, the Grieg exhibition was basic, and if you missed the tour of his house, there would be little point in visiting. I saw everything within 45 minutes, and it took me that long to get there from Bergen",
          "This tour is best taken on a sunny - or at least not rainy - day. There is a lot of hiking around, from the house to the lakeside studio, back up to the concert hall and down to Grieg's grave. On a rainy day, the uneven, leaf covered stone steps are treacherous. The Grieg",
          "The tour started with a visit to Grieg's home; the family momentos, photos, and furnishings all help to make Norway's famous composer come to life. A concert in the small but intimate on-property concert hall was a highlight. Such a gifted pianist! Marina Van Selvik",
          "A very nice museum on a nice parcel of land. Educational enough, don't need to spend too much time here an hour or less and you should be able to take it all in.",
          "Lots to see and do here. The old house is super and worth the walk down to the 'cabin' and graves. We had a piano concert that was fantastic, and a lovely little gift shop",
          "I suppose if you are into classical music it may be on your to-do list, We stopped to kill some time before our ferry to Denmark. It was just ok",
          "I enjoyed the visit as it was away from the city center in a lovely neighborhood overlooking a fiord. By the time we visited this I had been in too many museums so I was not as attentive as I should have been. Not a must see for me.",
          "Very much enjoyed this visit. I'd recommend the guided tour of the summer home. The guide provided many details of Grieg's life, his character, his music and the influence of his wife. I learned many interesting things. The home contained several period pieces and is very well",
          "Joined an optional tour to the home if Edward Grieg a very famous composer ( Piano Concerto in A minor). The house is with his preserved composition sheets and the lake is awesome! I could live there!!!",
          "We signed up at the visitors' center downtown for a tour to the house and museum, and a concert. I don't remember the price, but I do recall it was quite modest. The bus took us to within a five-minute walk to the house, where a guide took over and narrated a tour of the ground",
          "First, I have heard that people who took a guided tour bus that got them there, were very happy and found it very interesting. I didn't do that, and even worse, I miss-timed it so I didn't get to enjoy the lunchtime concert either. In hindsight, I should have passed on this.",
          "Group tours to this place are disappointing because the rooms are small and with so many people it is difficult to hear the guide. Better to go solo and time your entry when there are no groups.. The grounds are very steep so lots of steps. The modern concert hall has excellent",
          "The house shows how loved this home was and how wonderful to see a paranormal played by the maestro himself. Walk down to the lake to view his favourite areas and burial place. Do not miss a chance to enjoy a piano recital in the small concert hall overlooking the lake and place",
          "We called here on our way towards the airport on our last day and found the experience very pleasant. The highlight was a piano recital in the beautiful concert hall. So relaxing and enchanting",
          "We were intrigued by Edvard Greig, a classical composer influenced by Norwegian folk music. Our tour which we arranged through the Bergen Tourist Information (TI) included return transportation from downtown Bergen to his home, the tour of the home and a 1/2 hour musical",
          "This was one of the best days of touring I've spent anywhere. A live piano concert with a fjord view; peace, quiet, beauty. Highly recommended.",
          "It was quite busy on the day we were there (4 cruise ships in Bergen) so things took a little time. The house where he and his wife lived was interesting, with furnishings being original (I'm sure some of the photos were added later). We were only able to visit downstairs rooms",
          "We visited on a tour from our cruise ship. We would have preferred to go privately as it would have been cheaper with less time constraints, but we could not attend a concert that way. Guess you really have to be into Greg's music to get the most out of it - we are. Troldhaugen",
          "Grieg and Bergen (and Norway, as a matter of fact) are strongly connected, so going to this museum is quite evident. Getting there by public transport instead of the express bus is possible: take the tram (bybanen) and get out at the stop with the peculiar name 'Hop'. From",
          "Really great trip from Bergen city centre - tickets from Tourist Office but it books up fast. Highlight is a short piano recital of Greig's music in a concert hall which shares the same view as Grieg's composing hut. Before the concert, knowledgable guides show you round Grieg's",
          "It is a bit of trip out on public transport but it is a really sweet musem to Grieg's memory. You can only go in to the rooms downstairs. The lunchtime concert was very good too and looks out to the hut where Grieg composed a lot of his work. Unless you are a big Grieg fan it is",
          "A nice ride out on the tram from the city center. Reasonable fee to enter ($25.00 for two adults). Beautiful views everywhere. The house is small, and will be very crowded with the tour groups.they allow in at one time. Make the trek down the hill to where Grieg is buried. The",
          "We were on a tour to Grieg's home and had a lovely concert of his music. This venue is just stunning! We had champagne and local Norwegian strawberries (the BEST I have ever tasted) before the concert. The stage looks over Grieg's workshop and the lovely lake. Just a magical",
          "We found we had unplanned time in Bergen and the weather was sunny and warm, so we decided to go to the Grieg museum. We were so glad we did as the setting is so beautiful. We decided to take local transportation (the tram), not just to save money but so we could spend the",
          "We took a tour to Grieg's home, one of the only ways to assure a ticket to the concert there, and were thrilled by the site and the music.",
          "Booked this tour from the UK and it all went very smoothly. Met guide outside the tourist office to get the bus to the museum. Once we arrived (after about 25 mins) we had a quick guided tour of the house before being able to explore a bit on my own before the piano concert.",
          "We decided to take this tour after listening to the music of Edvard Grieg as we planned our trip to Bergen, Norway. His home is very interesting but the highlight for us was the noon hour concert set in a concert hall which was built in his memory and which overlooks a beautiful",
          "This is a great tour. We had a fabulous guide, Alexandro, a musicologist and opera singer, who enlightened us on Grieg throughout the 20 minute bus ride to Troldhaugen. There we took in the magnificent surroundings and learnt more about Grieg and his home. We visited the grave",
          "Via a bus at the Tourist office (at the pier), in less than twenty minutes, one is five miles south at Grieg's house. The house, overloooking a lake, is now in a suburban setting, but one has an idea of the countryside and tranquility he sought for composing. There is a short",
          "Good overview of Edvard Grieg and his career. You can visit house and peer into small cabin where he composed. House is interesting and walk to the water is pleasant. Be sure to ask specifically about his tomb where he and his wife are buried. It can easily be missed.",
          "Visited this on an organised tour from the ship Queen Elizabeth. I was a beautiful day of sun and music. The piano recital lasted just over 30 mins and gave a good selection of Grieg's music. The recital hall is built into the hill and the view from inside out was breathtaking.",
          "We visited with 3 children and went out on the tram on our own. It was wonderful - the staff had loads of time for us and fascinating insights into Greig and his life and music. We are not experts but it was very accessible. The staff are all musicians. We loved the lunchtime",
          "This is very nice place to visit. Norway's musical history as personified by Edvard Grieg is very claasy and elegant.",
          "Tour the beautiful home of composer Edward Grieg that overlooks the lake and visit Edvard's 'composer hut' were some of his most beautiful music was created. There's a gorgeous small concert hall. If you are lucky you can hear a short (about 30min) concert by one of talented",
          "We took the bus trip from the Tourist Info Center by the wharf for the journey of about 30-40 minutes to Grieg's home and museum. The excellent guide gave us commentary along the way and an introduction to Grieg's life and career. From the bus parking lot it is a 15-minute",
          "The excursion to Troldhaugen was very worthwhile. We took the organised tour from the Tourist Information Office by the Fish Market because the site is hard to reach by public transport (our usual preference). This worked well as the guide's introduction to Grieg and his family",
          "Grieg' home is as he left it. The original furnishings are there. A special,stained glass of a rose in honor of his wife. Tiny house but on a beautiful spot of land on a lake. There is also a small cabin where he would do much of his composing. Be sure to go when there us a",
          "When in Bergen, you must go over to The Edvard Grieg house (Troldhaugen). Grieg is Norway's most famous composer and to see the house and his studio is a pure joy. And if possible, make your visit on a day when there is a concert in the concert hall. You will be totally glad",
          "Brief tour of the house museum with the evening concert. Good guides. Definitely worth the trip. Enjoy.",
          "Be sure to schedule a Grieg concert during your Bergen tour. The music had wonderful variety and was performed flawlessly.",
          "For convenience, I took the organised bus from the Visitors Centre. A guided tours of Greig's gorgeous summer house, and plenty of time to wander down to his tiny studio and the burial place of Grieg and his wife. A half hour piano recital followed.",
          "The concert hall on Troldhaugen gives you the opportunity to listen to Edvard Griegs music right next to where it was composed. Troldhaugen, the home Nina and Edvard Grieg built for themselves when in Norway in the summers, is a beautiful museum in beautiful grounds. If you",
          "Be sure to arrive in time for the 1 PM piano concert. The grounds & buildings are nice but the Grieg piano concert was amazing and made the visit worthwhile. We took a cab there & then the light rail back to Bergen. Just a warning--finding the Light Rail station was more",
          "Edvard Grieg's house is worthy of a music lover's pilgrimage; it's in Troldhaugen, a half hour bus ride from Bergen, and while you can get there by train, you then have to walk a ways from the train station. I took a bus tour which I booked at the Bergen Tourist Info. office &",
          "Well worth a trip out to the house and museum, especially for the sweet details about Grieg and his wife. During our tour of the house, one of the docents played the piano in the living room, but the real highlight was a recital in the concert hall from a recent winner of the",
          "We toured Edvard Grieg home which has been made into a museum... The grounds and the manor were beautiful. Just the walk up to the manor was so enjoyable. We were a part of our Tour Group and were treated to a private piano performance by a very talented young man. The",
          "The house and working hut are very nicely preserved and presented. You have a nice short walk up from the parking where you can enter a small exibition hall with some photo's paintings and copies of original manuscripts about Edvard Grieg and his family. From there you can",
          "The Grieg piano concert is in a new concert hall built on the grounds of the Grieg historic home, which can be toured before or after the show. Nice views from both the concert hall and the writing hut, down by the water. The visitor center museum is marginally interesting, with",
          "We were lucky to have booked this on a beautiful day. The tour itself is only medium-interesting but the setting is lovely and we also got to hear a brief concert in the new concert hall which was fun",
          "Imagine being invited into the intimate setting of Norway's foremost composer! Troll Hill is the home that Nina and Edvard inhabited for the last 22 years of Grieg's life. It is a magnificent setting: a Victorian home with Grieg's own Steinway in the parlor and most of the",

          "The museum and museum grounds are lovely and definitely worth visiting. Guides are knowledgable and helpful. Everyday they have a 30 minute piano concert at 1 pm. Don't miss it. The concert hall view alone is worth it - huge picture window looking down on the hut where",
          "An very interesting place to visit. The excellent guide began already on the bus to Troldhaugen, (leaves at 4.30 p.m. on Sundays next to the Tourist Information Centre) continued around Grieg's home, now a museum and then we had a short time to wander around the grounds before",
          "The tour of the house is interesting, but overcrowded. The property is quite beautiful. But what makes the visit very special is the noon-time piano recital in the concert hall overlooking the fjord. Make sure you book a tour which includes the recital!!!",
          "The tour of Grieg's house was interesting, but the best was the short concert in the handsome concert hall of some of Grieg's music",
          "A visit to our Composer Edvard Griegs home is a must for any Norwegian who visits Bergen. Others would shurely like it too - this peaseful and Nice Place in the Part of Bergen which is named Paradis (Paradise).",
          "We took the tour of Troldhaugen Edvard Grieg's summer villa, museum, and lunchtime concert with transport from the Bergen Tourist Information Center. The tour leaves the info center at 11 am, and returns back on the same spot at about 2:30 pm. Tickets can be bought anytime at",
          "Provided that you have a keen interest in Norwegian music, this may be of interest to you. Other than the views, there was not that much interest for us.",
          "A beautiful home in a gorgeous natural setting. The water and forest views were priceless. The concert was alos great.",
          "Our tour out to Troldhaugen was a nice ride through the suburbs of Bergen and then a great tour of the grounds and buildings guided by music students who are a part of the college. They have a snackbar for lunch there, and then we had a concerrt. Some of Grieg's lesser known",
          "Inspiring musical experience, seeing the spot where Grieg's inspiration came from and listening to live piano performances of his music in the theatre overlooking the lake",
          "Greig's House is in an idyllic spot, overlooking lakes and forests. His hut in the garden where he did his composing, commands breath-taking views and it is not difficult to see where his inspiration came from. A superb concert hall has been built and 45 minute piano recitals",
          "A lovely spot to visit outside Bergen. The house reflects the musician's taste and life, but also gives a glimpse into Norwegian life. The location is spectacular. I was surprised that the place --neither the museum shop and cafeteria, not the house itself that stands",
          "Our cruise ship stopped for the day in Bergen where we took a ships' tour out to the former residence of composer Edvard Grieg. We drove through Bergen to the suburbs where the home is situated near the Nordasvannet. Grieg composed many of his most famous works here and is",
          "We went on a tour and then stayed for the piano recital given by a Professor from the Conservatorium who was dressed in traditional costume and had a passion about her which made it a really special event. Fantastic views of Griegs composition house while you listen to the music!",
          "I took the tour from the visitor center including bus, guided tour, and concert. I suggest booking in advance as our tour was full (50) and there is only 1 trip each day. The guide was interesting and knowledgeable--a university music student. The house tour is about 30 minutes,",
          "The tour package for the Edvard Grieg Museum in Troldhaugen, included bus tickets to & from the museum. The bus conveniently leaves from the Tourist Information Office (near the Fish Market in the central area of Bergen). The tour, including the bus trip, is for 3 hours. The",
          "Norway is an expensive country but this trip is worth every penny. You get transport, a trip round Grieg's house and a near 2 hour concert from a world class pianist with a fantastic view of the fjord and Grieg's shed for composing. Do this trip!",
          "We visited this museum as part of our Bergen tour in the company of a local guide. Our visit was exceptional in every respect and was capped with a lovely piano concert of Grieg compositions. The setting by the lake is spectacular also. This stop will be a highlight of our trip.",
          "My wife and I visited Grieg's house and museum and were blown away by the beautiful environment that contributed to some of the most beautiful music ever written. In Grieg's house everything is as it was when he lived there, so it's a living museum. Paintings of contemporary",
          "I've always wanted to visit Troldhaugen but never had the opportunity until last week. I was not disappointed, indeed the visit exceeded my expectations. Grieg' house is atmospheric with much information on the composer and some interesting hints as to his likes and dislikes. To",
          "I accompanied my mother on this trip and didn't really know much about Grieg but wow was brilliant from the lovely bus ride, the museum, the house, the grounds and then the lunchtime concert was just wonderful. I loved walking down through the trails and exploring the property.",
          "We loved our visit here! Grieg's property is charming but the highlight - the lunchtime concert in the concert hall. Just amazing. The winner of the 2014 Grieg Piano Competition playing Grieg on a Steinway! GO!!!!",
          "It is a great chance to visit the site where a great composer found the inspiration to compose some of the classics in music. While there we heard a renowned musician play some selections from his works. A beautiful venue overlooking the bay in Bergen.",
          "A nice cultural breakaway from Bergen. Make sure to take in the 30 minute mid day concert. We did not go through the travel bureau to do this. Since we were traveling in the very busy summer season we decided to try to skip the communal transportation and took a taxi to and",
          "Highly recommend the lunchtime concert! We didn't want to do a tour group and just rode the metro in from city center and got off at \"Hop\" stop. From there, there are easy directions to get to this place. It's about a 20-30min walk. Save money on the group tour--we're glad we",
          "We had the pleasure of attending a recital and private tour. It was interesting to learn about the composer and his wife/muse. The grounds are lovely and the concert hall has a wonderful view of the water in addition to great acoustics. However, the museum itself is very small",
          "We took the combined bus , entrance and concert ticket. I think it was well worth listening to music in that setting, bringing it all to life. Interesting house, and I learnt something about Grieg, though probably not enough detail for a real Grieg lover Beautiful setting",
          "A great day trip in Bergen. The tour guide on the bus ride was very informative. When we arrived at the museum we had a guided tour with lots of interesting tidbits about Grieg, his family and his musical accomplishments. There was time to wander about the grounds after the",
          "loved the concert especially. would have liked to spend more time in the museum and in the garden. you should allow several hours to explore everything that's there.",
          "We took the combination bus, tour, and concert out of Bergen. If space is available, you can get same day tickets at the tourist information center, but I'd recommend pre-booking since we saw a number of people turned away. The bus picks up at the tourist center near the",
          "As always in Norway, this place has some beautiful views. It was nice to see where one of the best composers of all time made his music. I gained a new appreciation for classical music by coming here. You have to see a performance in the concert hall. Ata a certain angle in the",
          "Visited for a short piano recital. The concert venue has fabulous views and the recital itself was very good. The tour of the (small) house was spoiled by too many people being there at once, otherwise a very enjoyable visit.",
          "Listening to Grieg's music played on a Steinway with the blue waters and gardens in the window behind was a highlight of our visit to Bergen.",
          "Would have given this five stars if it wasn't so over run with cruise ship tours. Had to wait a day because the Tourist office had sold out. Surprised and disappointed having to wait in crowded groups to see the home. The sights are very special. Really got to know what",
          "We were glad we did not overlook this delightful museum. A pleasant short walk took us to the info center and small museum. There is a nice cafe too. The helpful guides gave us a personal tour of the home. We walked down to see Grieg's work studio and then over to his grave",
          "Out...of..this..world.... Not often I say this, but the *whole* Grieg experience is wonderful. At all costs do a recital, preferably in the evening, of Grieg's piano music, heard against the backdrop of the scenery he wrote it for. Allow time to absorb the atmosphere. Try to",
          "Our best activity while in Bergen was taking a bus ride to Edvard Grieg's summer home outside of town (package tickets from the downtown TI), where he did his composing and sought inspiration from nature. The trip included a walk around the grounds, detailed and informative tour",
          "We took the Tourist Center and get a guide tour in the house of Grieg. The environment was nice and inspiring. The program was well performed. One advice is that you bring lunch because the cafeteria can be filled with people during lunch time. In a fine day, you can enjoy a",
          "This was an arranged tour, but nontheless, very enjoyable. We were dropped off in the parking lot and walked a short distance to the museum (one gets to see a village-like scene with a few houses along the way and the flowers were gorgeous!!). The tour of the museum was about 30",
          "As this is quite a small museum (Grieg's summer house) people have to be managed through it quite carefully. However once inside it is lovely and appears authentic. We were there with a group and were lucky enough to have a pianist play a short concert of Grieg's music for us on",
          "The property and home are beautiful. The Guides provided an interesting history of his life and his music.",
          "We took the train from Bergen. it took about 25 minutes (get off at Hop) and then we had a ten minute walk. We attended the 1:00 concert and it was really a lovely experience. If you go to the concert, it is extra $ but I thought it was worth it! The performers were extremely",
          "We visited the museum as part of a group tour. The museum is actually Grieg's house and contains many of his personal items, including a grand piano that was a gift to him. Our group also attended a private concert of Grieg's works at the museum's modern concert hall which",
          "We took the tram out to the Hop stop, crossed the street and walked back to the intersecting road where we followed signs to Troldhaugen. It was about a 25 minute easy walk. We were able to see the lunchtime concert at 1 which I HIGHLY recommend! This is a beautiful place. Make",
          "There is a special tour to Troldhaugen, home of Edvard Greig, which includes a coach to and from the centre of Bergen, a guided tour of the house, time in the gardens and a half hour piano recital. It was undoubtedly the best visit we had in Norway and would highly recommend",
          "If you're a classical music lover this is an absolute must see. We took a taxi (about $30) instead of the formal tour which takes 3.5 hrs. Time your visit to attend the 30 minute performance of Grieg's piano music (daily at 1 PM).",
          "We went with a small group and began with a 30 minute concert at 1pm of selected Grieg music (this was 60Kr extra to the house entry price...but well worth it). This is in an absolutely amazing auditorium which melds into the hillside - great architecture! You sit facing the",
          "Catch a bus at 11.00 by the tourist office and travel 20 mins to Grieg's house; now a museum and concert hall. Guided tour for 45 mins with a well informed and charming guide then some time to look round the small but well presented museum. Finally a lovely recital of Greig's",
          "Grieg's home is a short light-rail ride and ten minute walk from Bergen central. (The tourist office also offers a tour with transportation.) Arrive close to lunch time, because admission to the home includes a wonderful piano recital. The recital hall overlooks a fjord, as",
          "Here you will tour the home where Grieg and his wife entertained famous guests. Best of all for me was the beautifully modern auditorium where a pianist performed a program of Grieg works. From the audience seats one could look through an artistically framed portal at the tiny",
          "Lovely place to visit. Lunchtime concert was fabulous and staff very friendly and knowledgeable. It's a beautiful place.",
          "The setting is beautiful -- Edvard knew how to site his retreat! The performance hall was also wonderfully situated for small recitals. The museum was \"quaint\". Overall, I guess you just have to love Grieg to be enchanted by this touristic place . . .",
          "You can actually tour the bottom floor of the house, see Grieg's piano, and the hut where her composed. They also include a free piano concert of Grieg's music by the current \"artist in residence.\"",
          "Stop on the wharf at the tourist center and buy your ticket beforehand. I believe the price was 200 NOK. We purchased the ticket two days before visiting. We were picked up downtown at the tourist center...a nice coach bus....and took the approximate 30 minute trip to",
          "Defiantly worth the visit, not to crowded by turist. Not quite my taste but my wife and her friend really enjoyed it.",
          "I had the pleasure to be sent here through work. It is right next to the birth home of Edward grieg. Beautiful scenery.",
          "We are not classical music adverse, but also not devotees, so were pleasantly surprised by how much we enjoyed the outing. We are glad we purchased the combo ticket providing transportation, house tour and lunchtime concert. The price is not inconsequential (Bergen city card",
          "Visiting Greigs house and concert hall is one of the reasons you are all the way to Bergen! The concert hall and pianist is an expected gem literally buried in the hillside of a lake. The house is quirky and charming with great tour guides making the story come alive. It's a bit",

          "If you're in Bergen.... just do it. We were visiting on a cruise ship and paid for taxis etc..expensive to do because its Norway... and Norway is expensive. Worth every penny. Not to be missed. We did some internet research and it turned out there was a short concert the day we",
          "Our tour included a stop at Grieg's home which we were looking forward to. We were not disappointed. Not only is the home well maintained and interesting to wander through, but there is also a gorgeous modern concert hall attached to it. We were fortunate enough to be treated to",
          "Troldhaugen itself used to be remote but suburban neighborhood has crept up on it. The house and information are excellent. Though the guide was not fully fluent in English, he did know music in general and Grieg in particular. Lots of information. The underground concert hall",
          "Booked at the Tourist Information office. Tour included bus trip from the tourist office to Grieg's house and the concert hall. Went the first day of the season starting May 2017. The half hour concert was in a beautiful concert hall, overlooking the lake with excellent",

          "When I am traveling I usually do not visit too many museums. The Edvard Grieg's museum is a bit small, but breaks away from the standard museum layout. It is set at the Composers house when he lived in Bergen and has opportunity to be active and wander down the paths to the",
          "As part of our tour we visited Edvard Grieg house and the newly built concert hall. The house is not large and when busy I would think quite cramped but in a wonderful position overlooking the Fjord. We were very fortunate as there were only 23 of us there. A 30 minute recital",
          "The home of world famous composer Edvard Grieg.It is an amazing location,, secluded and beautiful.A small museum about the man and his life.",
          "This museum was a really nice surprise to me. It is an amazing house, in the middle of a huge green area and near the fjord. It also includes a concert hall in the grounds and a small old and magic little magic house near the water. Here you feel inspired, not only to write",
          "Excellent visit round this idyllic house and museum Beware there is a long walk from the coach drop off point but it is flat.",
          "Grieg was a classical composer musician. The family home is beautiful, old and well preserved. The new museum is modern architecture and well worth the visit.",
          "We did a tour that included a discounted entry to the KODE museums at the end of the tour and a concert at the museum grounds. The tour of the museum was relatively short. But the guide was good and patient, answering all questions. The grounds around the museum are",
          "This is definitely a fine cultural trip if you have a spare half day in your schedule. It is some distance out of Bergen and you will want to spend a minimum of 2-3 hours there, but it is worth it and a wonderful cultural experience.",
          "I play piano and used to play Grieg a lot. One of my favourites... I was in the museum many times, came here with guests from UK, USA, Ukraine, Germany... Lovely place to visit, learn about the Grieg family, listen to the piano concert (each time a surprise), have a light lunch,",
          "The museum is well laid out. Moving from a video display to museum to Greig's house, the visit requires a whole afternoon. The staff are very knowledgeable and took time on our visit. Visiting out of season we had a lengthy tour with a small group. Walking around the landscape",
          "Location was quite far in from the station - was lost initially but followed some sticker signs and located finally. Very nicely preserved exhibits and even have a museum shop. The villas and composer's hut were well kept. We love the scenery of the vicinity and that's no",
          "If you enjoy classical music, it's worth visiting. I missed more information in English. I attended a piano concert with explanations about his life, but unfortunately everything was in Norwegian. The view is awesome.",
          "The afternoon we spent at the Edvard Grieg museum has to be the best experience I've had during my university exchange here at Bergen! The curator, Amanda, played several of the composer's pieces for us inside Grieg's beautiful lakeside house. Her incredible knowledge of",

          "We toured Troldhaugen and those in our group who knew of him or his music found the tour interesting. We got to tour his home and I sat in Grieg's spot at the table and gazed at his favorite painting, just as he did every morning. We went down to the little building where he",
          "The Troldhaugen Edvard Grieg Museum is an interesting place and easily accessible when in Bergen due to the small nature of this city!",
          "A very well maintained Grieg's house with an interesting collection. Knowledgeable guides. A nice garden. A very impressive part for me was a small summer house down in the garden. A good place to visit. It takes time to reach it by public transport, but very easy by car.",
          "If you want to get a vibe of the place where Edvard Grieg and his wife lived, you need to see this. The museum is maintained in pristine condition, with all the original furniture and objects perfectly preserved. A local pianist offered a mini-concert featuring one of Grieg's",
          "We were taken to this museum whilst waiting for the rest of our party to fly in. In spite of the rain we much enjoyed seeing such an historic venue. The young guide was excellent.",
          "We found it quite difficult to find this attraction, not entirely sure that's down to us or poor signposting, it could have something to do with the icy conditions freezing our brains the day we visited. We succeeded in, on our third attempt, finding a local who knew where to",
          "i did tour from tourist bureau and also attended concert. the museum is located in a lovely woodland area and there isd a short walk to the museum . it is very well preserved with much of the same furniture that was there originally. the guide explained about his life and also",
          "This suburban treasure is well worth a visit. Beautiful grounds pretty views from the property. It is a well preserved home showcasing the life of Grieg. The wonderful bonus of the visit was a piano recital in the music hall of some of the compositions of Grieg by a local",
          "The place is genuine and intact and shows the suburban villa of composer Edvard Grieg and his wife Nina. It's placed on a beautiful height overlooking a picturesque fjord. It's worth a trip from the city centre of Bergen.",
          "Been here so many times I've lost count. Troldhaugen is very well taken care of. The house itself is very interesting, though of course more-so for Grieg fans, and the modern museum is well presented. There's a film room where you can learn about Grieg's life, and a souvenir",
          "Visit on a weekday in October. It was a very good, informative, and quiet experience. Very attentive guide. Not the easiest place to get to without a car.",
          "We didn't know much about Grieg before we arrived here, but it was great to see the beautiful hut where he worked on his compositions, and to learn a little more about his life. The lunchtime concert was excellent.",
          "If you are able to visit the museum when there is a concert playing, I would definitely recommend attending. The museum and home are very interesting and the pianist we heard was top notch.",
          "An outstanding visit to a beautiful view of the fjords. No wonder that Edvard Greig wrote such terrific music, it it truly a place to sit and contemplate. . I visited here with my granddaughters, who are of various teenage years and early twenties, they were enthralled by the",
          "A great place to visit and see the home of Edvard Grieg. Besides a beautiful house, it is a very beautiful area overlooking the lake. We enjoyed the history and area.",
          "Do see the movie; it illustrates in gorgeous film why Grieg's music reflects his impressions of waterfalls, sea, et al.",
          "The museum itself is quite small and there isn't too much to see unless you're a real Grieg fan. There are concerts on frequently in front of a giant window overlooking the same lake that Greig did when he composed his music. For a better experience go with one of the tours",
          "I loved everything about this place! The location, the walk to get there, the beautiful house and the breathtaking surroundings. No wonder this man was so inspired to write his music there. The piano concert is an outstanding touch to this visit. Do not miss it!",
          "A fabulous experience firstly to wonder the museum and then the home of this great composer, Edvard Grieg. We were also fortunate to hear a recital of some of Grieg's compositions by Gunilla S\u00fcssmann, a truly inspirational pianist.",
          "The museum is really informative with great personal items. The house, composition hut and grave site are really interesting. Make sure you get there and attend the recital. Truly a bucket list moment for anyone who loves classical music.",
          "We were to visit Bergen on a cruise and, because we had been there before, decided to try to find something different to do besides the usual tour. We booked directly with Tide Buss on their web site and had a very nice bus trip up to Troldhaugen. We then had a tour of Edvard",
          "The guides are very good. The park and views excellent. Concert hall wonderful! Recommend to stay for the sunset.",
          "What outstanding value is this 11 am to 2.30 pm experience! A short bus ride from Bergen harbour took us to Troldhaugen and Grieg's villa, with the (relatively) new concert hall and museum close by. How much there was to enjoy! An informative talk by Daniel on the bus; a",
          "We went on a 3.5 hour tour, from coach by the visitor information. Took about 18 minutes. Greigs house is pretty small and overlooks the fjord. We had a fantastic, knowledgable guide, who told his stories fluently and with humour. There were too many in the group though for the",
          "We visited Troldhaugen as part of a group from our cruise ship. The house itself is absolutely charming but not very large, and you cannot visit upstairs. The museum is interesting but again not very large, so if you have more than around 20 people in it is seems very cramped.",
          "If you have any musical interest (or not) do not miss this venue. The Tourist Office in Bergen will press the organised tour but we made our own way (at half the cost) and this independence allowed flexibility. We caught a tram from the centre (ticket at any 7/11 shop) to Hop",

          "This charming little house perched on rocks overlooking a lake was Grieg's summer house. There is a homeliness about it which draws you in to domesticity and creativity of Grieg's life. His daughter died of meningitis when only one and he suffered poor health most of his life",
          "He was a relatively short man, not a child prodigy but what beautiful music he wrote. And it's no wonder. His studio was located right on the edge of a fjord in a beautiful woods. The house he and Nina built after 20 years traveling and performing sits above the studio on a",
          "The house is situated about 40 mins from Bergen centre , we visited on a guided tour from our Cruise ship . The house is rather small and can be seen in under an hour . There are several guides on had to explain the history of the building . There are many items that date from",
          "This is a lovely old home with Grieg's original piano. There are lovely views from the yard and a lovely walk to the house along a tree lined road. If you love classical music, this is worth a visit.",
          "Troldhaugen is a very special experience. There is still a connection to Edvar Griegs mind. I highly recommend a visit here. Listen to Griegs music to deepen the experience and Enjoy your life.",
          "House beautifully preserved. Loved seeing the piano he played on still in the house. Also walked down to the water where he insisted being buried. It is in the rock in the cliff at the water front. He loved sitting at the water. Museum informative. The statue of him at the",

          "We had a pleasant visit to the museum and home of Edvard Grieg. Our treat for this visit was a concert at noon. It was a spectacular piano concert that lasted about 45 minutes. His home was a treat to visit, but his property is gorgeous on the water. If your in Bergen, this",
          "Worth a visit there are not many attractions in Bergen but if you appreciate good music this is a must situated in a great old building with a lovely statue of the composer close by",
          "It should have been pointed out when booking, there is a five minutes or more walk from the bus stop to the house. My wife walks with difficulty. The house is absolutely charming and the concert we attended was delightful, although it was mainly Schubert and Schumann and it",
          "If you are in Bergen, you must visit the Edvard Grieg home. Grieg is Norway's most famous composer but he was also a pianist and a conductor. The peace and tranquility of the house lead Grieg to compose beautiful music. You will walk through his house and be surrounded by",
          "Troldhaugen is a wonderful, multidimensional site. It includes, of course, the home of Grieg, the great Norwegian composer, as well as Grieg's composing hut and poignant final resting place. The home, furnished as it was when Grieg and his wife lived there (1885-1907),",
          "Visiting Grieg's house is definitely worthwhile. It's interesting and informative. His burial place, his composing hut and the house itself are all quite well-maintained. Gunilla Sussmann performed piano solos in the adjoining concert hall. There were a few errors but her body",
          "This was the home of Norway's most famous composer, Edvard Greig, and it is well worth a visit. If you don't have your own transport then there is a bus tour that departs from the tourist information centre in Bergen; located near the fish wharf. It takes about 30 minutes from",
          "We toured Edvard Grieg's home and museum with a Tauck tour group. For anyone acquainted with Georg's music, it's east to understand his inspiration with Troldhaugen. The house is open for tours and is furnished as Grieg would have known. His lakeside composing house is charming",
          "We had wedding day at Troldhaugen played at our wedding, so it was fitting that we should visit on honeymoon. It's well worth a trip and the lunchtime concert is not to be missed.",

          "The house that Edvard Grieg and his wife Nina built for themselves perches on a rocky outcrop overlooking the sea some 8 miles south of Bergen. For the dwelling of a world-famous composer it's surprisingly small and unpretentious, but very charming. Friendly and well-informed",

          "For this Grieg experience, you take the bus to his home, and take a guided tour. There is a performance hall, where a pianist plays Grieg music for about 1/2 hour, which is a real highlight. We also like the dessert at the caf\u00e9!",
          "We booked this tour through the Tourist Office. A very nice excursion to Troldhaugen - the estate is located on a very peaceful lake. Got a guided tour of his house/estate and enjoyed the lunch time concert(lunch not included)..",

          "Not a classical enthusiast but the 'villa' and composer's hut were unique and interesting. Certainly a monument to a diminutive yet storied composer. They offer a 30 minute Grieg concert at 1:00 atd least on weekdays in the summer and it is a very nice respite.",
          "Spent a morning here on a beautiful day. Nice place to walk around and get a sense of Griegs inspiration for his music. Definitely recommend buying tickets to the lunch or dinner time concerts. They have buses from downtown Bergen, but one can also drive there.",
          "I recommend the tour that includes transportation and the concert. The trip leaves from the tourism center and you can get your tickets there but buy in advance because the lines are long and they sell out. Taking public transportation is possible but requires a 25 minute walk",
          "Were not fortunate to hear a concert here but can only imagine how wonderful one might be on these lovely grounds. We did tour the museum/home of Edvard & Nina. There was something both sad and wonderful about this magical place. You really feel taken back in time by the",

          "Such a special walk to the museum and on arrival a wonderful and peaceful location for such a museum. Our guide provided a true insight into the life of Grieg and his music and a walk though the house and the gardens further told wonderful stories of his life and his talents.",
          "Sited on a lovely point above an inlet, Troldhaugen gives one a feel for the Romantic inspiration of Edvard's music and for Nina's strong will. He composed in tranquility water-side; she, a soprano and proto-feminist -- cigar-smoking, pants-wearing far ahead of her time --",
          "If you love history or music, you will no doubt appreciate visiting Troldhaugen, to see Edvard Griegs house and museum. Located just outside the city center, Troldhaugen is basically composed of Griegs house, visitors center, as well as small first-class concert hall, where you",
          "A bit of a walk but worth doing and it avoids the hordes off the coaches. Slight disappointment was you couldn't go upstairs in the house-would have loved to see the view from the top storey.",

          "I'm a fan of Grieg's music so this was an obvious destination. It was 100 NOK, about 12 USD right now, and was probably worth that. The grounds are beautiful, and it was neat to see both his composition hut and his tomb. The house was displayed with period furniture that",

          "Musically interesting, and really special views of the area. The music is diverting, the home a piece of history perserved in time.",
          "We went at a very quiet time during the morning of national day so had the place to ourselves for much of the time. As a result we had the excellent guide to ourselves! However, even if there had been more people, it would still have been a good place to visit. Excellent",
          "The lunchtime concert package including bus transportation from the Bergen TI is the best way to experience the Edvard Grieg Museum in Troldhaugen. A knowledgeable guide provides an introduction to Edvard Grieg's life during the bus tour, and continues during the tour of the",

          "Right in the middle of what seems to be the main walking and shopping street, this monument is worth stopping and having a look. Very impressive.",
          "This was a huge and interesting fountain in a pedestrian area very near my hotel. It depicts Norway's sailors from different eras to today.",
          "Located on a pedestrian mall near the harbor/fish market so its a good meeting point. Well done statues.",
          "Our hotel, the Ole Bull (highly recommend) was right up the hill, so we passed this monument daily for our four days in Bergen. Many people come here for the monument and fountain. It is close to the Opera house and the fish market and also the location where you cat h the",
          "Very central, nicely detailed and maintained monument to the sailors past. Only takes a few minutes but worth a visit.",
          "Pause here to spare a thought for some seriously brave men , nice to see they are commemorated by the waterside",
          "I found the fountain walking from the train station to the wharf. It became my point of reference for my visit to Bergen. Walk around the four sides and study the story it tells. I was saddened by the dead whale.",
          "We walked past this twice during our day stop to Bergen and whilst it was raining the first time, we stopped and had a close look on our way back through. This is a monument celebrating Bergens connections with the sea and depicts many of different eras of sailors and fishermen",
          "In the middle of shopping area is this monument and good to take photos from all angles to see it. It is free.",
          "One can argue that the Sailor\u2019s Monument is the \u201cheart\u201d of Bergen. Located near the harbor, it becomes quite busy with people sitting around the statue and the square. On the sides of Torgallmenningen square are popular shops and cafes. The statue was created in 1950",
          "Great masterpiece of display and art form. We loved all the bass relief depictions and statues of sailors going back to the Viking era.",
          "The monument commemorates sailors and traders from different centuries. Norway is rich of fish and survived in the past thanks to fishing, so the sailors deserve the glory and respect that Bergen's citizens give them.",
          "Sailor's Monument is located in central Bergen. It may not be the most attractive architecturally, but it may not be possible to visit Bergen without sing this monument.",
          "Take the time to walk around it and view the different carved figures representing various times in Norwegian history.",
          "Fine carved figures, fascinating stories come to mind of Norway\u2019s history as you walk around it. Clear scenes and faces. The sea and sailing are so much of Norway\u2019s story that it is easy to forget other aspects of the country but this is a fitting reminder of all the sea has",
          "It\u2019s a pretty impressive monument though it does look very Russian/USSR. But nevertheless it\u2019s grandiose.",

It is centrally located on Torgallmenningen, the wide pedestrian street in central Bergen. It is interesting to stop and look",
          "The monument has 4 sides up top and individual sailors on the bottom, each with its own stories. There is one which has a Viking ship navigating across the seas and you see how the lookout(for other ships,storms) is at the head of the ship. You can see others - captain,etc.",

          "Very nice installation highlighting the evolution of the Norwegian seaman. Worth a glance, and on a pleasant plaza.",
          "Located in the city center/square this is a pleasant place to sit and watch people. The monument is well done. It is hard to believe that in WWII this area was lined with tank b locks and full of Nazi troops--perhaps that was the most humbling/eye opening thing to take away",
          "Sea and sailors are linked to Norway and probably within every Norwegians DNA. Thus no wonder central monument of Bergen is this one, with many stories and characters depicting this link with the sea.",
          "It's a decent monument, but it is full of birds and one of them pooped on my brand new jacket. Would not recommend to eat your snack here.",

          "To be honest, I had no idea what it was until I started looking for places in Norway to review that we had recently visited, only to discover this monument, which I took some photos of was the Sailor's Monument! It is quite impressive, with several sailors carved into all four",

          "This monument told a story with sculptures, but you needed a guide book to tell you about it, as there was no narrative at the monument itself. The pedestrian square surrounding it was also enjoyable.",
          "The monument is located in a long rectangular square right next to the harbour, which is often full of tourists. The monument itself is magnificent and worth taking a picture. But the square is also a nice place for a walk, with all kinds of shops and cafes along its sides.",
          "Given the importance of seafaring and sailors to Bergen and Norway a lot more could be done to explain this monument in the town square. It is impressive but with better explanations could bring it alive a lot more",
          "Happened to walk by this monument in Bergen and really enjoyed it. The sculptures are an interesting progression of various seafaring roles that have had an impact on Bergen. I wish there was more information available about the monument either at the site or online, but could",

          "The Sailor's Monument in the centre of Bergan shopping district is a wonderful monument to Norwegian & Viking culture on the four sides the statues are different depicting different eras. This would only take 10 minutes to take the four sides in, and I think this is a must do",
          "You can't miss this fountain and monument when walking through the shopping district area of town, it's huge and has quite a presence. Each side of the monument has different pictures and statues so it's worth checking out each side slowly, to catch all the details. It's very",

          "I spent some time examining each wonderfully carved relief and the story each one told. Norwegian and Viking culture was founded on seafaring, as attested by this monument.",
          "This is not a destination spot but rather something you might notice on your way to destination tourist sites. It is a large monument that would be hard to overlook, but many people seemed more focused on their journey than the memorial. So not a stand out but a good tribute to",
          "It it a simple monument with nice people sculptures. Don't spend too much time for it, better keep moving further, because just a little bit further opens beautiful views of center of Bergen.",

          "While this is a nice monument it is not necessarily a destination. Located in the square it represents Bergen's seafaring history.Easy enough to stop and view on the way to other attractions.",
          "If you have sailors in your family, you should walk around this monument. Its sculptor(s) gave a wonderful historical walk through the history of Norway's seafarers. Hope that they can clean it because it would be spectacular.",
          "The monument to the sailing heritage of Bergen is entirely expected and quite an impressive piece, right at the heart of the pedestrianised zone, but it\u2019s not a work of beauty, being quite dark and slightly ominous. Better close up than from a distance.",
          "I was mesmerized by this little gem in the mall in Bergen, A brief history of Bergen displayed succinctly with a few statuesque ocean going lads. I liked it.",
          "This is a cool looking monument, with statues of various seafarers. Very interesting to look at, and in a very nice shopping area.",
          "The sculptures represents a glorius tribute to the maritime history of Bergen. Shaped as a huge chunk of 'brunost', it's a shame it claims the centerpiece of Torgalmenningen. The population of the city of Bergen is divided on the topic...",
          "Worth spending some time wandering around the four different sides. A beautiful monument if a little austere. Do visit",
          "A monument with 4 sides, 3 statues per side, reflecting the sea-faring generations since the Vikings. Very artfully crafted, with much detail to period changes in dress and comportment. It stands unadorned in a shopping mall type of setting which does not pay proper homage to",
          "The city seems to have many monuments but, this is one of the largest we saw on our visit there. Right in the middle of everything so you can not miss it. Very historical.",
          "Very nicely done bronze monument. Make sure that you look at all four sides are they are all distinctive.",
          "There is not much to say about the monument. It is seated in a nice area and I liked sitting down next to the monument and watch local people passing by. And I was not the only one sitting there !",
          "Dedicated to this city that is filled with history. A pleasant walk to get to it but go all the way around -- clockwise. Worth the walk.",
          "The monument is in the middle of the walking mall and gives you a great idea of what courage the individuals had that are represented. As you walk around the monument you can see the history of the seafarers and settlers of days gone by.",

          "Norway has a long seafaring tradition and this monument honors the men that sailed from Norway over the centuries. From Vikings to today there are sailors along the base and the ships they sailed on the upper plaque.",
          "The Sailor's Monument is located right at the start of Torgallmenningen, which is a pedestrian shopping area. There are 12 statues on the monument honoring Norwegian sailors from Viking to present time. It was very interesting to see the change of each statue on the timeline as",
          "Four century's of seamen are depicted on the 4 sides of the statue, Each century has it's boats and men in period clothing. Meantime it's in the middle of a pedestrian mall with high end shops all around. Close to the tourism building and the gardens.",
          "We walked around the Sailor's Monument a couple of times, but clearly did not fill comprehend the full intent of the monument. As others have said, the city is missing an opportunity to share more detail of the city with visitors. Clearly this is a Bergen landmark.",
          "Stands proud in the centre of the main shopping street, highlights and remembers all the Norwegian sailors through the ages, from the vikings to present day.",
          "The Seafrers' Monument from 1960 commemorates all those who have died on the oceans from the Viking Age and upwards. The monument really does tell the history of Bergen up through the centuries but because there is NO INFORMATION - who would know?",
          "Sat at the top end of the shopping precinct. Seemed to be a popular meeting point for friends and groups.",
          "In the centre of the traffic free shopping area of town just near the port. Very popular with visitors and locals",
          "Without a guide or explanation, you might not fully appreciate the 1950 sculpture which honors Norwegian seaman's achievements from Vikings - 20th century, but even so you can glean enough and simply enjoy the setting which locals also frequent. Nice place to eat your reindeer",
          "This is an impressive monument in the heart of Bergen honouring the fishermen and women who are part of bergens history. In the summer months if the weather permit there are concerts in front",
          "This is a very nice monument on a prominent place in town, the main shopping street. So to fully admire the meaning and to better understand what you see it could use some more information, like a infopanel orso. Nevertheless its nice to take a minute and check it out",

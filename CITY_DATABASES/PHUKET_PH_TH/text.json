        "wiki": "Phuket (; Thai: \u0e20\u0e39\u0e40\u0e01\u0e47\u0e15, [p\u02b0\u016b\u02d0.k\u00e8t] (listen), Malay: Talang or Tanjung Salang) is one of the southern provinces (changwat) of Thailand. It consists of the island of Phuket, the country's largest island, and another 32 smaller islands off its coast. It lies off the west coast of Thailand in the Andaman Sea. Phuket Island is connected by the Sarasin Bridge to Phang Nga Province to the north. The next nearest province is Krabi, to the east across Phang Nga Bay.\nPhuket Province has an area of 576 square kilometres (222 sq mi), somewhat less than that of Singapore, and is the second-smallest province of Thailand. The island was on one of the major trading routes between India and China, and was frequently mentioned in foreign ships' logs of Portuguese, French, Dutch, and English traders, but was never colonised by a European power. It formerly derived its wealth from tin and rubber and now from tourism.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThere are several possible derivations of the relatively recent name \"Phuket\" (of which the digraph ph represents an aspirated p). One theory is it is derived from the word Bukit (Jawi: \u0628\u0648\u0643\u064a\u062a) in Malay which means \"hill\", as this is what the island appears like from a distance.\nPhuket was formerly known as Thalang (\u0e16\u0e25\u0e32\u0e07 Tha-Laang), derived from the old Malay \"telong\" (Jawi: \u062a\u0644\u0648\u06a0) which means \"cape\". The northern district of the province, which was the location of the old capital, still uses this name. In Western sources and navigation charts, it was known as Junk Ceylon or Junkceylon (a corruption of the Malay Tanjung Salang, i.e., \"Cape Salang\").\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nPhuket is the largest island in Thailand. It is in the Andaman Sea in southern Thailand. The island is mostly mountainous with a mountain range in the west of the island from the north to the south. The mountains of Phuket form the southern end of the Phuket mountain range, which ranges for 440 kilometres (270 mi) from the Kra Isthmus.\n\nAlthough some recent geographical works refer to the sections of the Tenasserim Hills in the isthmus as the \"Phuket Range\", these names are not found in classical geographic sources. Besides, the name Phuket is relatively recent having previously been named Jung Ceylon and Thalang. The highest elevation of the island is usually regarded as Khao Mai Thao Sip Song (Twelve Canes), at 529 metres (1,736 ft) above sea level. However, it has been reported by barometric pressure readings that there is an even higher elevation (with no apparent name), of 542 meters above sea level, in the Kamala hills behind Kathu waterfall.Its population was 249,446 in 2000, rising to 525,709 in the 2010 decennial census, the highest growth rate of all provinces nationwide at 7.4 percent annually. Some 600,000 people reside on Phuket currently, among them migrants, international ex-pats, Thais registered in other provinces, and locals. The registered population, however, includes only Thais who are registered in a \"tabien baan\" or house registration book, which most are not, and the end of 2012 was 360,905 persons.Phuket is approximately 863 kilometres (536 mi) south of Bangkok and covers an area of 543 square kilometres (210 sq mi) excluding small islets. It is estimated that Phuket would have a total area of approximately 576 square kilometres (222 sq mi) if all its outlying islands were included. Other islands are:\nKo Lone 4.77 square kilometres (1.84 sq mi), Ko Maprao 3.7 square kilometres (1.4 sq mi), Ko Naka Yai 2.08 square kilometres (0.80 sq mi), Ko Racha Noi 3.06 square kilometres (1.18 sq mi), Ko Racha Yai 4.5 square kilometres (1.7 sq mi), and the second biggest, Ko Sire 8.8 square kilometres (3.4 sq mi).\nThe island's length, from north to south, is 48 kilometres (30 mi) and its width is 21 kilometres (13 mi).Seventy percent of Phuket's area is covered with mountains which stretch from north to south. The remaining 30 percent are plains in the central and eastern parts of the island. It has a total of nine brooks and creeks but does not have any major rivers.\nForest, rubber, and palm oil plantations cover 60 percent of the island. The west coast has several sandy beaches. The east coast beaches are more often muddy. Near the southernmost point is Laem Phromthep (Thai: \u0e41\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e)(\"Brahma's Cape\"), a popular viewpoint. In the mountainous north of the island is the Khao Phra Thaeo No-Hunting Area, protecting more than 20 km\u00b2 of the rainforest. The three highest peaks of this reserve are the Khao Prathiu (384 metres (1,260 ft)), Khao Bang Pae 388 metres (1,273 ft), and Khao Phara 422 metres (1,385 ft). The Sirinat National Park on the northwest coast was established in 1981 to protect an area of 90 square kilometres (35 sq mi) (68 kilometres (42 mi) marine area), including the Nai Yang Beach where sea turtles lay their eggs.The most popular (and overcrowded) tourist area on Phuket is Patong Beach on the central west coast, perhaps owing to the easy access to its wide and long beach. Most of Phuket's nightlife and its shopping is in Patong, and the area has become increasingly developed. Patong means \"the forest filled with banana leaves\" in Thai. South of Patong lie Karon Beach, Kata Beach, Kata Noi Beach, and around the southern tip of the island, Nai Han Beach and Rawai. To the north of Patong are Kamala Beach, Surin Beach, and Bang Tao Beach. These areas are generally much less developed than Patong. To the southeast is Bon Island and to the south are several coral islands. The Similan Islands lie to the northwest and the Phi Phi Islands which are part of Krabi Province, to the southeast.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Phuket features a tropical monsoon climate (Am). Due to its proximity to the equator, in the year, there is a little variation in temperatures. The city has an average annual high of 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) and an annual low of 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). Phuket has a dry season that runs from December to March and a wet season that covers the remaining eight months. However, like many cities that feature a tropical monsoon climate, Phuket sees some precipitation even during its dry season. Phuket averages roughly 2,200 millimetres (87 in) of rain.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 16th-18th century: European contact ===\nThe Portuguese explorer Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto arrived in Siam in 1545. His accounts of the country go beyond Ayutthaya and include a reasonably detailed account of ports in the south of the Kingdom as well. Pinto was one of the first European explorers to detail Phuket in his travel accounts. He referred to the island as \"Junk Ceylon\", a name the Portuguese used for Phuket Island in their maps, mentioning the name seven times in his accounts. Pinto said that Junk Ceylon was a destination port where trading vessels made regular stops for supplies and provisions. However, during the mid-16th century, the island was in decline due to pirates and often rough and unpredictable seas, which deterred merchant vessels from visiting the island. Pinto mentioned several other notable port cities in his accounts, including Patani and Ligor, which is modern-day Nakhon Si Thamarat.In the 17th century, the Dutch, English and, after the 1680s, the French, competed for the opportunity to trade with Junk Ceylon, which was a rich source of tin. In September 1680, a ship of the French East India Company visited the island and left with a full cargo of tin.A year or two later, the Siamese King Narai, seeking to reduce Dutch and English influence, named as governor a French medical missionary, Brother Ren\u00e9 Charbonneau, a member of the Siam mission of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Missions \u00c9trang\u00e8res. Charbonneau remained as governor until 1685.\n\nIn 1685, King Narai confirmed the French tin monopoly in Phuket to their ambassador, the Chevalier de Chaumont. Chaumont's former ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel, Sieur de Billy, was named governor of the island. However, the French were expelled from Siam after the 1688 Siamese revolution. On 10 April 1689, Desfarges led an expedition to re-capture Thalang to restore French control in Siam. His occupation of the island led to nothing, and Desfarges returned to Puducherry in January 1690.\n\n\n==== 1785: Burmese invasion ====\n\nBefore the Burmese attacked Thalang in 1785 during the \"Nine Armies' Wars\", Francis Light, a British East India Company captain (and later founder of Penang), who had been based on the island for some years, notified the local administration that he had observed Burmese forces preparing to attack. The island's military governor had just died, so the Burmese thought that it could be easily seized. Than Phu Ying Chan, the widow of the recently deceased governor, and her sister Mook (\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e21\u0e38\u0e01)  ordered the women of the island to dress as soldiers and take positions on the Thalang city walls. The Burmese called off their attack due to the perceived strength of the defences. Short of food, they retreated. After a month-long siege of the capital city, the Burmese were forced to retreat on 13 March 1785. The two women became local heroines, receiving the royal titles Thao Thep Kasattri and Thao Si Sunthon from a grateful King Rama I.The seal of Phuket is a depiction of the Two Heroines Monument along Highway 402 in Phuket. This commemorates the sisters The seal is a circle surrounded by a kranok pattern and has been used since 1985.\n\n\n=== 19th\u201320th centuries ===\nDuring the reign of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) from 1 October 1868 to 23 October 1910, Phuket became the administrative centre of the tin-producing southern provinces. His reign was characterized by the modernization of Siam, governmental and social reforms, and territorial concessions to the British and French. As Siam was threatened by Western expansionism, Chulalongkorn managed to save Siam from colonization.\nIn 1933 Monthon Phuket (\u0e21\u0e13\u0e11\u0e25\u0e20\u0e39\u0e40\u0e01\u0e47\u0e15) was dissolved and Phuket became a province.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\n\n==== 2004 tsunami ====\n\nOn 26 December 2004, Phuket and other nearby areas on Thailand's west coast suffered damage when they were struck by a tsunami caused by the Indian Ocean earthquake. The waves destroyed several highly populated areas in the region, killing up to 5,300 people in Thailand, and two hundred thousand more throughout the Asian region. Some 250 were reported dead in Phuket, including foreign tourists. Almost all of the major beaches on the west coast of Phuket, especially Kamala, Patong, Karon, and Kata sustained major damage, with some damage caused to resorts and villages on the island's southern beaches. Thailand's hardest-hit area was the Takua Pa District of Phang Nga Province north of Phuket, where a thousand or more Burmese workers building new beach resorts died.\nIn December 2006, Thailand launched the first of 22 tsunami-detection buoys to be positioned around the Indian Ocean as part of a regional warning system. The satellite-linked deep-sea buoys float 1,000 km (620 mi) offshore, roughly midway between Thailand and Sri Lanka.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs with most of Thailand, the majority of the population is Buddhist, but there is a significant number of Muslims (20 percent) in Phuket, mainly descendants of the island's original sea-dwelling people. Among the Muslims, many are of Malay descent. People of Chinese ancestry make up an even larger population, many of whom are descendants of the tin miners who migrated to Phuket during the 19th century. Peranakans, known as \"Phuket Babas\" in the local tongue, constitute a fair share of Chinese community members, particularly among those who have family ties with the Peranakans of Penang and Malacca.Phuket provincial population in the preliminary count of the 2010 census was counted to be 525,018 people, including some 115,881 expatriates, or 21.1 per cent of the population. However, it is admitted this is inaccurate since The Phuket Provincial Employment Office currently records for more than 64,000 Burmese, Lao and Cambodian workers legally residing on the island. The Thai census figure for 2015 shows a population of 386,605 persons.The number of people on Phuket island swells to over a million during the high season, as tourists, mainly from Western Europe, China, Russia, and the United States flock to Phuket around Christmas.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\n\n=== Provincial government ===\nPhuket is divided into three districts (amphoe), which are further divided into 17 subdistricts (tambon), and 103 villages (muban).\n\nMueang Phuket\nKathu\nThalang\n\n\n=== Local government ===\nAs of 26 November 2019 there are: one Phuket Provincial Administration Organisation (ongkan borihan suan changwat) and 12 municipal (thesaban) areas in the province. Phuket has city (thesaban nakhon) status. Kathu and Patong have town (thesaban mueang) status.  Further 9 subdistrict municipalities (thesaban tambon). The non-municipal areas are administered by 6 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (ongkan borihan suan tambon).\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nTin mining was a major source of income for the island from the 16th century until petering out in the 20th century. In modern times, Phuket's economy has rested on two pillars: rubber tree plantations (making Thailand the biggest producer of rubber in the world) and tourism.Since the 1980s, the sandy beaches on the west coast of the island have been developed as tourist destinations, with Patong, Karon, and Kata being the most popular. Since the 2004 tsunami, all damaged buildings and attractions have been restored. Phuket is being intensely developed, with many new hotels, apartments, and houses under construction. \nIn July 2005, Phuket was voted one of the world's top five retirement destinations by Fortune Magazine.In 2017, Phuket received about 10 million visitors, most of them foreign, with China the leading contributor. Tourists generated some 385 billion baht in revenues, nearly 14 percent of the 2.77 trillion baht earned by the nation as a whole.The first half of 2019 saw a dip in the number of tourists visiting Phuket, driving lower hotel occupancy rates leading to increased price competition. RevPAR (revenue per available room) is down. A decline in the number of tourists, combined with an oversupply of hotel rooms, is the root of the problem.  Despite falling numbers, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) claims that tourism revenues have risen by 3.1% in the first half of 2019.\nNo one seems to know how many hotel rooms Phuket has available. Oxfam says it has 60,000 hotel rooms for its 9.1 million annual visitors. The Bangkok Post in September 2019 reported that Phuket has 600 hotels with 40,000 rooms.. Three weeks earlier it said that Phuket had 93,941 hotel rooms available, excluding villas and hostels, with an additional 15,000 projected to become available by 2024.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\nAir\n\nPhuket International Airport (HKT) commenced a 5.7 billion baht (US$185.7 million) expansion in September 2012, scheduled for completion on 14 February 2016. The airport will increase its annual handling capacity from 6.5 million to 12.5 million passengers, and add a new international terminal.\nRailThere is currently no rail line to Phuket. Trains run to Surat Thani 230 km away.\n\nCity transitSongthaews are a common mode of transport on Phuket. Phuket's songthaews are larger than those found in other areas of Thailand. Songthaews are the cheapest mode of transportation from town to town. They travel between the town and beaches. There are also conventional bus services and motorbike taxis. The latter are found in large numbers in the main town and at Patong Beach. Traditional tuk-tuks have been replaced by small vans, mostly red, with some being yellow or green. Car taxis in Phuket are quite expensive and charge flat rates between towns. Privately run buses are available from the airport to Phuket Town and major beaches. It is often recommended by locals to take the ride-share company, Grab.\n\nBusPhuket's Bus Station 2 BKS Terminal is the long-distance arrivals hub for buses to and from Bangkok and other major Thai cities and provinces. Located four kilometres to the north of Phuket's town centre and port, the complex is large and modern, linking with transportation by tuk-tuk, metered taxi, motorcycle taxi, songthaew, or local bus to the island's beaches and resorts. There are daily scheduled buses from private and government-run companies going to Phuket from Bangkok's Mo Chit and Southern terminal stations.\n\nTramThe Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (MRTA) announced in 2018 that bidding to construct a 60 kilometre-long, 23 station tram network in Phuket will commence in 2020. The 39 billion baht tram is part of the government's Private-Public-Partnership (PPP) plan which ensures it will be fast-tracked. The planned route stretches from Takua Thung District in Phang Nga Province to Chalong in Phuket. Phase one will connect Phuket International Airport with Chalong, about 40 kilometres. It will take three years to complete.\nFerryThere are daily ferry boats that connect Phuket to neighboring islands Phi Phi and Koh Lanta. Ferries depart daily from Rassada Pier and Tonsai Pier, with service expanding each year.The average price for a one-way ticket ranges from 300 THB to 1500 THB.\n\n\n== Health ==\n6 hospitals exist in Phuket. The main hospital in Phuket operated by the Ministry of Public Health is Vachira Phuket Hospital, with smaller hospitals at Thalang and Patong. 3 Private hospitals exist which are Phuket International Hospital, Bangkok Hospital Phuket and Mission Hospital Phuket.\n\n\n== Human achievement index 2017 ==\nSince 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nFootballPhuket City football club participates in Thai League 3 Lower Region, the third tier of Thai football league system. The Golden Sloop (Thai:\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e43\u0e1a\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e07) plays their home matches at Surakul Stadium.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nTwo Heroines Monument (\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e38\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e27\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e27\u0e35\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35), is the monument in Thalang District, a memorial statue of the heroines Thao Thep Kasattri (Kunying Jan) and Thao Sri Sunthon (Mook), who rallied islanders in 1785 to repel Burmese invaders. As the island's governor had just died, the organization of Phuket's defense against the Burmese invasion of 1785 was conducted by his widow, Thao Thep Kasattri. With her sister's help, they assembled what forces they had, then disguised local women as male soldiers, a ruse to swell the ranks of the defenders. After a month's siege, the Burmese invaders became exhausted and withdrew. King Rama I awarded Kunying Jan with the royal title of Thao Thep Kasattri.\nThalang National Museum (\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e18\u0e20\u0e31\u0e13\u0e11\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e19\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e07\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e15\u0e34 \u0e16\u0e25\u0e32\u0e07) is near the Two Heroines Monument. In 1985, on the 200th anniversary of the Thalang War, the Thalang National Museum was established. The museum contains a permanent exhibition of life in old Phuket, ancient artifacts, remains discovered on the coast, and materials used during war with Burma.\nHat Karon (\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e14\u0e01\u0e30\u0e23\u0e19) is the second largest of Phuket's tourist beaches, approximately 20 kilometres (12 mi) from town. Large resort complexes line the road behind the shoreline, but the broad beach itself has no development. The southern point has a coral reef stretching toward Kata and Poo Island. There is also its smaller sister beach, Karon Noi.\nKamala Beach, Hat Kamala is a large beach approximately 16 km (10 mi) north of Patong Beach. The beach is undeveloped with coral reefs on the north side and surfing in the low season. It is a tourist beach in the high season and a sleepy seaside Muslim village in the low season. There is a market on Wednesday and Friday nights, as well as a weekly Saturday market.\nView Point (\u0e08\u0e38\u0e14\u0e0a\u0e21\u0e27\u0e34\u0e27) is midway between Nai Harn and Kata Beaches. Kata Noi, Kata, Karon, and Ko Pu can be viewed from this point.\nLaem Phromthep (\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e) (Phromthep Cape) is a headland forming the extreme south end of Phuket. \"Phrom\" is Thai for the Hindu term \"Brahma\", signifying purity, and \"thep\" is Thai for \"God\". Local villagers used to refer to the cape as \"Laem Chao\", or the God's Cape, and it was an easily recognizable landmark for the early seafarers traveling up the Malay Peninsula.\nWat Chalong (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e09\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e44\u0e0a\u0e22\u0e18\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e21) is where stands the cast statue of Luang Pho Cham, who helped the people of Phuket put down the Angyee, or Chinese Coolie Rebellion, in 1876 during the reign of Rama V. There are also statues of Luang Pho Chuang, and Luang Pho Cham, abbots of the temple during later times.\nPhuket Pearl Farm located about one kilometer offshore from Phuket's east coast close to coconut island. Phuket Pearl Farm can be accessed only by boat.\nKhao Phra Thaeo Wildlife Conservation Development and Extension Centre (\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35\u0e1e\u0e31\u0e12\u0e19\u0e32\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e48\u0e07\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e21\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e38\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e4c\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e15\u0e27\u0e4c\u0e1b\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e02\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e41\u0e17\u0e27) is a center for study of the environment. Its duty is to promote and distribute wildlife within Khao Phra Thaeo wildlife park. The park is forested and also conserves a number of wild animals that would otherwise have gone extinct in Phuket.\nThe Big Buddha of Phuket, \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e38\u0e17\u0e18\u0e21\u0e34\u0e48\u0e07\u0e21\u0e07\u0e04\u0e25\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e40\u0e19\u0e32\u0e04\u0e04\u0e35\u0e23\u0e35  (Phra Phutta Ming Mongkol Akenakiri or Ming Mongkol Buddha), is on the peak of a mountain near Muang Phuket, or Phuket town (\u0e20\u0e39\u0e40\u0e01\u0e47\u0e15). The image is 45 m in height and covered in white Burmese marble.\nPhuket Butterfly Garden and Insect World, \u0e2a\u0e27\u0e19\u0e1c\u0e35\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e42\u0e25\u0e01\u0e41\u0e21\u0e25\u0e07\u0e20\u0e39\u0e40\u0e01\u0e47\u0e15 is one of the very few remaining butterfly gardens in Thailand.\nOld Phuket Town  in Phuket town, around Thalang, Dibuk, Yaowarat, Phang Nga, and Krabi Roads. The architecture is Sino-Portuguese-style.\nPhuket Aquarium  attracts around 300,000 visitors each year. Established in 1983 as part of the Phuket Marine Biological Center (PMBC), it is a research and monitoring station within the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources (DMCR).\nAquaria Phuket opened on August 24, 2019, featuring more than 51,000 aquatic animals from more than 300 species. The aquarium, with a combined water capacity of seven million liters, has both saltwater and freshwater animals and is located at the Central Phuket Floresta shopping complex.\n\n\n== Local culture ==\nThao Thep Krasattri and Thao Si Sunthon Fair (\u0e07\u0e32\u0e19\u0e17\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e29\u0e31\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35 - \u0e17\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23) is held on March 13 every year to commemorate the two heroines who rallied the Thalang people to repel Burmese invaders.\nVegetarian Festival or Nine Emperor gods Festival (Hokkien Chinese language: \u4e5d\u7687\u52dd\u6703\uff0cKi\u00fa-H\u00f4ng S\u0113ng-Hu\u0113 or \u4e5d\u7687\u723a, Ki\u00fa-H\u00f4ng I\u00e2) Phuket Chinese people Call \u98df\u83dc\u7bc0\uff0cTsia\u030dh-tsh\u00e0i (\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e01\u0e32\u0e25\u0e01\u0e34\u0e19\u0e40\u0e08(\u0e01\u0e34\u0e19\u0e1c\u0e31\u0e01-\u0e40\u0e08\u0e35\u0e4a\u0e22\u0e30\u0e09\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22)) is held on the first day of the 9th Chinese lunar month (end-Sep or early-Oct). Phuket islanders of Chinese ancestry commit themselves to a nine-day vegetarian diet, a form of purification believed to help make the forthcoming year trouble-free.  The festival is marked by several ascetic displays, including fire-walking and ascending sharp-bladed ladders.\nGhost Festival or Ph\u00f3o-t\u014do Festival (Hokkien Chinese language: \u666e\u6e21\u7bc0\uff09 Full name is \u00db-l\u00e2n-ph\u00fbn S\u0113ng-Hu\u0113 (Hokkien Chinese language: \u76c2\u862d\u76c6\u52dd\u6703\uff09 is held on the middle day of the 7th Chinese lunar month. Intrinsic to the Ghost Festival is ancestor worship. Activities include preparing food offerings, burning incense, and burning joss paper, a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 form of material items such as clothes, gold, and other goods for the visiting spirits. Elaborate meals (often vegetarian) are served with empty seats for each of the deceased in the family. Other festivities may include, buying and releasing miniature paper boats and lanterns on water, which signifies giving direction to lost souls.\nPhuket King's Cup Regatta (\u0e07\u0e32\u0e19\u0e41\u0e02\u0e48\u0e07\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e43\u0e1a\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e07\u0e16\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e17\u0e32\u0e19) is held every December. The Kata Beach Resort hosts yachtsmen, largely from neighbouring countries who compete for trophies.\nLaguna Phuket Triathlon (\u0e25\u0e32\u0e01\u0e39\u0e19\u0e48\u0e32\u0e20\u0e39\u0e40\u0e01\u0e47\u0e15\u0e44\u0e15\u0e23\u0e01\u0e35\u0e2c\u0e32) is held each December. The triathlon (a 1,800 metres (5,900 ft) swim, a 55 kilometres (34 mi) bike race and a 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) run and a 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) fun run) attracts athletes from all over the world.\nPhuket Travel Fair (\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e01\u0e32\u0e25\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e14\u0e24\u0e14\u0e39\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e17\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e22\u0e27\u0e08\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e20\u0e39\u0e40\u0e01\u0e47\u0e15), starting 1 November, is usually called the Patong Carnival, from the place where celebrations occur. Colourful parades, sports events, and a beauty competition for foreign tourists are major activities. A popular festival, the Patong Carnival opening drew over 30,000 foreign and Thai tourists.\nChao Le (Sea Gypsy) Boat Floating Festival (\u0e07\u0e32\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e13\u0e35\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e27\u0e40\u0e25) falls during the middle of the sixth and eleventh lunar months yearly. The sea gypsy villages at Rawai and Sapam hold their ceremonies on the 13th; Ko Si-re celebrates on the 14th; and Laem La (east of the bridge on Phuket's northern tip) on the 15th. Ceremonies, which centre on the setting small boats adrift similar to the Thai festival of Loi Krathong, are held at night and their purpose is to drive away evil and bring good luck.\nPhuket Bike Week is the biggest motorcycle event in Asia. Motorcyclists with their motorcycles and visitors from many countries join this event in every year.

        "wiki": "Google Street View was first introduced in the United States on May 25, 2007, and until November 26, 2008, featured camera icon markers, each representing at least one major city or area (such as a park), and usually the other nearby cities, towns, suburbs, and parks. Many areas that had coverage were represented by icons.\n\n\n== Key additions ==\n\nOn May 25, 2007, Street View was announced.\nOn May 30, 2007, at the Where 2.0 Conference, Immersive Media was identified as the contractor that captured the imagery for four of the five cities initially mapped by Street View, using its patented dodecahedral camera array on a moving car. Immersive Media continued to do image capture for Street View until Google developed its own capability to do so. Since July 2007, Google has used imagery that belongs exclusively to Google.\nOn April 16, 2008, Street View was fully integrated into Google Earth 4.3.\nOn May 12, 2008, Google announced that it was testing face-blurring technology on its photos of the busy streets of Manhattan. The technology uses a computer algorithm to search Google's image database for faces and blurs them, according to John Hanke, director of Google Earth and Google Maps.\nOn June 10, 2008, two other features included in the update were an effective mask of the \"Google Car\" and the application of face-blurring technology on all photos, which effectively lowered the resolution across all photos, even the formerly impressive high resolution images of San Francisco. Also, many nearby metro areas were included, but they did not receive their own camera icons.\nOn July 2, 2008, Google Street View was introduced in France and Italy, providing the first service outside the United States and the debut of Google's new 4th Generation Cameras. On this day, 19 camera icons were added, mostly showing small towns and areas along the Tour de France route and part of northwestern Italy.\nOn August 4, 2008, 28 icons of major metropolitan areas of both Australia and Japan were added to Google Street View. Included in the update were approximately 40 new U.S. hub cities.\nOn November 26, 2008, the Street View button and all the camera icons were deleted. Instead of clicking the \"Street View\" button, this is now accessed using the \"pegman\" button in the left hand corner. When the \"pegman\" icon is dragged over the map blue polylines appear where Street View is available and a small window will show the current Street View. If this is dropped on the map the Street View opens and takes over the whole map window.\nOn December 1, 2008, New Zealand was added to Google Street View. Faces were blurred upon recommendation by the New Zealand Privacy Commission, but vehicle registration plates were not obscured.\nOn April 9, 2009, Street View became available with a full-screen option.\nOn June 5, 2009, Smart Navigation was introduced which allows users to navigate around the panoramas by double-clicking with their cursor on any place or object they want to see.\nIn mid-June 2010, Google added blue dots to its maps that display user-submitted images in all locations around the world, including land areas where Street View is not available and bodies of water. These images can be pulled up on the screen in the same manner as a Street View image with the pegman by dragging it onto the blue dot.\nOn October 30, 2012, Google announced that users could contribute to Street View by creating a panorama-like image from the Galaxy Nexus smartphone to share on Google Maps.\nOn February 14, 2013, Wii Street U was released for the Wii U.\nOn June 27, 2013, Google announced that users could contribute to Street View by creating a panorama-like image from the Galaxy non-Nexus smartphone to share on Google Maps.\nOn April 23, 2014, a new historical Street View option was introduced to new Google Maps. The date of panoramas can be selected from the timeline.\nStarting in August 2017, Google allows users to create their own street view-like blue paths, for the connected photospheres that are sufficiently close to one another.\n\n\n== Timeline of introductions ==\n\n\n=== 2007 ===\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n\n=== 2009 ===\n\n\n=== 2010 ===\n\n\n=== 2011 ===\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\n\n\n=== 2013 ===\n\n\n=== 2014 ===\n\n\n=== 2015 ===\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\n\n=== 2017 ===\n\n\n=== 2018 ===\n\n\n=== 2019 ===\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\n* Limited coverage.\n\n\n== Coverage by country \u03bfr territory ==\nBelow is a table showing the countries available on Street View and the year they were first added.

        "wiki": "Phuket (; Thai: \u0e20\u0e39\u0e40\u0e01\u0e47\u0e15, [p\u02b0\u016b\u02d0.k\u00e8t] (listen), Malay: Talang or Tanjung Salang) is one of the southern provinces (changwat) of Thailand. It consists of the island of Phuket, the country's largest island, and another 32 smaller islands off its coast. It lies off the west coast of Thailand in the Andaman Sea. Phuket Island is connected by the Sarasin Bridge to Phang Nga Province to the north. The next nearest province is Krabi, to the east across Phang Nga Bay.\nPhuket Province has an area of 576 square kilometres (222 sq mi), somewhat less than that of Singapore, and is the second-smallest province of Thailand. The island was on one of the major trading routes between India and China, and was frequently mentioned in foreign ships' logs of Portuguese, French, Dutch, and English traders, but was never colonised by a European power. It formerly derived its wealth from tin and rubber and now from tourism.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThere are several possible derivations of the relatively recent name \"Phuket\" (of which the digraph ph represents an aspirated p). One theory is it is derived from the word Bukit (Jawi: \u0628\u0648\u0643\u064a\u062a) in Malay which means \"hill\", as this is what the island appears like from a distance.\nPhuket was formerly known as Thalang (\u0e16\u0e25\u0e32\u0e07 Tha-Laang), derived from the old Malay \"telong\" (Jawi: \u062a\u0644\u0648\u06a0) which means \"cape\". The northern district of the province, which was the location of the old capital, still uses this name. In Western sources and navigation charts, it was known as Junk Ceylon or Junkceylon (a corruption of the Malay Tanjung Salang, i.e., \"Cape Salang\").\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nPhuket is the largest island in Thailand. It is in the Andaman Sea in southern Thailand. The island is mostly mountainous with a mountain range in the west of the island from the north to the south. The mountains of Phuket form the southern end of the Phuket mountain range, which ranges for 440 kilometres (270 mi) from the Kra Isthmus.\n\nAlthough some recent geographical works refer to the sections of the Tenasserim Hills in the isthmus as the \"Phuket Range\", these names are not found in classical geographic sources. Besides, the name Phuket is relatively recent having previously been named Jung Ceylon and Thalang. The highest elevation of the island is usually regarded as Khao Mai Thao Sip Song (Twelve Canes), at 529 metres (1,736 ft) above sea level. However, it has been reported by barometric pressure readings that there is an even higher elevation (with no apparent name), of 542 meters above sea level, in the Kamala hills behind Kathu waterfall.Its population was 249,446 in 2000, rising to 525,709 in the 2010 decennial census, the highest growth rate of all provinces nationwide at 7.4 percent annually. Some 600,000 people reside on Phuket currently, among them migrants, international ex-pats, Thais registered in other provinces, and locals. The registered population, however, includes only Thais who are registered in a \"tabien baan\" or house registration book, which most are not, and the end of 2012 was 360,905 persons.Phuket is approximately 863 kilometres (536 mi) south of Bangkok and covers an area of 543 square kilometres (210 sq mi) excluding small islets. It is estimated that Phuket would have a total area of approximately 576 square kilometres (222 sq mi) if all its outlying islands were included. Other islands are:\nKo Lone 4.77 square kilometres (1.84 sq mi), Ko Maprao 3.7 square kilometres (1.4 sq mi), Ko Naka Yai 2.08 square kilometres (0.80 sq mi), Ko Racha Noi 3.06 square kilometres (1.18 sq mi), Ko Racha Yai 4.5 square kilometres (1.7 sq mi), and the second biggest, Ko Sire 8.8 square kilometres (3.4 sq mi).\nThe island's length, from north to south, is 48 kilometres (30 mi) and its width is 21 kilometres (13 mi).Seventy percent of Phuket's area is covered with mountains which stretch from north to south. The remaining 30 percent are plains in the central and eastern parts of the island. It has a total of nine brooks and creeks but does not have any major rivers.\nForest, rubber, and palm oil plantations cover 60 percent of the island. The west coast has several sandy beaches. The east coast beaches are more often muddy. Near the southernmost point is Laem Phromthep (Thai: \u0e41\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e)(\"Brahma's Cape\"), a popular viewpoint. In the mountainous north of the island is the Khao Phra Thaeo No-Hunting Area, protecting more than 20 km\u00b2 of the rainforest. The three highest peaks of this reserve are the Khao Prathiu (384 metres (1,260 ft)), Khao Bang Pae 388 metres (1,273 ft), and Khao Phara 422 metres (1,385 ft). The Sirinat National Park on the northwest coast was established in 1981 to protect an area of 90 square kilometres (35 sq mi) (68 kilometres (42 mi) marine area), including the Nai Yang Beach where sea turtles lay their eggs.The most popular (and overcrowded) tourist area on Phuket is Patong Beach on the central west coast, perhaps owing to the easy access to its wide and long beach. Most of Phuket's nightlife and its shopping is in Patong, and the area has become increasingly developed. Patong means \"the forest filled with banana leaves\" in Thai. South of Patong lie Karon Beach, Kata Beach, Kata Noi Beach, and around the southern tip of the island, Nai Han Beach and Rawai. To the north of Patong are Kamala Beach, Surin Beach, and Bang Tao Beach. These areas are generally much less developed than Patong. To the southeast is Bon Island and to the south are several coral islands. The Similan Islands lie to the northwest and the Phi Phi Islands which are part of Krabi Province, to the southeast.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Phuket features a tropical monsoon climate (Am). Due to its proximity to the equator, in the year, there is a little variation in temperatures. The city has an average annual high of 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) and an annual low of 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). Phuket has a dry season that runs from December to March and a wet season that covers the remaining eight months. However, like many cities that feature a tropical monsoon climate, Phuket sees some precipitation even during its dry season. Phuket averages roughly 2,200 millimetres (87 in) of rain.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 16th-18th century: European contact ===\nThe Portuguese explorer Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto arrived in Siam in 1545. His accounts of the country go beyond Ayutthaya and include a reasonably detailed account of ports in the south of the Kingdom as well. Pinto was one of the first European explorers to detail Phuket in his travel accounts. He referred to the island as \"Junk Ceylon\", a name the Portuguese used for Phuket Island in their maps, mentioning the name seven times in his accounts. Pinto said that Junk Ceylon was a destination port where trading vessels made regular stops for supplies and provisions. However, during the mid-16th century, the island was in decline due to pirates and often rough and unpredictable seas, which deterred merchant vessels from visiting the island. Pinto mentioned several other notable port cities in his accounts, including Patani and Ligor, which is modern-day Nakhon Si Thamarat.In the 17th century, the Dutch, English and, after the 1680s, the French, competed for the opportunity to trade with Junk Ceylon, which was a rich source of tin. In September 1680, a ship of the French East India Company visited the island and left with a full cargo of tin.A year or two later, the Siamese King Narai, seeking to reduce Dutch and English influence, named as governor a French medical missionary, Brother Ren\u00e9 Charbonneau, a member of the Siam mission of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Missions \u00c9trang\u00e8res. Charbonneau remained as governor until 1685.\n\nIn 1685, King Narai confirmed the French tin monopoly in Phuket to their ambassador, the Chevalier de Chaumont. Chaumont's former ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel, Sieur de Billy, was named governor of the island. However, the French were expelled from Siam after the 1688 Siamese revolution. On 10 April 1689, Desfarges led an expedition to re-capture Thalang to restore French control in Siam. His occupation of the island led to nothing, and Desfarges returned to Puducherry in January 1690.\n\n\n==== 1785: Burmese invasion ====\n\nBefore the Burmese attacked Thalang in 1785 during the \"Nine Armies' Wars\", Francis Light, a British East India Company captain (and later founder of Penang), who had been based on the island for some years, notified the local administration that he had observed Burmese forces preparing to attack. The island's military governor had just died, so the Burmese thought that it could be easily seized. Than Phu Ying Chan, the widow of the recently deceased governor, and her sister Mook (\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e21\u0e38\u0e01)  ordered the women of the island to dress as soldiers and take positions on the Thalang city walls. The Burmese called off their attack due to the perceived strength of the defences. Short of food, they retreated. After a month-long siege of the capital city, the Burmese were forced to retreat on 13 March 1785. The two women became local heroines, receiving the royal titles Thao Thep Kasattri and Thao Si Sunthon from a grateful King Rama I.The seal of Phuket is a depiction of the Two Heroines Monument along Highway 402 in Phuket. This commemorates the sisters The seal is a circle surrounded by a kranok pattern and has been used since 1985.\n\n\n=== 19th\u201320th centuries ===\nDuring the reign of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) from 1 October 1868 to 23 October 1910, Phuket became the administrative centre of the tin-producing southern provinces. His reign was characterized by the modernization of Siam, governmental and social reforms, and territorial concessions to the British and French. As Siam was threatened by Western expansionism, Chulalongkorn managed to save Siam from colonization.\nIn 1933 Monthon Phuket (\u0e21\u0e13\u0e11\u0e25\u0e20\u0e39\u0e40\u0e01\u0e47\u0e15) was dissolved and Phuket became a province.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\n\n==== 2004 tsunami ====\n\nOn 26 December 2004, Phuket and other nearby areas on Thailand's west coast suffered damage when they were struck by a tsunami caused by the Indian Ocean earthquake. The waves destroyed several highly populated areas in the region, killing up to 5,300 people in Thailand, and two hundred thousand more throughout the Asian region. Some 250 were reported dead in Phuket, including foreign tourists. Almost all of the major beaches on the west coast of Phuket, especially Kamala, Patong, Karon, and Kata sustained major damage, with some damage caused to resorts and villages on the island's southern beaches. Thailand's hardest-hit area was the Takua Pa District of Phang Nga Province north of Phuket, where a thousand or more Burmese workers building new beach resorts died.\nIn December 2006, Thailand launched the first of 22 tsunami-detection buoys to be positioned around the Indian Ocean as part of a regional warning system. The satellite-linked deep-sea buoys float 1,000 km (620 mi) offshore, roughly midway between Thailand and Sri Lanka.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs with most of Thailand, the majority of the population is Buddhist, but there is a significant number of Muslims (20 percent) in Phuket, mainly descendants of the island's original sea-dwelling people. Among the Muslims, many are of Malay descent. People of Chinese ancestry make up an even larger population, many of whom are descendants of the tin miners who migrated to Phuket during the 19th century. Peranakans, known as \"Phuket Babas\" in the local tongue, constitute a fair share of Chinese community members, particularly among those who have family ties with the Peranakans of Penang and Malacca.Phuket provincial population in the preliminary count of the 2010 census was counted to be 525,018 people, including some 115,881 expatriates, or 21.1 per cent of the population. However, it is admitted this is inaccurate since The Phuket Provincial Employment Office currently records for more than 64,000 Burmese, Lao and Cambodian workers legally residing on the island. The Thai census figure for 2015 shows a population of 386,605 persons.The number of people on Phuket island swells to over a million during the high season, as tourists, mainly from Western Europe, China, Russia, and the United States flock to Phuket around Christmas.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\n\n=== Provincial government ===\nPhuket is divided into three districts (amphoe), which are further divided into 17 subdistricts (tambon), and 103 villages (muban).\n\nMueang Phuket\nKathu\nThalang\n\n\n=== Local government ===\nAs of 26 November 2019 there are: one Phuket Provincial Administration Organisation (ongkan borihan suan changwat) and 12 municipal (thesaban) areas in the province. Phuket has city (thesaban nakhon) status. Kathu and Patong have town (thesaban mueang) status.  Further 9 subdistrict municipalities (thesaban tambon). The non-municipal areas are administered by 6 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (ongkan borihan suan tambon).\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nTin mining was a major source of income for the island from the 16th century until petering out in the 20th century. In modern times, Phuket's economy has rested on two pillars: rubber tree plantations (making Thailand the biggest producer of rubber in the world) and tourism.Since the 1980s, the sandy beaches on the west coast of the island have been developed as tourist destinations, with Patong, Karon, and Kata being the most popular. Since the 2004 tsunami, all damaged buildings and attractions have been restored. Phuket is being intensely developed, with many new hotels, apartments, and houses under construction. \nIn July 2005, Phuket was voted one of the world's top five retirement destinations by Fortune Magazine.In 2017, Phuket received about 10 million visitors, most of them foreign, with China the leading contributor. Tourists generated some 385 billion baht in revenues, nearly 14 percent of the 2.77 trillion baht earned by the nation as a whole.The first half of 2019 saw a dip in the number of tourists visiting Phuket, driving lower hotel occupancy rates leading to increased price competition. RevPAR (revenue per available room) is down. A decline in the number of tourists, combined with an oversupply of hotel rooms, is the root of the problem.  Despite falling numbers, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) claims that tourism revenues have risen by 3.1% in the first half of 2019.\nNo one seems to know how many hotel rooms Phuket has available. Oxfam says it has 60,000 hotel rooms for its 9.1 million annual visitors. The Bangkok Post in September 2019 reported that Phuket has 600 hotels with 40,000 rooms.. Three weeks earlier it said that Phuket had 93,941 hotel rooms available, excluding villas and hostels, with an additional 15,000 projected to become available by 2024.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\nAir\n\nPhuket International Airport (HKT) commenced a 5.7 billion baht (US$185.7 million) expansion in September 2012, scheduled for completion on 14 February 2016. The airport will increase its annual handling capacity from 6.5 million to 12.5 million passengers, and add a new international terminal.\nRailThere is currently no rail line to Phuket. Trains run to Surat Thani 230 km away.\n\nCity transitSongthaews are a common mode of transport on Phuket. Phuket's songthaews are larger than those found in other areas of Thailand.

Old Phuket Town is noted for Sino-Portuguese buildings on both sides of the street. Many old buildings have been converted into shops, hotels, restaurants, and museums.\n\n\n== History ==\nPhuket has a rich history as tin-mining country peopled by Siamese, Chinese, Malays, Indians, Eurasians, and sea gypsies. A unique community in Phuket are the \"Baba\", with their own way of life, language, dress, and food. The core of this community was formed by early unions between Hokkien tin-miners and Siamese women. This distinctive Baba heritage can be seen in Old Phuket Town.Since the 16th century, Europeans have been involved in the tin trade of Phuket. In the 18th century, much of the island's tin mining was carried out by Hokkien Chinese who were instrumental in building the old part of the city. In the early-20th century, under Governor Phraya Rassada Nupradit, major European mining companies were invited in, and major public infrastructure such as roads and canals was built. No one knows exactly when the first building in this style was constructed, but photographs from the reign of King Rama V (1853\u20131910) show that it was already well established by then. Two styles of building in particular stand out: the shop-house (Sino-Portuguese style) and the big mansion (Sino-Colonial style).\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nChina Inn Cafe and Restaurant\nThe House of the Beautiful Images coffee shop\nThai Hua Museum\nBaan Chinpracha Museum\nPhra Pitak Chinpracha Mansion\nPhuket Provincial Hall\nPhuket Philatelic Museum\nOn On Hotel\nKopitiam Restaurant\n\n\n== References ==\nFootnotes\nSourceslestariheritage.net\nphuket.com",

        "wiki": "Buddhism is the largest religion in Thailand, which is practiced by 95% of the population. There is no official state religion in the Thai constitution, which guarantees religious freedom for all Thai citizens, though the king is required by law to be a Theravada Buddhist. The main religion practised in Thailand is Buddhism, but there is a strong undercurrent of Hinduism with a class of brahmins having sacerdotal functions. The large Thai Chinese population also practises Chinese folk religions, including Taoism. The Chinese religious movement Yiguandao (Thai: Anuttharatham) spread to Thailand in the 1970s and it has grown so much in recent decades to come into conflict with Buddhism; in 2009, it was reported that each year 200,000 Thais convert to the religion. Many other people, especially among the Isan ethnic group, practise Tai folk religions. A significant Muslim population, mostly constituted by Thai Malays, is present especially in the southern regions.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to official census data approximate 95% of Thais follow Buddhism. However, the religious life of the country is more complex than how it is portrayed by such statistics. Of the large Thai Chinese population, most of those who follow Buddhism have been integrated into the dominant Theravada tradition, with only a negligible minority having retained Chinese Buddhism. Otherwise, a large part of the Thai Chinese have retained the practice of ethnic Chinese religion, including Taoism, Confucianism and Chinese salvationist religions (such as Yiguandao and the Church of Virtue). Despite being practised freely, these religions have no official recognition, and their followers are counted as Theravada Buddhists in statistical studies. Also, many Thai and Isan practise their ethnic Tai folk religion.\nMuslims are the second largest religious group in Thailand at 4% to 5% of the population. Thailand's southernmost provinces \u2014 Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat and part of Songkhla and Chumphon \u2014 have large populations of Muslims, consisting of both ethnic Thai and Malay. \nChristians, mainly Catholics, represent just over 1% of the population. A small but influential community of Sikhs in Thailand and some Hindus, mostly live in the country's cities and are engaged in retail commerce. There is also a small Jewish community in Thailand, dating back to the 17th century.\n\n\n== Censuses ==\n\n\n=== Religions by region ===\nAccording to the 2015 census, 67,328,562 Thailand residents in the different regions of the country belonged to the following religious groups:\n\n\n== Main religions ==\n\n\n=== Buddhism ===\n\nBuddhism in Thailand is largely of the Theravada school. Over 90% of Thailand's population adheres to such school, though Thai Buddhism is practised alongside Chinese indigenous religions by the large Thai Chinese population, and alongside Hinduism by the Thais.Buddhist temples in Thailand are characterised by tall golden stupas, and the Buddhist architecture of Thailand is similar to that in other Southeast Asian countries, especially Cambodia and Laos, which share a cultural and historical heritage with Thailand.\n\n\n=== Ethnic religions ===\n\n\n==== Chinese folk religion ====\n\nMany within the large Thai Chinese population practise various Chinese religions, including the worship of local gods, Chinese ancestral worship, Taoism, Confucianism and Chinese salvationist religions. One of the latter, Yiguandao (Thai: Anuttharatham), spread to Thailand since the 1970s, and it has grown so popular to come into conflict with Buddhism; in 2009 there were more than 7000 Yiguandao churches in the country and approximately 200.000 people convert each year into the religion. Despite the large number of followers and temples these religions have no state recognition, their temples are not counted as places of worship, and their followers are counted as \"Theravada Buddhists\" in officially released religious figures. Chinese temples are called sanchao in Thai language.The Chinese folk religion of Thailand has developed local features, including the worship of local gods. Major Chinese festivals such as Nian, Zhongqiu, and Qingming, are widely celebrated, especially in Bangkok, Phuket, and other parts of Thailand where there are large Chinese populations.The Chinese in the city of Phuket practise a nine-day vegetarian festival between September and October. During the festive season, devotees will abstain from meat and mortification of the flesh by Chinese mediums is also commonly seen. The rites and rituals are devoted to the veneration of Tua Pek Kong. Such traditions were developed during the 19th century in Phuket by the local Chinese with influences from Thai culture.\n\n\n==== Thai folk religion ====\n\nMany Thais and Isan practise distinctive indigenous religions characterised by worship of local gods and ancestors. They are very similar to the Chinese folk religion.\n\n\n==== Hinduism ====\n\nSeveral thousand Hindus of Indian origin live in Thailand, mainly in the larger cities. Besides this group of \"traditional Hindus\", Thailand in its earliest days was under the rule of the Khmer Empire, which had strong Hindu roots, and the influence among Thais remains even today. The popular Ramakien epic is based on the Hindu Ramayana. The former capital of Ayutthaya was named for Ayodhya, the Indian birthplace of the Hindu god Rama.\nThere is a class of  brahmins who perform rituals for Hindu gods. Brahmin rituals are still common, including the use of holy strings for blessing and pouring of lustral water from conch shells. Hindu deities are worshipped by many Thais despite their official Buddhism, and statues and shrines of Brahma, Ganesh, Indra, Shiva, Vishnu, Lakshmi and other Hindu gods are a common sight (for example the Erawan Shrine area). Another relic of Hinduism is Garuda, now a symbol of the monarchy.\n\n\n== Abrahamic religions ==\n\n\n=== Islam ===\n\nAccording to the 2015 census, Thailand has 2,892,311 Muslims, or 4.29% of the total population. 2,227,613 of these Muslims are concentrated in the southern region of the country, where they represent up to 24.33% of the population.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\n\nChristianity was introduced by European missionaries as early as the 1550s, when Portuguese mercenaries and their chaplain arrived in Ayutthaya. Historically, it has played a significant role in the modernisation of Thailand, notably in social and educational institutions. As of 2015 just over one percent of the population of Thailand are Christians. Of that group, 400,000 are estimated to be Catholics.Thailand's Department of Religion, currently under the Ministry of Culture, has formally recognised five major Christian churches/denominations: the Roman Catholic Church, the Southern Baptists, the Seventh-day Adventists, the Church of Christ in Thailand, and the Evangelical Fellowship of Thailand. Although not officially recognised, missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) have been active in Thailand for decades, though their converts are comparatively few.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\n\nJudaism in Thailand dates back to the 17th century, with the arrival of a few Baghdadi Jewish families. The present community consists of both Ashkenazi (for instance the expatriate community plus some descendants of refugees from imperial Russia and later the Soviet Union), and Sephardi Jews, who were born in such places as Afghanistan, Iran and Syria, and wealthy gem traders. Most of the Jewish community in Thailand, consisting of an estimated 2,000 residents, reside in Bangkok, although there are at any given time thousands of tourists (some long-term) coming primarily from Israel. There are Jewish synagogues in Phuket, Chiang Mai, and Ko Samui, but no community there.\n\n\n== Other religions ==\n\n\n=== Sikhism ===\n\nThe first Sikh known to have come to Thailand was Ladha Singh, who arrived in 1890. Other Sikhs joined him in the early 1900s, and by 1911 more than a hundred Sikh families had settled in Thailand, mainly in Thonburi Region. There were at that time no gurdwaras (Sikh temples), and religious prayers were held in private homes every Sunday and on gurpurab days. The Sikh community continued to grow, and in 1912 it was decided to build a gurdwara. It stands today in Bangkok's Pahurat area and imitates the Golden Temple in Amritsar Punjab, India. A tiny but influential community of Sikhs live in the country's cities, most engaged in retail commerce.\n\n\n== Freedom of religion ==\n\nThai law provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respects this right in practice. It does not, however, register new religious groups that have not been accepted into one of the existing religious governing bodies on doctrinal or other grounds. In practice, unregistered religious organisations operate freely, and the government's practice of not recognising any new religious groups does not restrict the activities of unregistered religious groups.\nThe government officially limits the number of foreign missionaries that may work in the country, although unregistered missionaries are present in large numbers and are allowed to live and work freely. There have been no widespread reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice. However, in the far southern border provinces, continued separatist violence has resulted in mistrust in relations between the Buddhist and Muslim communities.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nKataoka, Tatsuki (December 2012). \"Religion as Non-religion: The Place of Chinese Temples in Phuket, Southern Thailand\".

        "wiki": "The culture of Thailand has evolved greatly over time, from its relative isolation during the Sukhothai era, to its more contemporary Ayutthaya era, which absorbed influences from all over Asia. Limited Indian, Chinese, Burmese and other Southeast Asian influences are still evident in traditional Thai culture. Buddhism, Animism and Westernization also play a significant role in shaping the modern culture.\nThai national culture is identified differently throughout regions in Thailand where it also integrated different regional cultures such as the Lanna, Isan, including Chinese origin, Portuguese origin, Persian origin, and in the reign of King Chulalongkorn in the late-19th century, European trend of nationalism has began to insert greater influence into Thai culture. However, the promotion of civic culture reached its peak after the Siamese revolution of 1932 where series of authoritarian regimes began to insert greater control over people's culture and lifestyles, especially under the regime of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram.\nPresent day Thailand has a culture that is a combination of various local rituals from different parts of the country, along with Buddhist values and oriental trends like in many parts of Asia. Monarchy and royal institution of Chakri dynasty remain highly revered according to original Siamese culture, whereas societal values in Thailand tend to be more collectivist and religiously secular than in other Southeast Asian cultures which have undergone influences from western colonization.\n\n\n== Norms and lifestyle ==\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThailand is nearly 94.6 percent Buddhist 4.3% muslim and 1% christian, mainly of the Theravada school (which includes the Thai Forest Tradition and the Dhammayuttika Nikaya and Santi Asoke sects) and an unknown minority belonging to the Mahayana school. In addition there are minorities of Muslims in Thailand (5-6 percent), Christians (1 percent), and other religions. Thai Theravada Buddhism is supported and overseen by the government, with monks receiving a number of government benefits, such as free use of public transportation.\nBuddhism in Thailand is strongly influenced by traditional beliefs regarding ancestral and natural spirits, which have been incorporated into Buddhist cosmology. Most Thai people install spirit houses (Thai: \u0e28\u0e32\u0e25\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e20\u0e39\u0e21\u0e34; RTGS: san phra phum), miniature houses outside their dwellings, where they believe household spirits live. They present offerings of food and drink to these spirits to keep them happy. If these spirits aren't happy, it is believed that they will inhabit the household and cause chaos. These spirit houses can be found in public places and on the streets of Thailand, where the public make offerings.Prior to the rise of Theravada Buddhism, both Indian Brahmanic religion and Mahayana Buddhism were present in Thailand. Influences from both these traditions can still be seen in present-day Thai folklore. Brahmanist shrines play an important role in Thai folk religion, and the Mahayana Buddhist influence is reflected in the presence of figures like Lokesvara, a form of the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara sometimes incorporated into Thailand's iconography.\n\n\n=== Customs ===\n\nThe traditional customs and the folklore of Thai people were gathered and described by Phya Anuman Rajadhon in the 20th century, at a time when modernity changed the face of Thailand and a great number of traditions disappeared or became adapted to modern life. Still, the striving towards refinement, rooted in ancient Siamese culture, consisting of promoting that which is refined and avoiding coarseness is a major focus of the daily life of Thai people and high on their scale of values.One of the most distinctive Thai customs is the wai. Used in greetings, leave-taking, as an acknowledgement, or accompanying an apology, it comes in many forms, reflecting the relative status of those involved. Generally the salutation involves a prayer-like gesture with the hands, derived from the A\u00f1jali Mudr\u0101 of the Indian subcontinent, and it also may include a slight bow of the head. This salutation is often accompanied by a serene smile symbolizing a welcoming disposition and a pleasant attitude. Thailand is often referred to as the \"land of smiles\" in tourist brochures.\nPublic displays of affection are not overly common in traditional Thai society, especially between lovers. It is becoming more common, especially among the younger generation.\nA notable social norm holds that touching someone on the head may be considered rude. It is also considered rude to place one's feet at a level above someone else's head, especially if that person is of higher social standing. This is because the Thai people consider the foot to be the dirtiest and lowliest part of the body, and the head the most respected and highest part of the body. This also influences how Thais sit when on the ground\u2014their feet always pointing away from others, tucked to the side or behind them. Pointing at or touching something with the feet is also considered rude. It was reported in the Thai press that pedestrians were prohibited from climbing stairs to the Victory Monument BTS Station when a royal motorcade was due to pass on the road beneath because, according to Thai custom, feet cannot be at any point above the head of a royal family member.\n\nSince a serene disposition is valued, conflict and sudden displays of anger are eschewed in Thai culture. For these reasons, visitors should take care not to create conflict or to display anger. Disagreements or disputes should be handled with a smile and no attempt should be made to assign blame to another. In everyday life in Thailand, there is a strong emphasis on the concept of sanuk, the idea that life should be fun. Because of this, Thais can be quite playful at work and during day-to-day activities. Displaying positive emotions in social interactions is also important in Thai culture.\nOften, Thais will deal with disagreements, minor mistakes, or misfortunes by using the phrase mai pen rai (Thai: \u0e44\u0e21\u0e48 \u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19 \u0e44\u0e23), translated as \"it doesn't matter\". The ubiquitous use of this phrase in Thailand reflects a disposition towards minimizing conflict, disagreements or complaints. A smile and the sentence \"mai pen rai\" indicates that the incident is not important and therefore there is no conflict or shame involved.\nRespect for hierarchy is a very important value for Thai people. The custom of bun khun emphasizes the indebtedness towards parents, as well as towards guardians, teachers, and caretakers. It describes the feelings and practices involved in certain relationships organized around generalized reciprocity, the slow-acting accounting of an exchange calculated according to locally interpreted scales and measures. It is also considered rude to step on any type of Thai currency (Thai coin or banknote) as they include a likeness of the King of Thailand.\nThere are a number of Thai customs relating to the special status of monks in Thai society. Thai monks are forbidden physical contact with women. Women are therefore expected to make way for passing monks to ensure that accidental contact does not occur. A variety of methods are employed to ensure that no incidental contact (or the appearance of such contact) between women and monks occurs. Women making offerings to monks place their donation at the feet of the monk, or on a cloth laid on the ground or a table. Powders or unguents intended to carry a blessing are applied to Thai women by monks using the end of a candle or stick. Laypersons are expected to sit or stand with their heads at a lower level than that of a monk. Within a temple, monks may sit on a raised platform during ceremonies to make this easier to achieve.\nWhen sitting in a temple, one is expected to point one's feet away from images of the Buddha. Shrines inside Thai residences are arranged so as to ensure that the feet are not pointed towards the religious icons, such as placing the shrine on the same wall as the head of a bed, if a house is too small to remove the shrine from the bedroom entirely.\nIt is also customary to remove one's footwear before entering a home or the sacred areas within a temple, and not to step on the threshold.\n\n\n=== Dress ===\n\n\n==== Traditional clothing ====\n\nTraditional Thai clothing is called chut thai (Thai: \u0e0a\u0e38\u0e14\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 Thai pronunciation: [t\u0255\u02b0\u00fat.t\u02b0ai]) which literally means \"Thai outfit\". It can be worn by men, women, and children. Chut thai for women usually consists of a pha nung or a chong kraben, a blouse, and a sabai. Northern and northeastern women may wear a sinh instead of a pha nung and a chong kraben with either a blouse or a suea pat. Chut thai for men includes a chong kraben or pants, a Raj pattern shirt, with optional knee-length white socks and a sabai. Chut thai for northern Thai men is composed of a sado, a white Manchu styled jacket, and sometimes a khian hua. In formal occasions, people may choose to wear a so-called formal Thai national costume.\n\n\n==== Uniforms ====\nThailand is a uniform-wearing society. From elementary school to university, school uniforms in Thailand are the norm, with few exceptions. Teachers at elementary and secondary levels wear uniforms, usually once a week. All civil servants up to ministerial level have uniforms appropriate to their organization and rank and wear them regularly.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\n\n==== Thai dining etiquette ====\nThai dining etiquette refers to the traditional and proper behaviors of Thai people while eating. Since Thai society has a lot of big families, so having a meal together and sharing the food between members of the family is Thai traditional dining style. Generally, Thais eat rice as the main food and share the rice side dishes with one another.\n\nTraditionally, in Thailand, people have a meal on the floor mat and eat the food with their right hands. The rice dishes are on the outer circle while the shared dishes are in the center of with shared spoons to transfer the side dish food to their own rice dish.\nIn the reign of King Mongkut (Rama IV); King Chulalongkorn the Great (Rama V), Prince Chulalongkorn at that time, was educated by an English woman, courted Western diplomats and leaders and travelled abroad. Observed and learnt western dining and he found out the fork and knife are not suitable for Thai food (no need to chop anything). He introduced the fork and spoon and so began the use of cutlery in Thailand. Thais use the fork to push the food onto the spoon (right hand), which then goes into your mouth instead of making the meat stable for the knife function. Nowadays, Thai dining is mixed with various countries\u2019 dining cultures, so Thai people use a lot of styles to eat not only with spoon and fork one but also chopstick, knife and bare hand as well.\n\n\n===== Regional Thai dining =====\n\nCentral Thailand: In central Thailand, sitting on a chair, eating at a table and using a fork, spoon and shared spoon are longstanding customs (Rama IV). For Thai rich family dining, variously shaped napkins are added on the table and also employ waiters or waitresses to serve the food and beverages beside the table. For some poor people the shared spoon is not used.\nNorthern Thailand: Thai northern people still preserve their traditional culture by using small food bowls and putting them on a kan tok (Thai northern small table). They are decorated with wood, pearl or yellowish gold. Sticky, glutinous rice is the main food eaten with shared dishes. It is contained in kratip song soong, high-height container for sticky rice. Next to the kan tok, there is kon tho din, an earthenware jar, and a kan ngeaun, a silver cup. After finishing the main course, the desserts are served and also buri chai yo, a cigarette, which is end of the meal.\nNortheastern Thailand, (Isan): Typically the food is served on a large flower-patterned circular zinc tray. The sticky rice contained in kra tip song taei (low-height container for sticky rice). Then the desserts are served.\nSouthern Thailand: The local people eat on a floor mat. The dishes are placed on the center of it. They sit in the circle and traditionally eat with their bare hands. The drinking water is contained in kan or jok, (a little cup). Nowadays, a fork and spoon are used instead of bare hands. Sitting on a chair and eating at a table now predominates. There are only few local people who still preserve the original dining style.\n\n\n===== Ways of serving food in Thailand =====\nThere are two main ways to serve Thai food, raad kao, individual dishes, and gap kao, separate dishes.\nIndividual dishes: In the past, Thai people had large families. Due to the difficulty of eating together at the same time, placing the rice side dish and the rice on the same dish and serving individually is to some extent supplanting the traditional Thai dining style.\nSeparated dishes: The rice side dishes are separately served with the rice (not same dish). Normally, this style is suitable for eating with others. The shared rice side dishes are in the center of the circle. Each has their own rice while the side dishes are shared by transferring them with the shared spoons to the individual rice dishes.\n\n\n===== Table settings =====\nIndividual dishes: The spoon is on the right and the fork is on the left side of the dish.\nShared dishes: For rice dishes, the spoon is on the right and the fork is on the left side of the dish. Shared dishes are placed in the center of the table with the serving spoons.\n\n\n===== Manners and customs =====\n\nOrdering: For shared dishes, the senior of the group orders his or her rice side dish first and then another selects dishes which everyone can eat, trying to balance a full range of tastes, ordering seafood, pork, shrimp, chicken, and vegetarian dishes. Spicy, sweet, salty, and bitter will all be represented, often all in one dish. Dishes are served serially as they are prepared, not all coming at once.\nDining: Thai people eat using a fork and spoon. The spoon acts as the main tool and the fork is the supporting tool pushing the food onto the spoon and a shared spoon is used to convey food from a shared dish to the diner's rice dish. Some people use their own spoon to scoop the food from the shared dish directly, but this is improper. If the shared dish is curry, it is transferred to an individual little cup first. Then they sip the soup from the spoon. Sipping it from the cup directly is improper. Making undue noise during eating and sipping is impolite in Thailand. Talking during the meal is de rigueur. Thai foods contain inedible bits such as lemongrass stalks. They are put on the edge of the dish or on a dish provided for refuse. After finishing eating, placing the spoon and fork down close together on the bowl or plate, gathering any remainders to one side of the dish and stacking the empty plates at the side of the table is a signal to the server that the table may be cleared. To be polite when using a toothpick, hide the mouth with one hand as you wield the toothpick with the other.\nBill: The bill is usually picked up and paid by the host or the wealthiest or most important or eldest person. If customers are friends the bills are usually paid separately.\n\n\n=== Birth traditions and beliefs ===\n\nTraditional principles concerning pregnancy and childbirth are largely influenced by folk beliefs, especially in rural areas of central and north Thailand. Modern practices follow the Western medical model.\n\n\n=== Nicknames ===\n\nThai people universally have one, or occasionally more, short nicknames (Thai: \u0e0a\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19 name-play) that they use with friends and family. Often first given shortly after birth by friends or an older family member, these nicknames are overwhelmingly one syllable (or worn down from two syllables to one). Though they may be simply shortened versions of a full name, they quite frequently have no relation to the person's full name and are often humorous and/or nonsense words. Babies may be given a nickname of a relative or named for a characteristic of birth, e.g., \"little\". Traditionally, nicknames would relate to things of low value, e.g., \"dirt\", which was to convince evil spirits lurking in the vicinity that the child was not worthy their attention. Today this folk custom is on the decline.\nSome common nicknames translate into English as \"small\", \"fatty\", \"pig\", \"little\", \"frog\", \"banana\", \"green\", or \"girl/boy\". Though rare, sometimes Thai children are given nicknames in the order they were born into the family (i.e., \"one\", \"two\", \"three\", etc.). Nicknames are useful because official Thai names are often long, particularly among Thais of Chinese descent, whose lengthy surnames stem from an attempt to translate Chinese names into Thai equivalents, or among Thai with similarly lengthy Sanskrit-derived names. In recent years, English language words have become popular nicknames. Examples include: \"Ice\" (\u0e44\u0e2d\u0e0b\u0e4c); \"Bank\" (\u0e41\u0e1a\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c); \"New\" (\u0e19\u0e34\u0e27); \"Ball\" (\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e25), and even \"Beer\" (\u0e40\u0e1a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e23\u0e4c).\n\n\n=== Marriage ===\n\nThai Buddhist marriage ceremonies are generally divided into two parts: a Buddhist component, which includes the recitation of prayers and the offering of food and other gifts to monks and images of the Buddha, and a non-Buddhist component rooted in folk traditions, which centers on the couple's families.\nIn former times, it was unknown for Buddhist monks to be present at any stage of the marriage ceremony itself. As monks were required to attend to the dead during funerals, their presence at a marriage (which was associated with fertility, and intended to produce children) was considered a bad omen. A couple would seek a blessing from their local temple before or after being married, and might consult a monk for astrological advice in setting an auspicious date for the wedding. The non-Buddhist portions of the wedding would take place away from the temple, and would often take place on a separate day.\nIn modern times, these prohibitions have been significantly relaxed. It is not uncommon for a visit to a temple to be made on the same day as the non-Buddhist portions of a wedding, or even for the wedding to take place within the temple. While a division is still commonly observed between the \"religious\" and \"secular\" portions of a wedding service, it may be as simple as the monks present for the Buddhist ceremony departing to take lunch once their role is complete.\nDuring the Buddhist component of the wedding service, the couple first bow before the image of the Buddha. They then recite certain basic Buddhist prayers or chants (typically including taking the Three Refuges and the Five Precepts), and light incense and candles before the image. The parents of the couple may then be called upon to \"connect\" them, by placing upon the heads of the bride and groom twin loops of string or thread that link the couple together. The couple may then make offerings of food, flowers, and medicine to the monks present. Cash gifts (usually placed in an envelope) may also be presented to the temple at this time.\nThe monks may then unwind a small length of thread that is held between the hands of the assembled monks. They begin a series of recitations of Pali scriptures intended to bring merit and blessings to the new couple. The string terminates with the lead monk, who may connect it to a container of water that will be \"sanctified\" for the ceremony. Merit is said to travel through the string and be conveyed to the water. A similar arrangement is used to transfer merit to the dead at a funeral, further evidence of the weakening of the taboo on mixing funerary imagery and trappings with marriage ceremonies. Blessed water may be mixed with wax drippings from a candle lit before the Buddha image and other unguents and herbs to create a paste that is then applied to the foreheads of the bride and groom to create a small dot, similar to the marking made with red ochre on Hindu devotees. The bride's mark is created with the butt end of the candle rather than the monk's thumb, in keeping with the Vinaya prohibition against touching women.\nThe highest-ranking monk present may elect to say a few words to the couple, offering advice or encouragement. The couple may then make offerings of food to the monks, at which point the Buddhist portion of the ceremony is concluded.\nThe Thai dowry system is known as the sin sot (Thai: \u0e2a\u0e34\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e2d\u0e14; RTGS: sin sot). It roughly translates to \"bride price\". The groom will be expected to pay a sum of money to the family, to compensate them for the loss of a daughter and to demonstrate that the groom is financially capable of taking care of their daughter. Bride prices of 50,000 to 300,000 baht have been documented, but bride prices can sometimes run into the tens of millions of baht. In many cases, the bride price is purely symbolic and will be returned to the bride and groom after the wedding has taken place. Whether the practice of sin sot is a tradition or a scam has been debated by critics. One observed, \"All that talk of face and argument for cherished tradition? It's a thinly veiled con. Behind that gobbledygook, it's the same old forces of the material world and about the parents getting enough cash to buy a new pickup, pay outstanding debts or acquire something to elevate their status.\" Actually, in the Thai culture the sin sot is an essential part of the marriage and no man would refuse it to the bride's family.Thailand outlawed marital rape in 2007.Thai people of Chinese origin may opt to mix marriage traditions; typically, they also seek monks. Other might choose to follow Chinese marriage customs, often performed in a simpler manner.\nThe religious components of marriage ceremonies between Thai Muslims are markedly different from those described above. The Imam of the local mosque, the groom, the father of the bride, men in the immediate family, and important men in the community sit in a circle during the ceremony, conducted by the Imam. All the women, including the bride, sit in a separate room and do not have any direct participation in the ceremony. The secular component of the ceremony, however, is often nearly identical to the secular part of Thai Buddhist wedding ceremonies. The only notable difference here is the type of meat served to guests (goat and/or beef instead of pork). Thai Muslims frequently, though not always, also follow the conventions of the Thai dowry system.\n\n\n=== Funerals ===\n\nTraditionally, funerals last for at least one week. Crying is discouraged during the funeral, so as not to worry the spirit of the deceased. Many activities surrounding the funeral are intended to make merit for the deceased. Copies of Buddhist scriptures may be printed and distributed in the name of the deceased, and gifts are usually given to a local temple. Monks are invited to chant prayers that are intended to provide merit for the deceased, as well as to provide protection against the possibility of the dead relative returning as a malicious spirit. A picture of the deceased from his/her best days will often be displayed next to the coffin. Often, a thread is connected to the corpse or coffin which is held by the chanting monks during their recitation; this thread is intended to transfer the merit of the monks' recitation to the deceased. The corpse is cremated, and the urn with the ash is usually kept in a chedi in the local temple.\nThai Chinese and Thai Muslim minorities bury their deceased according to the rituals of their respective communities.\nFuneral services are not restricted to humans. Funerals for pets, sometimes lavish, are not uncommon, particularly in Bangkok. One company that specializes in pet funerals cremates up to 400 animals per month. The owner says that, \"Bangkok is an extremely religious city ... those beliefs extend to all parts of life. Most of our customers realise that their pets can't gain enough merit on their own in this life, so it is up to them to do for them. Funerals are an obvious choice.\"\n\n\n=== National anthem and respect for the flag and king ===\nTwice a day, at 08:00 and again at 18:00, the national anthem is played by all Thai media outlets. Thais stop what they are doing and stand at attention to pay homage to the flag during the anthem. Students in school stand in front of the raised flag and sing the national anthem at 08:00 every school day. The practice dates from 1935 when the regulations for the raising and lowering of the colours was published in the Royal Gazette. The Flag Act of 1979 decreed that those who do not observe the custom by standing in silence during the anthem are subject to a fine of up to 2,000 baht and not more than one year in prison.In a related practice, the royal anthem of the King of Thailand is played before movies, concerts, and sporting events. All are expected to stand.\n\n\n=== Knowing one's place ===\nBangkok Post columnist Paritta Wangkiat maintains that Thais are expected to \"know their place\" in society and to be submissive. A result is that those from the lower ranks of the social order are often treated dismissively. People of different social classes are never treated equally in her view. As people fear to speak out about their rights, or those of others, submissiveness and deference to authority make the behaviour a \"perfect match for an authoritarian regime.\" Persons who stand up for their beliefs and challenge the status quo are scorned as people who don't know their proper place in society. Thai culture places great emphasis on hierarchy and knowing one's place in it.Writer and editor Wasant Techawongtham, seeking to explain governmental missteps, observed that, \"As everybody in Thailand knows, we are a society of conformity. We conform to tradition, to authority, to power, to wealth. There is little room for people to think outside the box or to imagine the impossible. And what little window of opportunity exists for civilians, that window is forever closed for government workers.\"\n\n\n=== Thai toilets ===\nThe \"bidet shower\" is common in Thai toilets, as evidenced by an uproar by parliamentarians when it was disclosed that the new parliament building was not equipped with \"bum guns\".\n\n\n== Arts ==\n\n\n=== Traditional arts ===\n\nThai visual arts were traditionally Buddhist only. Thai Buddha images from different periods have a number of distinctive styles. Thai temple art and architecture form a unique combination of elements derived from ancient Siamese architectures. Thai contemporary art often combines traditional Thai elements with modern techniques.Literature in Thailand is heavily influenced by Indian Hindu culture. The most notable works of Thai literature are a version of the Ramayana, a Hindu religious epic, called the Ramakien, written in part by Kings Rama I and Rama II, and the poetry of Sunthorn Phu.\nTraditional Thai paintings showed subjects in two dimensions without perspective. The size of each element in the picture reflected its degree of importance. The primary technique of composition is that of apportioning areas: the main elements are isolated from each other by space transformers. This eliminated the intermediate ground, which would otherwise imply perspective. Perspective was introduced only as a result of Western influence in the mid-19th century. Monk artist Khrua In Khong is well known as the first artist to introduce linear perspective to Thai traditional art.\nThere is no tradition of spoken drama in Thailand, the role instead being filled by Thai dance. This is divided into three categories: Khon, 'Lakhon, and Likay, Khon being the most elaborate and Likay the most popular. Nang drama, a form of shadow play, is found in the south.\nThere is also Thai folklore, Sri Thanonchai as an example.\n\n\n=== Dance ===\n\nThe first detailed European record of khon and other classical Siamese dances was made during the Ayutthaya Kingdom. It described a dramatic tradition and style that are almost identical to the Thai traditions we still see today. Historical evidence clearly establishes that the Thai art of stage plays must have already been perfected by the 17th century. Louis XIV, the Sun King of France, had a formal diplomatic relation with Ayutthaya's King Narai. In 1687, France sent the diplomat Simon de la Loub\u00e8re to record all that he saw in the Siamese Kingdom and its traditions. In his account Du Royaume de Siam, La Loub\u00e8re carefully observed the classic 17th century theatre of Siam, including an epic battle scene from a khon performance, and recorded what he saw in great detail:\n\"The Siamese have three sorts of Stage Plays: That which they call Cone [khon] is a figure dance, to the sound of the violin and some other instruments. The dancers are masked and armed, and represent rather a combat than a dance. And though every one runs into high motions, and extravagant postures, they cease not continually to intermix some word. Most of their masks are hideous, and represent either monstrous Beasts, or kinds of Devils. The Show which they call Lacone is a poem intermix with Epic and Dramatic, which lasts three days, from eight in the morning till seven at night. They are histories in verse, serious, and sung by several actors always present, and which do only sing reciprocally.... The Rabam is a double dance of men and women, which is not martial, but gallant... they can perform it without much tying themselves, because their way of dancing is a simple march round, very slow, and without any high motion; but with a great many slow contortions of the body and arms.\"Of the attires of Siamese khon dancers, La Loub\u00e8re recorded that: \"[T]hose that dance in Rabam, and Cone, have gilded paper-bonnets, high and pointed, like the Mandarins caps of ceremony, but which hang down at the sides below their ears, which are adorned with counterfeit stones, and with two pendants of gilded wood.Today \"ram Thai\" (Thai: \u0e23\u0e33\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22), 'Thai dance'. Thai dance, like many forms of traditional Asian dance, can be divided into two major categories that correspond roughly to the high art (classical dance) and low art (folk dance) distinction.\nAlthough traditional Thai performing arts are not as vibrant as they once were, suffering inroads from Western entertainment and generally changing tastes, Thai dance drama is not extinct. What survives displays the elegance of an art form refined over centuries and supported by regal patronage.Aside from folk and regional dances (southern Thailand's Indian-influenced Menora dance, for example), the two major forms of Thai classical dance drama are khon and Lakhon nai. In the beginning both were exclusively court entertainments and it was not until much later that a popular style of dance theater, Likay, evolved as a diversion for the common folk who had no access to royal performances. Apart from Lakhon nai, Lakhon chatri is also one of the most important Thai dances.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nThe Music of Thailand includes classical and folk music traditions, e.g., Piphat and Mor lam, respectively, as well as Thai pop music, e.g., \"String\". Thai classical music is synonymous with those stylized court ensembles and repertoires that emerged in its present form within the royal centers of Central Thailand some 800 years ago. These ensembles, while being slightly influenced by older practices and repertoires from India, are today uniquely Thai expressions. While the three primary classical ensembles, the Piphat, Khrueang sai and Mahori differ in significant ways, they all share a basic instrumentation and theoretical approach. Each employ the small ching hand cymbals and the krap wooden sticks to mark the primary beat reference.\nSeveral kinds of small drums (klong) are employed in these ensembles to outline the basic rhythmic structure (natab) that is punctuated at the end by the striking of a suspended gong (mong). Seen in its most basic formulation, the classical Thai orchestras are very similar to the Cambodian (Khmer) pinpeat and mahori ensembles, and structurally similar to other orchestras found within the widespread Southeast Asian gong-chime musical culture, such as the large gamelan of Bali and Java, which most likely have their common roots in the diffusion of Vietnamese Dong-Son bronze drums beginning in the first century.\nTraditional Thai classical repertoire is anonymous, handed down through an oral tradition of performance in which the names of composers (if, indeed, pieces were historically created by single authors) are not known. However, since the beginning of the modern Bangkok period, composers' names have been known and, since around the turn of the century, many major composers have recorded their works in notation. Musicians, however, imagine these compositions and notations as generic forms which are realized in full in idiosyncratic variations and improvisations in the context of performance.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nMuay Thai (Thai: \u0e21\u0e27\u0e22\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22, RTGS: Muai Thai, [muaj t\u02b0aj], lit. \"Thai boxing\") is a native form of kickboxing and Thailand's signature sport. It incorporates kicks, punches, knees and elbow strikes in a ring with gloves similar to those used in Western boxing and this has led to Thailand gaining medals at the Olympic Games in boxing.\nAssociation football has overtaken muay Thai as the most widely followed sport in contemporary Thai society. Thailand national football team has played the AFC Asian Cup six times. The team reached the semifinals in 1972 and the round of 16 in 2019. The country has hosted the Asian Cup twice, in 1972 and in 2007. The 2007 edition was co-hosted together with Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam. It is not uncommon to see Thais cheering their favourite English Premier League teams on television and walking around in replica kit. Another widely enjoyed pastime, and once a competitive sport, is kite flying.\nTakraw (Thai: \u0e15\u0e30\u0e01\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d) is a sport native to Thailand, in which the players hit a rattan ball and are only allowed to use their feet, knees, chest, and head to touch the ball. Sepak takraw is a form of this sport which is similar to volleyball. The players must volley a ball over a net and force it to hit the ground on the opponent's side. It is also a popular sport in other countries in Southeast Asia. A rather similar game but played only with the feet is Buka ball.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe Major part of the country's cultural legacy and reflects both the challenges of living in Thailand's sometimes extreme climate as well as, historically, the importance of architecture to the Thai people's sense of community and religious beliefs. Influenced by the architectural traditions of many of Thailand's neighbors, it has also developed significant regional variation within its vernacular and religious buildings.\nBuddhist temples in Thailand are known as \"wats\", from the P\u0101\u1e37i v\u0101\u1e6da, meaning an enclosure. A temple has an enclosing wall that divides it from the secular world. Wat architecture has seen many changes in Thailand in the course of history. Although there are many differences in layout and style, they all adhere to the same principles.\nAs the phrase \"Thai stilt house\" suggests, one universal aspect of Thailand's traditional architecture is the elevation of its buildings on stilts, most commonly to around head height. The area beneath the house is used for storage, crafts, lounging in the daytime, and sometimes for livestock. The houses were raised due to heavy flooding during certain parts of the year, and in more ancient times, predators. Thai building and living habits are often based on superstitious and religious beliefs. Many other considerations such as locally available materials, climate, and agriculture have a lot to do with the style.\n\n\n=== Traditional games ===\nOne-legged rabbit (Thai: \u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e15\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22\u0e02\u0e32\u0e40\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27; RTGS: kratai kha diao) is a type of \"catch-me\" game. The catcher will call out the rabbit, and the rabbit must stand on one leg and jump or tiptoe to catch other players and switch to rabbit instead. This game will exercise your legs and practice balancing on one leg. The number of players are divided into two teams, or may not have a team at all. Normally, there are two or more players. At the first time, the player will select the rabbit or team by \"rock-paper-scissors\". The loser becomes a rabbit.In the case of solo player, the rabbit must stand on one leg, then jump to chase and touch any part of the body of other children who have run away. Everyone must stay within the designated area. A player who runs out of space loses the game and must be switched to rabbit, but if the rabbit is exhausted and cannot stand on one leg, it was that defeated and must be punished.\nIn team play, the rules are similar to the solo player, but the rabbit team will send a representative to catch the other team to all the people. Those arrested will have to wait outside until the rabbit team can catch all of the rival teams. Rabbit team can switch to teammates to catch on until they are exhausted, and if the all of the members in rabbit team are exhausted and cannot stand on one leg, the rabbit team lose the game and must be punished too.\n\nBanana stalk hobby horse ridingBanana stalk hobby horse riding or \"khee ma khan kluay\" in Thai is a traditional game of Thailand that Thai kids frequently played in the past. They use a banana stalk to make the parts of a horse such as head, ear, and horsetail. The materials for making a banana rib hobby horse are banana stalk, knife, small bamboo pin, and string. First, find a banana stalk around 1.5 m long. Cut it in the form of the head, neck, and ears, then use a small bamboo pin to connect the ear to the head of a horse. The remaining part of the banana stalk becomes a horsetail. Attach a string between the head and the tail of this banana stalk horse and place on the shoulder of the rider.\nKids sit on the horse and pretend they are riding a real horse, shouting \"hee hee\" or \"yee haaah\", sounds typical of people on horseback. They may race with friends if they have more than two players. The team that runs faster is the winner.\n\n\n== Holidays ==\n\nImportant holidays in Thai culture include Thai New Year, or Songkran, which is officially observed from 13\u201315 April each year. Falling at the end of the dry season and during the hot season in Thailand, the celebrations notoriously feature boisterous water throwing. The water throwing stemmed from washing Buddha images and lightly sprinkling scented water on the hands of elderly people. Small amounts of scented talcum powder were also used in the annual cleansing rite. In recent decades, water fights have been increasingly industrialised with use of hoses, barrels, squirt guns, water-filled surgical tubing, and copious amounts of powder.\nLoi Krathong is held on the 12th full moon of the Thai lunar calendar, usually early-November. While not a government-observed holiday, it is nonetheless an auspicious day in Thai culture, in which Thai people \"loi\", meaning \"to float\" a \"krathong\", a small raft traditionally made from elaborately folded banana leaves and including flowers, candles, incense sticks, and small offerings. The act of floating away the candle raft is symbolic of letting go of all one's grudges, anger, and defilements so that one can start life afresh on a better footing.\nNational Elephant Day or Chang Thai Day is a holiday in Thailand, held on March 13, which celebrates the cultural and historical significance of the elephant in Thailand.\n\n\n== Pastimes ==\n\n\n=== Reading and Internet ===\nEighty-eight percent of Thai people read books and spend an average of 28 minutes per day doing so, according to a poll conducted by the Thai Publishers and Booksellers Association (PUBAT) and Chulalongkorn University's Faculty of Economics and Research Centre for Social and Business Development.\nA total of 3,432 Thais aged 15\u201369 in 12 provinces, including Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Songkhla, Nakhon Si Thamarat, Nakhon Ratchsima, and Khon Kaen, were interviewed from December 2014 to January 2015. While 88% of Thai respondents said they read books, 12% said they did not. They cited as reasons lack of time, bad eyesight, and dislike of reading.\nAveraged over the entire population, Thais spend 28 minutes a day reading books. The reading sub-set of the population averages 46 minutes a day. Of this group, those aged under 20 spend the most time reading books, 56 minutes a day. That figure shrinks as people age until they reach 61, when people tend to get back into reading.\nBy comparison, 71% of Thais use the Internet almost every day for an average of 92 minutes. Those who spend most time on the Internet are people under 20, on average 224 minutes a day, while those over 61 spend ten minutes a day on-line.\nIn 2013 the Thai National Statistical Office conducted a reading survey that found that Thais aged over six spent an average of 37 minutes a day reading. The survey was not focused specifically on reading books, but also reading journals, the Internet, tablet computers, and smart phones.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBetel Chewing In Thailand\nCinema of Thailand\nFolklore of Thailand\nGhosts in Thai culture\nList of museums in Thailand\nMedia of Thailand\nMinistry of Culture (Thailand)\nPhya Anuman Rajadhon\nRacism in Thailand\nRoyal Flags of Thailand\nThai temple art and architecture\nThailand National Artist\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLapanun, Patcharin (2019).

        "wiki": "Phuket (; Thai: \u0e20\u0e39\u0e40\u0e01\u0e47\u0e15, [p\u02b0\u016b\u02d0.k\u00e8t] (listen), Malay: Talang or Tanjung Salang) is one of the southern provinces (changwat) of Thailand. It consists of the island of Phuket, the country's largest island, and another 32 smaller islands off its coast. It lies off the west coast of Thailand in the Andaman Sea. Phuket Island is connected by the Sarasin Bridge to Phang Nga Province to the north. The next nearest province is Krabi, to the east across Phang Nga Bay.\nPhuket Province has an area of 576 square kilometres (222 sq mi), somewhat less than that of Singapore, and is the second-smallest province of Thailand. The island was on one of the major trading routes between India and China, and was frequently mentioned in foreign ships' logs of Portuguese, French, Dutch, and English traders, but was never colonised by a European power. It formerly derived its wealth from tin and rubber and now from tourism.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThere are several possible derivations of the relatively recent name \"Phuket\" (of which the digraph ph represents an aspirated p). One theory is it is derived from the word Bukit (Jawi: \u0628\u0648\u0643\u064a\u062a) in Malay which means \"hill\", as this is what the island appears like from a distance.\nPhuket was formerly known as Thalang (\u0e16\u0e25\u0e32\u0e07 Tha-Laang), derived from the old Malay \"telong\" (Jawi: \u062a\u0644\u0648\u06a0) which means \"cape\". The northern district of the province, which was the location of the old capital, still uses this name. In Western sources and navigation charts, it was known as Junk Ceylon or Junkceylon (a corruption of the Malay Tanjung Salang, i.e., \"Cape Salang\").\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nPhuket is the largest island in Thailand. It is in the Andaman Sea in southern Thailand. The island is mostly mountainous with a mountain range in the west of the island from the north to the south. The mountains of Phuket form the southern end of the Phuket mountain range, which ranges for 440 kilometres (270 mi) from the Kra Isthmus.\n\nAlthough some recent geographical works refer to the sections of the Tenasserim Hills in the isthmus as the \"Phuket Range\", these names are not found in classical geographic sources. Besides, the name Phuket is relatively recent having previously been named Jung Ceylon and Thalang. The highest elevation of the island is usually regarded as Khao Mai Thao Sip Song (Twelve Canes), at 529 metres (1,736 ft) above sea level. However, it has been reported by barometric pressure readings that there is an even higher elevation (with no apparent name), of 542 meters above sea level, in the Kamala hills behind Kathu waterfall.Its population was 249,446 in 2000, rising to 525,709 in the 2010 decennial census, the highest growth rate of all provinces nationwide at 7.4 percent annually. Some 600,000 people reside on Phuket currently, among them migrants, international ex-pats, Thais registered in other provinces, and locals. The registered population, however, includes only Thais who are registered in a \"tabien baan\" or house registration book, which most are not, and the end of 2012 was 360,905 persons.Phuket is approximately 863 kilometres (536 mi) south of Bangkok and covers an area of 543 square kilometres (210 sq mi) excluding small islets. It is estimated that Phuket would have a total area of approximately 576 square kilometres (222 sq mi) if all its outlying islands were included. Other islands are:\nKo Lone 4.77 square kilometres (1.84 sq mi), Ko Maprao 3.7 square kilometres (1.4 sq mi), Ko Naka Yai 2.08 square kilometres (0.80 sq mi), Ko Racha Noi 3.06 square kilometres (1.18 sq mi), Ko Racha Yai 4.5 square kilometres (1.7 sq mi), and the second biggest, Ko Sire 8.8 square kilometres (3.4 sq mi).\nThe island's length, from north to south, is 48 kilometres (30 mi) and its width is 21 kilometres (13 mi).Seventy percent of Phuket's area is covered with mountains which stretch from north to south. The remaining 30 percent are plains in the central and eastern parts of the island. It has a total of nine brooks and creeks but does not have any major rivers.\nForest, rubber, and palm oil plantations cover 60 percent of the island. The west coast has several sandy beaches. The east coast beaches are more often muddy. Near the southernmost point is Laem Phromthep (Thai: \u0e41\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e)(\"Brahma's Cape\"), a popular viewpoint. In the mountainous north of the island is the Khao Phra Thaeo No-Hunting Area, protecting more than 20 km\u00b2 of the rainforest. The three highest peaks of this reserve are the Khao Prathiu (384 metres (1,260 ft)), Khao Bang Pae 388 metres (1,273 ft), and Khao Phara 422 metres (1,385 ft). The Sirinat National Park on the northwest coast was established in 1981 to protect an area of 90 square kilometres (35 sq mi) (68 kilometres (42 mi) marine area), including the Nai Yang Beach where sea turtles lay their eggs.The most popular (and overcrowded) tourist area on Phuket is Patong Beach on the central west coast, perhaps owing to the easy access to its wide and long beach. Most of Phuket's nightlife and its shopping is in Patong, and the area has become increasingly developed. Patong means \"the forest filled with banana leaves\" in Thai. South of Patong lie Karon Beach, Kata Beach, Kata Noi Beach, and around the southern tip of the island, Nai Han Beach and Rawai. To the north of Patong are Kamala Beach, Surin Beach, and Bang Tao Beach. These areas are generally much less developed than Patong. To the southeast is Bon Island and to the south are several coral islands. The Similan Islands lie to the northwest and the Phi Phi Islands which are part of Krabi Province, to the southeast.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Phuket features a tropical monsoon climate (Am). Due to its proximity to the equator, in the year, there is a little variation in temperatures. The city has an average annual high of 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) and an annual low of 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). Phuket has a dry season that runs from December to March and a wet season that covers the remaining eight months. However, like many cities that feature a tropical monsoon climate, Phuket sees some precipitation even during its dry season. Phuket averages roughly 2,200 millimetres (87 in) of rain.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 16th-18th century: European contact ===\nThe Portuguese explorer Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto arrived in Siam in 1545. His accounts of the country go beyond Ayutthaya and include a reasonably detailed account of ports in the south of the Kingdom as well. Pinto was one of the first European explorers to detail Phuket in his travel accounts. He referred to the island as \"Junk Ceylon\", a name the Portuguese used for Phuket Island in their maps, mentioning the name seven times in his accounts. Pinto said that Junk Ceylon was a destination port where trading vessels made regular stops for supplies and provisions. However, during the mid-16th century, the island was in decline due to pirates and often rough and unpredictable seas, which deterred merchant vessels from visiting the island. Pinto mentioned several other notable port cities in his accounts, including Patani and Ligor, which is modern-day Nakhon Si Thamarat.In the 17th century, the Dutch, English and, after the 1680s, the French, competed for the opportunity to trade with Junk Ceylon, which was a rich source of tin. In September 1680, a ship of the French East India Company visited the island and left with a full cargo of tin.A year or two later, the Siamese King Narai, seeking to reduce Dutch and English influence, named as governor a French medical missionary, Brother Ren\u00e9 Charbonneau, a member of the Siam mission of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Missions \u00c9trang\u00e8res. Charbonneau remained as governor until 1685.\n\nIn 1685, King Narai confirmed the French tin monopoly in Phuket to their ambassador, the Chevalier de Chaumont. Chaumont's former ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel, Sieur de Billy, was named governor of the island. However, the French were expelled from Siam after the 1688 Siamese revolution. On 10 April 1689, Desfarges led an expedition to re-capture Thalang to restore French control in Siam. His occupation of the island led to nothing, and Desfarges returned to Puducherry in January 1690.\n\n\n==== 1785: Burmese invasion ====\n\nBefore the Burmese attacked Thalang in 1785 during the \"Nine Armies' Wars\", Francis Light, a British East India Company captain (and later founder of Penang), who had been based on the island for some years, notified the local administration that he had observed Burmese forces preparing to attack. The island's military governor had just died, so the Burmese thought that it could be easily seized. Than Phu Ying Chan, the widow of the recently deceased governor, and her sister Mook (\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e21\u0e38\u0e01)  ordered the women of the island to dress as soldiers and take positions on the Thalang city walls. The Burmese called off their attack due to the perceived strength of the defences. Short of food, they retreated. After a month-long siege of the capital city, the Burmese were forced to retreat on 13 March 1785. The two women became local heroines, receiving the royal titles Thao Thep Kasattri and Thao Si Sunthon from a grateful King Rama I.The seal of Phuket is a depiction of the Two Heroines Monument along Highway 402 in Phuket. This commemorates the sisters The seal is a circle surrounded by a kranok pattern and has been used since 1985.\n\n\n=== 19th\u201320th centuries ===\nDuring the reign of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) from 1 October 1868 to 23 October 1910, Phuket became the administrative centre of the tin-producing southern provinces. His reign was characterized by the modernization of Siam, governmental and social reforms, and territorial concessions to the British and French. As Siam was threatened by Western expansionism, Chulalongkorn managed to save Siam from colonization.\nIn 1933 Monthon Phuket (\u0e21\u0e13\u0e11\u0e25\u0e20\u0e39\u0e40\u0e01\u0e47\u0e15) was dissolved and Phuket became a province.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\n\n==== 2004 tsunami ====\n\nOn 26 December 2004, Phuket and other nearby areas on Thailand's west coast suffered damage when they were struck by a tsunami caused by the Indian Ocean earthquake. The waves destroyed several highly populated areas in the region, killing up to 5,300 people in Thailand, and two hundred thousand more throughout the Asian region. Some 250 were reported dead in Phuket, including foreign tourists. Almost all of the major beaches on the west coast of Phuket, especially Kamala, Patong, Karon, and Kata sustained major damage, with some damage caused to resorts and villages on the island's southern beaches. Thailand's hardest-hit area was the Takua Pa District of Phang Nga Province north of Phuket, where a thousand or more Burmese workers building new beach resorts died.\nIn December 2006, Thailand launched the first of 22 tsunami-detection buoys to be positioned around the Indian Ocean as part of a regional warning system. The satellite-linked deep-sea buoys float 1,000 km (620 mi) offshore, roughly midway between Thailand and Sri Lanka.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs with most of Thailand, the majority of the population is Buddhist, but there is a significant number of Muslims (20 percent) in Phuket, mainly descendants of the island's original sea-dwelling people. Among the Muslims, many are of Malay descent. People of Chinese ancestry make up an even larger population, many of whom are descendants of the tin miners who migrated to Phuket during the 19th century. Peranakans, known as \"Phuket Babas\" in the local tongue, constitute a fair share of Chinese community members, particularly among those who have family ties with the Peranakans of Penang and Malacca.Phuket provincial population in the preliminary count of the 2010 census was counted to be 525,018 people, including some 115,881 expatriates, or 21.1 per cent of the population. However, it is admitted this is inaccurate since The Phuket Provincial Employment Office currently records for more than 64,000 Burmese, Lao and Cambodian workers legally residing on the island. The Thai census figure for 2015 shows a population of 386,605 persons.The number of people on Phuket island swells to over a million during the high season, as tourists, mainly from Western Europe, China, Russia, and the United States flock to Phuket around Christmas.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\n\n=== Provincial government ===\nPhuket is divided into three districts (amphoe), which are further divided into 17 subdistricts (tambon), and 103 villages (muban).\n\nMueang Phuket\nKathu\nThalang\n\n\n=== Local government ===\nAs of 26 November 2019 there are: one Phuket Provincial Administration Organisation (ongkan borihan suan changwat) and 12 municipal (thesaban) areas in the province. Phuket has city (thesaban nakhon) status. Kathu and Patong have town (thesaban mueang) status.  Further 9 subdistrict municipalities (thesaban tambon). The non-municipal areas are administered by 6 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (ongkan borihan suan tambon).\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nTin mining was a major source of income for the island from the 16th century until petering out in the 20th century. In modern times, Phuket's economy has rested on two pillars: rubber tree plantations (making Thailand the biggest producer of rubber in the world) and tourism.Since the 1980s, the sandy beaches on the west coast of the island have been developed as tourist destinations, with Patong, Karon, and Kata being the most popular. Since the 2004 tsunami, all damaged buildings and attractions have been restored. Phuket is being intensely developed, with many new hotels, apartments, and houses under construction. \nIn July 2005, Phuket was voted one of the world's top five retirement destinations by Fortune Magazine.In 2017, Phuket received about 10 million visitors, most of them foreign, with China the leading contributor. Tourists generated some 385 billion baht in revenues, nearly 14 percent of the 2.77 trillion baht earned by the nation as a whole.The first half of 2019 saw a dip in the number of tourists visiting Phuket, driving lower hotel occupancy rates leading to increased price competition. RevPAR (revenue per available room) is down. A decline in the number of tourists, combined with an oversupply of hotel rooms, is the root of the problem.  Despite falling numbers, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) claims that tourism revenues have risen by 3.1% in the first half of 2019.\nNo one seems to know how many hotel rooms Phuket has available. Oxfam says it has 60,000 hotel rooms for its 9.1 million annual visitors. The Bangkok Post in September 2019 reported that Phuket has 600 hotels with 40,000 rooms.. Three weeks earlier it said that Phuket had 93,941 hotel rooms available, excluding villas and hostels, with an additional 15,000 projected to become available by 2024.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\nAir\n\nPhuket International Airport (HKT) commenced a 5.7 billion baht (US$185.7 million) expansion in September 2012, scheduled for completion on 14 February 2016. The airport will increase its annual handling capacity from 6.5 million to 12.5 million passengers, and add a new international terminal.\nRailThere is currently no rail line to Phuket. Trains run to Surat Thani 230 km away.\n\nCity transitSongthaews are a common mode of transport on Phuket. Phuket's songthaews are larger than those found in other areas of Thailand. Songthaews are the cheapest mode of transportation from town to town. They travel between the town and beaches. There are also conventional bus services and motorbike taxis. The latter are found in large numbers in the main town and at Patong Beach. Traditional tuk-tuks have been replaced by small vans, mostly red, with some being yellow or green. Car taxis in Phuket are quite expensive and charge flat rates between towns. Privately run buses are available from the airport to Phuket Town and major beaches. It is often recommended by locals to take the ride-share company, Grab.\n\nBusPhuket's Bus Station 2 BKS Terminal is the long-distance arrivals hub for buses to and from Bangkok and other major Thai cities and provinces. Located four kilometres to the north of Phuket's town centre and port, the complex is large and modern, linking with transportation by tuk-tuk, metered taxi, motorcycle taxi, songthaew, or local bus to the island's beaches and resorts. There are daily scheduled buses from private and government-run companies going to Phuket from Bangkok's Mo Chit and Southern terminal stations.\n\nTramThe Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (MRTA) announced in 2018 that bidding to construct a 60 kilometre-long, 23 station tram network in Phuket will commence in 2020. The 39 billion baht tram is part of the government's Private-Public-Partnership (PPP) plan which ensures it will be fast-tracked. The planned route stretches from Takua Thung District in Phang Nga Province to Chalong in Phuket. Phase one will connect Phuket International Airport with Chalong, about 40 kilometres. It will take three years to complete.\nFerryThere are daily ferry boats that connect Phuket to neighboring islands Phi Phi and Koh Lanta. Ferries depart daily from Rassada Pier and Tonsai Pier, with service expanding each year.The average price for a one-way ticket ranges from 300 THB to 1500 THB.\n\n\n== Health ==\n6 hospitals exist in Phuket. The main hospital in Phuket operated by the Ministry of Public Health is Vachira Phuket Hospital, with smaller hospitals at Thalang and Patong. 3 Private hospitals exist which are Phuket International Hospital, Bangkok Hospital Phuket and Mission Hospital Phuket.\n\n\n== Human achievement index 2017 ==\nSince 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nFootballPhuket City football club participates in Thai League 3 Lower Region, the third tier of Thai football league system. The Golden Sloop (Thai:\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e43\u0e1a\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e07) plays their home matches at Surakul Stadium.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nTwo Heroines Monument (\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e38\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e27\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e27\u0e35\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35), is the monument in Thalang District, a memorial statue of the heroines Thao Thep Kasattri (Kunying Jan) and Thao Sri Sunthon (Mook), who rallied islanders in 1785 to repel Burmese invaders. As the island's governor had just died, the organization of Phuket's defense against the Burmese invasion of 1785 was conducted by his widow, Thao Thep Kasattri. With her sister's help, they assembled what forces they had, then disguised local women as male soldiers, a ruse to swell the ranks of the defenders. After a month's siege, the Burmese invaders became exhausted and withdrew. King Rama I awarded Kunying Jan with the royal title of Thao Thep Kasattri.\nThalang National Museum (\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e18\u0e20\u0e31\u0e13\u0e11\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e19\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e07\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e15\u0e34 \u0e16\u0e25\u0e32\u0e07) is near the Two Heroines Monument.

        "wiki": "The Phuket Zoo is a zoo located in Phuket, Thailand. It was founded as a private zoo in 1997 and currently remains private. The zoo is located near the Muang District and the Phuket Bay. The zoo has been embroiled in controversy over its lack of animal welfare standards and allegations of extreme cruelty to animals.The zoo makes up 30 rai (12 acres). It is known for having close encounters with many exotic animals including tigers, monkeys and elephants. The zoo has many sections including areas devoted to crocodiles, elephants and monkeys while also having an aquarium and an orchard garden.\n\n\n== Animal shows ==\n\n\n=== Monkey shows ===\nThe monkey show consists of a macaque monkey doing tricks and then taking pictures with the crowd. Some of the monkey's tricks include riding a bike, dunking a basketball and doing exercises, like push-ups and sit-ups. After that, the monkey will walk around with an oil-paper umbrella and take pictures with guests.\n\n\n=== Elephant shows ===\n\nIn the elephant shows, a group of asian elephants perform tricks and have an opportunity to meet the guests. The elephants start off by doing tricks like kicking a soccer ball and will also do dances and races. At times, the guests will be able to feed the elephants bananas and at the end touch their trunks. The elephants have even be trained to ask for tips. Many of these shows are demeaning to the animals involved, and some say the zoo should be shut down entirely.\nThe elephants the zoo has were formerly logging elephants. Currently, the Zoo faces allegations of animal abuse due to their treatment of their captive elephants.\n\n\n=== Crocodile shows ===\nWhile there are no encounters guests can have with the crocodiles, many guests find the show very entertaining. The highlight is when one of the trainers sticks his head in between the crocodiles mouth.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\n\n\n=== Aquarium ===\nThe zoo has a small aquarium with a variety of fish and marine animals including fresh-water and salt-water fish, turtles, frogs, crabs and lizards. They also have a display area showing fishing equipment and techniques of Thailand's fisherman as well as seashells.\n\n\n=== Bird Park ===\nThe Phuket's Zoo Bird Park has a variety of birds including toucans, peacocks, parrots, hawks, emus and ostriches. Some of the birds are allowed to fly freely in the park. For some reason there's a civet cat\n\n\n== Animal encounters ==\nAs well as the opportunities to meet the animals during the shows, the Phuket Zoo also allows guests to meet some of their other animals. Some of those opportunities include getting to take pictures and pet a tiger. Formerly, you could take pictures and touch an orangutan, but she was later confiscated by the police. The experiences cost an extra fee.\n\n\n== Conservation efforts by the zoo ==\nIt does not appear that the Phuket Zoo is involved with conservation efforts to save animals worldwide. They are also not accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums or the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums.\n\n\n== Milo the Orangutan ==\nThe Phuket Zoo formerly had an orangutan named, Milo. However, a petition garnished over 10,000 signatures for her to be removed due to her being forced to take photos and her health struggles. Due to the petition, the Natural Resources and Environmental Crime Division of the Royal Thai Police and Department of National Parks decided to confiscate her after it appeared she was being kept illegally.\nWhen the authorities came to confiscate Milo, she was not at the zoo. All pictures of her on the zoo's website were also deleted. Later in the week, Milo was found in a small cage in the jungle.\nMilo later died the following year of a stroke. Her bad health from her time at the zoo most likely contributed to her passing.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nWhile many guests enjoy their time at the Phuket Zoo, many people find the zoo to be cruel and inhumane.\n\n\n=== Disappearance of animals ===\nSome guests have complained that animals at the zoo including snow leopards and camels disappeared without any word from the zoo. Some people have speculated that the animals may have gotten sick and were sold off before they died.\n\n\n=== Monkeys ===\nThe macaque monkey used in the monkey shows have a rope around their neck and are forced to do tricks. One exhibit holds two monkeys, but one is more aggressive than the other forcing it to become malnourished. One gibbon is even in a staff-member's arms all day and stays in a cage with a lock  at night with no room to move.\n\n\n=== Elephants ===\nIn 2019, a 2-year-old elephant died from injuries he sustained after performing for tourists.\n\n\n=== Crocodiles ===\nThe crocodile exhibit is highly criticized for being overcrowded, small and dirty. Many people have said the water the crocodiles have is too shallow and is filled with feces. They have also been caught on video being poked at with brooms.\n\n\n=== Turtle ===\nA video of a turtle at the Phuket Zoo's Aquarium sparked controversy as its exhibit seemed to be too small for it to move.\n\n\n=== Bird Park ===\nSome of the birds in the Bird Park are chained up and some guests  have said the bird's cages are too small and overcrowded.\n\n\n=== Drugging of animals ===\nDue to the fact many animals have encounters with humans, many guests speculate that the animals are drugged so they don't attack humans.\n\n\n=== Inadequate exhibits ===\nMany of the animal's exhibits, including the ostrich and deer, have no grass, shrubbery or enrichment toys. Even one of the Asiatic black bear's enclosure was just a concrete pit.\n\n\n== Efforts to change or close the Phuket Zoo ==\nPETA has called on the zoo to \"Improve the Living Conditions of the Animals...\"\nThere are also plenty of petitions online including one on change.org that call for the closing of the Phuket Zoo.\n\n\n== Animal list ==\n\n\n== References ==",

He owned the newspaper Inside Phuket and he edited Phuket E-News. Wisut covered some controversial stories, including controversial land claims in Freedom Beach and other areas in Phuket and an expos\u00e9 on illegalities within the system of the transfer and promotion of government officers.Wisut was also the secretary of the Red Shirt political group, a group that opposed the military coup that overthrew Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, and he led a local community group that opposed the private use of Freedom Beach.\n\n\n== Death ==\nWisut was killed on 12 January 2012 by two gunmen on a motorcycle. He had been under observation by his killers for two months. Wisut and his wife were in a black Honda Jazz on Thepkasattri Road in Phuket when the gunmen pulled the motorcycle in front of his car and shot him three times with four shots fired before making their getaway. The crime was captured by surveillance video. Wisut died in Vachira Phuket Hospital. Wisut's wife, Jiraporn \"Ji\" Hosakul, survived the attack unharmed and was able to describe the gunmen and vehicle to police. There were also other witnesses at the scene.Noppadol \"Pae\" Praisri was arrested and confessed to being the driver of the motorcycle. He said he was paid 50,000 baht. He also accused Sanya \"Noo\" Klinchum of being the gunman. Noppadol reenacted the crime for the police and images of his demonstration appeared in the media. Sanya \"Noo\" Klinchum was arrested as the gunman. Noppadol implicated Somkuan \"Mr. Boy\" Deepan as the person who arranged the shooting and paid for it but Somkuan remains uncaught today.The main suspect for ordering the murder was Ausadakorn \"Pord\" Sidorkbaow, the director of KPP Cable TV and deputy director of the Phuket's Chamber of Commerce. Ausadakorn was allegedly friends with Somkuan, or \"Mr. Boy\", and he was mentioned in a column written by Wisut. For his part Ausadakorn said Somokuan had been a worker at one of his construction sites and that he was friends with Wisut. Without the confession of Somkuan, he was granted bail, he denied any involvement, and he was never convicted.\n\n\n== Context ==\nAt the time of Wisut's death, Thailand lacked freedom of speech as several journalists were imprisoned for insulting the monarchy. There were several other murders related to the real estate industry in the province around the time of Wisut's death as well.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nAfter Wisut's death, Pheu Thai Party officials investigated the land at Freedom Beach, which is associated with his reporting and political activity.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nThe murder of Wisut Tangwittayaporn was condemned by the UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova, who called for an investigation and labeled it violation of the human right of expression. The statement read: \"Media professionals and owners must be allowed to carry out their work freely and without fear. Only under such conditions can the media fulfill its responsibilities, contributing to democracy and good governance. This brutal killing must be investigated and its perpetrators be brought to trial in the interest of press freedom and the fundamental human right of freedom of expression.\"Thida Thavornseth, leader of the Red Shirts, said, \"Mr Ae was a very brave man. First, because he was fearless in his reporting. Second, because he was openly a red shirt supporter, which is rare in the South \u2013 this is not a \u2018red-shirt\u2019 area. To do what he did was very dangerous. Some people in Thailand still solve problems in barbaric ways. This is an indicator of an undeveloped country. I want to pass this message on to all people in the media: to report all facts truly and accurately without fear. Those who think differently than those around them, should be able to walk freely through society without fear of repercussions.\"Phuket's Governor Tri Augkaradacha took personal interest in the investigation. The investigation was given high priority by the local police force with at least 5 teams of police officers involved in the case.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Elephant Nature Park is a sanctuary and rescue centre for elephants in Mae Taeng District, Chiang Mai Province, Northern Thailand, approximately 60 kilometres (37 mi) from Chiang Mai City, co-founded by Sangduen \"Lek\" (Thai for \"Small\") Chailert.  In 2013 Erawan Elephant Retirement Park opened in western Thailand as an offshoot.  By 2016 there were branch elephant parks in Surin and in Cambodia, and there were plans to open a fifth park in Phuket. By then the work was coordinated by the Save the Elephant Foundation.\nThe parks provide sanctuary for rescued elephants and operate under a business model in which tourists pay to visit and help care for the animals, and can stay for extended periods.\n\n\n== History ==\nLek Chailert started working on elephant conservation in 1996. Teak logging, in which many elephants were used, had been banned in Thailand in 1989, and those elephants had been abandoned or sold for use in the tourist industry or for begging in cities. Elephants are also left maimed after poachers take their ivory.In the late 1990s the government of Thailand was working to promote ecotourism in Chiang Mai Province; tourism brought in 350 million dollars in 1997 and was the province's biggest source of revenue; the ecotourism plans were controversial with indigenous people there.By 1998, an organization called Green Tours run by Adam Flinn had founded Elephant Nature Park, a tourist site and reserve for rescued elephants in a valley about an hour north of Chiang Mai, with Chailert, who owned some of the land and leased some from the Thai government.  At that time the park featured a daily elephant show where elephants performed tricks like balancing on one leg and playing football, and included elephant rides.  She maintained a more isolated section up one of the surrounding mountains for especially damaged animals that she called \"Elephant Heaven.\"  The park had 34 rescued elephants.  Her goal was to eventually end the performances and run it purely as a reserve.By 2002 Chailert was well known for campaigning against elephant crushing  and around that time a documentary about the treatment of elephants in Thailand featuring Chailert's work was released; in response, PETA called for a boycott of Thailand until conditions there changed.By 2005 the boycott campaign had made Chailert an embarrassment to the Thai government and had led to death threats and to Friends of the Asian Elephant, a government-funded organization that had done work to improve conditions for elephants, ending its funding for Chailert's work. Chailert was listed in a special 2005 post-tsunami issue of the Asian edition of Time magazine as one of \"Asia's heroes\".  By 2005 17 of the elephants Chailert had rescued were adults, and she had also opened a travel agency in Chiang Mai. By this time the park no longer offered performances and had shifted to a business model in which visitors could come help care for the elephants.In 2010 the park had 33 elephants and visitors could come for up to 28 days, paying $400/week.In 2013 Erawan Elephant Retirement Park opened in western Thailand on 50 hectares of land beside the River Kwai an hour from Kanchanaburri, as an extension of the original park and using the same business model; it opened with five elephants, one of which died in the first year.  In 2014 there were 37 elephants at Elephant Nature Park.As of 2016, Chailert had rescued a total of 200 distressed elephants since she started in 1996 and there were branch elephant parks in Surin and in Cambodia, and there were plans to open a fifth park in Phuket.  That work is coordinated by the Save the Elephant Foundation, run by the same people.\n\n\n== Recognition and Criticism ==\nFor her work, Chailert received numerous awards and recognitions, such as the Ford Foundation's \u201cHero of the Planet\u201d (2001), Time Magazine's Heroes of Asia (2005), one of six Women Heroes of Global Conservation (2010), and the Responsible Thailand Award for Animal Welfare (2018). In addition to the elephants, Chailert has accommodated over 400 dogs, cats, birds and water buffaloes at the Park. She also convinced several independent camps to improve the lives of elephants and forbid tourists from riding them through her Saddle Off! outreach program. On the other hand, in 2011, Elephant Aid International assessed the care of elephants in the Elephant Nature Park and found abundant foot disease, long periods of chaining on concrete floors, low mahout morale, and dominance as the form of elephant management used by mahouts. It also noted problems with the elephants' diet, sanitation, exercise, and stress levels, and disapproved of tourists having direct contact with the elephants.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nsegments from Vanishing Giants, documentary film by Jennifer Hile via National Geographic.

        "wiki": "Phuket (; Thai: \u0e20\u0e39\u0e40\u0e01\u0e47\u0e15, [p\u02b0\u016b\u02d0.k\u00e8t] (listen), Malay: Talang or Tanjung Salang) is one of the southern provinces (changwat) of Thailand. It consists of the island of Phuket, the country's largest island, and another 32 smaller islands off its coast. It lies off the west coast of Thailand in the Andaman Sea. Phuket Island is connected by the Sarasin Bridge to Phang Nga Province to the north. The next nearest province is Krabi, to the east across Phang Nga Bay.\nPhuket Province has an area of 576 square kilometres (222 sq mi), somewhat less than that of Singapore, and is the second-smallest province of Thailand. The island was on one of the major trading routes between India and China, and was frequently mentioned in foreign ships' logs of Portuguese, French, Dutch, and English traders, but was never colonised by a European power. It formerly derived its wealth from tin and rubber and now from tourism.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThere are several possible derivations of the relatively recent name \"Phuket\" (of which the digraph ph represents an aspirated p). One theory is it is derived from the word Bukit (Jawi: \u0628\u0648\u0643\u064a\u062a) in Malay which means \"hill\", as this is what the island appears like from a distance.\nPhuket was formerly known as Thalang (\u0e16\u0e25\u0e32\u0e07 Tha-Laang), derived from the old Malay \"telong\" (Jawi: \u062a\u0644\u0648\u06a0) which means \"cape\". The northern district of the province, which was the location of the old capital, still uses this name. In Western sources and navigation charts, it was known as Junk Ceylon or Junkceylon (a corruption of the Malay Tanjung Salang, i.e., \"Cape Salang\").\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nPhuket is the largest island in Thailand. It is in the Andaman Sea in southern Thailand. The island is mostly mountainous with a mountain range in the west of the island from the north to the south. The mountains of Phuket form the southern end of the Phuket mountain range, which ranges for 440 kilometres (270 mi) from the Kra Isthmus.\n\nAlthough some recent geographical works refer to the sections of the Tenasserim Hills in the isthmus as the \"Phuket Range\", these names are not found in classical geographic sources. Besides, the name Phuket is relatively recent having previously been named Jung Ceylon and Thalang. The highest elevation of the island is usually regarded as Khao Mai Thao Sip Song (Twelve Canes), at 529 metres (1,736 ft) above sea level. However, it has been reported by barometric pressure readings that there is an even higher elevation (with no apparent name), of 542 meters above sea level, in the Kamala hills behind Kathu waterfall.Its population was 249,446 in 2000, rising to 525,709 in the 2010 decennial census, the highest growth rate of all provinces nationwide at 7.4 percent annually. Some 600,000 people reside on Phuket currently, among them migrants, international ex-pats, Thais registered in other provinces, and locals. The registered population, however, includes only Thais who are registered in a \"tabien baan\" or house registration book, which most are not, and the end of 2012 was 360,905 persons.Phuket is approximately 863 kilometres (536 mi) south of Bangkok and covers an area of 543 square kilometres (210 sq mi) excluding small islets. It is estimated that Phuket would have a total area of approximately 576 square kilometres (222 sq mi) if all its outlying islands were included. Other islands are:\nKo Lone 4.77 square kilometres (1.84 sq mi), Ko Maprao 3.7 square kilometres (1.4 sq mi), Ko Naka Yai 2.08 square kilometres (0.80 sq mi), Ko Racha Noi 3.06 square kilometres (1.18 sq mi), Ko Racha Yai 4.5 square kilometres (1.7 sq mi), and the second biggest, Ko Sire 8.8 square kilometres (3.4 sq mi).\nThe island's length, from north to south, is 48 kilometres (30 mi) and its width is 21 kilometres (13 mi).Seventy percent of Phuket's area is covered with mountains which stretch from north to south. The remaining 30 percent are plains in the central and eastern parts of the island. It has a total of nine brooks and creeks but does not have any major rivers.\nForest, rubber, and palm oil plantations cover 60 percent of the island. The west coast has several sandy beaches. The east coast beaches are more often muddy. Near the southernmost point is Laem Phromthep (Thai: \u0e41\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e)(\"Brahma's Cape\"), a popular viewpoint. In the mountainous north of the island is the Khao Phra Thaeo No-Hunting Area, protecting more than 20 km\u00b2 of the rainforest. The three highest peaks of this reserve are the Khao Prathiu (384 metres (1,260 ft)), Khao Bang Pae 388 metres (1,273 ft), and Khao Phara 422 metres (1,385 ft). The Sirinat National Park on the northwest coast was established in 1981 to protect an area of 90 square kilometres (35 sq mi) (68 kilometres (42 mi) marine area), including the Nai Yang Beach where sea turtles lay their eggs.The most popular (and overcrowded) tourist area on Phuket is Patong Beach on the central west coast, perhaps owing to the easy access to its wide and long beach. Most of Phuket's nightlife and its shopping is in Patong, and the area has become increasingly developed. Patong means \"the forest filled with banana leaves\" in Thai. South of Patong lie Karon Beach, Kata Beach, Kata Noi Beach, and around the southern tip of the island, Nai Han Beach and Rawai. To the north of Patong are Kamala Beach, Surin Beach, and Bang Tao Beach. These areas are generally much less developed than Patong. To the southeast is Bon Island and to the south are several coral islands. The Similan Islands lie to the northwest and the Phi Phi Islands which are part of Krabi Province, to the southeast.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Phuket features a tropical monsoon climate (Am). Due to its proximity to the equator, in the year, there is a little variation in temperatures. The city has an average annual high of 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) and an annual low of 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). Phuket has a dry season that runs from December to March and a wet season that covers the remaining eight months. However, like many cities that feature a tropical monsoon climate, Phuket sees some precipitation even during its dry season. Phuket averages roughly 2,200 millimetres (87 in) of rain.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 16th-18th century: European contact ===\nThe Portuguese explorer Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto arrived in Siam in 1545. His accounts of the country go beyond Ayutthaya and include a reasonably detailed account of ports in the south of the Kingdom as well. Pinto was one of the first European explorers to detail Phuket in his travel accounts. He referred to the island as \"Junk Ceylon\", a name the Portuguese used for Phuket Island in their maps, mentioning the name seven times in his accounts. Pinto said that Junk Ceylon was a destination port where trading vessels made regular stops for supplies and provisions. However, during the mid-16th century, the island was in decline due to pirates and often rough and unpredictable seas, which deterred merchant vessels from visiting the island. Pinto mentioned several other notable port cities in his accounts, including Patani and Ligor, which is modern-day Nakhon Si Thamarat.In the 17th century, the Dutch, English and, after the 1680s, the French, competed for the opportunity to trade with Junk Ceylon, which was a rich source of tin. In September 1680, a ship of the French East India Company visited the island and left with a full cargo of tin.A year or two later, the Siamese King Narai, seeking to reduce Dutch and English influence, named as governor a French medical missionary, Brother Ren\u00e9 Charbonneau, a member of the Siam mission of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Missions \u00c9trang\u00e8res. Charbonneau remained as governor until 1685.\n\nIn 1685, King Narai confirmed the French tin monopoly in Phuket to their ambassador, the Chevalier de Chaumont. Chaumont's former ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel, Sieur de Billy, was named governor of the island. However, the French were expelled from Siam after the 1688 Siamese revolution. On 10 April 1689, Desfarges led an expedition to re-capture Thalang to restore French control in Siam. His occupation of the island led to nothing, and Desfarges returned to Puducherry in January 1690.\n\n\n==== 1785: Burmese invasion ====\n\nBefore the Burmese attacked Thalang in 1785 during the \"Nine Armies' Wars\", Francis Light, a British East India Company captain (and later founder of Penang), who had been based on the island for some years, notified the local administration that he had observed Burmese forces preparing to attack. The island's military governor had just died, so the Burmese thought that it could be easily seized. Than Phu Ying Chan, the widow of the recently deceased governor, and her sister Mook (\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e21\u0e38\u0e01)  ordered the women of the island to dress as soldiers and take positions on the Thalang city walls. The Burmese called off their attack due to the perceived strength of the defences. Short of food, they retreated. After a month-long siege of the capital city, the Burmese were forced to retreat on 13 March 1785. The two women became local heroines, receiving the royal titles Thao Thep Kasattri and Thao Si Sunthon from a grateful King Rama I.The seal of Phuket is a depiction of the Two Heroines Monument along Highway 402 in Phuket. This commemorates the sisters The seal is a circle surrounded by a kranok pattern and has been used since 1985.\n\n\n=== 19th\u201320th centuries ===\nDuring the reign of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) from 1 October 1868 to 23 October 1910, Phuket became the administrative centre of the tin-producing southern provinces. His reign was characterized by the modernization of Siam, governmental and social reforms, and territorial concessions to the British and French. As Siam was threatened by Western expansionism, Chulalongkorn managed to save Siam from colonization.\nIn 1933 Monthon Phuket (\u0e21\u0e13\u0e11\u0e25\u0e20\u0e39\u0e40\u0e01\u0e47\u0e15) was dissolved and Phuket became a province.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\n\n==== 2004 tsunami ====\n\nOn 26 December 2004, Phuket and other nearby areas on Thailand's west coast suffered damage when they were struck by a tsunami caused by the Indian Ocean earthquake. The waves destroyed several highly populated areas in the region, killing up to 5,300 people in Thailand, and two hundred thousand more throughout the Asian region. Some 250 were reported dead in Phuket, including foreign tourists. Almost all of the major beaches on the west coast of Phuket, especially Kamala, Patong, Karon, and Kata sustained major damage, with some damage caused to resorts and villages on the island's southern beaches. Thailand's hardest-hit area was the Takua Pa District of Phang Nga Province north of Phuket, where a thousand or more Burmese workers building new beach resorts died.\nIn December 2006, Thailand launched the first of 22 tsunami-detection buoys to be positioned around the Indian Ocean as part of a regional warning system. The satellite-linked deep-sea buoys float 1,000 km (620 mi) offshore, roughly midway between Thailand and Sri Lanka.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs with most of Thailand, the majority of the population is Buddhist, but there is a significant number of Muslims (20 percent) in Phuket, mainly descendants of the island's original sea-dwelling people. Among the Muslims, many are of Malay descent. People of Chinese ancestry make up an even larger population, many of whom are descendants of the tin miners who migrated to Phuket during the 19th century. Peranakans, known as \"Phuket Babas\" in the local tongue, constitute a fair share of Chinese community members, particularly among those who have family ties with the Peranakans of Penang and Malacca.Phuket provincial population in the preliminary count of the 2010 census was counted to be 525,018 people, including some 115,881 expatriates, or 21.1 per cent of the population. However, it is admitted this is inaccurate since The Phuket Provincial Employment Office currently records for more than 64,000 Burmese, Lao and Cambodian workers legally residing on the island. The Thai census figure for 2015 shows a population of 386,605 persons.The number of people on Phuket island swells to over a million during the high season, as tourists, mainly from Western Europe, China, Russia, and the United States flock to Phuket around Christmas.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\n\n=== Provincial government ===\nPhuket is divided into three districts (amphoe), which are further divided into 17 subdistricts (tambon), and 103 villages (muban).\n\nMueang Phuket\nKathu\nThalang\n\n\n=== Local government ===\nAs of 26 November 2019 there are: one Phuket Provincial Administration Organisation (ongkan borihan suan changwat) and 12 municipal (thesaban) areas in the province. Phuket has city (thesaban nakhon) status. Kathu and Patong have town (thesaban mueang) status.  Further 9 subdistrict municipalities (thesaban tambon). The non-municipal areas are administered by 6 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (ongkan borihan suan tambon).\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nTin mining was a major source of income for the island from the 16th century until petering out in the 20th century. In modern times, Phuket's economy has rested on two pillars: rubber tree plantations (making Thailand the biggest producer of rubber in the world) and tourism.Since the 1980s, the sandy beaches on the west coast of the island have been developed as tourist destinations, with Patong, Karon, and Kata being the most popular. Since the 2004 tsunami, all damaged buildings and attractions have been restored. Phuket is being intensely developed, with many new hotels, apartments, and houses under construction. \nIn July 2005, Phuket was voted one of the world's top five retirement destinations by Fortune Magazine.In 2017, Phuket received about 10 million visitors, most of them foreign, with China the leading contributor. Tourists generated some 385 billion baht in revenues, nearly 14 percent of the 2.77 trillion baht earned by the nation as a whole.The first half of 2019 saw a dip in the number of tourists visiting Phuket, driving lower hotel occupancy rates leading to increased price competition. RevPAR (revenue per available room) is down. A decline in the number of tourists, combined with an oversupply of hotel rooms, is the root of the problem.  Despite falling numbers, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) claims that tourism revenues have risen by 3.1% in the first half of 2019.\nNo one seems to know how many hotel rooms Phuket has available. Oxfam says it has 60,000 hotel rooms for its 9.1 million annual visitors. The Bangkok Post in September 2019 reported that Phuket has 600 hotels with 40,000 rooms.. Three weeks earlier it said that Phuket had 93,941 hotel rooms available, excluding villas and hostels, with an additional 15,000 projected to become available by 2024.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\nAir\n\nPhuket International Airport (HKT) commenced a 5.7 billion baht (US$185.7 million) expansion in September 2012, scheduled for completion on 14 February 2016. The airport will increase its annual handling capacity from 6.5 million to 12.5 million passengers, and add a new international terminal.\nRailThere is currently no rail line to Phuket. Trains run to Surat Thani 230 km away.\n\nCity transitSongthaews are a common mode of transport on Phuket. Phuket's songthaews are larger than those found in other areas of Thailand. Songthaews are the cheapest mode of transportation from town to town. They travel between the town and beaches. There are also conventional bus services and motorbike taxis. The latter are found in large numbers in the main town and at Patong Beach. Traditional tuk-tuks have been replaced by small vans, mostly red, with some being yellow or green. Car taxis in Phuket are quite expensive and charge flat rates between towns. Privately run buses are available from the airport to Phuket Town and major beaches. It is often recommended by locals to take the ride-share company, Grab.\n\nBusPhuket's Bus Station 2 BKS Terminal is the long-distance arrivals hub for buses to and from Bangkok and other major Thai cities and provinces. Located four kilometres to the north of Phuket's town centre and port, the complex is large and modern, linking with transportation by tuk-tuk, metered taxi, motorcycle taxi, songthaew, or local bus to the island's beaches and resorts.

As the island's governor had just died, the organization of Phuket's defense against the Burmese invasion of 1785 was conducted by his widow, Thao Thep Kasattri. With her sister's help, they assembled what forces they had, then disguised local women as male soldiers, a ruse to swell the ranks of the defenders. After a month's siege, the Burmese invaders became exhausted and withdrew. King Rama I awarded Kunying Jan with the royal title of Thao Thep Kasattri.\nThalang National Museum (\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e18\u0e20\u0e31\u0e13\u0e11\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e19\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e07\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e15\u0e34 \u0e16\u0e25\u0e32\u0e07) is near the Two Heroines Monument.

        "wiki": "Phuket (; Thai: \u0e20\u0e39\u0e40\u0e01\u0e47\u0e15, [p\u02b0\u016b\u02d0.k\u00e8t] (listen), Malay: Talang or Tanjung Salang) is one of the southern provinces (changwat) of Thailand. It consists of the island of Phuket, the country's largest island, and another 32 smaller islands off its coast. It lies off the west coast of Thailand in the Andaman Sea. Phuket Island is connected by the Sarasin Bridge to Phang Nga Province to the north. The next nearest province is Krabi, to the east across Phang Nga Bay.\nPhuket Province has an area of 576 square kilometres (222 sq mi), somewhat less than that of Singapore, and is the second-smallest province of Thailand. The island was on one of the major trading routes between India and China, and was frequently mentioned in foreign ships' logs of Portuguese, French, Dutch, and English traders, but was never colonised by a European power. It formerly derived its wealth from tin and rubber and now from tourism.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThere are several possible derivations of the relatively recent name \"Phuket\" (of which the digraph ph represents an aspirated p). One theory is it is derived from the word Bukit (Jawi: \u0628\u0648\u0643\u064a\u062a) in Malay which means \"hill\", as this is what the island appears like from a distance.\nPhuket was formerly known as Thalang (\u0e16\u0e25\u0e32\u0e07 Tha-Laang), derived from the old Malay \"telong\" (Jawi: \u062a\u0644\u0648\u06a0) which means \"cape\". The northern district of the province, which was the location of the old capital, still uses this name. In Western sources and navigation charts, it was known as Junk Ceylon or Junkceylon (a corruption of the Malay Tanjung Salang, i.e., \"Cape Salang\").\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nPhuket is the largest island in Thailand. It is in the Andaman Sea in southern Thailand. The island is mostly mountainous with a mountain range in the west of the island from the north to the south. The mountains of Phuket form the southern end of the Phuket mountain range, which ranges for 440 kilometres (270 mi) from the Kra Isthmus.\n\nAlthough some recent geographical works refer to the sections of the Tenasserim Hills in the isthmus as the \"Phuket Range\", these names are not found in classical geographic sources. Besides, the name Phuket is relatively recent having previously been named Jung Ceylon and Thalang. The highest elevation of the island is usually regarded as Khao Mai Thao Sip Song (Twelve Canes), at 529 metres (1,736 ft) above sea level. However, it has been reported by barometric pressure readings that there is an even higher elevation (with no apparent name), of 542 meters above sea level, in the Kamala hills behind Kathu waterfall.Its population was 249,446 in 2000, rising to 525,709 in the 2010 decennial census, the highest growth rate of all provinces nationwide at 7.4 percent annually. Some 600,000 people reside on Phuket currently, among them migrants, international ex-pats, Thais registered in other provinces, and locals. The registered population, however, includes only Thais who are registered in a \"tabien baan\" or house registration book, which most are not, and the end of 2012 was 360,905 persons.Phuket is approximately 863 kilometres (536 mi) south of Bangkok and covers an area of 543 square kilometres (210 sq mi) excluding small islets. It is estimated that Phuket would have a total area of approximately 576 square kilometres (222 sq mi) if all its outlying islands were included. Other islands are:\nKo Lone 4.77 square kilometres (1.84 sq mi), Ko Maprao 3.7 square kilometres (1.4 sq mi), Ko Naka Yai 2.08 square kilometres (0.80 sq mi), Ko Racha Noi 3.06 square kilometres (1.18 sq mi), Ko Racha Yai 4.5 square kilometres (1.7 sq mi), and the second biggest, Ko Sire 8.8 square kilometres (3.4 sq mi).\nThe island's length, from north to south, is 48 kilometres (30 mi) and its width is 21 kilometres (13 mi).Seventy percent of Phuket's area is covered with mountains which stretch from north to south. The remaining 30 percent are plains in the central and eastern parts of the island. It has a total of nine brooks and creeks but does not have any major rivers.\nForest, rubber, and palm oil plantations cover 60 percent of the island. The west coast has several sandy beaches. The east coast beaches are more often muddy. Near the southernmost point is Laem Phromthep (Thai: \u0e41\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e)(\"Brahma's Cape\"), a popular viewpoint. In the mountainous north of the island is the Khao Phra Thaeo No-Hunting Area, protecting more than 20 km\u00b2 of the rainforest. The three highest peaks of this reserve are the Khao Prathiu (384 metres (1,260 ft)), Khao Bang Pae 388 metres (1,273 ft), and Khao Phara 422 metres (1,385 ft). The Sirinat National Park on the northwest coast was established in 1981 to protect an area of 90 square kilometres (35 sq mi) (68 kilometres (42 mi) marine area), including the Nai Yang Beach where sea turtles lay their eggs.The most popular (and overcrowded) tourist area on Phuket is Patong Beach on the central west coast, perhaps owing to the easy access to its wide and long beach. Most of Phuket's nightlife and its shopping is in Patong, and the area has become increasingly developed. Patong means \"the forest filled with banana leaves\" in Thai. South of Patong lie Karon Beach, Kata Beach, Kata Noi Beach, and around the southern tip of the island, Nai Han Beach and Rawai. To the north of Patong are Kamala Beach, Surin Beach, and Bang Tao Beach. These areas are generally much less developed than Patong. To the southeast is Bon Island and to the south are several coral islands. The Similan Islands lie to the northwest and the Phi Phi Islands which are part of Krabi Province, to the southeast.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Phuket features a tropical monsoon climate (Am). Due to its proximity to the equator, in the year, there is a little variation in temperatures. The city has an average annual high of 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) and an annual low of 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). Phuket has a dry season that runs from December to March and a wet season that covers the remaining eight months. However, like many cities that feature a tropical monsoon climate, Phuket sees some precipitation even during its dry season. Phuket averages roughly 2,200 millimetres (87 in) of rain.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 16th-18th century: European contact ===\nThe Portuguese explorer Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto arrived in Siam in 1545. His accounts of the country go beyond Ayutthaya and include a reasonably detailed account of ports in the south of the Kingdom as well. Pinto was one of the first European explorers to detail Phuket in his travel accounts. He referred to the island as \"Junk Ceylon\", a name the Portuguese used for Phuket Island in their maps, mentioning the name seven times in his accounts. Pinto said that Junk Ceylon was a destination port where trading vessels made regular stops for supplies and provisions. However, during the mid-16th century, the island was in decline due to pirates and often rough and unpredictable seas, which deterred merchant vessels from visiting the island. Pinto mentioned several other notable port cities in his accounts, including Patani and Ligor, which is modern-day Nakhon Si Thamarat.In the 17th century, the Dutch, English and, after the 1680s, the French, competed for the opportunity to trade with Junk Ceylon, which was a rich source of tin. In September 1680, a ship of the French East India Company visited the island and left with a full cargo of tin.A year or two later, the Siamese King Narai, seeking to reduce Dutch and English influence, named as governor a French medical missionary, Brother Ren\u00e9 Charbonneau, a member of the Siam mission of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Missions \u00c9trang\u00e8res. Charbonneau remained as governor until 1685.\n\nIn 1685, King Narai confirmed the French tin monopoly in Phuket to their ambassador, the Chevalier de Chaumont. Chaumont's former ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel, Sieur de Billy, was named governor of the island. However, the French were expelled from Siam after the 1688 Siamese revolution. On 10 April 1689, Desfarges led an expedition to re-capture Thalang to restore French control in Siam. His occupation of the island led to nothing, and Desfarges returned to Puducherry in January 1690.\n\n\n==== 1785: Burmese invasion ====\n\nBefore the Burmese attacked Thalang in 1785 during the \"Nine Armies' Wars\", Francis Light, a British East India Company captain (and later founder of Penang), who had been based on the island for some years, notified the local administration that he had observed Burmese forces preparing to attack. The island's military governor had just died, so the Burmese thought that it could be easily seized. Than Phu Ying Chan, the widow of the recently deceased governor, and her sister Mook (\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e21\u0e38\u0e01)  ordered the women of the island to dress as soldiers and take positions on the Thalang city walls. The Burmese called off their attack due to the perceived strength of the defences. Short of food, they retreated. After a month-long siege of the capital city, the Burmese were forced to retreat on 13 March 1785. The two women became local heroines, receiving the royal titles Thao Thep Kasattri and Thao Si Sunthon from a grateful King Rama I.The seal of Phuket is a depiction of the Two Heroines Monument along Highway 402 in Phuket. This commemorates the sisters The seal is a circle surrounded by a kranok pattern and has been used since 1985.\n\n\n=== 19th\u201320th centuries ===\nDuring the reign of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) from 1 October 1868 to 23 October 1910, Phuket became the administrative centre of the tin-producing southern provinces. His reign was characterized by the modernization of Siam, governmental and social reforms, and territorial concessions to the British and French. As Siam was threatened by Western expansionism, Chulalongkorn managed to save Siam from colonization.\nIn 1933 Monthon Phuket (\u0e21\u0e13\u0e11\u0e25\u0e20\u0e39\u0e40\u0e01\u0e47\u0e15) was dissolved and Phuket became a province.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\n\n==== 2004 tsunami ====\n\nOn 26 December 2004, Phuket and other nearby areas on Thailand's west coast suffered damage when they were struck by a tsunami caused by the Indian Ocean earthquake. The waves destroyed several highly populated areas in the region, killing up to 5,300 people in Thailand, and two hundred thousand more throughout the Asian region. Some 250 were reported dead in Phuket, including foreign tourists. Almost all of the major beaches on the west coast of Phuket, especially Kamala, Patong, Karon, and Kata sustained major damage, with some damage caused to resorts and villages on the island's southern beaches. Thailand's hardest-hit area was the Takua Pa District of Phang Nga Province north of Phuket, where a thousand or more Burmese workers building new beach resorts died.\nIn December 2006, Thailand launched the first of 22 tsunami-detection buoys to be positioned around the Indian Ocean as part of a regional warning system. The satellite-linked deep-sea buoys float 1,000 km (620 mi) offshore, roughly midway between Thailand and Sri Lanka.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs with most of Thailand, the majority of the population is Buddhist, but there is a significant number of Muslims (20 percent) in Phuket, mainly descendants of the island's original sea-dwelling people. Among the Muslims, many are of Malay descent. People of Chinese ancestry make up an even larger population, many of whom are descendants of the tin miners who migrated to Phuket during the 19th century. Peranakans, known as \"Phuket Babas\" in the local tongue, constitute a fair share of Chinese community members, particularly among those who have family ties with the Peranakans of Penang and Malacca.Phuket provincial population in the preliminary count of the 2010 census was counted to be 525,018 people, including some 115,881 expatriates, or 21.1 per cent of the population. However, it is admitted this is inaccurate since The Phuket Provincial Employment Office currently records for more than 64,000 Burmese, Lao and Cambodian workers legally residing on the island. The Thai census figure for 2015 shows a population of 386,605 persons.The number of people on Phuket island swells to over a million during the high season, as tourists, mainly from Western Europe, China, Russia, and the United States flock to Phuket around Christmas.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\n\n=== Provincial government ===\nPhuket is divided into three districts (amphoe), which are further divided into 17 subdistricts (tambon), and 103 villages (muban).\n\nMueang Phuket\nKathu\nThalang\n\n\n=== Local government ===\nAs of 26 November 2019 there are: one Phuket Provincial Administration Organisation (ongkan borihan suan changwat) and 12 municipal (thesaban) areas in the province. Phuket has city (thesaban nakhon) status. Kathu and Patong have town (thesaban mueang) status.  Further 9 subdistrict municipalities (thesaban tambon). The non-municipal areas are administered by 6 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (ongkan borihan suan tambon).\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nTin mining was a major source of income for the island from the 16th century until petering out in the 20th century. In modern times, Phuket's economy has rested on two pillars: rubber tree plantations (making Thailand the biggest producer of rubber in the world) and tourism.Since the 1980s, the sandy beaches on the west coast of the island have been developed as tourist destinations, with Patong, Karon, and Kata being the most popular. Since the 2004 tsunami, all damaged buildings and attractions have been restored. Phuket is being intensely developed, with many new hotels, apartments, and houses under construction. \nIn July 2005, Phuket was voted one of the world's top five retirement destinations by Fortune Magazine.In 2017, Phuket received about 10 million visitors, most of them foreign, with China the leading contributor. Tourists generated some 385 billion baht in revenues, nearly 14 percent of the 2.77 trillion baht earned by the nation as a whole.The first half of 2019 saw a dip in the number of tourists visiting Phuket, driving lower hotel occupancy rates leading to increased price competition. RevPAR (revenue per available room) is down. A decline in the number of tourists, combined with an oversupply of hotel rooms, is the root of the problem.  Despite falling numbers, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) claims that tourism revenues have risen by 3.1% in the first half of 2019.\nNo one seems to know how many hotel rooms Phuket has available. Oxfam says it has 60,000 hotel rooms for its 9.1 million annual visitors. The Bangkok Post in September 2019 reported that Phuket has 600 hotels with 40,000 rooms.. Three weeks earlier it said that Phuket had 93,941 hotel rooms available, excluding villas and hostels, with an additional 15,000 projected to become available by 2024.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\nAir\n\nPhuket International Airport (HKT) commenced a 5.7 billion baht (US$185.7 million) expansion in September 2012, scheduled for completion on 14 February 2016. The airport will increase its annual handling capacity from 6.5 million to 12.5 million passengers, and add a new international terminal.\nRailThere is currently no rail line to Phuket. Trains run to Surat Thani 230 km away.\n\nCity transitSongthaews are a common mode of transport on Phuket. Phuket's songthaews are larger than those found in other areas of Thailand. Songthaews are the cheapest mode of transportation from town to town. They travel between the town and beaches. There are also conventional bus services and motorbike taxis. The latter are found in large numbers in the main town and at Patong Beach. Traditional tuk-tuks have been replaced by small vans, mostly red, with some being yellow or green. Car taxis in Phuket are quite expensive and charge flat rates between towns. Privately run buses are available from the airport to Phuket Town and major beaches. It is often recommended by locals to take the ride-share company, Grab.\n\nBusPhuket's Bus Station 2 BKS Terminal is the long-distance arrivals hub for buses to and from Bangkok and other major Thai cities and provinces. Located four kilometres to the north of Phuket's town centre and port, the complex is large and modern, linking with transportation by tuk-tuk, metered taxi, motorcycle taxi, songthaew, or local bus to the island's beaches and resorts. There are daily scheduled buses from private and government-run companies going to Phuket from Bangkok's Mo Chit and Southern terminal stations.\n\nTramThe Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (MRTA) announced in 2018 that bidding to construct a 60 kilometre-long, 23 station tram network in Phuket will commence in 2020. The 39 billion baht tram is part of the government's Private-Public-Partnership (PPP) plan which ensures it will be fast-tracked. The planned route stretches from Takua Thung District in Phang Nga Province to Chalong in Phuket. Phase one will connect Phuket International Airport with Chalong, about 40 kilometres. It will take three years to complete.\nFerryThere are daily ferry boats that connect Phuket to neighboring islands Phi Phi and Koh Lanta. Ferries depart daily from Rassada Pier and Tonsai Pier, with service expanding each year.The average price for a one-way ticket ranges from 300 THB to 1500 THB.\n\n\n== Health ==\n6 hospitals exist in Phuket. The main hospital in Phuket operated by the Ministry of Public Health is Vachira Phuket Hospital, with smaller hospitals at Thalang and Patong. 3 Private hospitals exist which are Phuket International Hospital, Bangkok Hospital Phuket and Mission Hospital Phuket.\n\n\n== Human achievement index 2017 ==\nSince 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nFootballPhuket City football club participates in Thai League 3 Lower Region, the third tier of Thai football league system. The Golden Sloop (Thai:\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e43\u0e1a\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e07) plays their home matches at Surakul Stadium.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nTwo Heroines Monument (\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e38\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e27\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e27\u0e35\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35), is the monument in Thalang District, a memorial statue of the heroines Thao Thep Kasattri (Kunying Jan) and Thao Sri Sunthon (Mook), who rallied islanders in 1785 to repel Burmese invaders. As the island's governor had just died, the organization of Phuket's defense against the Burmese invasion of 1785 was conducted by his widow, Thao Thep Kasattri. With her sister's help, they assembled what forces they had, then disguised local women as male soldiers, a ruse to swell the ranks of the defenders. After a month's siege, the Burmese invaders became exhausted and withdrew. King Rama I awarded Kunying Jan with the royal title of Thao Thep Kasattri.\nThalang National Museum (\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e18\u0e20\u0e31\u0e13\u0e11\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e19\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e07\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e15\u0e34 \u0e16\u0e25\u0e32\u0e07) is near the Two Heroines Monument. In 1985, on the 200th anniversary of the Thalang War, the Thalang National Museum was established. The museum contains a permanent exhibition of life in old Phuket, ancient artifacts, remains discovered on the coast, and materials used during war with Burma.\nHat Karon (\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e14\u0e01\u0e30\u0e23\u0e19) is the second largest of Phuket's tourist beaches, approximately 20 kilometres (12 mi) from town.

There is also its smaller sister beach, Karon Noi.\nKamala Beach, Hat Kamala is a large beach approximately 16 km (10 mi) north of Patong Beach. The beach is undeveloped with coral reefs on the north side and surfing in the low season. It is a tourist beach in the high season and a sleepy seaside Muslim village in the low season. There is a market on Wednesday and Friday nights, as well as a weekly Saturday market.\nView Point (\u0e08\u0e38\u0e14\u0e0a\u0e21\u0e27\u0e34\u0e27) is midway between Nai Harn and Kata Beaches.

Local villagers used to refer to the cape as \"Laem Chao\", or the God's Cape, and it was an easily recognizable landmark for the early seafarers traveling up the Malay Peninsula.\nWat Chalong (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e09\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e44\u0e0a\u0e22\u0e18\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e21) is where stands the cast statue of Luang Pho Cham, who helped the people of Phuket put down the Angyee, or Chinese Coolie Rebellion, in 1876 during the reign of Rama V.

They were constructed when tin mining was an important on the island. The architectural style, called \"Sino-Portuguese\", is European mixed with Chinese modern. Characteristic is a single or two-storey building with a narrow front compensated for by considerable depth. The tiles, doors, perforated windows and other details are all influenced by Chinese and European styles combined. \"Phuket Old Town\" is a  2.7 km2 area covering a total of 210 rai.

        "wiki": "Old Phuket Town, is an area of historical interest in Phuket City. The main streets of Old Phuket Town are Thalang, Phang Nga, Krabi, Dibuk, and Yoawarat. Old Phuket Town is noted for Sino-Portuguese buildings on both sides of the street. Many old buildings have been converted into shops, hotels, restaurants, and museums.\n\n\n== History ==\nPhuket has a rich history as tin-mining country peopled by Siamese, Chinese, Malays, Indians, Eurasians, and sea gypsies. A unique community in Phuket are the \"Baba\", with their own way of life, language, dress, and food. The core of this community was formed by early unions between Hokkien tin-miners and Siamese women. This distinctive Baba heritage can be seen in Old Phuket Town.Since the 16th century, Europeans have been involved in the tin trade of Phuket. In the 18th century, much of the island's tin mining was carried out by Hokkien Chinese who were instrumental in building the old part of the city. In the early-20th century, under Governor Phraya Rassada Nupradit, major European mining companies were invited in, and major public infrastructure such as roads and canals was built. No one knows exactly when the first building in this style was constructed, but photographs from the reign of King Rama V (1853\u20131910) show that it was already well established by then. Two styles of building in particular stand out: the shop-house (Sino-Portuguese style) and the big mansion (Sino-Colonial style).\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nChina Inn Cafe and Restaurant\nThe House of the Beautiful Images coffee shop\nThai Hua Museum\nBaan Chinpracha Museum\nPhra Pitak Chinpracha Mansion\nPhuket Provincial Hall\nPhuket Philatelic Museum\nOn On Hotel\nKopitiam Restaurant\n\n\n== References ==\nFootnotes\nSourceslestariheritage.net\nphuket.com",

        "wiki": "The Phuket Zoo is a zoo located in Phuket, Thailand. It was founded as a private zoo in 1997 and currently remains private. The zoo is located near the Muang District and the Phuket Bay. The zoo has been embroiled in controversy over its lack of animal welfare standards and allegations of extreme cruelty to animals.The zoo makes up 30 rai (12 acres). It is known for having close encounters with many exotic animals including tigers, monkeys and elephants. The zoo has many sections including areas devoted to crocodiles, elephants and monkeys while also having an aquarium and an orchard garden.\n\n\n== Animal shows ==\n\n\n=== Monkey shows ===\nThe monkey show consists of a macaque monkey doing tricks and then taking pictures with the crowd. Some of the monkey's tricks include riding a bike, dunking a basketball and doing exercises, like push-ups and sit-ups. After that, the monkey will walk around with an oil-paper umbrella and take pictures with guests.\n\n\n=== Elephant shows ===\n\nIn the elephant shows, a group of asian elephants perform tricks and have an opportunity to meet the guests. The elephants start off by doing tricks like kicking a soccer ball and will also do dances and races. At times, the guests will be able to feed the elephants bananas and at the end touch their trunks. The elephants have even be trained to ask for tips. Many of these shows are demeaning to the animals involved, and some say the zoo should be shut down entirely.\nThe elephants the zoo has were formerly logging elephants. Currently, the Zoo faces allegations of animal abuse due to their treatment of their captive elephants.\n\n\n=== Crocodile shows ===\nWhile there are no encounters guests can have with the crocodiles, many guests find the show very entertaining. The highlight is when one of the trainers sticks his head in between the crocodiles mouth.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\n\n\n=== Aquarium ===\nThe zoo has a small aquarium with a variety of fish and marine animals including fresh-water and salt-water fish, turtles, frogs, crabs and lizards. They also have a display area showing fishing equipment and techniques of Thailand's fisherman as well as seashells.\n\n\n=== Bird Park ===\nThe Phuket's Zoo Bird Park has a variety of birds including toucans, peacocks, parrots, hawks, emus and ostriches. Some of the birds are allowed to fly freely in the park. For some reason there's a civet cat\n\n\n== Animal encounters ==\nAs well as the opportunities to meet the animals during the shows, the Phuket Zoo also allows guests to meet some of their other animals. Some of those opportunities include getting to take pictures and pet a tiger. Formerly, you could take pictures and touch an orangutan, but she was later confiscated by the police. The experiences cost an extra fee.\n\n\n== Conservation efforts by the zoo ==\nIt does not appear that the Phuket Zoo is involved with conservation efforts to save animals worldwide. They are also not accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums or the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums.\n\n\n== Milo the Orangutan ==\nThe Phuket Zoo formerly had an orangutan named, Milo. However, a petition garnished over 10,000 signatures for her to be removed due to her being forced to take photos and her health struggles. Due to the petition, the Natural Resources and Environmental Crime Division of the Royal Thai Police and Department of National Parks decided to confiscate her after it appeared she was being kept illegally.\nWhen the authorities came to confiscate Milo, she was not at the zoo. All pictures of her on the zoo's website were also deleted. Later in the week, Milo was found in a small cage in the jungle.\nMilo later died the following year of a stroke. Her bad health from her time at the zoo most likely contributed to her passing.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nWhile many guests enjoy their time at the Phuket Zoo, many people find the zoo to be cruel and inhumane.\n\n\n=== Disappearance of animals ===\nSome guests have complained that animals at the zoo including snow leopards and camels disappeared without any word from the zoo. Some people have speculated that the animals may have gotten sick and were sold off before they died.\n\n\n=== Monkeys ===\nThe macaque monkey used in the monkey shows have a rope around their neck and are forced to do tricks. One exhibit holds two monkeys, but one is more aggressive than the other forcing it to become malnourished. One gibbon is even in a staff-member's arms all day and stays in a cage with a lock  at night with no room to move.\n\n\n=== Elephants ===\nIn 2019, a 2-year-old elephant died from injuries he sustained after performing for tourists.\n\n\n=== Crocodiles ===\nThe crocodile exhibit is highly criticized for being overcrowded, small and dirty. Many people have said the water the crocodiles have is too shallow and is filled with feces. They have also been caught on video being poked at with brooms.\n\n\n=== Turtle ===\nA video of a turtle at the Phuket Zoo's Aquarium sparked controversy as its exhibit seemed to be too small for it to move.\n\n\n=== Bird Park ===\nSome of the birds in the Bird Park are chained up and some guests  have said the bird's cages are too small and overcrowded.\n\n\n=== Drugging of animals ===\nDue to the fact many animals have encounters with humans, many guests speculate that the animals are drugged so they don't attack humans.\n\n\n=== Inadequate exhibits ===\nMany of the animal's exhibits, including the ostrich and deer, have no grass, shrubbery or enrichment toys. Even one of the Asiatic black bear's enclosure was just a concrete pit.\n\n\n== Efforts to change or close the Phuket Zoo ==\nPETA has called on the zoo to \"Improve the Living Conditions of the Animals...\"\nThere are also plenty of petitions online including one on change.org that call for the closing of the Phuket Zoo.\n\n\n== Animal list ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Amazing Race 26 is the twenty-sixth installment of the American reality television show The Amazing Race. In this installment, eleven teams of dating couples (six existing couples and five blind date teams who met for the first time at the start of the Race) competed in a race around the world for a US$1 million grand prize. The season premiered on CBS for the 2014\u201315 television season with a special 90-minute episode on Wednesday, February 25, 2015. Following the premiere, the program aired in the same time slot that the previous season of The Amazing Race took.

In some legs of the Race, a special clue was available. Teams that received the special clue were given a Date Night reward, an opportunity to participate in a romantic activity.The Save from the previous season returned for this season but was unaired, unclaimed, and unused. It could be obtained during the 3rd leg of the Race by completing both sides of the Detour.For the second season in a row, four teams competed in the final leg of the Race. However, the host of the show, Phil Keoghan, eliminated one team in the middle of the final leg, leaving only three teams to race to the Finish Line for the $1 million grand prize.\nStarting with this season, the scenes in which host Phil Keoghan described the country and Pit Stop were removed and replaced with the teams discussing what happened during the previous episode or a team having their date night before the next leg began.\n\n\n=== Casting and contestants ===\n\nThe cast included Olympic couple Aly Dudek and Steven Langton, as well as New Kids on the Block member Jonathan Knight, racing with his boyfriend, Harley Rodriguez. This season was the first in the history of the American edition or any international edition of the program, which did not include at least one all-female team. The reasons for not casting at least one lesbian dating couple, whether preexisting or blind date, are unknown.\nAt the Pit Stop of Leg 3, Matt Cucolo proposed to Ashley Gordon, who accepted, becoming the third team to do so after Hayden & Aaron from The Amazing Race 6 and Chad & Stephanie from The Amazing Race 17.\n\n\n==== Future appearances ====\nIn June 2015, Jackie Ibarra and Jeff Weldon were revealed as additional contestants by Race host Phil Keoghan on the seventeenth season of fellow CBS reality show Big Brother.

The first place team was still awarded a prize for that leg. An underlined team placement indicates that the team came in last on a \"continue racing\" leg but was not eliminated at the end of the leg. Teams were warned that at some point in the next leg, a team would be eliminated.\n\n\n== Prizes ==\nThe prize for each leg was awarded to the first place team for that corresponding leg of the Race.

        "wiki": "Sirinat National Park (Thai: \u0e2d\u0e38\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e19\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e07\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e15\u0e34\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e23\u0e34\u0e19\u0e32\u0e16) is a national park in Phuket Province, Thailand. This park, with sections on land and sea, is in the northwest of the island of Phuket.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSirinat National Park is in Thalang District, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) north of Phuket town on the coastal section surrounding Phuket International Airport.\nThe park's total area is 90 square kilometres (35 sq mi), with 68 square kilometres (26 sq mi) of marine area and 22 square kilometres (8.5 sq mi) land-based. The park includes four main beaches: Hat Nai Thon, Hat Nai Yang, Hat Mai Khao, and Hat Sai Kaeo. Hat Mai Khao is Phuket's longest beach.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe park was originally known as Nai Yang National Park and became Thailand's 51st national park on 13 July 1981. It was renamed Sirinat National Park in 1992.A 2014 Bangkok Post editorial said that, \"The latest questionable development in the sad saga of Sirinat National Park in Phuket province raises serious and vexing issues. Among the most pertinent is the old paradox of \"Who will watch the watchers?\" The Royal Thai Navy has moved into the precious park on the pretext of providing security. But the threats to this little jewel of national land are not physical, and heavily armed military men provide no solution at all\".In January 2016, it was reported that about 1,200 rai of Sirinat Park land was \"detached\" from the park by unscrupulous officials and sold to property developers, completed with illegal deeds, for 40 million baht per rai or approximately 50 billion baht in total. \"The land had been detached from the national park so investers [sic] could build resorts and several well-known hotels,...\", according to Mr Damrong Phidet, a former director-general of the National Parks, Wildlife and Plants Conservation Department.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nSirinat National Park is best known for its well-preserved white sand beaches. Also, Hat Mai Khao and Hat Nai Yang are both sea turtle nesting areas. Between November and February sea turtles come to lay eggs on these beaches.\n\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\nThe park's beach forests, approximately 2 square kilometres (0.77 sq mi) in area, consist of numerous tree species with the effect of providing a windbreak during tropical storms and stabilising the beach sands. Tree species include common ironwood, tulip tree, tropical almond, white barringtonia, cajeput tree, Alexandrian laurel, screwpine, ashoka tree, black plum, elephant apple and morning glory.Beach forest birds include magpie-robin, common myna, spotted dove, Asian fairy-bluebird, oriole, greater racket-tailed drongo and some bulbul species.Sirinat National Park also hosts a small area (1 square kilometre) of mangrove forest, located where freshwater and seawater mix in estuarine areas. Tree species here include red mangrove, white mangrove, black mangrove, cannonball mangrove, looking-glass mangrove and Ceriops. Other plant species include Rhizophora apiculata and Derris trifoliata.Mangrove forest birds include collared kingfisher, Terek sandpiper, bar-tailed godwit, white-breasted waterhen, slaty-breasted rail, white-bellied sea eagle, brahminy kite and large-billed crow.The mangrove forest hosts some reptiles such as monitor lizard, mangrove snake and turtle.\nMangrove marine life includes shrimp, mudskipper, mullet, grouper and garfish.\nCoral reefs are located in the marine section of the park at a distance of  700 metres (2,300 ft) to 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) offshore. Reef species include plate coral, soft coral, sea fan and sea anemone.Formerly, leatherback sea turtles laid eggs on a stretch of beach in Sirinat National Park. At the park, 166 eggs were laid between 1999\u20132013, but the survival rate was small given the intensive property development along the beach. Since 2013 no further eggs have been observed there. Thailand was once a sanctuary for leatherback turtles.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Elephant Nature Park is a sanctuary and rescue centre for elephants in Mae Taeng District, Chiang Mai Province, Northern Thailand, approximately 60 kilometres (37 mi) from Chiang Mai City, co-founded by Sangduen \"Lek\" (Thai for \"Small\") Chailert.  In 2013 Erawan Elephant Retirement Park opened in western Thailand as an offshoot.  By 2016 there were branch elephant parks in Surin and in Cambodia, and there were plans to open a fifth park in Phuket. By then the work was coordinated by the Save the Elephant Foundation.\nThe parks provide sanctuary for rescued elephants and operate under a business model in which tourists pay to visit and help care for the animals, and can stay for extended periods.\n\n\n== History ==\nLek Chailert started working on elephant conservation in 1996. Teak logging, in which many elephants were used, had been banned in Thailand in 1989, and those elephants had been abandoned or sold for use in the tourist industry or for begging in cities. Elephants are also left maimed after poachers take their ivory.In the late 1990s the government of Thailand was working to promote ecotourism in Chiang Mai Province; tourism brought in 350 million dollars in 1997 and was the province's biggest source of revenue; the ecotourism plans were controversial with indigenous people there.By 1998, an organization called Green Tours run by Adam Flinn had founded Elephant Nature Park, a tourist site and reserve for rescued elephants in a valley about an hour north of Chiang Mai, with Chailert, who owned some of the land and leased some from the Thai government.  At that time the park featured a daily elephant show where elephants performed tricks like balancing on one leg and playing football, and included elephant rides.  She maintained a more isolated section up one of the surrounding mountains for especially damaged animals that she called \"Elephant Heaven.\"  The park had 34 rescued elephants.  Her goal was to eventually end the performances and run it purely as a reserve.By 2002 Chailert was well known for campaigning against elephant crushing  and around that time a documentary about the treatment of elephants in Thailand featuring Chailert's work was released; in response, PETA called for a boycott of Thailand until conditions there changed.By 2005 the boycott campaign had made Chailert an embarrassment to the Thai government and had led to death threats and to Friends of the Asian Elephant, a government-funded organization that had done work to improve conditions for elephants, ending its funding for Chailert's work. Chailert was listed in a special 2005 post-tsunami issue of the Asian edition of Time magazine as one of \"Asia's heroes\".  By 2005 17 of the elephants Chailert had rescued were adults, and she had also opened a travel agency in Chiang Mai. By this time the park no longer offered performances and had shifted to a business model in which visitors could come help care for the elephants.In 2010 the park had 33 elephants and visitors could come for up to 28 days, paying $400/week.In 2013 Erawan Elephant Retirement Park opened in western Thailand on 50 hectares of land beside the River Kwai an hour from Kanchanaburri, as an extension of the original park and using the same business model; it opened with five elephants, one of which died in the first year.  In 2014 there were 37 elephants at Elephant Nature Park.As of 2016, Chailert had rescued a total of 200 distressed elephants since she started in 1996 and there were branch elephant parks in Surin and in Cambodia, and there were plans to open a fifth park in Phuket.  That work is coordinated by the Save the Elephant Foundation, run by the same people.\n\n\n== Recognition and Criticism ==\nFor her work, Chailert received numerous awards and recognitions, such as the Ford Foundation's \u201cHero of the Planet\u201d (2001), Time Magazine's Heroes of Asia (2005), one of six Women Heroes of Global Conservation (2010), and the Responsible Thailand Award for Animal Welfare (2018). In addition to the elephants, Chailert has accommodated over 400 dogs, cats, birds and water buffaloes at the Park. She also convinced several independent camps to improve the lives of elephants and forbid tourists from riding them through her Saddle Off! outreach program. On the other hand, in 2011, Elephant Aid International assessed the care of elephants in the Elephant Nature Park and found abundant foot disease, long periods of chaining on concrete floors, low mahout morale, and dominance as the form of elephant management used by mahouts. It also noted problems with the elephants' diet, sanitation, exercise, and stress levels, and disapproved of tourists having direct contact with the elephants.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nsegments from Vanishing Giants, documentary film by Jennifer Hile via National Geographic.

        "wiki": "Phuket (; Thai: \u0e20\u0e39\u0e40\u0e01\u0e47\u0e15, [p\u02b0\u016b\u02d0.k\u00e8t] (listen), Malay: Talang or Tanjung Salang) is one of the southern provinces (changwat) of Thailand. It consists of the island of Phuket, the country's largest island, and another 32 smaller islands off its coast. It lies off the west coast of Thailand in the Andaman Sea. Phuket Island is connected by the Sarasin Bridge to Phang Nga Province to the north. The next nearest province is Krabi, to the east across Phang Nga Bay.\nPhuket Province has an area of 576 square kilometres (222 sq mi), somewhat less than that of Singapore, and is the second-smallest province of Thailand. The island was on one of the major trading routes between India and China, and was frequently mentioned in foreign ships' logs of Portuguese, French, Dutch, and English traders, but was never colonised by a European power. It formerly derived its wealth from tin and rubber and now from tourism.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThere are several possible derivations of the relatively recent name \"Phuket\" (of which the digraph ph represents an aspirated p). One theory is it is derived from the word Bukit (Jawi: \u0628\u0648\u0643\u064a\u062a) in Malay which means \"hill\", as this is what the island appears like from a distance.\nPhuket was formerly known as Thalang (\u0e16\u0e25\u0e32\u0e07 Tha-Laang), derived from the old Malay \"telong\" (Jawi: \u062a\u0644\u0648\u06a0) which means \"cape\". The northern district of the province, which was the location of the old capital, still uses this name. In Western sources and navigation charts, it was known as Junk Ceylon or Junkceylon (a corruption of the Malay Tanjung Salang, i.e., \"Cape Salang\").\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nPhuket is the largest island in Thailand. It is in the Andaman Sea in southern Thailand. The island is mostly mountainous with a mountain range in the west of the island from the north to the south. The mountains of Phuket form the southern end of the Phuket mountain range, which ranges for 440 kilometres (270 mi) from the Kra Isthmus.\n\nAlthough some recent geographical works refer to the sections of the Tenasserim Hills in the isthmus as the \"Phuket Range\", these names are not found in classical geographic sources. Besides, the name Phuket is relatively recent having previously been named Jung Ceylon and Thalang. The highest elevation of the island is usually regarded as Khao Mai Thao Sip Song (Twelve Canes), at 529 metres (1,736 ft) above sea level. However, it has been reported by barometric pressure readings that there is an even higher elevation (with no apparent name), of 542 meters above sea level, in the Kamala hills behind Kathu waterfall.Its population was 249,446 in 2000, rising to 525,709 in the 2010 decennial census, the highest growth rate of all provinces nationwide at 7.4 percent annually. Some 600,000 people reside on Phuket currently, among them migrants, international ex-pats, Thais registered in other provinces, and locals. The registered population, however, includes only Thais who are registered in a \"tabien baan\" or house registration book, which most are not, and the end of 2012 was 360,905 persons.Phuket is approximately 863 kilometres (536 mi) south of Bangkok and covers an area of 543 square kilometres (210 sq mi) excluding small islets. It is estimated that Phuket would have a total area of approximately 576 square kilometres (222 sq mi) if all its outlying islands were included. Other islands are:\nKo Lone 4.77 square kilometres (1.84 sq mi), Ko Maprao 3.7 square kilometres (1.4 sq mi), Ko Naka Yai 2.08 square kilometres (0.80 sq mi), Ko Racha Noi 3.06 square kilometres (1.18 sq mi), Ko Racha Yai 4.5 square kilometres (1.7 sq mi), and the second biggest, Ko Sire 8.8 square kilometres (3.4 sq mi).\nThe island's length, from north to south, is 48 kilometres (30 mi) and its width is 21 kilometres (13 mi).Seventy percent of Phuket's area is covered with mountains which stretch from north to south. The remaining 30 percent are plains in the central and eastern parts of the island. It has a total of nine brooks and creeks but does not have any major rivers.\nForest, rubber, and palm oil plantations cover 60 percent of the island. The west coast has several sandy beaches. The east coast beaches are more often muddy. Near the southernmost point is Laem Phromthep (Thai: \u0e41\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e)(\"Brahma's Cape\"), a popular viewpoint. In the mountainous north of the island is the Khao Phra Thaeo No-Hunting Area, protecting more than 20 km\u00b2 of the rainforest. The three highest peaks of this reserve are the Khao Prathiu (384 metres (1,260 ft)), Khao Bang Pae 388 metres (1,273 ft), and Khao Phara 422 metres (1,385 ft). The Sirinat National Park on the northwest coast was established in 1981 to protect an area of 90 square kilometres (35 sq mi) (68 kilometres (42 mi) marine area), including the Nai Yang Beach where sea turtles lay their eggs.The most popular (and overcrowded) tourist area on Phuket is Patong Beach on the central west coast, perhaps owing to the easy access to its wide and long beach. Most of Phuket's nightlife and its shopping is in Patong, and the area has become increasingly developed. Patong means \"the forest filled with banana leaves\" in Thai. South of Patong lie Karon Beach, Kata Beach, Kata Noi Beach, and around the southern tip of the island, Nai Han Beach and Rawai. To the north of Patong are Kamala Beach, Surin Beach, and Bang Tao Beach. These areas are generally much less developed than Patong. To the southeast is Bon Island and to the south are several coral islands. The Similan Islands lie to the northwest and the Phi Phi Islands which are part of Krabi Province, to the southeast.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Phuket features a tropical monsoon climate (Am). Due to its proximity to the equator, in the year, there is a little variation in temperatures. The city has an average annual high of 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) and an annual low of 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). Phuket has a dry season that runs from December to March and a wet season that covers the remaining eight months. However, like many cities that feature a tropical monsoon climate, Phuket sees some precipitation even during its dry season. Phuket averages roughly 2,200 millimetres (87 in) of rain.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 16th-18th century: European contact ===\nThe Portuguese explorer Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto arrived in Siam in 1545. His accounts of the country go beyond Ayutthaya and include a reasonably detailed account of ports in the south of the Kingdom as well. Pinto was one of the first European explorers to detail Phuket in his travel accounts. He referred to the island as \"Junk Ceylon\", a name the Portuguese used for Phuket Island in their maps, mentioning the name seven times in his accounts. Pinto said that Junk Ceylon was a destination port where trading vessels made regular stops for supplies and provisions. However, during the mid-16th century, the island was in decline due to pirates and often rough and unpredictable seas, which deterred merchant vessels from visiting the island. Pinto mentioned several other notable port cities in his accounts, including Patani and Ligor, which is modern-day Nakhon Si Thamarat.In the 17th century, the Dutch, English and, after the 1680s, the French, competed for the opportunity to trade with Junk Ceylon, which was a rich source of tin. In September 1680, a ship of the French East India Company visited the island and left with a full cargo of tin.A year or two later, the Siamese King Narai, seeking to reduce Dutch and English influence, named as governor a French medical missionary, Brother Ren\u00e9 Charbonneau, a member of the Siam mission of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Missions \u00c9trang\u00e8res. Charbonneau remained as governor until 1685.\n\nIn 1685, King Narai confirmed the French tin monopoly in Phuket to their ambassador, the Chevalier de Chaumont. Chaumont's former ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel, Sieur de Billy, was named governor of the island. However, the French were expelled from Siam after the 1688 Siamese revolution. On 10 April 1689, Desfarges led an expedition to re-capture Thalang to restore French control in Siam. His occupation of the island led to nothing, and Desfarges returned to Puducherry in January 1690.\n\n\n==== 1785: Burmese invasion ====\n\nBefore the Burmese attacked Thalang in 1785 during the \"Nine Armies' Wars\", Francis Light, a British East India Company captain (and later founder of Penang), who had been based on the island for some years, notified the local administration that he had observed Burmese forces preparing to attack. The island's military governor had just died, so the Burmese thought that it could be easily seized. Than Phu Ying Chan, the widow of the recently deceased governor, and her sister Mook (\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e21\u0e38\u0e01)  ordered the women of the island to dress as soldiers and take positions on the Thalang city walls. The Burmese called off their attack due to the perceived strength of the defences. Short of food, they retreated. After a month-long siege of the capital city, the Burmese were forced to retreat on 13 March 1785. The two women became local heroines, receiving the royal titles Thao Thep Kasattri and Thao Si Sunthon from a grateful King Rama I.The seal of Phuket is a depiction of the Two Heroines Monument along Highway 402 in Phuket. This commemorates the sisters The seal is a circle surrounded by a kranok pattern and has been used since 1985.\n\n\n=== 19th\u201320th centuries ===\nDuring the reign of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) from 1 October 1868 to 23 October 1910, Phuket became the administrative centre of the tin-producing southern provinces. His reign was characterized by the modernization of Siam, governmental and social reforms, and territorial concessions to the British and French. As Siam was threatened by Western expansionism, Chulalongkorn managed to save Siam from colonization.\nIn 1933 Monthon Phuket (\u0e21\u0e13\u0e11\u0e25\u0e20\u0e39\u0e40\u0e01\u0e47\u0e15) was dissolved and Phuket became a province.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\n\n==== 2004 tsunami ====\n\nOn 26 December 2004, Phuket and other nearby areas on Thailand's west coast suffered damage when they were struck by a tsunami caused by the Indian Ocean earthquake. The waves destroyed several highly populated areas in the region, killing up to 5,300 people in Thailand, and two hundred thousand more throughout the Asian region. Some 250 were reported dead in Phuket, including foreign tourists. Almost all of the major beaches on the west coast of Phuket, especially Kamala, Patong, Karon, and Kata sustained major damage, with some damage caused to resorts and villages on the island's southern beaches. Thailand's hardest-hit area was the Takua Pa District of Phang Nga Province north of Phuket, where a thousand or more Burmese workers building new beach resorts died.\nIn December 2006, Thailand launched the first of 22 tsunami-detection buoys to be positioned around the Indian Ocean as part of a regional warning system. The satellite-linked deep-sea buoys float 1,000 km (620 mi) offshore, roughly midway between Thailand and Sri Lanka.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAs with most of Thailand, the majority of the population is Buddhist, but there is a significant number of Muslims (20 percent) in Phuket, mainly descendants of the island's original sea-dwelling people. Among the Muslims, many are of Malay descent. People of Chinese ancestry make up an even larger population, many of whom are descendants of the tin miners who migrated to Phuket during the 19th century. Peranakans, known as \"Phuket Babas\" in the local tongue, constitute a fair share of Chinese community members, particularly among those who have family ties with the Peranakans of Penang and Malacca.Phuket provincial population in the preliminary count of the 2010 census was counted to be 525,018 people, including some 115,881 expatriates, or 21.1 per cent of the population. However, it is admitted this is inaccurate since The Phuket Provincial Employment Office currently records for more than 64,000 Burmese, Lao and Cambodian workers legally residing on the island. The Thai census figure for 2015 shows a population of 386,605 persons.The number of people on Phuket island swells to over a million during the high season, as tourists, mainly from Western Europe, China, Russia, and the United States flock to Phuket around Christmas.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\n\n=== Provincial government ===\nPhuket is divided into three districts (amphoe), which are further divided into 17 subdistricts (tambon), and 103 villages (muban).\n\nMueang Phuket\nKathu\nThalang\n\n\n=== Local government ===\nAs of 26 November 2019 there are: one Phuket Provincial Administration Organisation (ongkan borihan suan changwat) and 12 municipal (thesaban) areas in the province. Phuket has city (thesaban nakhon) status. Kathu and Patong have town (thesaban mueang) status.  Further 9 subdistrict municipalities (thesaban tambon). The non-municipal areas are administered by 6 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (ongkan borihan suan tambon).\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nTin mining was a major source of income for the island from the 16th century until petering out in the 20th century. In modern times, Phuket's economy has rested on two pillars: rubber tree plantations (making Thailand the biggest producer of rubber in the world) and tourism.Since the 1980s, the sandy beaches on the west coast of the island have been developed as tourist destinations, with Patong, Karon, and Kata being the most popular. Since the 2004 tsunami, all damaged buildings and attractions have been restored. Phuket is being intensely developed, with many new hotels, apartments, and houses under construction. \nIn July 2005, Phuket was voted one of the world's top five retirement destinations by Fortune Magazine.In 2017, Phuket received about 10 million visitors, most of them foreign, with China the leading contributor. Tourists generated some 385 billion baht in revenues, nearly 14 percent of the 2.77 trillion baht earned by the nation as a whole.The first half of 2019 saw a dip in the number of tourists visiting Phuket, driving lower hotel occupancy rates leading to increased price competition. RevPAR (revenue per available room) is down. A decline in the number of tourists, combined with an oversupply of hotel rooms, is the root of the problem.  Despite falling numbers, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) claims that tourism revenues have risen by 3.1% in the first half of 2019.\nNo one seems to know how many hotel rooms Phuket has available. Oxfam says it has 60,000 hotel rooms for its 9.1 million annual visitors. The Bangkok Post in September 2019 reported that Phuket has 600 hotels with 40,000 rooms.. Three weeks earlier it said that Phuket had 93,941 hotel rooms available, excluding villas and hostels, with an additional 15,000 projected to become available by 2024.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\nAir\n\nPhuket International Airport (HKT) commenced a 5.7 billion baht (US$185.7 million) expansion in September 2012, scheduled for completion on 14 February 2016. The airport will increase its annual handling capacity from 6.5 million to 12.5 million passengers, and add a new international terminal.\nRailThere is currently no rail line to Phuket. Trains run to Surat Thani 230 km away.\n\nCity transitSongthaews are a common mode of transport on Phuket. Phuket's songthaews are larger than those found in other areas of Thailand. Songthaews are the cheapest mode of transportation from town to town. They travel between the town and beaches. There are also conventional bus services and motorbike taxis. The latter are found in large numbers in the main town and at Patong Beach. Traditional tuk-tuks have been replaced by small vans, mostly red, with some being yellow or green. Car taxis in Phuket are quite expensive and charge flat rates between towns. Privately run buses are available from the airport to Phuket Town and major beaches. It is often recommended by locals to take the ride-share company, Grab.\n\nBusPhuket's Bus Station 2 BKS Terminal is the long-distance arrivals hub for buses to and from Bangkok and other major Thai cities and provinces. Located four kilometres to the north of Phuket's town centre and port, the complex is large and modern, linking with transportation by tuk-tuk, metered taxi, motorcycle taxi, songthaew, or local bus to the island's beaches and resorts. There are daily scheduled buses from private and government-run companies going to Phuket from Bangkok's Mo Chit and Southern terminal stations.\n\nTramThe Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (MRTA) announced in 2018 that bidding to construct a 60 kilometre-long, 23 station tram network in Phuket will commence in 2020. The 39 billion baht tram is part of the government's Private-Public-Partnership (PPP) plan which ensures it will be fast-tracked. The planned route stretches from Takua Thung District in Phang Nga Province to Chalong in Phuket. Phase one will connect Phuket International Airport with Chalong, about 40 kilometres. It will take three years to complete.\nFerryThere are daily ferry boats that connect Phuket to neighboring islands Phi Phi and Koh Lanta. Ferries depart daily from Rassada Pier and Tonsai Pier, with service expanding each year.The average price for a one-way ticket ranges from 300 THB to 1500 THB.\n\n\n== Health ==\n6 hospitals exist in Phuket. The main hospital in Phuket operated by the Ministry of Public Health is Vachira Phuket Hospital, with smaller hospitals at Thalang and Patong. 3 Private hospitals exist which are Phuket International Hospital, Bangkok Hospital Phuket and Mission Hospital Phuket.\n\n\n== Human achievement index 2017 ==\nSince 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nFootballPhuket City football club participates in Thai League 3 Lower Region, the third tier of Thai football league system. The Golden Sloop (Thai:\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e43\u0e1a\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e07) plays their home matches at Surakul Stadium.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\nTwo Heroines Monument (\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e38\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e27\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e27\u0e35\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35), is the monument in Thalang District, a memorial statue of the heroines Thao Thep Kasattri (Kunying Jan) and Thao Sri Sunthon (Mook), who rallied islanders in 1785 to repel Burmese invaders. As the island's governor had just died, the organization of Phuket's defense against the Burmese invasion of 1785 was conducted by his widow, Thao Thep Kasattri. With her sister's help, they assembled what forces they had, then disguised local women as male soldiers, a ruse to swell the ranks of the defenders. After a month's siege, the Burmese invaders became exhausted and withdrew. King Rama I awarded Kunying Jan with the royal title of Thao Thep Kasattri.\nThalang National Museum (\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e18\u0e20\u0e31\u0e13\u0e11\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e19\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e07\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e15\u0e34 \u0e16\u0e25\u0e32\u0e07) is near the Two Heroines Monument. In 1985, on the 200th anniversary of the Thalang War, the Thalang National Museum was established. The museum contains a permanent exhibition of life in old Phuket, ancient artifacts, remains discovered on the coast, and materials used during war with Burma.\nHat Karon (\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e14\u0e01\u0e30\u0e23\u0e19) is the second largest of Phuket's tourist beaches, approximately 20 kilometres (12 mi) from town. Large resort complexes line the road behind the shoreline, but the broad beach itself has no development. The southern point has a coral reef stretching toward Kata and Poo Island. There is also its smaller sister beach, Karon Noi.\nKamala Beach, Hat Kamala is a large beach approximately 16 km (10 mi) north of Patong Beach. The beach is undeveloped with coral reefs on the north side and surfing in the low season. It is a tourist beach in the high season and a sleepy seaside Muslim village in the low season. There is a market on Wednesday and Friday nights, as well as a weekly Saturday market.\nView Point (\u0e08\u0e38\u0e14\u0e0a\u0e21\u0e27\u0e34\u0e27) is midway between Nai Harn and Kata Beaches.

Local villagers used to refer to the cape as \"Laem Chao\", or the God's Cape, and it was an easily recognizable landmark for the early seafarers traveling up the Malay Peninsula.\nWat Chalong (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e09\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e44\u0e0a\u0e22\u0e18\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e21) is where stands the cast statue of Luang Pho Cham, who helped the people of Phuket put down the Angyee, or Chinese Coolie Rebellion, in 1876 during the reign of Rama V.

George Town is Malaysia's third most populous city with 708,127 inhabitants as of 2010, while Greater Penang is the nation's second largest conurbation in the country after Greater Kuala Lumpur with a population of 2,412,616. The historical core of George Town has been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2008.Established as an entrep\u00f4t by Francis Light of the British East India Company in 1786, George Town was the first British settlement in Southeast Asia. Together with Singapore and Malacca, George Town formed part of the Straits Settlements, which became a British crown colony in 1867. It was subjugated by Japan during World War II, before being recaptured by the British at war's end. Shortly before Malaya attained independence from the British in 1957, George Town was declared a city by Queen Elizabeth II, making it the first city in the country's modern history.\nDue to the intermingling of the various ethnicities and religions that arrived on its shores, George Town acquired a large eclectic assortment of colonial and Asian architectural styles. It also gained a reputation as Malaysia's gastronomic capital for its distinct and ubiquitous street food. Moreover, the city hosts unique cultural heritage, such as the Peranakans, whose legacies are still visible on Penang's architecture and cuisine.\nThe city of George Town includes the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone, a high-tech manufacturing hub regarded as the \"Silicon Valley of the East\". The city also serves as the financial centre of northern Malaysia and the nation's most vital medical tourism hub. Logistically, the Penang International Airport links George Town with several major regional cities, while a ferry service, the Penang Bridge and the Second Penang Bridge connect the city with the rest of Peninsular Malaysia. Meanwhile, George Town's Swettenham Pier has emerged as the busiest port of call in Malaysia for cruise ships.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Establishment ===\nIn the 1770s, the British East India Company instructed Francis Light, a British Royal Navy captain, to form trade relations in the Malay Peninsula. Light subsequently landed in Kedah, a Siamese vassal state threatened by both Siam and Burma, as well as an internal Bugis revolt. Aware of this situation, Light formed friendly relations with the then Sultan of Kedah, Sultan Muhammad Jiwa Zainal Adilin II, and promised British military protection, while the Sultan reciprocally offered Penang Island, then part of Kedah.Although Light subsequently reported on this offer to his superiors, it was only in 1786 when he was finally ordered to obtain Penang Island from Kedah. The British East India Company sought control of the island as a Royal Navy base, and as a trading post between China and India. To that end, Light negotiated with the new Sultan of Kedah, Sultan Abdullah Mukarram Shah, regarding the cession of the island to the British East India Company in exchange for British military aid. After an agreement was signed between Light and the Sultan, Light and his entourage sailed on to Penang Island, where they arrived on 17 July 1786.The area where Light first landed, which is now the Esplanade, was originally a swamp covered in thick jungle. Once the area was cleared, a simple ceremony was held on 11 August, during which the Union Jack was raised. Penang Island was renamed the Prince of Wales Island after the heir to the British throne, while the new settlement of George Town was created in honour of King George III.Light developed George Town as a free port, thus allowing merchants to trade without having to pay any form of tax or duties. The policy's intent was to entice traders from the Dutch ports in the region. The number of incoming vessels rose from 85 in 1786 to 3,569 in 1802; George Town's population had also increased to 10,000 by 1792.A committee of assessors was established in 1800, making it the first local council to be established in British Malaya. Meanwhile, a Supreme Court was established at Fort Cornwallis in 1808.\n\n\n=== Colonial era ===\n\nIn the early 19th century, Penang Island became a centre of spice production within Southeast Asia. Spices such as nutmeg, clove and pepper, produced from the spice farms throughout the island, were exported via the Port of Penang in George Town. The spice trade also allowed the British East India Company to cover the administrative costs of Penang.In 1826, George Town was made the capital of the Straits Settlements, an administrative polity that was also composed of Singapore and Malacca. However, the capital was then shifted to Singapore in 1832, as the latter had usurped George Town's position as the region's preeminent harbour.\n\nNonetheless, George Town retained its importance as a vital British entrep\u00f4t. Due to the opening of the Suez Canal, the advent of steam ships and a tin mining boom in the Malay Peninsula, the Port of Penang became a major tin-exporting harbour. By the end of the 19th century, as mercantile firms and banks, including Standard Chartered and HSBC, flocked into George Town, the city also evolved into a leading financial centre in Malaya.Throughout the century, George Town's population grew rapidly in tandem with the city's economic prosperity. A cosmopolitan, multi-cultural population emerged, comprising Chinese, Malay, Indian, Peranakan, Eurasian, Thai and other ethnicities. However, the population growth also created social problems, such as inadequate sanitation and public health facilities, as well as rampant crime. The latter culminated in the Penang Riots of 1867, during which rival Chinese triads clashed in the streets of George Town.Also in the same year, the Straits Settlements was made a British crown colony, to be governed directly by the Colonial Office in London. For George Town, direct British rule meant better law enforcement, as the police force was vastly improved and the secret societies that had previously plagued the city were gradually outlawed. More investments were also made on the city's health care and public transportation.With improved access to education, a greater level of participation in municipal affairs by its Asian residents and substantial press freedom, George Town was perceived as being more intellectually receptive than Singapore. The city became a magnet for well known English authors, Asian intellectuals and revolutionaries, including Rudyard Kipling, Somerset Maugham and Sun Yat-sen.\n\n\n=== World Wars ===\n At the start of World War I in 1914, the Battle of Penang occurred, during which SMS Emden, an Imperial German Navy cruiser, sank two Allied warships off the coast of George Town. 147 French and Russian sailors were killed.World War II, on the other hand, brought unparalleled social and political upheaval to Penang. In early December 1941, Japanese warplanes indiscriminately strafed and bombed George Town, and wiped out the defending Allied air squadrons. While the British Army had earlier designated Penang Island as a fortress, Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival then ordered a withdrawal from Penang. Not only did the British abandon the Batu Maung Fort south of the city, they also covertly evacuated Penang's European population, leaving the rest of the populace to their fates. Historians have since argued that the withdrawal and the silent evacuation of the white race led to the loss of the British sense of invincibility, and that the moral collapse of British rule in Southeast Asia came not in Singapore, but in Penang.George Town fell to the Imperial Japanese Army on 19 December 1941, marking the start of a brutal period of Japanese occupation. Penang Island was renamed Tojo-to, after the then Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo. This period was known for the Imperial Japanese Army's massacres of Penang's Chinese populace, known as Sook Ching to the locals. Women in George Town were also coerced to work as comfort women by the Japanese.George Town's harbour facilities were also put to use as a major U-boat base by Nazi Germany. Between 1942 and 1944, the Port of Penang was utilised by submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy, the Kriegsmarine and the Regia Marina.Between 1944 and 1945, Allied bombers based in India repeatedly bombed George Town, seeking to destroy the naval facilities and administrative centres. Several colonial buildings were destroyed or damaged, including the Government Offices, St. Xavier's Institution, Hutchings School (now Penang State Museum) and the Penang Secretariat Building. The Penang Strait was also mined to impede Japanese shipping.Following the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945, the Penang Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper, published the proclamation of surrender issued by the Emperor of Japan. Under Operation Jurist, the British Royal Marines accepted the surrender of the Japanese garrison in Penang and retook Penang Island on 3 September 1945.\n\n\n=== Post-war ===\n\nAfter a period of military administration, the British dissolved the Straits Settlements in 1946 and proceeded to merge the Crown Colony of Penang into the Malayan Union, which was then replaced with the Federation of Malaya in 1948. However, the absorption of the British colony of Penang into Malaya alarmed Penang's population over economic and ethnic concerns. Between 1948 and 1951, the Penang Secessionist Committee was formed to avert Penang's merger with Malaya, but ultimately petered out due to British disapproval.The British government responded to the concerns raised by the secessionists by guaranteeing George Town's free port status, as well as reintroducing municipal elections in George Town in 1951. By 1956, George Town had become the first municipality in the Malayan Federation to have a fully elected local council.On 1 January 1957, George Town was accorded city status by Queen Elizabeth II, becoming the first city within the Federation of Malaya, and by extension, Malaysia.\n\n\n=== Post-independence ===\nIn the following years, George Town retained its free port status, as guaranteed by the British colonial authorities before granting independence to Malaya. This was not to last, however \u2013 in 1969, the Malaysian federal government revoked George Town's free port status, sparking massive unemployment in the city.This also marked the start of George Town's decline, which lasted up to the early 2000s. As the Malaysian federal government continued to develop Kuala Lumpur and nearby Port Klang, Penang began to suffer considerable brain drain.In a bid to revitalise George Town, the Komtar project was launched in 1974. Hundreds of shophouses, schools and temples, as well as whole streets, were demolished in order to make way for the construction of Penang's tallest skyscraper. However, instead of arresting George Town's decline, Komtar itself became a white elephant by the 2000s.In 1974, the George Town City Council was merged with the Penang Island Rural District Council to form the Penang Island Municipal Council, sparking a decades-long debate over George Town's city status.\n\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nThe city's decline continued into the early 2000s. In 2001, the Rent Control Act, which had protected the low-income residents and smaller businesses within the city centre from arbitrary rental hikes, was repealed. Consequently, residents moved out of the city's historical core, leaving its colonial-era buildings in disrepair. Meanwhile, an incoherent urban planning policy and poor traffic management led to worsening traffic congestion, while decades of brain drain also took its toll as the city lacked the expertise to regulate urban development.In response, George Town's non-governmental organisations and the national press galvanised public support and formed strategic partnerships for the conservation of the historic buildings, and to restore the city to its former glory. As a result of the widespread resentment over George Town's decline, the then federal opposition coalition, Pakatan Rakyat (now Pakatan Harapan), was voted into power within Penang in the 2008 State Election.Also in 2008, George Town was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Subsequent efforts to clean up the city, and measures to improve traffic flow, cultural and environmental aspects by the new state government led to George Town being ranked Asia's 8th most liveable city by ECA International in 2010. The city's services sector has since been boosted by the private sector and an influx of foreign investors.The Indian Ocean tsunami which struck in 2004 hit the western and northern coasts of Penang Island, including George Town, claiming 52 lives (out of 68 in Malaysia).Whilst George Town had been declared a city by Queen Elizabeth II in 1957, the jurisdiction of the city was expanded by the Malaysian federal government to encompass the entirety of Penang Island in 2015.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe jurisdiction of George Town covers an area of 305.77 km2 (118.06 sq mi), encompassing the entirety of Penang Island and five of the surrounding islets, including Jerejak Island. George Town is only slightly more than a third the size of Singapore with a population density of 2,372/km2 (6,140/sq mi); thus the city has one of the highest population densities of all Malaysian cities.The contiguous hotel and resort belts of Batu Ferringhi and Tanjung Bungah and Tanjung Tokong along the northern beaches of Penang Island form the northwestern fringes of George Town. The central hills of Penang Island, including Penang Hill, serve as a giant green lung for George Town and an important forested catchment area. While the central hills have somewhat limited the westward urban sprawl, George Town's expansion is more evident southward along the eastern seaboard of Penang Island, creating the suburbs of Jelutong and Gelugor, the latter merging with the northward development of Bayan Lepas.As with most island cities, land scarcity is a pressing issue in George Town. Land reclamation projects have been carried out to provide more low-lying land at high-demand areas, such as at Gurney Drive, Tanjung Tokong and Jelutong.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n==== UNESCO World Heritage Site ====\nThe oldest portion of the city centre has been designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site since 2008. Recognised as having a \"unique architectural and cultural townscape without parallel anywhere in East and Southeast Asia\", George Town contains one of the largest collections of pre-war buildings in Southeast Asia.The World Heritage Site covers nearly 260 ha (2.6 km2) of the city centre, roughly bounded by Transfer Road to the west and Prangin Road to the south. The zone includes the city's administrative precinct, which is home to the most historic landmarks like Fort Cornwallis, City Hall and the Penang State Museum, as well as the main Central Business District along Beach Street. The zone also covers various places of worship, such as St. George's Church, the Kapitan Keling Mosque and the Goddess of Mercy Temple, as well as the Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion and the Eastern & Oriental Hotel.Among the restrictions in force within the zone is a ban on the construction of any structure exceeding 18 m (59 ft) in height, and that any new building which is located adjacent to a historically important structure must not exceed the height of the latter.\n\n\n==== Street names ====\nUnlike other cities in Malaysia, George Town still retains most of its English street names. Even for roads that have been renamed in Malay, such as Jalan Masjid Negeri, Penangites in general still prefer to use the road's former colonial name, which in this particular case is Green Lane. This is partly because the new names are often unwieldy (e.g. Pitt Street vs Jalan Masjid Kapitan Keling, Northam Road vs Jalan Sultan Ahmad Shah), but also reflects a strong conservatism in the local population, who see Penang's colonial history as part of their local identity.Since 2008, multi-lingual road signs have been in use throughout Penang Island. Each of the new road signs shows the street's official Malay name and either the street's English, Chinese, Tamil or Arabic name.\n\n\n==== Suburbs ====\nThe expansion of George Town has created suburbs to its northwest, west and south. The northwestern suburbs are somewhat more affluent, given their seafront locations which attract tourists and expatriates. The southern suburbs, such as Jelutong, grew due to industrial activities. On the other hand, Air Itam and Paya Terubong emerged to the west of George Town as a result of agricultural plantations on the central hills of Penang Island.Since the 1970s, massive industrialisation around Bayan Lepas, which created the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone, led to the rapid urbanisation of the southeastern corner of Penang Island as well. The western half of the island, where Balik Pulau forms the main population centre, remains sparsely-populated, although urbanisation has encroached into the area in recent years.\n\n\n==== Beaches and seafronts ====\n\nThe most popular beaches of George Town are situated along the city's northwestern suburbs, specifically Batu Ferringhi, Tanjung Bungah and Tanjung Tokong. Several hotels and resorts have been established along these locations, including Hard Rock Hotel. Aside from these, George Town is home to popular promenades such as Gurney Drive, the Esplanade and Karpal Singh Drive. In particular, Gurney Drive forms part of the city's second Central Business District, and is a shopping haven with two upmarket shopping malls \u2013 Gurney Plaza and Gurney Paragon. Land reclamation is currently ongoing off Gurney Drive in a state-led effort to create a seafront public park, named Gurney Wharf.\n\n\n==== Hills ====\nThe central hills of Penang Island, situated to the west of George Town, serve as a gigantic green lung and water catchment area for the urbanised island. Rising 833 m (2,733 ft) above sea level, the peak of Penang Hill is accessible via the Penang Hill Railway from its base station off Hill Railway Road. Once a retreat used by British officials and Queen Elizabeth II, Penang Hill is one of Penang's most well-known tourist attractions.\n\n\n==== Parks ====\n\nFounded in 1884 as an offshoot of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the Penang Botanic Gardens is Malaysia's oldest botanical garden. Today, it serves as a major recreational area, receiving about 5,000 visitors every weekend. This botanical garden also encompasses Penang's biggest waterfall, which forms part of George Town's water supply. Meanwhile, the nearby 172-acre (70 ha) City Park was officially opened in 1972.The city is also home to the world's smallest national park \u2013 the Penang National Park. Covering 2,562 ha (25.62 km2) of the northwestern tip of Penang Island, it contains mangrove swamps, rainforest interspersed with hiking trails and tranquil beaches. Other notable natural attractions nearby include the Tropical Spice Garden and the Entopia Butterfly Farm, the latter of which was Malaysia's first butterfly sanctuary.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe city features a tropical rainforest climate, under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification (Af). George Town experiences relatively consistent temperatures throughout the course of the year, with an average high of about 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) and an average low of 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F). The city sees on average about 2,477 millimetres (97.5 in) of precipitation annually.George Town's proximity to the island of Sumatra makes it susceptible to dust particles carried by wind from the perennial but transient forest fires, creating a yearly phenomenon known as the Southeast Asian haze.Weather forecast in George Town is served by the Penang Meteorological Office in Bayan Lepas, which acts as the primary weather forecast facility for northern Peninsular Malaysia.\n\n\n== Governance and politics ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\nLocal administration of George Town and all of Penang Island is carried out by the Penang Island City Council, which comes under the purview of the Penang state government. With a history dating back to 1800, it is Malaysia's oldest local government and the successor to the nation's first city council \u2013 the George Town City Council.Headquartered in the City Hall, the city council is responsible for urban planning, heritage preservation, public health, sanitation, waste management, traffic management, environmental protection, building control, social and economic development, and general maintenance of urban infrastructure. In 2018, George Town was recognised as one of the cleanest cities in ASEAN, following a 2017 ranking which placed George Town as Malaysia's second cleanest city.The Mayor of Penang Island is appointed by the Penang state government every two years, while each of the 24 councillors is appointed for a one-year term. The current Mayor is Yew Tung Seang, who took office in 2018. Penang-based non-governmental organisations are also allocated four of the 24 councillor positions.\n\n\n=== State government ===\n\nAs the capital of the State of Penang, George Town is the seat of the Penang state government. The Office of the Chief Minister of Penang is housed within the Komtar Tower, Penang's tallest skyscraper. The unicameral Penang State Legislative Assembly convenes inside the State Assembly Building at Light Street. The Governor of Penang, the head of state, also has his official residence within the city.In the State Legislative Assembly, George Town is represented by 19 state constituencies, namely Padang Kota, Pengkalan Kota, Komtar, Kebun Bunga, Pulau Tikus, Tanjong Bunga, Air Putih, Air Itam, Paya Terubong, Seri Delima, Datok Keramat, Sungai Pinang, Batu Lancang, Batu Uban, Pantai Jerejak, Batu Maung, Bayan Lepas, Pulau Betong and Telok Bahang. The members of the State Legislative Assembly, known as State Assemblymen, are elected into office via the Penang State Election, which by convention is held simultaneously with the Malaysian General Election every five years.The city is also represented by six Members of Parliament in the Malaysian Parliament, who are elected via the Malaysian General Election. The parliamentary constituencies are Tanjong, Bukit Bendera, Jelutong, Bukit Gelugor, Bayan Baru and Balik Pulau.\n\n\n=== Judiciary ===\n\nThe Malaysian legal system had its roots in George Town. By 1807, Penang was accorded a Royal Charter which provided for the establishment of a Supreme Court and the appointment of the first Supreme Court judge, designated as the Recorder.The Supreme Court of Penang (now High Court of Penang) was first opened at Fort Cornwallis on 31 May 1808. Edmond Stanley assumed office as the First Recorder of the Supreme Court of Penang in 1808, thus serving as Malaya's first Superior Court Judge. The Supreme Court was then relocated a short distance away to Light Street, where the present building was built in 1903.Today, the Malaysian judiciary has become largely centralised. The courts in George Town consist of the Magistrates, Sessions and the High Court, the latter of which sits at the top of Penang's judicial system. The High Court remains at Light Street to this day, along with the Magistrates and Sessions Court across the street. Another Sessions Court has also been established in Balik Pulau to the west.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the 2010 Census conducted by the Malaysian federal government, George Town had a population of 708,127. More recent estimates from Malaysia's Department of Statistics indicated that about 738,500 inhabitants lived within this cosmopolitan city as of 2012. These figures placed George Town as Malaysia's second largest city by population.In addition, Greater Penang, which also covers Seberang Perai, and parts of neighbouring Kedah and Perak, was home to 2,412,616 residents as of 2010. Thus, Greater Penang is the most populous metropolitan area in Malaysia outside the Klang Valley (Greater Kuala Lumpur).\n\n\n=== Ethnicities ===\nAccording to Malaysia's Department of Statistics, George Town is a Chinese-majority city; as of 2010, over 53% of the urban population consisted of ethnic Chinese, including the Peranakans. The Bumiputeras, which include ethnic Malays and East Malaysian indigenous races like the Dayaks and Kadazans, collectively made up almost 32% of the city's population. Ethnic Indians comprised another 9% of George Town's population. These are in addition to small, but prominent, Eurasian and Siamese minorities. In particular, most of the nearly 1,500 Eurasians remain concentrated at the Pulau Tikus suburb.The Peranakans, descendants of mixed Malay and Chinese ancestries, were once the political and business elites in George Town. They held the top positions in some of the city's most influential associations, such as the Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Penang Straits Chinese British Association. As the Peranakans tended to be more loyal to the British Crown than to China, they were also known as the King's Chinese. In spite of Malaysia's ethnic policies that have effectively forced the Peranakans to identify themselves as Chinese, Peranakan culture still thrives in George Town to this day, in the form of Straits Chinese architectural styles and dishes like asam laksa.George Town currently has a sizeable expatriate population, especially from Singapore, Japan and various Asian countries as well as the United Kingdom, many of whom chose to retire in Penang as part of Malaysia My Second Home programme. In recent years, George Town has been acknowledged as one of the best cities for retirement within Southeast Asia by the likes of CNN and Forbes. As of 2010, expatriates made up nearly 6% of George Town's population, reflecting the city's popularity amongst foreigners.\nThe city was also once home to Burmese, Filipino, Sinhalese, Japanese, Sumatran, Arab, Armenian and Persian communities. A small but commercially significant community of German merchants existed in George Town as well, as did a Jewish enclave. Even though most of these other communities, including the Jews, are no longer extant, they lent their legacy to numerous street and place names such as the Dhammikarama Temple, Burmah Road, Armenian Street, Jewish Cemetery and Gottlieb Road.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nAs with other multi-ethnic cities in Malaysia, all four major languages are widely spoken in George Town \u2013 Malay, English, Chinese and Tamil. However, George Town, and by extension Penang, is best known for its distinct Hokkien dialect, known as Penang Hokkien.During the British colonial era, English was the official language. This was helped by the mushrooming of missionary schools throughout George Town, all of which used English as their medium of instruction and were held in high esteem by the locals. Most Penangites still maintain reasonable command of the language; while British English is formally used, spoken English usually takes the form of Manglish.As in the rest of Malaysia, Malay is currently the official language in George Town. The city's Malays also use a variant of the Kedah Malay dialect, with slight modifications made to the original dialect to suit the conditions of a cosmopolitan city. These modifications include the use of words of Indian origin and the alteration of the final l syllable into i.Due to their Tamil ancestry, most Indians in George Town speak Tamil. Punjabi and Telugu are also spoken by smaller numbers of Indians. Meanwhile, George Town's Chinese population uses a variety of Chinese dialects, including Hakka and Cantonese. Mandarin, more widely used by youths, has been the medium of instruction in Chinese schools throughout Penang.However, Penang Hokkien serves as the lingua franca of George Town. Originally a variant of the Minnan dialect, over the centuries, Penang Hokkien has incorporated a large number of loanwords from Malay and English. It is spoken by many Penangites regardless of race for communication purposes. In recent years, there have been more efforts to maintain the dialect's relevance in the face of the increasing influence of Mandarin and English among the younger populace.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nAs the capital city of Penang, one of the most urbanised states in Malaysia, George Town is one of the top contributors of Malaysia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and tax income. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, the city contributed US$12,044, or nearly 8%, of Malaysia's personal disposable income in 2015, second only to Kuala Lumpur. In 2016, George Town was ranked Malaysia's most attractive destination for commercial property investment by Knight Frank, surpassing even Kuala Lumpur. By 2017, Penang's GDP per capita, already the highest among Malaysian states, rose to RM49,873, thereby surpassing the World Bank's threshold to be considered a high-income economy. George Town's popularity amongst foreign investors has contributed to Penang gaining the largest share of Malaysia's foreign direct investments within the same year.Originally established as an entrep\u00f4t by the British, George Town's economy is now dominated by other tertiary sub-sectors ranging from manufacturing to finance, whilst newer industries, including entrepreneurial startups, are taking root within the city as well. In addition, George Town serves as the economic pole of northern Malaysia, with relatively wide logistical connectivity. The Penang International Airport is one of the nation's busiest, whilst Swettenham Pier has cemented the city's reputation as a popular destination for cruise shipping.\n\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\n\nSince the 1970s, manufacturing formed the backbone of Penang's economy, generating 44.8% of the state's GDP as of 2017 and attracting about 3,000 firms to set up operations within the state. The Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone, dubbed the Silicon Valley of the East, is the main electronics manufacturing hub within Malaysia. Located at the southeastern corner of Penang Island, the zone is home to various high-tech multinational firms, including Dell, Intel, AMD, Motorola, Agilent, Renesas, Osram, Bosch, Sony and Seagate.\n\n\n=== Finance ===\n\nGeorge Town was the centre of banking in Malaysia at a time when Kuala Lumpur was still a small outpost. The oldest bank in Malaysia, Standard Chartered, opened its main branch in George Town in 1875 to cater to the financial requirements of early European traders. This was followed by HSBC in 1885 and the Royal Bank of Scotland in 1888.Today, George Town remains the banking hub of northern Malaysia, with branches of major international banks such as Standard Chartered, HSBC, Citibank, UOB, OCBC, Bank of China and Bank Negara Malaysia (Malaysian central bank). Most of the foreign banks still maintain their Penang headquarters at Beach Street, which serves as the city's main Central Business District.Since the 1990s, Northam Road, along with Gurney Drive, has evolved into George Town's second Central Business District. Northam Road is now home to a cluster of financial services, with a number of accounting, auditing and insurance firms based along this coastal road. In addition to these, the Employees Provident Fund, run by the Malaysian federal government, operates an office at the road as well.The financial sector and its related industries, such as insurance, auditing and real estate transactions, accounted for over 8% of Penang's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as of 2017.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nGeorge Town has always been one of the most popular tourist destinations in Malaysia. Throughout history, the city has even welcomed some of the most influential personalities, including Somerset Maugham, Rudyard Kipling, No\u00ebl Coward, Lee Kuan Yew and Queen Elizabeth II.In recent years, George Town has received numerous international accolades, further putting the city on the world stage. The city has been listed by various publications, including the Lonely Planet, Forbes and Time, as one of the top travel destinations in Asia. These are in addition to George Town's reputation as a gastronomic haven, with the CNN placing the city as one of Asia's best street food cities.Unlike most other Malaysian cities, George Town does not rely only on air transportation for tourist arrivals. Aside from the Penang International Airport, Swettenham Pier, conveniently located within the city centre, also serves as one of the major tourist entry points into Penang. As of 2017, Penang attracted almost 8.6 million tourists, with the airport posting a record 7.2 million passenger arrivals and the pier registering another 1.35 million tourist arrivals. Within the same year, Penang became the third largest contributor of Malaysia's tourism tax revenue after Kuala Lumpur and Sabah.The state government launched its ten-year Penang Tourism Master Plan in February 2019 with the goal of ensuring sustainable development and making Penang a hub for tourism, heritage, culture and arts in the region. George Town World Heritage Incorporated \u2013 the state government's independent heritage agency responsible for managing the George Town World Heritage Site \u2013 has produced a Sustainable Tourism Strategy action plan.\n\n\n=== Services ===\n\nWith nearly \u200b3\u20445 of Penang's workforce employed in services-related fields, the services sector has marginally overtaken manufacturing as Penang's biggest economic sector, contributing 49.3% of Penang's total GDP in 2017. The largest share of employment was recorded in the retail, accommodation, and food and beverages (F&B) sub-sectors, clearly depicting the influence of tourist arrivals on service-related industries. Since the inscription of George Town as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, an emerging trend is the acquisition of heritage shophouses within the zone by foreign investors, especially from Singapore and Hong Kong.In addition, a startup community has been growing in the city, which include the likes of Piktochart and DeliverEat. Attracted by the city's cheaper living costs and the presence of several multinational technology firms in Penang, the city's startups are also being actively encouraged by the Penang state government and the private sector, with initiatives to encourage entrepreneurship and promote the Internet of Things (IoT).This services sector has also been boosted by firms seeking to establish shared services outsourcing (SSO) operations within or around George Town, including AirAsia, Citigroup, Dell, Jabil and Temasek Holdings. Consequently, Penang has emerged as the second most important Global Business Services (GBS) hub within Malaysia, after Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\n==== Medical tourism ====\nAn integral part of Penang's services sector is medical tourism, which has made George Town the medical tourism hub of Malaysia. The city has attracted approximately half of Malaysia's medical tourist arrivals in 2013 and generated about 70% of the nation's medical tourism revenue. About 1,000 patients arrive in George Town daily, mostly from Asian countries such as Indonesia, Singapore and Japan.The success of George Town's medical tourism industry is mainly due to the specialised medical treatments offered at more affordable costs by the city's numerous private hospitals, coupled with well-trained professionals and advanced equipment. Indirect factors that were cited include the relatively low cost of living and the ease of travel facilitated by the well-developed logistical infrastructure.\n\n\n==== Retail ====\nAs many as 24% of Penang's workforce are employed in the retail sub-sector, the largest of all economic sub-sectors in Penang. Due to the numerous shopping malls and hypermarkets in George Town, the city is the main shopping hub of northern Malaysia. Since 2001, shopping complexes in George Town registered the biggest increases in Malaysia. Among the more well-known shopping malls within the city are Gurney Plaza, Gurney Paragon, 1st Avenue and Queensbay Mall.While shopping malls now dominate the retail scene in George Town, many centuries-old shophouses are still operating alongside the city's flea markets and wet markets, such as Chowrasta Market. These traditional retail establishments cater more to locally made products, including spices, nutmegs and tau sar pneah, a famous Penang delicacy.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nCenturies of development have brought a mix of architectural styles to George Town, both historical and modern. The oldest portion of the city centre is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, while outside the UNESCO zone lies the modern cityscape, with skyscrapers, residential high-rises, office blocks and shopping malls built all over the city.\n\n\n=== Historic architecture ===\n\nMost of George Town's famous heritage landmarks, including Fort Cornwallis, the City Hall, the High Court, St. George's Church and the Eastern & Oriental Hotel are located within the UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city's main Central Business District at Beach Street, also within the UNESCO zone, is home to banks built in various Art Deco-based hybrid styles. Colonial-era bungalows, such as The Residency and Suffolk House, can be found throughout the city as well.Aside from colonial European architecture, a huge assortment of Asian architectural styles also exist throughout the city. Buildings like the Kapitan Keling Mosque, Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion and the Pinang Peranakan Mansion are notable for their architectural styles, which combine diverse cultural influences. Peranakan townhouses, exemplified by the Sun Yat-sen Museum, dominate the cityscape as well. Meanwhile, Indian architecture is more prominent within the city's Little India, which also contains the Sri Mahamariamman Temple.In the suburbs, the Siamese and Burmese communities have left their mark too; the Buddhist temples at Pulau Tikus include Wat Chaiyamangkalaram and the Dhammikarama Temple. Another example of a hybrid Asian architecture is the Kek Lok Si Temple at Air Itam, which merges Chinese, Siamese and Burmese influences.\n\n\n=== Modern architecture ===\nSince the mid 20th century, modern urbanisation has transformed much of George Town. Just south of the UNESCO World Heritage Site stands the Komtar Tower, the tallest skyscraper in Penang at nearly 250 m (820 ft) tall. The second Central Business District at Northam Road and Gurney Drive, which lies along the city's northern shoreline, is also home to some of Penang's tallest skyscrapers, including Setia V, Gurney Paragon and BHL Tower.With increasing urbanisation, high-rises are also springing up within the suburbs of George Town.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Food ===\n\nGeorge Town, long known as the food capital of Malaysia, is renowned for its good and varied street food, incorporating Malay, Chinese, Indian, Peranakan, Thai and European influences into its literal melting pot.The city has been recognised as one of Asia's top street food cities by CNN, as well the world's top culinary destination by the Lonely Planet in 2014. These were in addition to the Time magazine in 2004, which acclaimed Penang as having the best street food in Asia.The best places to savour street cuisine include Gurney Drive, Pulau Tikus, Chulia Street, Kimberley Street, New Lane, New World Park, Penang Road and Air Itam. The more prominent local dishes include asam laksa, char kway teow, curry mee, Hokkien mee, nasi kandar, oh chien (fried oyster omelette), rojak and chendol. Besides these, several tau sar pneah shops can be found throughout the city, selling bean paste biscuits.\n\n\n=== Performance arts ===\n\nGeorge Town is the birthplace of a unique form of Chingay procession, which began with its first parade in 1919. Penang's variant of Chingay includes the act of balancing gigantic flags on one's forehead or hands. An annual Chingay parade is held in the city every December, though Chingay performances are also a common feature of Chinese festivities and major state celebrations in Penang.Bangsawan is a form of Malay theatre which was developed in Penang with Indian, Western, Islamic, Chinese and Indonesian influences. It went into decline in the latter decades of the 20th century and is now a dying art form. Boria is another traditional dance drama indigenous to Penang, featuring singing accompanied by violin, maracas and tabla.Aside from these, there are two Western orchestras based in George Town \u2013 the Penang Philharmonic and the Penang Symphony Orchestra (PSO) \u2013 as well as several chamber and school-based musical ensembles. Dewan Sri Pinang and Penangpac within Straits Quay are two of the major performing venues in the city.\n\n\n=== Street art ===\nIn 2012, as part of the annual George Town Festival, Lithuanian artist Ernest Zacharevic created a series of wall murals depicting local culture, inhabitants and lifestyles. They now stand as celebrated cultural landmarks of George Town, with Children on a Bicycle becoming one of the most photographed spots in the city.Since then, the street art scene has blossomed. Arts exhibitions are held at the city's numerous cultural centres, such as the Hin Bus Depot. Aside from wall art, several wrought iron caricatures, each depicting a unique aspect of George Town's history and culture, have been installed throughout the city centre.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nThe Penang State Museum and Art Gallery houses relics, photographs, maps, and other artifacts that document the history and culture of Penang. Other museums within the city focus on religious and cultural aspects, as well as famous personalities, including the Penang Islamic Museum, Sun Yat-sen Museum, P. Ramlee's House, Batik Painting Museum, and Universiti Sains Malaysia Museum and Gallery.In recent years, private-run museums have sprung up all over the city, such as the Camera Museum and the Penang Toy Museum. A handful of newer visual museums have also been launched, such as the Made-in-Penang Interactive Museum and the Penang Time Tunnel.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\nGeorge Town's cultural melting pot of various races and religions means that there are a great many celebrations and festivities in any given year. The major cultural and religious festivities in George Town include, but not limited to, the Chinese New Year, Chap Goh Meh, Songkran, Wesak Day, Seventh Month Festival, Nine Emperor Gods Festival, Eid ul-Fitri, Deepavali, Thaipusam, Vaisakhi and Christmas.The city's expatriates have introduced a host of other celebrations as well. Bon Odori is celebrated yearly at the Esplanade by the Japanese, while St. Patrick's Day and Oktoberfest, traditionally celebrated by the Irish and the Germans respectively, have also been gaining popularity amongst the locals.In addition, the city hosts several major festivals in any given year. The George Town Festival, first held in 2010, has evolved into one of the top arts events in Southeast Asia, while the Penang Hot Air Balloon Fiesta attracts close to 200,000 visitors from all over the world.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nGeorge Town has a relatively well-developed sporting infrastructure. The City Stadium is Penang Island's main football stadium, with a capacity of about 25,000. It is the home ground of Penang FA, and was where Penang footballer Mohd Faiz Subri scored the goal that won him the 2016 FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award. The SPICE Arena at Bayan Baru consists of an indoor stadium, an aquatics centre and a convention centre, while the Nicol David International Squash Centre at Gelugor is a major squash training facility. In addition, the Penang Turf Club, established in 1864, is Malaysia's oldest horse racing and equestrian centre.[232]The Penang Bridge International Marathon is a popular annual event. The full marathon route starts from near Queensbay Mall, then on to the 13.5 km (8.4 mi) length of the Penang Bridge, and finally back to the starting point for the finish.The national and international sporting events that were held in George Town include the 2001 Southeast Asian Games and the 2013 Women's World Open Squash Championship. In addition, George Town will host the Asia Pacific Masters Games in 2018, the first Malaysian city to be selected to host this regional multi-sports tournament.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nGeorge Town is home to some of the oldest schools in Malaysia, making it a pioneer in the country's education system. Under British rule, missionary schools were set up across George Town. They were followed by Chinese schools, some of which are also among the oldest in the nation, thus making George Town the nucleus of Chinese education in Southeast Asia. More recently, international schools have also been established to cater to the growing expatriate population.\nIn addition, George Town contains a number of private tertiary educational institutions, as well as one of the premier Malaysian public universities \u2013 Universiti Sains Malaysia. Aside from these, the city has a handful of language institutions, such as the British Council, Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and the Malaysian German Society.\n\n\n=== Schools ===\n\nThere are a total of 117 primary schools, 49 high schools, four Islamic religious schools, two vocational colleges and a technical school throughout George Town. The breakdown of these schools is as follows.\nSome of the oldest missionary schools in George Town include the Penang Free School, St. Xavier's Institution, Convent Light Street, St. George's Girls' School and Methodist Boys' School. Meanwhile, the Chung Hwa Confucian School, founded in 1904, was the first Chinese school in Southeast Asia.Aside from government-run and private schools, the city has 11 international schools. Of these, Dalat, Uplands, Tenby, Fairview, Pelita, Hua Xia and Wesley Methodist offer both primary and secondary education. The Penang Japanese School is the only international school in George Town that caters for expatriates of a specific nationality.\n\n\n=== Tertiary education ===\n Universiti Sains Malaysia, situated at Gelugor, is one of the premier Malaysian public universities. Established in 1969 as Malaysia's second university, it was originally named Universiti Pulau Pinang (University of Penang). As of 2018, it was ranked 207th in the QS World University Rankings, the fourth highest in Malaysia.Several private universities and colleges have also been set up across George Town, including Wawasan Open University, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and University College Dublin Malaysia Campus, Han Chiang University College of Communication, DISTED College, SEGi College, Sentral College, Lam Wah Ee Nursing College, Adventist College of Nursing and Health Sciences, Equator Academy of Arts and KDU University College.\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\nGeorge Town contains a total of 30 libraries. Among the libraries in the city are the Penang State Library at Scotland Road and the Penang Digital Library at Green Lane. The latter, which was opened by the Penang state government in 2016, is Malaysia's first digital library and houses a digitalised collection of over 3,000 publications.\n\n\n== Health care ==\n\nThe numerous public and private hospitals in George Town has helped the city to emerge as the centre of medical tourism in Malaysia. The Penang General Hospital, administered and funded by the Ministry of Health, is the main public hospital in George Town and serves as the tertiary referral hospital within northern Malaysia. It is complemented by the Balik Pulau Hospital, which is also managed by the country's Ministry of Health.There are also 54 government-run clinics throughout George Town, supported by 11 private hospitals and 352 private clinics. The private hospitals within George Town include Penang Adventist Hospital, Island Hospital, Gleneagles Medical Centre, Loh Guan Lye Specialists Centre, Lam Wah Ee Hospital, Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital and Pantai Hospital.\nGeorge Town became the first Malaysian city to install public automated external defibrillators (AEDs), with the launch of the first device in Komtar in 2015. Since then, AEDs have been installed at several public locations throughout the city.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Print ===\nGeorge Town was once the centre of Malaysia's print media. The country's first newspaper \u2013 the Prince of Wales Island Gazette \u2013 was established in the city in 1806. One of Malaysia's top dailies currently in circulation, The Star, was founded in George Town in the 1970s, while the country's oldest Chinese newspaper, Kwong Wah Yit Poh, was also founded in the city in 1910.In 2011, the then Chief Minister of Penang, Lim Guan Eng, officiated the launch of the Penang edition of Time Out. This version of the international listings magazine is currently published in three versions \u2013 an annual guide, a website and a mobile app.The Penang state government also publishes its own multi-lingual newspaper, Buletin Mutiara, which is circulated for free every fortnight. The Penang-centric newspaper focuses on the current issues affecting Penang.\n\n\n=== Television ===\nDue to its well-preserved heritage cityscape, George Town served as the filming location for a number of movies, such as Anna and the King, Lust, Caution and You Mean the World to Me, the latter of which is the first movie to be filmed entirely in Penang Hokkien. Singaporean drama series, The Little Nyonya and The Journey: Our Homeland, were also shot within the UNESCO zone. In addition, the city was one of the pit-stops of The Amazing Race 16, The Amazing Race Asia 4 and The Amazing Race Asia 5.\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nThe available FM radio stations in George Town, both government (including Penang-based Mutiara FM) and commercial, are as listed below.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Land ===\nDevelopment of George Town's streets and roads is an ongoing process that dates back to the early years of British rule. The city's oldest streets, including Light Street, Beach Street, Chulia Street and Pitt Street, were arranged in a grid pattern.The Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway runs along the eastern coastline of Penang Island between the city centre and the Penang International Airport, linking both locations with the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone and the Penang Bridge. The George Town Inner Ring Road and the Penang Middle Ring Road are the two major ring roads around the city centre. The city centre is also linked with the western parts of Penang Island, such as Balik Pulau, via the pan-island Federal Route 6.\nBoth the 13.5 km (8.4 mi)-long Penang Bridge and the 24 km (15 mi)-long Second Penang Bridge link George Town with the rest of Peninsular Malaysia. The former bridge was completed in 1985, while the latter, opened in 2014, is currently the longest bridge in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n==== Public transportation ====\n\nGeorge Town was once a pioneer of public transportation in British Malaya. The city's first tram system, then powered by steam, commenced operations in the 1880s. While the tram lines have since been disused, another colonial legacy, the trishaw, remains in use throughout the city, albeit catering primarily for tourists.Today, buses form the backbone of public transportation within George Town. Rapid Penang, with over 30 routes on Penang Island, is the sole public bus service provider within George Town. In addition, open-topped double deckers, known as Hop-On Hop-Off buses, have been introduced for tourists in the city. Meanwhile, the Penang Hill Railway is a funicular railway to the peak of Penang Hill.\nEfforts are also being undertaken to promote pedestrianisation and the use of bicycles as a greener transportation mode. Dedicated cycling lanes have been marked throughout the city and in 2016, George Town became the first Malaysian city to operate a public bicycle-sharing service, with the launch of LinkBike.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nThe Penang International Airport, 16 km (9.9 mi) south of the city centre, was opened in 1935. It serves as the main airport for northern Malaysia, with frequent links to major Asian cities such as Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Bangkok, Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, Taipei, Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Doha. It is also a hub for two Malaysian low-cost carriers \u2013 AirAsia and Firefly. The airport is Malaysia's second busiest in terms of cargo traffic and recorded the third highest passenger traffic of all Malaysian airports as of 2013.\n\n\n=== Sea ===\n\nThe Port of Penang consists of seven facilities along the Penang Strait, including Swettenham Pier in George Town. Renovated in 2009 as a cruise shipping terminal, Swettenham Pier is one of the major tourist entry points into George Town. As of 2017, the pier recorded 1.35 million tourist arrivals, thereby surpassing Port Klang as the busiest port-of-call in Malaysia for cruise shipping. The pier has also attracted some of the world's largest cruise liners, such as the RMS Queen Mary 2.A number of cruise ships call Swettenham Pier as their homeport, bringing tourists into and out of George Town towards regional destinations like Phuket and Singapore. Occasionally, the pier hosts warships as well, including those from Singapore, Thailand and the United States.\n\n\n==== Ferry ====\n\nRapid Ferry is a cross-strait shuttle ferry service that connects George Town with the town of Butterworth on the Malay Peninsula. It is the oldest ferry service in Malaysia, dating back to 1894 when the first passenger ferry commenced operations. Currently, six ferries ply the Penang Strait between George Town and Butterworth daily.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Consulates ===\nSeveral nations have either established their consulates or appointed honorary-consulates within George Town.\n\n\n=== Sister cities ===\nGeorge Town has eight sister cities.\n\nThe State of Penang also has a sister area partnership with Kanagawa Prefecture in Japan, which was ratified in 1991.\n\n\n==== Sister subdivision ====\n Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan\n\n\n=== Friendship cities ===\nIn addition to the sister cities and areas, George Town has inked five other friendship city agreements.\n\n Sanya, China\n Zhongshan, China\n Busan, South Korea\n Changwon, South Korea\n Kaohsiung, TaiwanIn 2013, the State of Penang signed a friendship state agreement with Hainan Province in China.Friendship subdivision\n\n Hainan Province, China\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nInternational rankings of George Town\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nSuet Leng Khoo; Narimah Samat; Nurwati Badarulzaman; Sharifah Rohayah Sheikh Dawood The Promise and Perils of the Island City of George Town (Penang) as a Creative City.

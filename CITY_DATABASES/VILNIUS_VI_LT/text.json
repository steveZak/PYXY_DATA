        "wiki": "The Cathedral Basilica of St Stanislaus and St Ladislaus of Vilnius (Lithuanian: Vilniaus \u0160v. Stanislovo ir \u0160v. Vladislovo arkikatedra bazilika, Polish: Bazylika archikatedralna \u015bw. Stanis\u0142awa Biskupa i \u015bw. W\u0142adys\u0142awa) is the main Roman Catholic Cathedral of Lithuania. It is situated in  Vilnius Old Town, just off Cathedral Square. Dedicated to Saints Stanislaus and Ladislaus, the church is the heart of Catholic spiritual life in Lithuania.\nThe coronations of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania took place within its confines. Inside its crypts and catacombs are buried many famous people from Lithuanian and Polish history including Vytautas (1430), his wife Anna (1418), his brother Sigismund (\u017dygimantas) (1440), his cousin \u0160vitrigaila (1452), Saint Casimir (1484), Alexander Jagiellon (1506), and two wives of Sigismund II Augustus: Elisabeth of Habsburg (1545) and Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142 (1551). The heart of the Polish king W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa was buried there upon his death, although the rest of his body is buried at the Wawel Cathedral in Krak\u00f3w.\nInside, there are more than forty works of art dating from the 16th through 19th centuries, including frescoes and paintings of various sizes. During the restoration of the cathedral, the altars of a presumed pagan temple and the original floor, laid during the reign of King Mindaugas, were uncovered. In addition, the remains of the cathedral built in 1387 were also located. A fresco dating from the end of the 14th century, the oldest known fresco in Lithuania, was found on the wall of one of the cathedral's underground chapels.\nDuring the Soviet regime initially the cathedral was converted into a warehouse. Masses were celebrated again starting in 1988, although the cathedral was still officially called \"The Gallery of Images\" at that time. In 1989, its status as a cathedral was restored.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIt is believed that in pre-Christian times, the Baltic pagan god Perk\u016bnas was worshipped at the site of the cathedral. It has also been postulated that the Lithuanian King Mindaugas ordered the construction of the original cathedral in 1251 after his conversion to Christianity and appointment of a bishop to Lithuania. Remains of the archaic quadratic church with three naves and massive buttresses have been discovered underneath the current structure in the late 20th century.  After Mindaugas's death in 1263, the first cathedral again became a place of pagan worship.\nIn 1387, the year in which Lithuania was officially converted to Christianity, construction began on a second Gothic Cathedral with five chapels.  This second cathedral, however, burnt down in 1419.  During preparations for his 1429 coronation as King of Lithuania, Vytautas built a significantly larger Gothic Cathedral in its place. Although the coronation never took place, the walls and pillars of this third Cathedral have survived to this day.  The third Cathedral had three naves and four circular towers at its corners, and Flemish traveler Guillebert de Lannoy noticed its similarity to Frauenburg Cathedral.  In 1522, the cathedral was renovated, and a bell tower was built on top of the Lower Castle defensive tower. After another fire in 1530, it was rebuilt again and between 1534 - 1557 more chapels and the crypts were added. The cathedral acquired architectural features associated with the Renaissance.\nIn 1529, the Crown Prince and future King of Poland, Sigismund II Augustus, was crowned Grand Duke of Lithuania in the cathedral.  After yet another fire in 1610, the cathedral was rebuilt again, and the two front towers were added. The cathedral was damaged again in 1655 when Vilnius fell to Russian troops in the Russo-Polish War of 1654\u20131667. It was renovated and redecorated several more times.\nBetween 1623 - 1636, at the initiative of Sigismund III Vasa and later completed by his son Wladyslaw IV Vasa, the Baroque style Saint Casimir chapel by royal architect Constantino Tencalla was built of Swedish sandstone. Its interior was reconstructed in 1691-1692 and decorated with frescoes by Michelangelo Palloni, the altar and stuccowork by Pietro Perti. This chapel contains sculpted statutes of Jagiellon kings and an epitaph with Wladyslaw IV Vasa's heart. More than anything in the Cathedral this chapel symbolizes the glory of Polish-Lithuanian union and common history.\nIn 1769 the southern tower, built during the reconstruction of 1666 collapsed, destroying the vaults of the neighbouring chapel and killing 6 people. After the damage, Bishop of Vilnius Ignacy Jakub Massalski ordered the reconstruction  of the cathedral. The works started in 1779 and were completed in 1783, and the interior was completed in 1801. The cathedral was reconstructed to its present appearance according to the design of Laurynas Gucevi\u010dius in the Neoclassical style; the church acquired a strict quadrangular shape common to local public buildings. The main facade was adorned with sculptures of the Four Evangelists by Italian sculptor Tommaso Righi. Some scholars point to the architectural resemblance of the cathedral to the works of Andrea Palladio or see the influence of Gucevi\u010dius's tutor Claude Nicolas Ledoux. The influence of Palladian architecture is evident in side facades of the building. The lack of 'purity' of the Classical architecture, due to incorporation of Baroque style sculptures and other elements, was later criticized by academical architects, notably Karol Podczaszy\u0144ski.\nBetween 1786 and 1792 three sculptures by Kazimierz Jelski were placed on roof of the Cathedral  - Saint Casimir on the south side, Saint Stanislaus on the north, and Saint Helena in the centre. These sculptures were removed in 1950 and restored in 1997.  Presumably the sculpture of St. Casimir originally symbolized Lithuania, that of St. Stanislaus symbolized Poland, and that of St. Helena holding a 9 m-golden cross represents the true cross.\nIn 2002 work officially began to rebuild the Royal Palace of Lithuania behind the cathedral. The newly erected palace building will considerably alter the context of the cathedral.\nThe cathedral and the belfry were thoroughly renovated from 2006 to 2008. The facades were covered with fresh multicolor paintwork, greatly enhancing the external appearance of the buildings.  It was the first renovation since the restoration of Lithuania's independence in 1990.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

          "It\u2019s amazing; you have to visit as this is a landmark The outside architecture the grandness of the pillars really does have a presences. However The interior atmosphere is very somber and peaceful. Compared to other cathedrals the interior seems basic. It is busy being",
          "The cathedral dominates the square it is in and is architecturally superb inside and out.The cathedral is all in white,just like the bell tower and is very much worth a visit. Entry is free to the cathedral.A crypt tour is available,which I purchased with my girlfriend,which was",
          "The Cathedral with the Tower are an amazing place. They resemble the Pisa cathedral and its Tower. Both of them worth the visit and shouldn't be skipped.",
          "Vilnius has a less \"coordinated\" OLD Town but it boasts more and better cathedrals. This is one of them which is on the fringe of the OLD Town.",
          "This cathedral is in heat of Vilnius. Cathedral is open all day for all visitors. You can\u2019t miss this cathedral when you become in Vilnius",
          "Fantastic Cathedral with impressive statues, paintings, imperial-like exterior and crypt chambers. Easily one of the standout experiences of our time in Vilnius.",
          "An impressive architecture, great for taking pictures thanks to the empty space around it. The interior is quite simple but there is a very beautiful chapel, the Chapel of Saint Casimir, that really must be visited.",
          "It\u2019s lovely to see how well preserved the cathedral is. It\u2019s wasn\u2019t crowded so we could look around freely and take photos without disturbance.",
          "This is the major landmark in old town Vilnius. There are 20+ churches in old town Vilnius, this is perhaps, by far the most famous and popular. It still hosts regular service on Sundays. There is a catacomb underneath, you will need to pay to enter during its opening hours.",
          "Not as pompose as cathedrals can be or as we are used to, but outside facades are great. Inside not as reach as in general, but I prefer it like that. But really crowded.",
          "Quite stunning from the outside but rather plain and functional inside. Definitely worth a visit and a climb up the bell tower is recommended",
          "Very Huge fill with people situated in the Square i like the visit there very nice hotel and statues",
          "There is no way you'll miss it, since it's the most visited attraction in Vilnius. The Cathedral itself is huge and very impressive. You can pay a couple of euros to enter and climb the bell tower, but I would recommend climbing the nearby Castle Hill or The Hill of Three",
          "Quite a pretty spot and worthy of a photo or two - different angles give you better vistas - if you\u2019re in the area it\u2019s worth a visit Don\u2019t forget the magic tile between the tower and the cathedral to spin three tones and make a wish !",
          "We enjoyed the spacious interior with its many details and art work. A quiet place to reflect, pray or simply appreciate the majesty of the cathedral.",
          "A very photogenic church at the heart of the Old Town. The interior is immaculate and well worth seeing and exploring. It is very pretty and important to the city. It was consecrated again after the Soviets had used it as an Art Gallery. There is a great deal of information",
          "A very nice cathedral in old town. The cathedral looks lovely from outside and is equally beautiful from inside. We only spent a few minutes there but the place is very nice. You can sit outside the cathedral, near tower on a nice sunny day.",
          "The main church in Vilnius situated in the central square, very close to Gediminas Tower and Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania.",
          "We visited this splendid and imposing white neo-classical Cathedral ( walked around also) and it's Bell tower leisurely. We learnt from the guide book that this wooden Cathedral was built in 1377-88 and rebuilt many times since then. This is most popular site for visitors and",
          "This is a stunning church, make sure you are reasonably covered if you wish to go in as we were not allowed in for showing our knees.",
          "At the \u201cbottom\u201d of Old Town. Public square with impressive architecture, culture and history. Easy walking access from most Vilnius Old Town lodging.",
          "If you are in the Old Town I would highly suggest a visit here. Plenty of opportunity for beautiful photos both in the cathedral or in the square.",
          "We did venture inside the cathedral as well and it was just as beautifully ornate inside as out. There was lots of rich looking marble, gold detailing and elaborate paintings so I'd certainly recommend the time to go inside as well.",
          "The Vilnius Cathedral is the first place that a tourist must visit in Vilnius. The Cathedral\u00b4s facade is majestic with gigantic columns and wonderful sculptures/figures on its huge walls. The tower adds to the drama. Upon our visit few days ago, we witnessed a wedding ceremony",
          "A \u201cmust see\u201d cathedral in the very heart of Vilnius. Beautiful from inside out. The main city ceremonies are held here. Despite of being huge it is still a very cosy place to calm down and free your mind! The Cathedral Square next to it is a popular meeting point and a place for",

          "The neoclassical fa\u00e7ade is impressive, but inside, in my opinion, the cathedral is rather bland. It's one of the must visit sites in Vilnius simply because its the city's main cathedral. However, there are several far more impressive church interiors to be seen.",
          "I am not a fan of the neoclassic style, and that leaves me a little cold towards a church that, otherwise, has a great many stories to tell, from its early foundations and the Gothic predecessors that succumbed to fire in earlier centuries.",
          "This is a massive Cathedral so plan to spend sometime walking around outside and inside. There are a few special chapels inside and the exterior is pristine. Along with he bell tower & palaces the whole site is impressive.",
          "Really nice church and Bell tower on main square close to Old Town. Good place to start getting to know Vilnius.",
          "Well it's big. Among European cathedrals, this one seemed a little garish to me from the outside. However the interior was spectacular. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "My hotel was right across this cathedral and I fell in love with it. This cathedral is so beautiful and its history made it even more beautiful. This cathedral is not only a city landmark but people actually go here to hear the mass.",
          "We chanced upon a tour in English. It was very informative as we were just coming from Krakow, Poland and visited the Wawel Hill. The guide talked abt the union of the two countries. We visited the royal tombs underneath. Well spent 50 min!",
          "Our tour bus from Riga dropped me off here so i got a good introduction to Vilnius seeing the cathedral in the spacious square. The sculptures on the roof were well worth looking at and the various statues around the building.",

          "\u0130f you have time to make city tour you need to see this Kathedral. It has great status outside building and the inside is also needs to be seen.",
          "There\u2019s a decent sized square around the cathedral itself, sometimes has special events on. The parking immediately around the square is awfully expensive, something to be wary of. The building is beautiful and a true monument of Vilnius, definitely recommend going to see it",
          "Large square and beautiful huge building. Couple of buildings and things to see here, including the bell tower. Nice to sit and eat an ice cream from up the road.",
          "The biggest and most impressive of Vilnius' 48 churches. A big space with a distinctly Holy atmosphere. Small shop. Well worth paying the extra to go up the bell tower or down into the crypt. Exterior lovely in the evening sunshine. Not to be missed.",
          "This is in the main square and has an information centre nearby. It looks more like the White House with its splendid columns",

          "First built as a Christian on the site of a pagan temple in 1251 Today it largely dates from the late 18th century, closed by the Soviets in 1950 and reconsecrated i 1989",
          "Its external architecture reminds me of Rome's Colosseum. The huge white pillars dwarfed me. It housed the relics of St. Casimir, Lithuania's Patron Saint. It is officially name as Basilica of St. Stanislaus & St. Vladislaus. No visit to Vilnius without visiting this cathedral !",
          "This Cathedral is all about being sober, both from the exterior which has nothing spectacular and looks more or less like a walled Greek temple than a Cathedral... as well as from the inside that looks more like a library than an actual Cathedral. This all changes when you get",
          "More imposing from the outside than the inside, it is situated in a huge square. Wonderful external architecture, it is a natural centre to the city.",
          "A typical Catholic cathedral built and restored on classical lines. Architecturally, the tower outside is particularly interesting. There is a crypt visit but tours in English are held on certain days at 4.00pm. You have to book in advance but there are no details on how to do",
          "In the square there is a palce, a belfry and the cathedral. There is a crypta that could be visited in soem moments of the day Do not forget the chapel of San Casimiro (three hands icon)",
          "Uncrowded, free and impressive. Napoleon used this cathedral as a barracks for his troops on route to Moscow and the soviets used it as an art gallery. Now back in use for its intended purpose.",
          "A very worthwhile place to visit; a bright interior, simply fashioned but with one or two very ornate corners. A must when in Vilnius.",
          "The Cathedral is located in the centre of the Old Town and is both a focal point and highlight of the city. The Cathedral and its adjacent bell tower are impressive and provide excellent photo opportunities, especially at sunset. The Cathedral is free to enter and is calm place",
          "On my visit to Vilnius I visited the Cathedral and it was a memorable place and beautiful inside and outside.",
          "This is a huge bright white cathedral which really stands out. There is a huge paved area beside it and at night it\u2019s full of children and families hanging out.",

          "The amazing thing about this cathedral is that it has survived 700 years of assault from one side or another. Restored again after independence in 1989 it us once again a jewel in the crown of Vilnius. Surrounded by sn impressive plaza which was buzzing with activity - kids and",
          "I thought the bell tower next to the. Cathedral was mote interesting while you cannot deny the size and scale. Inside was rather disappointing with no real wow factor.",

          "We visited here on a cold but bright and sunny day. The ' white' exterior of the Cathedral stood out in its majesty. Impressive. We wanted to go inside and this is where the hiccup began. We needed to go inside. After circumnavigating the Cathedral we finally found a small",

          "It rained during our visit so we were not able to spend much time here. However, on the plus side, it meant we were able to spend more time inside the church and take in the entire square.",
          "The Cathedral Basilica of St Stanislaus and St Ladislaus is the most prominent site in Vilnius. A peaceful and serene place but why so dark inside? The alcoves were not lit so difficult to fully appreciate the statues & paintings. Its a pity we missed the free Crypt Tour.",
          "Lovely to sit and contemplate and listen to the organist in the afternoon, close to the main street and squares",

          "This church is the oldest & very famous because it is the main church of Vilnius, which you will see in all the news paper & massages & adds around world when you see the name of Lithuania, when you come to vilnius 100% you will get to see this church if you don;t get to see",
          "The size, quality and quality paintings in the cathedral are nothing short of remarkable. How they protected them during the war and then the occupation is a tribute to Lithuanian determination. You certainly don't need to be a religious person ( I'm not) to appreciate the",

          "The inside of the church is nice, but not as dramatic as other churches in Vilnius. Book for a Crypt tour, which is done a few times a day and you must purchase in advance. This one hour tour is amazing!",
          "Although it's an amazing building from the outside I think it's a little bit plain inside compared to others I've been in ? Still worth the visit though!",
          "Very large and impressive building with huge pillars, inside not as interesting as others but still worth a visit plus being on the main square it also looks stunning at night when all lit up.",
          "A must visit. You can also go down to the \"catacombs\" which is great place to learn some history as well.",
          "We liked the stylish neoclassical building. It is worthy to walk around, make a wish on a tile in front of the main entrance, and admire the interior.",
          "An impressive building in the center of Vilnius attracting tourists. Those who wish can drop into the underground chambers and look around there.",
          "The broad surrounding square and the long row of tall white columns are impressive,although the instead is quite austere.",
          "Nice stop just to walk around the grounds and interior of the church. They were preparing for the Pope's visit so there was some cleaning and restoration being done on the outside. Therefore we did not get the full optical effect of the exterior.",
          "The cathedral and bell tower are very imposing from the outside. Inside, I was disappointed to find that St Cashmir's Chapel was closed for renovations during my visit (in July, may have reopened since). But I could peer at the chapel through the bars in the gate and it was",
          "This is a very large area where slot of tours start and a lot of interesting information about history. A definite must when visiting.",
          "Always the symbol of the city of Vilnius. A Cathedral that during our visit was about to host Pope Francis on his visit to the Baltic countries. The bell tower is detached from the main body and this is rather unusual, but the glance is spectacular!",
          "This cathedral is a must see when in Vilnius! It's the most important cathedral for Lithuania's Catholic population and the Chapel of St Kazimir is very impressive.",
          "It is a huge and imposing cathedral. The interior decorations are monumental and very impressive. And the chapel of Saint Casimir is breathtaking with the murals and the sculptures. If you are in Vilnius, then I would definitely recommend a visit here",
          "The cathedral imposes itself on a open area in the city center. Used as storage room under soviet occupation it has been restored to its original glory. Sometimes the underground area can be visited where you can see the foundations of the original Gothic building.",
          "We were lucky enough to wander into a wedding going on in this cathedral. It was nice to just sit quietly at the back and absorb the atmosphere.",
          "Monumental and breathtaking cathedral. White, clean walls don't distract you and lead straight to amazing chapel of Saint Casimir.",
          "This is a beautiful place in Vilnius but it is far more beautiful and impressive on the outside than it was on the inside. The inside was nice was we expected more. Be sure to find the tile marker between the cathedral and the tower outside and read the story behind it, very",
          "This is definitely my favorite place in town. The place invites you for just sit somewhere and stay for several minutes relaxing and enjoying the view, people passing by, practicing sports, kids playing around. Just grab a coffee and enjoy.",
          "Very nice place to grab a coffee and enjoy the people watching. Square was clean and the cathedral was beautiful",
          "This is a Vilnius landmark for sure, which sits at one end of the Old Town just as it meets the new at Gediminas Avenue. I was expecting more perhaps on the inside than was promised, being used to the older style Churches both at home and on the wider continent of Europe, but",
          "Amazing church with a great and long history, from the start through very hard periods for Lithuania. It is worth a visit for sure.",
          "If you are visiting Vilnius \u2014 this place is a must see. It is not only surrounded by great architecture but has loads of history to it. Plus it is just 5 minutes walk to Gedemino Tower. I would say that if you\u2019ve been to Vilnius and didn\u2019t visit this place \u2014- you haven\u2019t been",
          "A wonderful monument, the main part of the church is excellent, but the final chapel on the far right hand side is astonishing, and should not be missed.",
          "Vilnius Cathedral, located in the medieval part of the city, is the main Catholic Church of Lithuania .. It is dedicated to Saint Stanislaus and Saint Ladislas and has a chapel dedicated to Saint Casimir which is a place of pilgrimage of all the country and surrounding",
          "The cathedral is a lovely catholic cathedral, however it is maybe not as impressive as some of the baroque churches in Vilnius, Poland or Czechia. When we were there the exterior was being renovated for the visit of the Pope, so it had a lot of scaffolding up, but we could still",
          "The cathedral is still being restored and it is interesting to compare the areas that have been completed with those that are in progress. Do look in on St Casimir\u2019s chapel and note the lovely candlesticks with feet.",
          "Vilnius Cathedral (or if full the Cathedral Basilica of St Stanislaus and St Ladislaus of Vilnius) lords it over Cathedral Square. On our visit, the Classical Facade was festooned with scaffolding!. The Grand Dukes of Lithuania were crowned here, and their remains are buied",
          "First of all, I\u2019m not christian but was very nice to visit and it was really impressed. As usual, sunday was full of local and tourist. Right next to bell tower and located close to old town",
          "We recently visited this Cathedral while visiting Vilnius. The outside of the cathedral was being prepped for a visit by the Pope on 22-23 Sept 2018 so scaffolding was in front of the building. The interior was very spectacular. The bell tower just outside the front of the",
          "First day in vilnius, walking the town. Very cool and old school town. There is alot in walking distance to do and see. Get out and see all you can #porkmafia",
          "The church is very beautiful as it is being readied for Pope Francis' soon visit. I did not get to take the crypt tour which was only offered once, later in the day. I think I would have liked to taken that and I would plan accordingly if time allows.",
          "It is not exactly the regular architecture I would imagine for a cathedral, but it is quite stunning. The interior is simple, but memorable, the art is beautiful and on top of it all, my visit was accompanied by organ music. It's definitely worth checking out. No entrance fee",
          "Amazing catedra with a great story. I recommend to buy a excursion to undegrounds of Cathedral, tickets are cheap, especially if you also buy tickets to belfry Tower. Both will be cheaper and really worth attencion. Reccomend!",
          "This cathedral sits set back on the square and stands out. Incredibly beautiful baroque masterpiece. The bell tower is separate and makes it very unique",
          "Do not expect the richness in decor of central and Southern European churches. However, it is rich with history and the stark decor has its own charm and appeal. A must visit.",
          "The cathedral occupies the prime location in Vilnius, unsurprisingly. Its exterior is very classical and un-church-like. The interior is resplendent but, for me, not particularly exciting. Other visitors may feel differently",
          "The cathedral itself is beautiful, but its treasure is its crypt. Take the tour and see the Royal Mausoleum, see what the archaeologists have discovered, and see the original floor of the church.",
          "1st time visitor, killing some time, wondered over to have a closer look, I am not particularly interested in religious buildings, but this was not only impressive, fully in use, the art work inside was breathtaking",
          "This building is huge! Really, it's gigantic. You will be amazed at the sight of it, definitely worth a visit.",
          "Absolutely stunning Cathedral on the outside and beautiful inside, the square in which it sits is a great place to relax and close to a very nice park, a short walk from the river and for most people the entrance to the Old Town and it's many attractions, it was the first place",
          "This building is stunning, looks more like a museum or government building from the outside and the detached bell tower is unusual. I like that it is fronted by a big open plaza.The inside is well worth looking at, excellent sculptures and pictures",
          "This \"arch\"cathedral is a must see in Vilnius. The outside alone is impressive with beautiful columns and sculptures. Inside, in addition to the beautiful main altar it contains numerous chapels along the outside of the main hall including St. Casimir's at the front right which",
          "It's in the centre of the old city so easy to find and no entrance fee to get in. Ot the most impressive interior in comparison to the grand exterior. Photography is allowed inside. It's an active church so recommended to wear appropriately. If you have time to kill in Vilnius",
          "The cathedral is interesting as it has been rebuilt many times and therefore looks very modern . This is also the only cathedral which does not have the bell tower on top but at the side .",
          "A centre point of any tour of old town right beside the Bell tower which you can go up to view things and. Again a demonstation of the power of the church.",
          "A truly beautiful church with a light , airy feel. Magnificent sculptures and paintings and tomorrow we do a tour of the crypts under the church which holds the last resting place of some of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania.",
          "I have visited Vilnius for couple of days. This was one of the great places I have been, very nice and clean city. Definitely recommend it to anyone who travel alone or family and friends. can't wait to go back again.",
          "Our first day in Vilnius we visited the Cathedral. I was impressed with the structure, painting and history of the building. I came back to hear the organ recital. It was only 20 minutes and enjoyable. The whole area around the Cathedral is well worth walking round.",
          "An impressive cathedral that dominates the northern end of the Old City of Vilnius on the equally impressive Cathedral Square. The architecture mixes classical and baroque, with the St. Casimir Chapel (on the right, near the front of the church) being the most impressive part",
          "The Neo Classical style is good but the King's Chapel at the side rear of the Cathedral was locked/blocked when the refurbishment happened and fortunately missed out on a neo classical face lift. Makes this Cathedral different. Still impressive.",
          "Impressive large stark white building resembles a museum more that a cathedral. Inside the roof is grand with fine slight decoration, and you will find silver statues, marble carvings and frescoes. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.",
          "This is a pretty cathedral. The building outside is beautifully decorated. We only spent about 10 minutes here as not much to do once walked around inside.",
          "The place is nice, a good spot to take a couple pictures, behind it there are some restaurants and a touristic street.",
          "Lovely grand structure very impressive building inside and out. Free entry but you have to pay to visit the clock tower next to it.",
          "Very beauty cathedral, I think just Vilnius has cathedral like this, no countries have something like Vilnius cathedral. It also has a huge cathedral square. I should visit our cathedral in winter time, because in winter in cathedral square you can see Vilnius Christmas tree.",
          "The organist was playing really strong powerful music while I was there. You can get a few nice photographs out of the visit.",
          "This cathedral is in daily use. It is so beautiful, particularly the small chapel of St Casimir in the corner. A guide showed us the crypts under the cathedral and I was prepared to be bored. This was fascinating hour visit. The stories of the royalty buried there, what they\u2019ve",
          "This is another great church. beautiful in side lots of painting and gold.. it is a land mark . good to visit",
          "Very beautiful cathedral in the absolute centre of the city. Outside is a large and beautiful square.",
          "Wonderful open light airy easy access right in one of the main square. You can easily hop over to whole town from this place",
          "The Cathedral and the Bell Tower along with the Cathedral Square together are a Photographers Delight Cathedral is beautiful in the inside as well as the Outside",
          "In the heart of the City a must visit. Did not get chance to do the crypt but if visiting again would try to add this.",
          "The most important building in Vilnius. Classical and actually very beautiful. Go inside, take some time to realy enjoy it. If you have spare time, buy tickets to go downstairs to see dungeons. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude09",
          "Very big cathedral, located at downtown. All the ways in Vilnius take you there! Easy to visit! Nothing special! From outside it is more impressive!!",
          "Huge building, very clean and extremely cold!! For those who pray is a nice church to go without cruel scenes such as typical Catholic churches!!",
          "I think that the cathedral is one of the most beautiful buildings in Vilna. I visited at night (just being outside) and I recommend it for sure!",
          "You should visit this cathedral. It has a long history very imortant for the inhabitants of Vilnius.",
          "Roman Catholic Cathedral is the highlight of the square. If you are looking for a bit of peace in addition to history, it is ideal to visit it in the morning.",
          "The Cathedral itself is impressive, with its strong neo classical design. The interior has a newness about it which is a reminder to the changing fortunes of the building in the last century. It is nice to spend some time outside too, as there is always people milling about!",
          "The cathedral is a modern rebuild, but is still very impressive brilliant white building. The outside is probably more impressive than the inside, but its still worth a visit.",
          "Very impressive building. The \"newest version\" of the cathedral, was built in the end of 18th century. Keeps a lot of secrets of Vilnius and gives possibility to discover part of it. The organ is also the masterpiece! If you're visiting the church during mess, you can listen",
          "Is of some think you have to visit in Vilnius... vilnius is too small town that you have not many things to see but this is one of the must",
          "The cathedral represents the centre of the Catholic faith in Lithuania and you can't miss it as it's one of Vilnius' most imposing buildings. it is also the resting place of the country's patron saint, St. Casimir. Constructed in 1783, the cathedral underwent a period of",
          "Authentic and with its soul. If you are in Vilnius - it is a must place you have to see. It is located in the heart of Vilnius so you'll find it easily.",
          "We went in 4 times during our stay in Vilnius. Very peaceful Cathedral. Busy with people for the Easter week. Take a tour of the crypts if you can - very interesting.",
          "Definitely worth having a look at. This big cathedral is beautiful on the outside as well as the inside. Entry is free.",
          "More attractive Outlook. It's a church, more or less the same as any other in the kind. As it's sort of landmark and it's free, no harm to visit once.",
          "The cathedral is very impressive from the outside and the inside is also magnificent with all those works of art.",
          "The cathedral looks very impressive form the outside but I found the inside a little disappointing. There is not a great deal to see, inside, although there is a small art gallery and St Casimir chapel. Around the outside of the cathedral there are lots of statues and sculptures",
          "The church isn't particularly interesting but the crypt tour is excellent. You learn the history of those buried below the cathedral and about the rebuilding.",
          "Didn't think this was the Cathedral we were advised to visit it looked more like a museum from the outside rather than a Cathedral. Once inside it was clearly a place of worship, it is quite beautiful so glad we went in.",
          "I went for Mass at the Vilnius Cathedral. It is a spectacular place of worship. The building was full for the 17:30 service, with standing room only available. Still, many worshipers joined throughout the entire time. I would encourage anyone to stop here.",
          "Lovely building, was fortunate enough to be there during St Casimirs weekend event with a lovely event into the late evening which anyone can appreciate",

          "The Cathedral is a big, huge, building which stand up fierce in the open square in the center area of Vilnius. It is not so old (in particular if compared to others church there) but sounds to be one of the main city attraction and building. It is a very \"minimalist\" and made of",
          "The St Casmier Chapel was beautiful. The rest was plain. Its worth a visit and free to enter so you have nothing to loose. Lots of art inside the main hall and lovely sculptures outside.",
          "Suppose to be a big attraction but nothing great inside compared to other churches in Vilnius. Exterior was great and got a long history.",
          "The current Vilnius Cathedral dates to 1783, but earlier churches on this site go back to 1400s. Survived Soviet occupation as an art gallery. The base of the Bell Tower was part of the original city wall. Bricks in the square show an outline of the wall's original location.",
          "Nice cathedral, not fancy and an interesting outside bell tower! Price rather expensive to climb up 4.5euros (for which you can dine in a restaurant here!). Try to get the combined ticket with the crypt (7\u20ac for both). Unfortunately the tours in English are only on Tuesday",
          "As a none believer this place carried nil spiritual impact for me but as a building it\u2019s worth stepping out of the cold and having a little wander around (for free) for a few minutes",
          "Looks more like a place but still has interesting interior. Free - worth getting a guide to get the details.",
          "its HUGE! so beautiful. the inside looks amazing and if you walk around the outside there are so many different statues acting our scenes.",
          "Make no mistake, this is a sacred place, a fully functioning Catholic Church. Its not as grand as some in the west, but well worth a visit. I read that it was only restored as a holy place in 1989 or thereabouts, before that when the Russians occupied, it was used as a warehouse",
          "Always visit religious places of worship anywhere in the World. I pray for World peace and the return of Middlesbrough FC to their rightful place in the Premiership. Have to say I was not wowed but in some ways was impressed by the understated nature of the Cathedral. Perhaps",
          "Visited on a day of worship, it was magical to hear the choir singing witht eh christmas decs still up.",
          "Every time I go there I light a candle. It is my tradition when I need to recharge my calmness. It helps",
          "This very large and rather sober cathedral has historical significance and it has been reconstructed several times. A good stop in your visit to Vilnius city centre",
          "I missed the usual stained glass windows of European cathedrals. The interior feels strangely remote. Some interesting art to be found.",
          "Rather new (200 years +) and not so embellished. Good organ (there are midday free concerts). Put attention to unusual and beautiful modern icons at the entrance",
          "A very nice place to visit and to meet new people ;) I would recommend to go up to a tower as-well, enjoyed it!",
          "We visited during the height of the Christmas market period and the place was lovely, especially with the most beautiful Christmas Tree in Europe. Lots of Christmas stalls set up for decorative and souvenier items, and local cuisine, mulled wine and coffee and chocolate drinks.",

          "06 July, 2017. I had set out to explore the Old Town of Vilnius on foot, and high on my agenda was one of the most locatable images of Vilnius, simply known as the `Cathedral'. This place cannot be missed: though I had started my walk from the Gates of Dawn, I sent past the",
          "If you are visiting Vilnius, this is a place you must visit. It's big, glorious and great to photograph.",
          "Worth to get in and see. Really pretty both on the inside as on the outside. I entered during a church mass and was beautiful to watch",
          "Stunning on the outside, take a little time to go inside (free entry) for an oasis of calm in the city. The separate bell tower to the cathedral (admission fee applies) is well worth a visit for both the internal story and views from the top.",
          "The cathedral was only 400 metres from our hotel and sits at the end of the main road in the city centre. We first saw this at night and it looked stunning lit up. We went the following day to look again and it was then you could see the poor facade of the building; paint and",

          "When I visited Vilnius, I was really surprised to find such a massive Cathedral. The architecture and the materials used is typically to Catholic structures seen by the Mediterranean. The Cathedral leaves one breathless, it has the aura of something, a presence of greater power.",
          "A magnificent work of art both inside as well as on the outside. I wish I had had more time to admire the interior, as it is a home to many interesting paintings and sculptures. Hope to come back one day and spend more time there.",

          "Centrally situated and dominating the surrounding square. Rather austere interior. Worth quick visit but not really one of the highlights.",
          "Worth visit. Nice from outside and breathtaking from inside. Very well repaired building. Nice to have those monuments here.",
          "Amazing cathedral! So huge next to a tower and enormous plaza. Free of charge! Just walking around at outside there are sculptures of prists. Inside the church, high ceilings and paints. Impressive all over. Walking distance from old town and main shopping avenue.",

          "A must see in Vilnius. Astonishing interior. When looking from the outside it doesn't look fantastic, but it is! Highly recommendable.",
          "Church dominating the area. Short visit inside is worth your time for its grandness even if few pieces of art to see.",
          "The cathedral is situated next to the former royal palace and used to have a connection between the two. The afternoon we were there there seemed to be continuous services taking place so entry to the cathedral was impossible and a great disappointment",

          "The Vilnius cathedral is very nice. Compared to most cathedrals, its beauty is in its simplicity- huge on the inside, it does not bombard the senses with so many icons, flags, statuary. Once inside, you sense the grandness of God.",
          "It is pretty from the outside, but really breathtaking on the inside. Be sure to look up! Also, make sure to look for the tile on the square outside markin the end of the \"Baltic Way\", the 675 km human chain of 2 million people formed in 1989 to protest Soviet occupation.",
          "I really nice place to visit when you're a tourist in Vilnius. Old relegious buildings like this cathedral are always so impressive.",

          "This cathedral has a central location near the river and Old Town. It is situated in large square, and looks more like a palace or castle than a cathedral. It is interesting to wander about inside, as the side chapels are quite full of art and history,",
          "So rare to see a Christian cathedral built in the ancient Greek (that is, pagan) style. Still, it works -- the architecture is lofty and dignified. On the outside are sculptures of Biblical scenes. the interior has several ornate side-chapels worthy of exploration.",

          "When I look back at our tour aside from the beauty and the grandeur of the place I think of babies in strollers. For sure the beauty is in the details and in the small side chapels. But also in the fact that is easily accessible by strollers. In many instances the churches have",

          "One of the most iconic places in the city, and close to many of the other most popular sights. Inside they sell candles for lighting, and outside there is some kind of \u201cspecial tile\u201d in the pavement, where you can make a wish. If you like that sort of thing \u2013 or have children",
          "I just loved this place. All of the buildings are completely right and the huge expanse of ground around the cathedral just sets it off beautifully. I could have sat here for hours just watching. Do not miss this part of the old town whatever you do.",
          "Did not go up the tower but a nice white church against a blue sky backdrop. There is beautiful organ inside. Free to go in part of it.",
          "The area around the cathedral, square, tower and palace as well as the Gediminas Castle which overlooks them all is a must see, a couple of hours wandering and finding out about some of the history is a great way to spend your time before checking out the shops along Gedimino Pl",
          "Magnificent Vilnius the Cathedral. Here are secert the undergroundrooms and several the chapels. Everytime when i am here i feeling blessed",
          "Cathedral Square is hard to miss now that they have added the three statues back onto the top of the cathedral (in 1995) and opened the bell tower for viewing adventures. In addition to the iconic cathedral, there is the statue of Gediminas and his horse (installed in 1996).",
          "A beautiful cathedral easy to find across from the Irish embassy. The bell tower is fantastic and the interior of the building stunning. Candles can be bought for 15 cents in shop inside Cathedral on the left.",
          "Our exceptionally good Vilnius Walking Tour guide explained the history of this cathedral, which is markedly more interesting than it looks today. Regularly damaged/destroyed over the years, remodelled in the 19th C in neo- Classical style, \"de-churched' by Communists under USSR",
          "a building that looks like a museum on the outside and also a lot like the town hall. spacious and airy, we visited the day before the beatification of a lithuanian archbishop, so there were a large number of pilgrims.",
          "I was impressed by the size, the situation (lots of space to get a good view of it), and the homogeneity of the building. Purely neo-classical, it looks like a modernized version of a Greek temple. Inside, it had the feeling of an art gallery, though some of the side chapels had",
          "The cathedral is very centrally located with large square alongside where locals come to meet and chat. Inside cathedral is as you would expect quite allowing thinking and reflection. Beautifully decorated. If you get chance take time to listen to the organ music being played",
          "The outside promises a great inside. However, the inside is rather dull. While in Vilnius, you might as well visit it.",
          "Standing in the square looking at this impressive cathedral with the sun shining directly on the facade you have almost to shade your eyes it is so bright .The bell tower itself is a magnificent structure and has been added to over the years seemingly at one time it was part of",
          "It is great to visit Vilnius Cathedral any time of the day, it is absolutely impressive. There are with many chapels, paintings, scuptures and cavings inside. Pope John Paul II visited this Cathedral in 1993 too. Amazing organ, you can find the schedule at the gate. Too bad",
          "It was a special Beatitude service on Sunday morning 25/6/17. Hundreds of people listening to choral singing and a sermon.",
          "St Stanislaus and St Vladislav is the main Roman Catholic Cathedral of Lithuania. Located in Vilnius Old Town, it's the centre of Catholic spiritual life in the country. Coronations took place here and, inside its crypts and catacombs are buried many famous and nobles people",
          "The Vilnius Cathedral is an impressive building with many chapels inside. The chapel of Holy Casimir of early 17th century is one of the highlights in the church.",
          "Unusual to find a neoclassical building in a city of Baroque churches. Be sure to visit the royal burial chapel, a Baroque masterpiece. Occasional organ concerts show off wonderful acoustics.",
          "Cathedral has long history (from 1241) and 7 reconstructions (last 1799 in clasicism style). Interior was destroyed by soviets so it is not so impressive inside. If you come from protestant country and want to be impressed by Catholic mass visit it on Sunday noon. Perfect organ",
          "Vilnius is a city best known for its outstanding collection of Baroque churches. It is less known for its Neo-Classical buildings, though it does also have a sprinkling of them, with this being one of the most important. The gleaming white cathedral is the main Catholic monument",
          "Great architecture with a wonderful history. It's right in the city centre with lovely views around it. It's a nice place to walk around, take nice pictures or just sit down and rest.",
          "If you come on a Sunday, you will be treated to lovely choral music during the well-attended service. The interior is huge white and neo-classic. The Cazimir chapel has some unusual baroque frescoes that fly out of their designated frames.",
          "A beautiful building reminiscent of classical temples the cathedral is best viewed by night. It's highlight is the facade, and Chapel of St Casimir on the far right inside the cathedral. The rococo chapel is not to be missed. Would recommend reading up on what the chapel",
          "The cathedral was a bit disappointing on the inside, having admired its classical proportions from outside. It felt a bit like a functional museum more than a place of worship.",
          "Big cathedral in the main square of Vilnius, I think you will see a lot of interesting spots just taking a look arround, the cathedral is a simple one if compared with another in europe, even so it has its own beaty, there is a souvenir store as well where you can buy religious",
          "A really impressive cathedral, viewed from all directions... worth a visit inside, as it is equally impressive and quite warm for a church!",
          "Beautiful and unique neoclassical, late 18th century church built on the foundations of earlier cathedrals dating back to the 13th century. Wonderful light inside and very accessible.",
          "Not just a tourist attraction, the Cathedral and the square around it are a busy part of Vilnius. Plan an hour or two to visit and linger outside, specially if there's a concert or event during your visit. Not too different from lots of other roman catholic cathedral's around",
          "Would recommend - stumbled in there on \u00e1 walk in the old town and this is one of the most beautiful churches i've seen.",
          "It's one of a kind but nothing special about this Basilica. However it's still worth to visit while you're in Vilnius. All churches can't be the same when it comes to architectural design.",
          "Arkikatedra Bazilika is situated in the centre of Vilnius. It's one of the main attractions, built as pagan temple, latter converted to Catholic Church, nearby you can find small park where at certan place you can produce echo from your voice (must true, ask local for the certan",

          "Beautiful building worth to see. You will pass it anyway traveling through the Old City. Impressive photos could be taken. There is a large square nearby - a place for concerts and other attractions in festive days. As ther square is REALLY big - you can stroll there with a",
          "A gorgeous square featuring an impressive belfry and beautiful cathedral buildings. The plaza has beautiful tile and one very special tile hidden between the main structures!",
          "This is not just a must, but also hard to avoid. Outside more impressive than inside. There is live music at 19:18 each night from the bell Tower to get ready for the 100 anniversary of Independence (?)",
          "Beautiful cathedral! Worth a quick walk through. The statues outside are large and detailed. There's a small book store / gift shop inside with some rosaries and bibles.",
          "One of the most important place to visit and very near to Hill of three crosses. The cathedral view was amazing and specially on sunny day.",
          "The cathedral basement is full of 'secrets' and the basement is not opened for general public. We sign up for the guided tour from the clock tower at extra \u20ac3. Best decision ever because the basement is so interesting. Full of history and undiscovered secrets. Totally worth that",
          "The current model was built in the 18th century, in the classical style, it feels it would be more at home in Athens. spend some time in the square as there are many attractions to see: The bell tower, which the bottom section was actually part of the ancient city walls. Statue",
          "Nice to take pictured from the outside. But nothing worth visiting inside. It is free though so just get in.",
          "The place is a nice square and one of the worthwile places to visit in Vilnius. The square is of course crowded compared to other places but still less compared to other European cities",
          "Possibly the most famous building in Vilnius Old Town. It is very impressive from the outside. Its Tower sightly resembles the leaning tower of Pisa. The Tower itself is worth a walk up. The interior isn't as impressive as the St Peter & St Paul's church but it is still nice all",
          "The Cathedral of Vilnius is a very big building, in a very vivid white. Along with its bell-tower and the square around, it is a must-see of Vilnius. Best view: approaching it walking down from Gedimino avenue. Inside, the Cathedral is not that wonderful, except for the",
          "the cathedral is located at a beautiful square and the tower looks very impressive. The cathedral from the outside looks a bit like a temple more than a cathedral. It is peaceful and invites to contemplation worth a visit",
          "I really enjoyed a visit to Vilnius Cathedral one of the first things I did on my visit to the city. It is very centrally located in a square at the end of Gediminas Prospectas adjacent to the Old Town and close to the Gediminas Tower, Castle and Hill of Crosses. There has been",
          "Worth visiting and going inside to see all the beautiful art. Side entry gives access to the main transept and to the rear of the altar which has smaller decorative alcoves off. Very interesting.",
          "Cathedral is in center of old town. When I saw it at first I thought that it was not amazing. There are many churches over there however, when I was going inner place it was marvelous. You must see it.",
          "This is the perfect place to be especially in summer. Being there you can feel that city is alive - there are a lot of people passing by, children are playing or riding bikes and skateboards, friends are drinking coffee. It is a huge space so everybody here fits perfectly",
          "Must visit. I went on a Sunday when they had a sermon. The cathedral was full of people. The architecture of the building is amazing and clean.",
          "Beautiful classical cathedral in the heart of Vilnius. Just right near King's palace (now museum) Highly recommended to visit to have a look and/or to pray.... Don't forget Cathedral caves, it is place of rest - Lithuanian Dukes and Queen.",
          "A must to take pictures. Beautiful architecture design. Went with kids and old mother. Although we were not able to enter, the cathedral could be admired from the outside. I have lovely photos taken after christmas 2016.",
          "This is a must see location. The cathedral is beautiful and very well-maintained. Church services are usually in Lithuanian but sometimes in Latin. Terrific choir and organ. No restrooms but there are plenty nearby. It is right in the center of the city and restaurants and",
          "We are locals, so visit Cathedral and its lovely square on regular basis - it's a lovely place for a walk. This year Christmas tree is different again and market is worth a visit. Dutch waffles are absolutely delicious!",
          "Vilnius Cathedral is situated in Cathedral Square. Beautiful building. It is free to go inside and have a look and pray.",
          "Great Christmas market in the Cathedral square with an unconventional, yet creative and cosy Christmas tree concept \ud83c\udf84 \ud83c\udf84 \ud83c\udf84",
          "It does not matter if you believe in God or not - this place has something spiritual. Even in ancient times it was a place for pagan temple, so if you are able to visit this white beauty - don't miss this opportunity. The best way is to pre-order guided tours (they can show you",
          "The cathedral is beautiful from a distance and has a lovely setting. When you go inside it is a little disappointing. Whilst the chapel of Casimir is beautiful and unique the rest of the cathedral is disappointing. When we visited the lighting was poor and two of the major",
          "a great place to see, quiet and lovely. Had a nice time there walking around, thinking, praying and enjoyed every minute",
          "This definitely feels like the centre of this lively city and worth a visit inside. The history of the place juxtaposed rather nicely with the KFC directly opposite.",
          "We been down the cathedal where you can see the criptas ans the sarcofagh of the dukes. The guide was very nice and lots of stories! It took an hour and cost 4.5 euros. I recommend to see it at least once if you are interested in lithuanian history.",
          "The cathedral was really amazing, truly worth the visit. Couldnt even imagine how beautiful it was on the inside. Do visit the Bell tower as well. Amazing wiew.",
          "The scale, design and construction of the Cathedral dominates this part of town. It has great presence and significance for the Lithuanian people. You can't miss it.!",
          "There isn't much more to say, just that you visit it because you were there, but you do not travel there for it.",
          "Very non ornate so quite different to most cathedrals especially in Vilnius. Plain walls with pictures. I really like it.",
          "This is a magnificent complex. The cathedral sits separate from the bell tower in a spectacular plaza. Serving as the main Roman Catholic Church of Lithuania, it is centrally located in Old Town Vilnius. It is dedicated two Saints Stanislaus and Ladislaus. The church has served",
          "This is a big cathedral. I happened to find shelter here from the rain and it was during a mass. It was full of people, but it was still inviting for a tourist with walking halls for visitors. There are also smaller altar rooms with all different decorations. The overall decor",
          "This is massive. Back in the day, the whole dang village, including pets, could\u2019ve fit into this cathedral. The sheer size of this Cathedral will awe you. Insider tip: there\u2019s a spot on the ground in between the watch tower and the Cathedral entrance and rumor has it, if you",
          "The building is monumental, big, clasicist style (?) with very interesting interior. One can feel the history of this proud nation here.",
          "This cathedral is huge. It is decorated with white statues, large columns and ceiling before main entrance are gorgeous! I really like white color. Most of Vilnius churches and cathedrals are pale yellow, pinkish and don't stand out from local buildings at all. This one seeks",
          "This was nothing special from the inside but looks amazing from the outside. So you shouldn't expect too much out of it.",
          "The cathedral is very nice, both on the outside and the inside. Nice statues and it's nicely lit up in the evening. Inside no photos, but we chose to buy two very inexpensive candles and light them for passed family members. Beside the cathedral is the clock tower, also nice,",
          "This main Vilnius Cathedral occupies the entire central square. It's a big and most important Catholic Church in Lithuania. The current structure dates back to 15 cent with the Neoclassical facade added later. Above the front entrance there are three saints figures representing",
          "Cathedral rebuilt rather minimalistically. Interesting to see, especially if you've toured lots of grandiose European cathedrals. Chapel in the back right corner is preserved from a previous church on the site and is rather beautiful, peserving the original marble interior and",
          "This cathedral is beautiful place for take the sacral atmosphere finfing calm and silence and praing. Is the middle point of the capital city. If you are in Vilnius you jave to visit this beautiful church.",

          "Best time to visit here is new year occasion with colorful lights, crackers and to meet lovely people of LT.",
          "The cathedral itself is impressive, as expected, but what really makes it is the crypt. Built originally on a pagan site, the hour tour through the crypt with a guide,who was enthusiastic and knowledgeable, taught me a lot about Lithuanian history as well as the history of the",
          "It is worth visiting as it is really big and is part of the city's history. It has many different chapels worth exploring.",
          "Great place to visit. The crypts are not worth the tour but cathedral itself is very nice. Also the tower outside is interesting.",
          "Fantastic piece of religious architecture with tremendous history and presence. A must see attraction whist in Vilnius and easy to get to.",
          "Great Architecture from the outside, lots of interesting details. Inside it is great too, however the new interior restoration does not give the full \"old buiding\" spirit. Lots of paintings. There are very interesting sculptures outside, that do not belong to the Cathedral.",
          "This cathedral is the nicest looking building in vilnius. It has been refurbished on the outside (pavement and building) Inside is very pretty and what you would expect from a cathedral.",
          "We visited and the outside of the Cathedral indeed has that wow factor. The inside however is dark and other than the ceiling it rather plain. Small windows large paintings hung on the walls. Interesting place.",
          "It reminds me of the one in Helsinki. Quite different from what we are used to. Inside it is not that special.",
          "Different to most cathedrals. More modern but with one older chapel which is just beautifully decorated.",
          "For the first date or for the next one-the best place. You are waiting near the clock , like always :)",
          "Located in the city centre. Nicely located on a big square. A big cathedral, most impressive on the outside. But a must see in Vilnius",

          "From the outside it looks spectacular especially next to the other local buildings and inside it is Interesting. Small chapels around the edges with their own altars paintings ornate ceilings. Sculptures. The crypt has tours I think at 4pm unfortunately we were later so it was",
          "A beautiful cathedral. Take some time to stop and admire both the outside and especially the inside.",
          "A very beautiful interior with lovely ceiling paintings. Surprisingly no admission fee and no sign of any donation boxes. Religious or not, well worth checking out.",
          "This square is very grand and lively. You will find the statue of the founder of Vilnius here. The view from the ruined tower on the top gives a magnificent view of the city centre. It is a must-see and the walking is not tough even though it looks a bit high.",

          "This is in the book '1,001 buildings you must see before you die' so it was a must-see for me. We climbed the bell tower first (separate from the main building), for great views over the city. We then entered the cathedral itself which in Communist times was converted to a",
          "The Roman Catholic cathedral of Vilnius is a modern building, built in neoclassic style. The inside is that a modern church, but there are many others in town which are much more interesting to visit. St Kasimir, the only Lithuanian saint, has his tomb there in one of the side",

          "A very beautiful Cathedral with a long and interesting history. Well worth a visit drinking in the quite solitude. The Chapel of St Casimir at the back to the left is very impressive. The black marble and silver statutes gives it a very different look. Take your time visiting.",

          "Pagans worshiped at this site, and after Lithuanian King Mindaugas converted to Christianity, postulated the construction of the original cathedral in 1251AD. A second cathedral with five chapels was constructed in 1387, but was razed by fire in 1419. King Vytautas built a",
          "Looks nice from the outside, but there's literally nothing of interest inside. Applies to almost all Vilnius churches",

          "A massive and beautiful building, close to the Centre of Vilnius, I find this place to be a necessary place to drop by to experience the city. There are gorgeous carvings, paintings and figures within the cathedral. Would easily recommend. Didn't have the pleasure of trying the",

          "If you approach the Old Town of Vilnius from the Gediminas Avenue, the first thing you will see is the Cathedral with its belfry. It is a huge building, and its size is emphasized by the empty area that surrounds the Cathedral. However, size is the main quality of the Bazilika,",
          "I was part of a wedding here and was impressed. It was in one of the side chapels and is quite a site. Very ornate room and the details of the ceilings should not be missed. I was thrilled to be able to be more that a tourist here and the setting is quite elegant. Very",
          "This is an impressive church from the outside and also inside. We saw it from up in the Bell tower that provided great views. This is one of the best churches in Vilnius. It is also one end of the human chain that linked across the Baltic Nations protesting Soviet Rule that lead",
          "Great building. It is much more interesting motive interior and exterior. first, In exterior in the eyes falling six facade sculptures and facade portal Doric style. In the interior first, me charmed sculptures. both sides of the altar in the side naves standing in baroque style",
          "Great building. Inside is not as ornate as the outside suggests it should be. Many dramatic paintings. The cathedral is central with great cafe's nearby to watch the world go by. Between the cathedral and the bell tower is an individual pink tile. Apparently if you make a",

          "From the outside this church looked like a Greek temple. Inside it was very much Catholic church, however. There were very few tourists so we got to get a 'feel' for religious life -- locals come to pray and make donations regularly. This place is nice but not spectacular.",
          "If you look through any pictures of Vilnius, you are bound to come across many pictures of this Cathedral and rightfully so. It is unmissable, located next to a main road at Vilnius old town, with Castle Hill and Gediminas Tower in the background and well-maintained pavements",

          "You can not miss this place as it dominates the square. It is worth a visit just to have a look around inside which does not take very long. The square is worth visiting and just sitting to people watch. If you want it all to yourself go before 10 a.m. on a weekend.",

          "I stopped by to take a peek inside while I was quickly taking a self tour of Vilnius before a flight. Its a really big church - it was just ok for me. It was lovely inside but not very ornate. Perhaps I didn't see all the chapels inside the High Baroque Chapel of St Casimir",
          "Situated in the heart of the city, in the middle of cathedral square, a beautiful and quiet stop off is a must when visiting this capital city. Visit in the daytime, but also at night to see the stunning white building all lit up. There are lots of works of art to admire when",

It is a major site of Catholic pilgrimage in Lithuania.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was built between 1503 and 1522 as a part of defensive fortifications for the city of Vilnius, the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It has also been known as the Medininkai Gate, as it led to the village Medininkai south of Vilnius, as well as A\u0161tra broma. Of ten city gates, only the Gate of Dawn remains, while the others were destroyed by the order of the government at the end of the 18th century.\n\n\n== Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn ==\n\nIn the 16th century city gates often contained religious artifacts intended to guard the city from attacks and to bless travelers. The Chapel in the Gate of Dawn contains an icon of The Blessed Virgin Mary Mother of Mercy, said to have miraculous powers. For centuries the picture has been one of the symbols of the city and an object of veneration for both  Roman Catholic and Orthodox inhabitants. Thousands of votive offerings adorn the walls and many pilgrims from neighboring countries come to pray in front of the beloved painting.  Masses are held in Lithuanian and Polish languages.\nAfter World War II the cult of Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn prevailed in Lithuanian and Polish communities worldwide and is continued in many shrines to the Virgin Mary in Europe, and the Americas. The largest of the churches devoted to Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn is St. Mary's Church in Gda\u0144sk, Poland.\nThe shrine is also important in the development of the devotion Divine Mercy as it is the first place where the Divine Mercy image was exposed and also where the first celebration of the Divine Mercy Sunday took place.On 4 September 1993 Pope John Paul II said Rosary at the Gate of Dawn Chapel. Church festival of the Blessed Virgin Mary Mother of Mercy\u2014celebrated in the third week of November\u2014is of great importance in the Vilnius Archdiocese.\n\n\n== Lithuanian Chapel in the St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City ==\nThere is a Vilnius' Gate of Dawn Mother of Mercy Chapel (Italian: Cappella Lituana) in the St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. It was consecrated by the Pope Paul VI in 1970 and it is a place where Pope John Paul II had his first prayer after being elected as the Pope in 1978. Only Lithuania, Poland, Hungary and Ireland have such chapels in the St. Peter's Basilica.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe landmark is mentioned in a poem of Maksim Bahdanovich \"Pahonia\" (1913) and its emblem Pahonia.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Gate of Dawn at Wikimedia Commons\nCatholic Church in Lithuania | Au\u0161ros Vartai\nThe Congregation of the Sisters of Merciful Jesus",

          "This is an unusual tourist sight. the Black Madonna is not very big, and you really need to go up to the balcony to view it properly. The history of the painting is what makes it worth the visit, and the fact that it is in a nice street with plenty of other attractions",

          "When approaching the arch from the major street, it is disappointing looking and will make you wonder why it is worth a look. After you enter through the arch and see it from the other side, you can get a better idea of why the fuss. For Catholics, it may hold special",
          "This is a must see for Roman Catholics, but should be interesting to all others. People with various health problems praying for the help of the Blessed Virgin Mary placed silver images of hearts, legs, and so forth on the walls. A few years ago they rebuilt the stairway.",

          "Lovely place with some nice shops and buildings around it. Good for a walk with family or friends. Absolute must if you are a religious person, we did not go inside but could hear some religious music.",
          "This is definitely a must if you are exploring the Old Town. You'll see a bright blue archway marking the end of the Old Town. Look a bit closer and you'll see figures and candlelight through the open shutters above the street. A side door lets you in and you can climb up to the",
          "Busy and flooded with tourists. At the edge of the old city is this famous gate. Nice entrance to the town. Beware of the cobblestones and the Height differences.",
          "At present, Gates of the Dawn are firstly and primarily a pilgrimage object as it holds one of the most important worship objects in Lithuania \u2013 miraculous icon of Virgin Mary, which is revered by catholics of Lithuania and neighbouring countries. So, if you come for worship,",
          "We did not go Inside but the beautiful blue exterior caught our eyes. There were several people begging under the archway but were not intrusive.",
          "A beautiful way to enter the old town from the top end. It is surrounded by stunning churches all ornately decorated and is a very peaceful and pretty area",
          "The Gates of Dawn is at the top of Pilius Street and attracts many visitors. You can walk the stairs to make it to the chapel or actually catch a glimpse as windows are always open.",
          "This is considered as a very holy site for locals and also Polish people. The entrance is on the side, where you can climb up through a hidden staircase to reach to the top.",
          "They have mass in different languages just about every morning. We could see the faithful upstairs through the window, and the big madonna. Nice gateway to the city as part of a city tour.",
          "it is a nice thing to see, but it is a town gate and although there are some fine decorations, it is not an attraction to visit for itself- ok as part of the town tour.",
          "This is interesting as it is part of a church and also a gateway. I would not put in a class of \"must see\".",
          "The gate of dawn has a small open chapel above it which should not be missed. Climb the stairs to go into the small chapel.",
          "Historical place of two reasons: 1/ The fantastic ikon of St Mary, wich is the one and only when she's alone, withouth a baby in her arms. Many people come here to pray in front of her. 2/ The gate kan make miraculous things happen, make a pray for your own miracle.\ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f",
          "Walking through the gate there was beautiful singing floating down from above with a small service taking place. It was just finishing as people moved away from the window and we were able to see the virgin",
          "Not very meaningful unless one is of Catholic faith. The icon of Mary can be seen from the street using the camera tele photo lens when no one was blocking the view inside the chapel. This is a one of the sites in old town when on a guided tour.",
          "Only for pilgrims, pointless otherwise. Not pretty and not interesting. Not worth the walk from other attractions.",
          "The old Gate of Dawn is one of the most important religious, historical and cultural monuments. It was built from 1503 to 1522 as a part of defensive fortifications of the city. Nowadays, it's the only gate that remains from the city\u2019s original defensive walls. The others were",
          "One of the most important buildings in Vilnius. It is the only city gate left. It leads directly into the old city past the townhall and to Pilies gatve, that leads to Vilnius Cathedral and the castle.",
          "The miracle working icon is upstairs at the old city gate, to the left of the city hall in the Old Town. A good walk through an interesting part of the city.",
          "Mostly for Catholic piligrims. One of the three most important religious places. Second is still in Vilnius, third - in Poland.",
          "The Gates of Dawn are the only of the original city gates which are still functioning. As such, they are of possible interest to people doing a walking tour of the Old Town. There is some sort of chapel with a cherished icon of the Virgin Mary inside. We visited the city in",
          "I was a little disappointed with this attraction. If you do not come for the religious angle there isn't too much to it. An important religious site with many pilgrims.",
          "My partner and I visited here on Friday, it was a must do on our list of things to do , and glad we did it , it's a small prayer room over a courtyard and has a large icon of the virgin mary, which was absolutely awesome to behold; I stood reflective at the image for a while ;",
          "You can visit the Church and the street is full of nice restaurants and coffeehouses where you can set and enjoy your time",
          "Obviously some of the people were there to worship and acted accordingly. However, others were noisy and not being respectful. Interesting to see the Black Madonna.",
          "I likely went at the worst time, right before a mass started, so was cramped and couldn't take photos inside of the gorgeous piece of art. Also too many not wearing deodorant which was unpleasant. I might try to pop in again when a mass is not about to start! Free to enter.",
          "When I visited this tiny chapel it was overcrowded so obviously it is an important religious place for locals",
          "Would recommend a visit to the gate through St Theresa Church before heading outside. It is a very special chapel above the city gate. Be quiet upon entering as this is one of the most sacred places in Lithuania.",
          "This is a small traditional and spiritual place to visit. It is a reserved place, so not touristy, but it something you must see when in Vilnius. It is a holy place , so go with these expectations and you will enjoy. I said my prayers, and felt good in doing so here.",
          "Few pictures are there; it could be seen while walking through the street; there is a gate, very old.",
          "Just people praying. the statues and pictures inside looks amazing, jet again there is nothing there to do. so check it out and leave right away. Google the history of it so you would understand the story behind it before you go.",
          "There was nothing here which seemed interesting. The place looked very secluded and completely empty which tells a lot.",
          "Part of the old city wall, it is a church on top of an arch. Walk through from the outside, it is much more impressive from the inside.",
          "Everytime I go to Vilnius I go and visit this little chapel, built inside one of the main gates of the old wall of the town. I like its silent, religious, traditional mood. It's located in one of the nicest areas of Vilnius historical areas. Beware: steep stairs.",
          "This Vilnius attraction. Is a church set on top of a wide arch which Vilnius is famous for. The altar can be viewed from the street and the painted brickwork has been well preserved",
          "One of the \"must sees\" in Vilnius. The gate is much more than a gate with a chapel, it's a shrine for millions of Catholic and Orthodox Christians from Baltic countries, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine alike. November 16th is the day when the icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary is",
          "A little hard to find at the top end of the old town and will come up on you by surprise. Later on in the day there are a few beggars in the arch way. They do not harass you and are not a problem",
          "The number one attraction for Vilnius so if you you are visiting this is the top attraction to see while in the town.",
          "The Gates of Dawn, right in the heart of Old Twon Vilnius, is an absolutely stunning place to visit, a place of extraordinary reverence and beauty. I found it deeply moving to see the passion and devotion of all the locals that were here to pray and seek solace. It was built in",
          "The Gates of Dawn are much more beautiful on the inside than the outside - we saw the outside from the hop on hop off bus and weren't too impressed - but to visit them on foot and walk through them is much better, they're beautifully decorated, the street leading up to them is",
          "The gates are the last remaining physical gate of the old city walls , the lead up to the gates , from the main road shows a painting on the whitewash of the gated upper wall The main street side , is where the entrance to the religious area exists , a bell tower , church and",
          "It\u00b4s been a sanctuary. People come here to pray and also to admire the beauty of the sacred pieces in bronze or another metal.",
          "The varied churches of Vilnius are a delight & brings home the spiritual & cultural richness of 17th century Vilnius - Gates of Dawn is not for fragile legs being up a steep staircase - but a very special place to worship & remember the miracles.",
          "For me, this is the main entrance to Vilnius Old city from the South. From the brick road to the Old structure, you could feel the ambiance of the past.",
          "At the end of the old city this tower pops up. Please check the entrance on the left in front of the port because here you can enter and walk the stairs to a tiny cathedral with golden and silver plagues. Really cool.",
          "Travelling from old town up a long windy cobbled street up to the Gates of dawn. Lovely setting and exit from/entrance to at the top of the hill.",
          "This is a breathtaking place of worship. Humple and peaceful. There are a few steps to climb in order to reach the chapel but I say many elderly locals doing it so all should be able to. I am not sure if there was a wheelchair access though. Regardless, a must if you are",
          "A must see in Vilnius. To watch the silver hearts and the holy place. And also to breathe the faith of the people praying here. Silence and admiration",
          "This is another one of the holy sites in Vilnius - the only remaining gate to the old town. The Black Madonna is located in the small room above the gate accessible from a side entrance via a set of stairs. Interesting to look at but not special. The place is very crowded with",
          "Gates of Dawn is beautiful. It is situated at Ausros vartu 12 at the upper part of the Old Town. Well worth a visit.",
          "The is located at the upper end of the old city it is located beside a beautiful church. It is inspiring to see devoted Catholics visit the shire and feel it's power. For non-Catholics, it is a beautiful cultural artwork.",
          "The only remaining original gate into the city. There is a chapel above the gate in remembrance of the Virgin Mary. Pretty unique and should be on everyone's itinerary if walking in the city.",
          "It's a beautiful place and very unusual \"street-church\" (church under the open sky), religiuos people believe in power of icon of St. Maria and come there to pray and ask for their wishes come true. When their wishes fulfil, they come back and leave a silver sign (heart, leg,",
          "A highly ornate altar to the Virgin Mary in an arch above the sole remaining gate to the city. Entrance is not obvious. It's down the hill to the left as you look up at the Madonna. Worth a visit for three reasons. To see the ornate altar itself. Because Pope John Paul visited",
          "One of our most memorable places in Vilnius, this Chapel is placed above the only survived gate from the original medieval city walls. It's in a small Chapel above the arched passageway and the entry is on a small left side door in the Old town side (before you enter the",
          "Of all the cathedrals and churches that I have been to in Europe, this probably ranks as one of the most solemn. Situated above the gate into Old Town Vilnius, the elevation underscores its sacred place in Lithuanian religion, history and culture. This also allows for a",
          "The place is considered to be magical. The Maddona is venerated and believed to answer sincere prayers by sometimes providing miraculous recoveries or other miracles. Pray sincerely and donate generously. :)",
          "We enjoy visiting the place and its a must in Vilnius. The Maddona is revered by the polish community and special traps are made to see her. We had a chance to hear a full mass and communion in Polish!",
          "Even if you are not a catholic or religious person, this is a must visit site. It is better to have a guided tour, but not mandatory - a quick check online will tell you enough info that you need to have before you're visit.",
          "My visit coincided with 9:00 am mass. Unique way to see this beautiful place of worship that has,been there for hundreds of years.",
          "Located at the entrance the old part of town, this small chapel should be on every visitor's list. Enter through the not-very-obvious door, turn right, walk up several stairs and then you're in the small chapel with beautiful wall decorations.",
          "Exciting historical place, full of mysticism and something calming. There is a very beautifully done sacred icon of Saint Mary. In which you can find silver hearts with writings on them. A lot of people visit this place to make their wishes come true. So check it out",
          "For the Christian believers the visit of this small church is a must: an impressive, holy icon of Virgin Mary is a major attraction, where many prayers bring positive answers.",
          "I basically stumbled on this place. It was almost closing, but I still went inside. I'm not religious, so the place says nothing to me, but you should go to the top and enjoy the view from the balcony, specially at sunset!",
          "The gates of dawn are the gates to Vilnius and is one of, if not thee most important places to worship. The entrance is by a door in the street bu you must be respectful here and be quiet as many locals will be here at all times of the day to pray. I didn't go up as I'm not that",
          "City gate of Vilnius and one of the most important religious, historical and cultural places. Built in beg of XVI centry as a part of defensive fortifications. The Chapel exhibits The Blessed Virgin Mary Mother of Mercy, said to have miraculous power.",
          "The entrance is a door in the street you go along a corridor then up the steps. You have to be quiet and respectful as people are praying. It is very ornate and golden.",
          "We saw it from below, tried to go up and see the Madonna up close but the line came almost to the bottom of the stairs. It wasn't worth it to us to wait to see what could be viewed on the street.",
          "So my review is going to DEFINITELY be biased, I'll admit. But I can really only write how I feel. The place is undoubtedly pretty and has a historical significance to the people of Vilnius. In fact, it pretty much is a must-visit. However, my own rather mixed experience left",
          "This is a very important land mark which if your in the capital you have to visit. It also leads on to the main town and the best of Vilnius.",
          "A fantastic entrance into the old town and the original gates into the walled city of Vilnius with local stores surrounding the gates",
          "The Gates of Dawn contain an icon of the Virgin Mary so it's revered by the locals and a popular tourist attraction too. We climbed the stairs (there's a door on the left before you reach the gate from the Old Town) and got a close-up glimpse before we had to make way for a",
          "I included a walk through this gate as part of my walk around of the Old Town. It is lit up in early morning and is quite the sight with the Virgin Mary shining.",
          "The gates of dawn are inside Vilnius old town. They are not that fascinating to overlook, however, their historical value is what makes them score full.",
          "Expected a spectacular gate and found quite an average gate, lots of history and reverence. Enjoyed it in the fresh morning air.",
          "This is a must see. To reach the gates you can have a nice little walk along a busy street of shops and cafes. You may also visit a range of beautiful churches along the way. When you reach the gates you can admire them from a far or climb up the stairs to see it up close.",
          "The attraction of the Gates of Dawn is its uniqueness in building the chapel into the south gate. When the religious ceremonial is being conducted, the passers through the gate can easily observe from the street level. We tried to enter to the chapel for better inside viewing",
          "Constructed between 1503 and 1522 as a city gate, this has become one of the most important historical, religious, and cultural monuments. It harbored a religious icon for pilgrimage members. It has also been known as the Medininkai Gate, as it led to the village Medininkai. Of",
          "I guess it might be interesting to religious people because it houses a holy picture of Mother Mary, but other than that it's really underwhelming. On the second hand, you won't waste much time getting there, so you can go and see it just as well",
          "This is something that I've never seen before, beautiful place, a must see, you can feel great energy at this place.",
          "As you walk up the street toward the Gate of Dawn, the first think you see is a glimpse of the exceptionally beautiful icon of the Virgin Mary in a chapel in the arch of the gate. You get to the chapel by climbing a staircase and find yourself in a small room, most likely",
          "You enter the old town through this vault, and on the other side you will find this open tower with praying people as long as it is open. The pope payed a visit here last time he was in Lithuania.",
          "You should walk through the one remaining gate to Vilnius at least once! This is a goog place to visit with the very interesting church next to the gate. You can explore the combined area on several levels and if you are in luch hear the early morning singing.",
          "It is the only remaining gate to Vilnius that is still standing, and that would be reason enough to visit (or at least to cross it). But then there is the Virgin icon, a rich masterpiece that can be seen from the street. No further description here - just visit.",
          "A must see spot, A priest friend of mine from Poland insisted I come here. You are amazed before you even go in by the view from the old street. At night you can see the image from a distance and it is beautiful. I was able to attend mass there and was delighted to do so.",
          "We visited the Gates of Dawn today and it was a special moment. I am at least slightly sceptic of so called holy places but even I felt some special energies here. Truly recommended to have a moment of silence here.",
          "while in Vilnus, you must enter and see this beautiful picture, that gate used to be a part of the city walls, if you want to go close to the altar, the doors are on the left when you look at the picture, small brown doors, then turn left, go up the stairs and then left. I'm",

          "Please find the time to visit this chapel, the gate is something really amazing to live. Enjoy the style and the beauty of the icon, respect the place and the people there for their prayers. There's not a lot of space around the chapel, so please wait for your moment in silence.",
          "The gate is the only one left of 9 that were once in the wall of this city,and one of the must see attractions of Vilnius. Various Popes and other dignitaries have visited the gate and chapel over the years. The chapel that houses the famous icon is easily reached by a flight",
          "It is a beautiful place to visit in Vilnius. A beautiful church and the sanctuary is really worth to visit. Take your time to appreciate the decoration and the majestic altar.",
          "This gorgeous gate/chapel is a short uphill walk from Town Hall. This a must while in Vilnius as it is one of the highlights of the historic core. The Silver and gold alter to Virgin Mary is striking in beauty. The downside is the hordes of tourists vying to get up and close",
          "This seemed to be a widely revered chapel built in what used to be one of the few remaining gates of the old city walls. Definitely worth seeing. Large number of religious pilgrims there. Their English speaking chaplain was very helpful.",
          "This gate is colorful and once served as one of the gates to the city. It's worth the walk up the hill. Very well done",
          "This is an absolutely beautiful restoration. This is part of the Old Town wall, and it's a gorgeous entry point for first time visitors like us!",
          "It's a \"must visit\", especially for religious people. Entrance is free of charge and also you can look down to the Old Town from there.",
          "The Gate is part of the original town defence. While most people visit from inside (old town side) consider going to the outside then enter. The difference between the two sides could not be so contrasted - from plain plaster fa\u00e7ade to a richly ornamented chapel and a view",
          "One of the best moments in Vilinius, seeing the black Madonna and having the luck that at 12.00 o' clock was a mess.",
          "We visited there during the morning hour and there were service going on, so we were able to inside, but could not take pictures. I would suggest going there in the late afternoon or bring really nice zoom lens.",
          "So touching to see pilgrims there at any time of day, worshipping and singing, their voices spreading down to the street below. The history and the beauty of this very special little chapel is fascinating.",
          "Worth seeing in Old Town. This visit will only take a few minutes as you pass through the only remaining city gate. Beautiful painting of the Virgin Mary sits above the gate.",
          "The Gate itself is historical but unremarkable until you go through it and turn around to see the Chapel above it with the 17th century painting the Vilnius Madonna. It is possible to go up into the chapel and see the painting up close but be very respectful as there are many",
          "Pilgrims come from far away to see this beautiful painting of the Virgin Mary, called the Madonna of Vilnius. Stunning picture in a very small chapel on top of one of the old city gates.",
          "It is not the most impressive city gate, but it is the last remaining one in Vilnius and the chapel that sits on the top of the arch is a unique sight",
          "Gates od Dawn is one of the most important landmarks of Vilnius. From the gate you can enter the Old Town of Vilnius but more importantly the Chapel in the Gate of Dawn contains an icon of The Blessed Virgin Mary Mother of Mercy with miraculous powers. The icon is worth of",
          "Made a pit stop at this spot to see for my own eyes the famous Gate of Dawn while touring around Vilnius old town. Very historical site and standing from the main road, you can see the chapel of Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn which is in the middle behind the glass window. In the",

          "We first saw the gate from the outside only. Be sure to see the inner side as that is far more impressive. We didn't tour but going through this beautiful gate will inspire you to imagine the Teutonic Knights thundering through it.",
          "\u2022 Exit the Old Town thru the impressive Gates of Dawn in Ausros Vartu st. where the chapel of the miracle working Madonna of Mercy is on view from the street and accessible to the public. Very busy when religious services are being held",
          "This is a gate, which when you walk through if you are coming from the old town, you can see how the entrance into the old town would have looked. The top of the gate is a church/chapel which you can get into. If you leave the gate behind you walking into the old town about 40m",
          "This was part of the original wall for Vilnius. From the outside, it doesn't look like anything special, but from the inside of the wall, it's ornate. There's also a kind of shrine if you walk upstairs.",
          "The place was full of Japanese tourists wanting to take pictures. It was a nice place but you might by Catholic to understand the hype about this place",
          "It is a gate and above a small chapel with painting of the Holy Mother. It is often a very crowded place because there are many pilgrims visiting this side. When there is no crowd it is great for refection and meditation.",
          "A quaint little church, up lots of steps, but very small. Interesting view from the window down the old street.",
          "Originally there were nine gates in the town's wall. Unfortunately Gate of Dawn is the only one remaining. Of course, we had to pay our respect to the black and gold \"miracle working\" Virgin Mary. Apparently she is one of the most important icon in Polish Catholicism and dates",
          "This isn't my idea of a good tourist thing to visit as only took a few seconds, I am sure others will appreciate just not me",
          "Visited this place several times, and I can definitely say it's worth a visit. A beautiful, exquisite, different church. Wonderfully decorated.",
          "A must for anyone travelling to Vilnius it was a very moving experience shared by others the highlight of our trip",
          "Nothing special - stayed for a quick photo but like the rest of the sites in the city - not very pretty or interesting. Not worth a special trip (although there isn't much in this city that would be worth it...)",

          "interesting place to visit for every catholic, lots of history and suspense in this place worth to visit",
          "This is the only of the five original medieval city gates still standing. The gate itself is interesting but the main sight is the chapel on top with a famous XVIII century painting of Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of Mercy that can be seen from the street in the old town side.",
          "This is the arch to access the historic town centre and above is a chapel with a huge golden madonna. The day we visited the street was densely packed for most of its length, with Polish people celebrating a Polish special day (not too sure what and why). But the window was open",
          "I wouldn't say it was a must see sight, but I would recommend entering the old town through this gate so you can tick it off the list. It's free and is a good way to lead into the old town streets.",

          "Completed in 1522, the site is still revered by both the Catholic and Orthodox faiths and the tiny chapel very much worth visiting",
          "As a world-famous pilgrimage spot alone this place is worth a visit. And it's not like you have to go out of the way, if you are visiting Vilnius's Old Town there's really no avoiding it :) The Gates of Dawn is the only gate that remains out of the original 10. Despite a",

          "This is a nice thing to have a look at. Might be pretty crowded at some times. Of course worth going up and seeing it from closer than just from the street.",
          "A very grand place where a great many people come to pay their respects, the artwork and grandeur inside is well worth going inside to see even for those less religious folks amongst us. Free entry, a donation is encouraged.",

          "A good place to aim for as an end to your Old City walk. A place of pilgrimage. Worth seeing from outside at night.",
          "Amazing icon of the Virgin Mary can be seen from the street but get closer to her and you will probably feel something quite special!",
          "As with the Basilican gate, this gate albeit a nice piece of architecture and also the chapel is a harbor for a nice icon, is good for a quick visit. The gate is historic as it dates back to the 16th century.",
          "This is a lovely religious site, which is located at one of the entrances to the old town. It was directly on our route in to the old town. The view from the street while religious ceremonies are taking place is particularly nice. There is not too much to see though and this",
          "I'm sure that this is important/meaningful for those who are religious but it inside there is a small shrine that could maybe hold a dozen people and looking up from the outside it's a nice picture.",
          "Climb the stairs (on the left and back a bit, when you're looking up at the chapel on the gate) for a quick look inside. People seem very devoted to the icon, and the cases of votive offerings from those who have sought and I suppose received assistance are interesting. Those",
          "This is a place of visit for many catholic worshipers, particularly Polish. The place was described in the famous Adam Mickiewicz's poems \"Pan Tadeusz\".",
          "A must-see in Vilnius and thus quite tourisity. However, the highly peculiar architecture and the devotion of th pilgrims will let you forget the tourists if you take your time.",
          "The chapel of the gate of Dawn preserves the painting of Holy Virgin Mary, the mother of Mercy.Undeniably an impressive sight.",
          "From the street it's just a plain arch when you get on the other side you have a beautiful ornate fascia with an amazing sight in the centre window .you can visit inside on certain times but we weren't able to but well worth a look.",
          "Architecture is nice and all those religious things kinda boring. So if you want to get a joint on Sunday (better choose Sunday) just kneel down for 5 minutes. Local and tourist prayers will manage some donation. So get you cash find some joint and relax in beautiful old town.",
          "Located in the old city. Its a famous and sacred place in Vilnius. One of the most visited by local people and tourists. It is one of the nine and the only remaining old city gates. The Chapel in the Gate of Dawn contains an icon of The Blessed Virgin Mary Mother of Mercy, said",
          "After we bought some post cards from him, the older gentleman was kind to pointed out to the gate, showing us the golden icon of Virgin Mary. You have silver hearts, many of the surrounding the icon. I saw only elderly female devoters. The view from above is nice and the icon is",
          "It was quite interesting to see, but I didn't find it as amazing as other people did. From outside, looking up at the beautiful gold picture it was great. Once inside I found the art work around the gold picture more intriguing. It was good enough to see if you're about the",
          "This is the entrance to the Old Town coming from the train and busstations. It has an interesting interior, the entrance is in the wall as you have passes the gate. A shop inside with religious articles.",
          "Not much to see here unless you are a religious person. Smelly beggars that usually hang around and mini market of tasteless religious odds and ends don't add much to the charm as well. Still might be worth a few steps if you find yourself at that part of the oldtown.",
          "There were nine city gates built as part of the city's fortifications in the 14th century. This is the only gate that remains. The chapel contains a painting of the blessed Virgin Mary, which is said to have miraculous powers. The painting itself is gorgeous. Definitely worth",
          "The Church is over the gate of Dawn - which is the last remaining ancient city gates of Vilnius. If You want to visit some of Vilnius churches this one most definitely should be on Your list. Pay attention to the small silver items puted there by People who are praying for a",
          "A gate to the City, which at the same time is an open air church. At Sunday morning you can be part of the official ceremony, just by walkie-talkie through the gate.",
          "I have never known there was such a belief in Christianity that you pray for your health and if you recover from your disease you give silver to church as a gift from yourself. It opens in early day and close as sunset.",
          "Although the painting is beautiful, it won't be too impressive unless you're religious, and believe in the painting's magic. If you're in Vilnius, you should check it out, since it won't be completely out of the way. Definitely do not come to Vilnius just to see it tho. Nice,",
          "This was something i did not expect, but was pleasantly surprised when witnessing this when accidentally strolling across it. Just go see it, to understand.",
          "Gates of dawn was built between 1503 and 1522 as a part of the town wall. This is the only gate remaining of the nine that was built. The others were torn down in the 1700's. It feels like stepping into another age when going through the gate - really a nice experience!",
          "Very taken with the icon, well worth a visit. The feeling of tranquility is unreal.Definately a must when visiting Vilnius",
          "We liked the chapel on top a lot. Many worshipers, special atmosphere, a lot of silver hearts. My Vilnius highlight",
          "This area is worthy a visit, closed to orthodox monk, catholic church, in the skirt of the old town. This icon of virgin Mary is in an old place of worship, the wooden room, the hearts for grace, the atmosphere, the stairs and the narrow corridors, baroque style.",
          "Well worth climbing the stairs to visit or even better to go to a Mass at the Gates of Dawn, it is a very spiritual place and to be treated with respect. Standing only for Mass so be prepared. There is also a very good gift shop at the Church that sells religious artefacts at",
          "It took me a while to find the door to go up to this tiny chapel due to roadworks. Quite a few steps to negotiate but worth it. This is a very holy place, there were several nuns praying here when we arrived and Pope John Paul prayed here too apparently. The gilded Virgin Mary",
          "a must visit when in Vilnius. make sure to have good time in hand to walk into the church and up the stairs to see the spectacular The Blessed Virgin Mary. leaving aside the religious significance of the church and the gates, one truly feels a sense if calm and humility.",
          "Walking through the Gates of Dawn into the city, one can really feel like a traveler from the middle ages. Then, finding the little door and walking down the long hallway and up the stairs to see the painting of the Virgin Mary is really moving. It is such a unique painting",
          "Climb the stairs and go into the chapel on the right to see the gilded portrait of Mary. Her face is black but the features are caucasian. People came to visit this picture which was associated with healing and miracles. My favorite painting in Vilnius",
          "A top sight in Vilnius and a sacred Icon that is probably the most holy in Vilnius. Its nice to visit whilst ambling around Vilnius.",
          "17th century painting of Virgin Mary important for Lithuanians and Poles. Almost certainly you will pass under the gate going to the old town. Door on the right (looking in the direction of the old town) lead up to the gate chapel.",
          "The place to visit the Cathedral of the impressive Black Madonna Gate of Dawn old town main Entrance",
          "It is a small chapel over the gate and as long as you realise that, you will not be disappointed. The painting is beautiful.",
          "To visit the Gates of Dawn Church is a wonderful experience. It means a steep flight of stairs to be climbed, but they are newish stairs, the old ones were very worn and a bit treacherous. The little oratory is a great place for prayer and pilgrimage, and always busy with people",
          "This chapel for the Virgin Mary is said to have inspired many miracles. It's small and there are lots of stairs to climb to access it. Pope John Paul II visited here. It's a very special place to Lithuanians.",
          "This is stunning, I've never seen a church in a city wall arch before. As there was a mass in progress, I didn't go up , but I got a lovely view from below. Quite beautiful",
          "After a 2 l/2 hour walking tour through Old Town, the Gates of Dawn awaited us. It was a spectacular entrance back into Old Town, but I am afraid I was so tired out that I missed the message of importance. I rested by leaning on a wall and simply took in the people and",
          "marks the entrance to the Vilnius Old Town. quite scenic. the line of shops starting from the gate of dawn towards the old town are pricey. the same stuff you can get for a better price down the road",
          "It was built in 16th century as a part of defensive fortifications for the city of Vilnius. Of the nine city gates, only the Gate of Dawn remains, while the others were destroyed by the order of the government at the end of the 18th century.",
          "Really unique place for sure! A gate over a street, where is a little but truly amazing chapel! Really worth to visit it!",
          "A must see!! I happened to be there while the priest was giving communion. It's a very beautiful tiny chapel.",
          "It's a church on the street, built over a city gate known as the Gate of Dawn. It is along a street full of churches.",
          "The gates of Dawn with the chapel of Our Lady in the old city is the last gate, remaining of 9 gates. This spot is simply a beautiful place to get back to when visiting the old city.",
          "If you are a Christian than have to visit this sacred place. It is must to visit point in Lithuania.",
          "Go and visit at night time. Really surreal experience. The lighting is superbly done . Makes a much bigger impression than during daytime",
          "We visited this on a Sunday so there was a service on but when we went in the alter and main area was spectacular to see.",
          "The gate of Dawn is awful, but if you are in Vilnius, you will surely go there because the city center is very very small",
          "after climbing those steepy steps, which look more difficult than they really are, look at the Madonna and also around at all the thankings she has received from all over the world.",
          "its a very nice Madonna but we couldn't take a good look at it since there was a polish ceremony going on. my partner was flattered since he's polish",
          "It's not understandable from outside - it's look like part of old cassual building. From the inner side of old town it's look pretty, but not more then it.",
          "The altar inside the gate is really beautifully decorated. It seems that many people come here to pray. Makes you feel humble even if you are not catholic.",
          "A rather unusual Catholic Church of the Mater Misericordia, built over a city gate known as the Gate of Dawn (Ausros Vartai). It is along a street full of churches. I happened to be there on Sunday morning and the choir was haunting! Worth a quick visit, especially on a Sunday.",
          "If a confessing Christian then a must see. It not, its average and like most religious relics but worth a visit. The area has numerous places to sit in the sun for a quieter place to eat than some of the more touristy places in the Old Town.",
          "This is another attraction that is most interesting when you visit from the outside. I.e. walk through it take pictures, but skip the trip up the stairs. People still worship here, so going up to the worship area to snap photos is kind of disrespectful.",
          "The devotion that I have seen on different tourist groups is unbelievable. You have to reach this chapel by steps and is very small. But the devotion and spiritual environment is unbelivable",
          "The Gates of Dawn is a lovely entry into the Old Town of Vilnius. The story behind it, very moving and the beauty of the chapel is not to be missed.",
          "It's very nice passing through this gate for a stroll into the Old Town. But, beware! Sometimes they are holding a church ceremony on the Balcony, and then there's a real big crowd. People singing and praying Catholic Verses... Nevertheless, this is the best way to enter Old",
          "I enjoy all religious art, churches, etc. This is a slightly different twist and those who like this sort of thing will enjoy the gates.",
          "There are some beautiful old places/buildings to swe here. We wandered around labyrinth streets and found the meat lovers pub, which isn't really a pub. These streets are very small so this place couldn't be bigger. Loads of photo opportunities!",
          "It's a very special and a very famouse icone in Christianity. So don\u2019t miss it! It looks wonderful when windows are open and sun rays light up the icon. Go inside, pray and ask in a hope that your wish become true. And it will be! I\u2019m sure.",
          "Discover the story of Barbara Radzivil before you go there. Come early, when there're not too many people, to feel how special this place is.",
          "The Gates of Dawn is basically an archway over the road with a shrine built on top. It is painted a nice shade of blue and is decorated with bright flowers, at this time of year at least. You can enter through an unobtrusive side door (on the left hand side as you look at the",
          "The only original gate still standing. What is spectacular ois not just the gate itself, but the view it affords of the neighbourhood, and the next door church.",
          "At the first look I wouldn't say it was a church, but in fact it is..... and for sure is the most different church I have ever been. It is small but very intense.....",
          "This is a very unusual church over the gates of dawn. If you are in Vilnius you should visit this tiny church. Almost all the walls are covered tin gold or silver.",
          "once through the gates is quite special once you avoid the many tours coming through, but little has been done to fix up or make the entrance to the other side inviting...quite rough and a bit depressing while there is a park on other side of street and opportunity for seating",
          "i was here a lot of times, its small churce but its very sweet and warm, also its very import place to religian peope from lithuania and polad. Also it is in old town, so you will find not far away much sweet restaurants \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",
          "Ausros Vartai, is a spiritually moving place. Perched atop of the the last remaining gates to the Vilnius Old Town, it is a must see",
          "See the inside and outside of the gates and spend some time walking around at your leisure inside the gates.",
          "Don't miss the short climb to the chapel. The portrait of the Virgin is surrounded by amazing silver ex-votos and it's a functional place of worship not just a museum...",
          "A small chapel with an impressive altar. However: extremly full with tourists and worshippers. Since it opens at 6 a.m. I would recommend coming here as early as possible. We were there at 9 a.m. and could hardly navigate anymore. The chapel offers very little space.",
          "The gate is very beautiful and rich and nicely decorated on one side and rather unimposing from the other.",
          "Ausros Vartai probably just looks like a little chapel above an archway, but it is one of the most important religious and historical locations in Vilnius. Even if you do not believe in the miracles, you can appreciate the beauty of the icon and the tributes and offerings that",
          "This is definitely not what I expected - it was really a show-stopper. From the street level it is grand, but worth the trip inside to see it up close and personal.",
          "Being able to look all round the gates and the chapels associated with them. The view down the main street is amazing.",
          "The most important place to see while staying in Vilnius. You can join a polish mass right there, view from balcony is on old town, for me amazing place.",
          "the whole old town in vilnius is quite small, and this prime tourist attraction is a little disappointing.",
          "The gilded painting of the Virgin is housed above this gate. Gato trough the gate into the city and turn around. Lots of amber shops along the street",
          "We didn't plant to go to there intentionally, but when we wandered around the old town, we came across this gate. This gate has very religious meanings. Even I am not christian, I could see the special feeling and imagine that the ancient peeps seriously believed the",
          "Ausros vartai, the Gate of Dawn, is he last remaining gate to the old town of Vilnius. From inside the city you will see the miraculous icon of our lady through the window from the street as you walk up. It is purposefully placed over the gate to protect the city and grant",
          "Gates of Dawn is one of the entrance of Villinus' old town. It is a part of city wall build in 1522. The small chapel is added in 1671 with the portrait of Virgin Mary. The portrait is plating with gold and silver like the style of Eastern Orthodox. Although the chapel is",
          "This is the only gate remaining of the fortifications of the old city. The chapel is above the gateway and the followers that pass through the gate still kiss the ground and cross themselves.",
          "We were staying just a few steps away from the gate.To pass it seemed to have some kind of symbolic meaning - people were ofte making the sign of the cross.",
          "Although the picture of Our Lady is visible from the street it is worth entering the church on the left and taking the stairs up to the right so that you find yourself in the room. It is also worth visiting in the evening to see it lit up.",
          "Of all the places of worship this was the smallest but most beautifully decorated. A single room above the last remaining gate to the city. The gate itself and the short portion of old city wall attached gives a flavour of what it would have been like.",
          "A must see as part of the walk around the old city. It must have been amazing when the whole wall was in place and this was one of the many gates into the city.",
          "Beautiful, take a look at night to see lit up. Beggars below (sadly.) A quick stop on your exploration of old town.",
          "I haven't seen the sacred place located over the street gates with a window behind never before. And the stairs with many moving (in squatting position) churchgoers haven't seen before too.",
          "Just walk around the streets of Vilnius. Without a map, without a gps. And yeah.. You can find such a beauty. The black Virgin Mary is a replica of the most important Polish religious painting, placed in the monastery of Czestochowa.",
          "Nice to have a few photographs taken at this site but nothing spectacular to see. We liked the shape of of the gates and the fading paintings on the arch.",
          "Wow. Went into the chapel with 8 others. All were quite as we looked around and said a prayer. The beauty of the chapel and the hearts on the walls are overwhelming.",
          "This fairly narrow archway is embedded in the old walls of the city fortification that now separates the Old and New Towns, and is the only one of the 9 original gates remaining. Facing the New Town, it looks fairly innocuous, pleasantly constructed, but of no great importance.",
          "Bit disappointed when we finally got up the hill to see this but plenty of other things to see on the way up",
          "The title is misleading as this is a chapel to the Virgin Mary over one of the gates to the old town. Do go in, but not with a large group. Climb the stairs and just sit to absorb the quiet. It was full of worship peers when we were there. Imoressive",
          "The chapel is unique in all meaning of the word. You can still see older women climbing the stairs at their knees - to suffer - all the way up. The chapel is small - but with a very rich decoration. Try to find the meaning of all the symbols. Remember to pay respect to the",
          "When visiting the historic Old Town of Vilnius one should definitely set aside time to visit the Gates of Dawn. I recommend visiting when Masses are not being held - so that one could feel the calm peacefulness of this sacred place. This is the perfect place for meditation and",
          "The Gate of Dawn is the last remaing part of Vilnius' city wall. Above the gateway, facing Vilnius' Old Town, is the famous and beautiful shrine to Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn. Originally placed above the gate as a means of protecting the city, it is today a special place of",
          "It is considered to be one of the most visited attractions of Vilnius but for of is not something special. I only recommend I visit just to see the real thing that you will see it in all magnets and mugs in souvenir shops otherwise doesn't count that much",
          "Depending where you hotel is, you will probably pass here on your trips. There isn't much special to see anymore, but the surrounding area makes it a nice sight.",
          "Interesting piece of religious building, with many visitors and easily located in the old town, worth a visit",
          "This is the place where the divine mercy image was unveiled for the first time. I am a great believer in divine mercy and this was one the reason why I went to visit this place . Very peaceful . The chapel is on the first floor and not much place to stand if you have many people",
          "Probably one of the best city entrances and exits I have been through. This leads into the old city, lots churches, bars, restaurants, shops and places to see etc. cobbled streets. There is a small bar cafe near to this entrance at Bazilijonu Gatve 6 which does very good home",
          "A lovely entrance into an entrancing city. Enter to cobbled streets, amber shops, cafes and restaurants and to a world of spires and domes amid lovely old buildings.",
          "One of attraction specially for Christians as they can pray infront of the Gates and read history on that. Souvenirs sells nearby.",
          "A pleasant way to enter the old town and a historical and religious monument. Worth visiting (make sure you look at both sides) though if you are on a tour your bus will probably drop you off here.",
          "Name sounds more romantic than it is. One way to get into old town. Nothing special, but usually tour buses will drop you off here",
          "Can be seen from 100 metres away. Very spectacular and majestic. You can get wry close to it and even smell it.",
          "This is the only remaining city gate in Vilnius, but it's much more than a gate. It houses a religious artifact, a representation of the Madonna that (like so many) is reputed to have miraculous powers. It's visible from the side of the gate within the city, in an archway over",
          "It's one of the sights in Vilnius but not much compared to the old gates of some other old cities. Notwithstanding what I said the Vilniusians are very proud of it.",
          "Anything with an antiquity is usually fascinating to me, but I hate to admit that I originally actually walked past the Gates. Whoops, if you're on a religious pilgrimage then this will probably be your Disneyland, if not, only worth a passing look.",
          "Probably one of the best visits in the Old Town. The history of the site is fascinating and it is worth reading about it to fully appreciate the significance of the site.",
          "We entered through this gate and our guide asked us not to turn around until he said so. As we turned around we where amazed of the beauty of the place.",
          "The only remaining gate of the old city, with religious images left pretty much in tact despite the soviet occupation of the city. Well worth a visit to the shrine of the virgin.",
          "I expected a bit more from the gate, but there wasn't much. It's a gate with a shrine. Historically important, but not a must visit in my opinion.",
          "For me this place was a main reason to visit Vilnius. I have heard and read about it before. I found what I expected but I was surprise it was empty on early evening - I have had a personal audience. This place is very connected with the history of the two nation country",
          "Really well done and beautiful to see from up close and from a distance. I liked that it is actually a functional place for worship for local people.",
          "Entry point to Vilnius Old Town and one of the highlights. This is the only remaining gateway left in the city walls and dates back to 1522. You can access the little chapel above the entrance through a door on your right. It is open from 6am. The image of the Madonna is very",
          "Worth going to see on southern border of old town. Impressive 16th century town gate constructed for defense .",
          "The icon of Mary in the chapel of the Gates of Dawn is exquisite, and the atmosphere in the chapel is almost sacred... very moving to see the earnestness and faith of the devotees. And after visiting the Chapel, don't miss the Orthodox Church next door that contains the",
          "the first stop you have to make in the old town of Vilnius. it's really amazing spot , and the only thing that can make it better is if you are with a guide which can tell you the story behind it",
          "An inspirational place though I would discourage giving money to beggars as it only encourages them and Vilnius has a very safe reputation at the moment. Visitors should not forget that its not a zoo and many people going there are doing so to pray and respectful silence should",
          "Interesting and beautiful. You will see it when you walk around in the old center. Don't forget to visit it!",
          "The Gates of Dawn are worth a stop in Old Town Vilnius. The door to the church is on the left side of the street before the actual gates; go inside and to the right for the stairs to the Madonna. It's a beautiful statue and a very peaceful room. On the way out, a woman was",
          "A boring looking piece of architecture with some religious iconography. Total waste of time. Dont know what the fuss is about.",
          "Very devotional, over decorated, very religious site that seems to be important to those who would do a pilgrimage. It does remain interesting to see the old gateway.",
          "A place of pilgrimage that must be experienced. When you look up just inside the Gates of Dawn and see the beautiful icon of the Madonna you will take a gasp and stop to drink it up.",
          "They have a small chapel above the gate, which might be interesting, but there was a Mass going on at the time we walked through the Gate. It is in a nice section of town, worth visiting.",
          "Wander through the last remaining gate into the city and then take a look into the chapel where the relief of the Virgin Mary sits. The marble steps are steep and take care. Remember also this is a place of worship - Pope John Paul II was here in 1993 also.",
          "Very lovely from the outside. Tried to go inside two times there is always a mass going on, thus only got to see it from far away. Must see if you are in Vilnius, plus there is a very old church nearby that is not renovated it is nice to check it out",
          "As the afternoon sun sank over the top of the Gates of Dawn, the gold and silver of the altar to the Blessed Virgin Mary shone through the windows drawing everyone into the chapel above the gate, a peaceful feeling indeed.",
          "Although the Gates of Dawn are interesting, the icon of Mary is the main item of interest. The chapel is small with no architecture to admire, the reason to visit is simply to view the icon.",
          "When visiting the old town Vilnius, the Gates of Dawn are a must see. The is a shrine to the Madonna that is covered in gold and is very beautiful.",
          "Take your time to visit this place inside. If you have enough time, visit this place during evening worship.",
          "Its a very nice place to visit. If you make a city tour you should see. To see that gate you have to walk through nice streets.",
          "Very beautiful gateway into the city. Well worth a visit. Not too busy at this time of year either.The interior is very impressive.",
          "In this city which has more than 30 churches, there is a small church , ducked in the centre of the gate at the top.",
          "Obvious from outside but little entrance door just inside Old Town not at all obvious but worth looking for and climbing steps inside to this place which has a special atmosphere and is very beautiful. On way out, step right into the church, which is also lovely, and again",
          "The church and its shrine are located at the top of a street that runs uphill through the old city centre. I saw pilgrims heading for the shrine climbing the stone staircase on their knees as a sign of humility. It is one of th oldest churches in the city and famed for the vast",
          "This sight is located in old town, near one of the gates on the exit from this central area. You just go through the gates, rise your head up, and see the icon of Maria and Jesus. If you are in the old town, you can see it, it is just 3 minutes walking by foot. But I was not",
          "went to see the gate--nothing too impressive. its fun just trying to find the gate / the icon is on the inner side.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Did\u017eiosios Kunigaik\u0161tyst\u0117s valdov\u0173 r\u016bmai Vilniaus \u017eemutin\u0117je pilyje; Polish: Zamek Dolny w Wilnie) is a palace in Vilnius, Lithuania. It was originally constructed in the 15th century for the rulers of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the future Kings of Poland. The palace, located in the lower castle of Vilnius, evolved over the years and prospered during the 16th and mid-17th centuries. For four centuries the palace was the political, administrative and cultural centre of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was demolished in 1801. Work on a new palace started in 2002 on the site of the original building and it took 16 years to complete it in 2018. The palace was rebuilt in Renaissance style to match the Cathedral of Vilnius and, according to the testimony of one of the couriers of Grand Duchess Bona Sforza, such initial reconstruction from 1520 to 1530 cost 100,000 gold ducats and was ordered by Grand Duke Sigismund I the Old. It is believed that the reconstruction was made for the proclamation ceremonies of Sigismund II Augustus, the only son of Sigismund I the Old, as the Grand Duke of Lithuania.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Grand Duchy of Lithuania ===\n\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries there were stone structures within the palace site; some archaeologists believe that a wooden palace stood there as well. The stone palace was built in the 15th century, apparently after a major fire in 1419. The existing stone buildings and defensive structures of the lower castle, which blocked the construction, were demolished. The palace was built in Gothic style. The keep of the upper castle, as well as the palace, were meant to host the coronation of Vytautas the Great. The Gothic palace had three wings; research suggests that it was a two-story building with a basement.Grand Duke Alexander Jagiellon, who later became King of Poland, moved his residence to the palace, where he met with ambassadors. He ordered the renovation of it. After his marriage to a daughter of Moscow's Grand Duke Ivan III, the royal couple lived and died in there.\nSigismund I the Old, after his ascension to the grand ducal throne, conducted his affairs in the palace as well as in Vilnius Cathedral. During the rule of Sigismund I the palace was greatly expanded to meet the new needs of the grand duke. Another wing was added, as well as a third floor, and the gardens were extended. By contemporary accounts the palace was worth 100,000 ducats. The palace reconstruction plan was probably prepared by the Italian architect Bartolomeo Berrecci da Pontassieve, who also designed several other projects in the Kingdom of Poland. In this palace Sigismund the Old welcomed an emissary from the Holy Roman Empire, who introduced Sigismund to Bona Sforza, his second wife, in 1517.\nSigismund's son Sigismund II Augustus was crowned Grand Duke of Lithuania in the palace. Sigismund II carried on with the development work and lived there with his first wife Elisabeth of Austria, daughter of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor. She was laid to rest in Vilnius Cathedral. Sigismund II's second wife, Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142, also lived in the palace. According to contemporary accounts of the Holy See's emissary, the palace at that time contained more treasures than the Vatican. Sigismund II also assembled one of the largest collection of books and tapestries in Europe.The palace was remodelled in the Renaissance style in the 16th century. The plan was prepared by several Italian architects, including Giovanni Cini da Siena, Bernardino de Gianotis Zanobi, and others. The palace was visited by Ippolito Aldobrandini, who later became Pope Clement VIII. Another major development took place during the reign of the House of Vasa. The palace was refurbished in the early Baroque style during the rule of Sigismund III Vasa. Matteo Castello, Giacopo Tencalla, and other artists participated in the 17th-century renovation.\nDuring the Vasa rule, several notable ceremonies took place, including the wedding of Duke John, who later became King John III of Sweden, and Sigismund Augustus' sister Catherine. The first opera in Lithuania was staged in the palace in 1634. Marco Scacchi and Virgilio Puccitelli were the opera's impresarios.\n\nAfter the Russian invasion in 1655, the state began to weaken, and that also affected the castle. In August 1655, Vilnius was captured by the Muscovite army. The Polish army recaptured the city six years later, by which time the palace had been destroyed by fire. The palace was greatly damaged and its treasures were plundered. After the recapture of the city of Vilnius in 1660\u20131661, the palace was no longer a suitable state residence, and stood abandoned for about 150 years. In the late 18th century, after the fall of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, several families lived in parts of the ruined palace. Soon after the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was incorporated into the Russian Empire, officials ordered the demolition of the remaining sections of the palace. The structure was almost completely demolished in 1801, the bricks and stones were sold, and the site was bowered.\n\n\n=== After demolition of the palace ===\n\nOnly a small portion of the walls up to the second floor in the eastern wing survived, that were sold to the Jewish merchant Abraham Schlossberg around 1800, who incorporated them into his house. After the November uprising of 1831, Schlossberg's house had been bought and taken over by Imperial Russian Army, which had presence in arsenals nearby. As Vilnius fortress was established, the building became part of the fortress, which by itself was surrounded by the ditch. The Schlossberg's house in 1840 Vilnius map is named as barracks (Polish: Koszary). By the end of 19th century the fortress' ditch on former palace's site was covered with soil and turned into the city's park.\nAfter Lithuania regained its independence following World War I in 1918, the Schlossberg's house became the headquarters of the army. It soon was captured by Polish troops following the Polish annexation of Vilnius. During World War II, it was the office of the German Wehrmacht, and after World War II it was used by Soviet security structures and later transformed into a Respublican Pioneers Palace. Pioneers' organisation vacated the building by the 1987. Archeological excavations started on the site, because Schlossberg's house was proposed for the People's Friendship Museum and for this conversion architectural investigation were needed to take place.\nSporadic archeological excavations took place already in 1964, when works for installation of central heating system in Schlossberg's house has been undertaken.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nAfter the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, Lithuania became independent again. In 1994 archeological excavations were put on hold due lack of funding. In 1994 Lithuanian Institute of History established Castles' Investigation Group that supervised archeological excavations. Schlossberg's house was used as Group's headquarters and housed collection of archaeological material found on the site.\nBy the end of 1980s archeological excavations covered more and more territory, exposure of excavated basements to environmental factors (e. g. weather) led to decay of the materials (in particular, wooden structures and bricks). To solve this problem, it was decided in 1988 to erect temporary buildings \u2013 greenhouses (also as known as \"hangars\" due to their brownish colour and shape of these buildings). By early 1990s three options of palace site's future were circulating in the public. First option was about covering excavated basements of the palace with soil, but it was deemed to be uneconomical option. Second option was about erecting purpose-built building on palace's site to conserve the ruins, but opponents of this option noted possible visual pollution to the Vilnius Old Town (as it was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1994). Third option was about constructing building similar to the original building. Latter option received most attention from politicians and lobbied by President of Lithuania Algirdas Brazauskas. In 1993 architectural design competition was held and out of seven projects Rimas Grigas' design won the competition.By the first half of 1990s, function of the palace in the future was raised. Initially, palace was proposed as future Presidential Palace, but Artists' Palace had been used for that function instead. By the end of the decade, Kazys Napoleonas Kitkauskas suggested to use palace as the National Gallery of Art (building of former Museum of Revolution has been used instead since 2009). In 1999 Lithuanian Art Museum stated that palace's building will be used as residential palace museum.As part of a programme of nation-building, the Seimas in 2000 passed legislation to reconstruct the palace. Ground was broken in summer of 2002 on the southern part of the site of the original building. By year 2002\u20132004 and 2005\u20132006 the palace's project was changed mainly due to archeological findings found on the site and discussions about Schlossberg's house architectural value. Fragments of Schlossberg's house became part of the eastern wing of the restored palace. The building (and museum that was planned to own the building) was partially opened during the celebration of the millennium of the name of Lithuania in summer of 2009, although it was not yet fully completed due to the lack of funding. By the end of July 2009, construction work resumed and the building again became inaccessible for the public.\nSeveral historians who were against the reconstruction provided many arguments for why the reconstruction of the palace was unnecessary. It was argued that the newly built palace would destroy the urban landscape formed over the last 300 years. Vilnius Cathedral would be overshadowed by the palace, and the Gediminas' Tower would not be visible from the side of the cathedral. Also it was noted that materials and technologies unknown at the time of original construction (e. g. reinforced concrete) have been used. Also the reconstruction was financed by the state, while many authentic historic buildings (mainly manor houses) are in critical condition.On 6 July 2013, the part of the palace known as Bloc A was officially opened to the public, 760 years after the coronation of Mindaugas. From 2014 to 2018 the part of the palace known as Bloc B was under construction. The Bloc B and museum building as a whole opened on the 6 July 2018.\n\n\n=== Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013 ===\n\nDuring Lithuania's presidency of the Council of the European Union, the palace was used as one of the main venues for the meetings of heads of European countries. On 28 November 2013, during the Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius, a dinner was held in the palace with many guests, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel; British Prime Minister David Cameron; French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande; Polish President Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski; European Council President Herman Van Rompuy; European Commission President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso; European Parliament President Martin Schulz; European Commission Vice-President and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Baroness Catherine Ashton; Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy \u0160tefan F\u00fcle; Commissioner for Trade Karel De Gucht; the presidents of Latvia, Cyprus, Romania and Slovakia; the Prime Ministers of Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Italy, Croatia, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, Hungary and Spain; as well as other high-ranking officials. Countries participating in the Eastern Partnership programme was represented at the summit by Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Georgian President Giorgi Margvelashvili, Moldovan Prime Minister Iurie Leanc\u0103, and Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania\nLithuanian Ducal Palace\nRestoration of Royal Palace\n(in Lithuanian) Fund Supporting Royal Palace\nThe Association of Castles and Museums around the Baltic Sea",

          "Just visited this place August 25th and was really impressed. The museum had 4 main exhibits. 1,2,3 consisted with all things Lithuanian. And exhibit 4 was about the relationship between Florence and The grand duchy throughout the renaissance. The museum was unique since",
          "I only had two hours to spend here. I chose Exhibits I and II on the architecture, history, and lifestyle habits here. Very oddly, tickets were split up by which exhibits and the tower the museum-goer wanted to visit. It reminded me of cable packages or flights these days- pay",

          "The best part for me was the Tower, as the views are very pretty (and no one else was up there, so we got some good pictures). We went through pretty quickly, and it's very inexpensive, so worth a quick visit. If you are really into history, it would take a while to read",
          "The Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania is now a sparkling museum, built over the ruble and walls of the many former buildings on the site. The reconstruction is of a very high standard, and there is a vast array of information presented for the visitor to tell the story of",

          "Good place to spend a couple of hours when looking for an indoor attraction. Very cheap entrance fee and there is plenty to look round, however we slightly felt like we were being chased round with staff locking doors behind us the moment we left a room, there was still 20 mins",
          "Worth a visit, interesting exhibits. Has clearly had a lot of money spent on it. Only about 3 euros for an adult ticket.",
          "If you are in Vilnius and have no special plans this place is for you, good destination close to the Old Town, if you are lucky some local exhibitions take place.",
          "This museum is definitely a go if you like to know more of the (royal) history of Lithuania. The first part (or tour) exists of historically delved walls from previous castles found underneath this palace and tells the history of the country in accordance to the time the castle",
          "Spent a few hours here whilst in Vilnius. The museum has not been open for long so is very modern. There is lots of Lithuanian history with some exhibitions of Italian art. Worth a visit, especially as its only 2.50 euros each for entrance",
          "I had a couple of hours to see Vilnius before my flight home. I stopped by the palace and when through the museum. This a a replica of the original palace - apparently when it opened a couple of years ago, the locals were upset that the money was spent on this museum and there",
          "The museum acts more like a long history lecture. It is very detailed and the signs reads you through the whole details of the Lithuania's history. Nice for a history lover for sure.",
          "To be honest, this place is only really going to appeal to a) hardcore museum goers and b) serious lovers of Lithuanian history. I think I can claim to be in the former group, and was willing to try to be part of the latter, but this museum was just too much. It starts",
          "This is one of the main attractions in Vilnius. There is a museum under the basement. The Gediminous tower is just beside this one.",
          "You can spend hours reading the detailed sign-boards (as I did) as they do a great job cataloguing Lithuania's history through to the mid 1600s. If you're more interested in an \"authentic palace\" then this place isn't as likely to be of interest.",
          "If you are interested in history but don't know much about Lithuania's past, this is a great place to visit. The museum is extremely well laid out and very interesting. I spent over an hour exploring everything!",
          "This place is wonderful. I had a very limited knowledge about Lithuania's history as most of it was recent knowledge (soviet rule) however this goes right back to ancient times and it's like you are following a timeline around the museum with wonderful information and artefacts",
          "It's three or four floor building with reconstructed interior of dukes of Lithuania. Also, in the ground floor there are panels with excellent presentation of Lithuanian history: relatively short but give the main and picturable informations. The upper floors are amazing!",
          "Great way to kill an hour or so. You follow the route through the museum following the history of the influential Grand Dukes of Lithuania. Each piece of info is in English as well so it's easy to follow. As well as the written history there are ruins inside the palace as you",
          "I am historian so my review is specific. I hare reconstructions. But when I visited palace my opinions changed... a little bit. Good place to come with children ad historic Disneyland is better than just Disneyland",
          "I was enthralled by this Palace/Museum. Not just an history through the annals of Lithuanian royalty but a fascinating insight into the life and times and tribulations of Vilnius and its peoples. All set in an remarkable modern concept to be enjoyed by all ages.",
          "Rebuilt according to some estampe available, the Grand Dukes Palace is both an architecture stuff to see and a museum to visit. It's also possible to rent it to organise gala and concerts. An impressive place to see.",
          "The new museum/exhibition is very interesting and extensive. This is one of the most interesting sights in Vilnius.",
          "and it was absolutely worth it! Now i wait for an opening of the full exposition. Though without the guided tour you will probably loose half of all fun. The price is not much higher, so make sure to prebook the guided tour in advance via their site and arrive right on time;)",
          "Took parents to visit this museum. It is very well created museum, tidy, well organised (wondering how much did it cost:)). It has 4 floors, which are very big (looks like too much wasted space), so it takes long time to go thru all of them. In order to leave the museum, you",
          "We wandered round this renovated palace and were pleasantly surprised by the exhibits and the many detailed posters in English. The museum is well laid out with plenty of exhibits. You start out in the basement looking at the structure of the ancient building and then gradually",
          "The original building was destroyed in the war and by the Soviets. It has recently opened after a major renovation (which is still ongoing) and is really quite impressive. It begins with the basement level and the remains of the foundations of the palace with very clear",
          "I've been there two times - once without guide another - with. And definitely, if you want to hear stories about dukes and to be impressed take a guided tour. You'll never regret. Just visiting a museum is good only if you are good at history of Lithuania by yourself.",
          "This is a modern museum and has lots of artefacts, well presented, with plenty of information boards in Lithuanian and English. It chronicles Lithuanian history through the Grand Dukes. One of the best museums we visited in Vilnius.",
          "The white Palace of the Grand Dukes is an attractive, impressive reconstruction of the original medieval r\u016bmai. The Palace was part of the early lower castle & had an integral connexion with Poland. During the era of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth it was the centre of",
          "Worth visiting-good tour through Lithuanian history. Guided tours recommended, possible to combine with tours to vaults of cathedral and belfry.",
          "It's a really new building that was built on top of the ruins of the castles that once stood there. The building was really impressive and the museum was extremely informative, but only up to a certain point. It's rather esoteric as it focuses extensively around the time",
          "The (reconstructed) building that houses the Lithuanian National Museum is impressive, but we felt that the museum was disappointing on the whole. Artefacts were loosely curated: there were too many that were similar and would have been more in place in an archaeological museum",
          "In a few years, this will be a worthwhile museum. For now, it is best regarded as a very interesting project in progress. The original palace was destroyed in Czarist times, neglected and hidden in Soviet times. It is now restored as a modern copy with meeting rooms, catering",
          "Well, first of course everyone expects old remnants of something huge or to see something old in there. Well, there is expositions, but only a few blocks of old castle is at the bottom of palace. Everything is newly rebuilt. Although, it is never too much to see new things and",
          "A rebuilt palace. Actually is just a piece of the original palace. Not very interesting. There's a museum but we didn't enter",
          "The palace has been completely reconstructed and opened in 2013 after it was destroyed in the 17tn century. The visit starts with the foundations of the palace, which in my view is of little interest. The upper floors are spartiate with furniture, carpets and paintings",
          "I visited this museum to learn more about history of Vilnius and Lithuania. The museum did not disappoint at all. The entire museum is designed in a modern way and provides an exhibition which offers a lot to see and read. In case you want to read everything, it may take a",
          "A real jewel. A modern, stylish and user-friendly museum. The only remark I could make is about dimensions: it is huge! It takes a long time to visit it all, and I only had a couple of hours, so I lost many details. There are special accesses for disabled people, a large",
          "We didn't go inside, but the outside is quite impressive. The square in front of it has been kept clear, so it makes a good photo.",
          "This is a must for tourists to understand Lithuanian history and culture.You need to spend time here.If you have time the time spend is worth.",
          "This is a really well laid out museum lots of stuff to see, but too much to read. One of those places you read the info and instantly forget it again, but I guess most museums are like that. It is a very nice place to visit especially as it was +30 degrees outside. There are",
          "I'm really interested in history so this was a must see in Vilnius. Extensive exhibitions of the country's past with lots of archaeological finds on display. The special little \"touch and play\" areas for kids scattered throughout was a nice touch.",
          "This may or may not be a place for you, but it was so well done. The exhibits and the easy to read / follow history lessons in the wall made it fascinating. From 12th century lithuania until today, it provided a great overview. Worthwhile.",
          "What has been built, is an archetypal pornographic mess. Never in the history of Vilnius, had the Palace and the Cathedral stood side by side, and what has been built, maybe, could of, may well have been something like what may have been there potentially... yuck",
          "This is a great place to get to know something about the names seen on streets such as Gedimina, Mindaugo etc. The exhibits are in English and Lithuanian and most informative. Your strolls through Vilnius will make more sense after the visit. My senior admission was only 87",
          "A little of this and a little of that - enjoyed this museum. From national costumes to crosses and wood carvings. It was about 2 euros for entry and worth the price and with English titles along with the native language it was very helpful overview.",
          "The building is a reconstruction of the palace that was originally constructed in the 15th century. If you are interested in the actual ruins, then you will enjoy the brick walls, ceramic fragments, bits of jewelry and armor. If you would like to see how it looked to the royalty",
          "I'm not sure if this copy is good. As far as Cathedral is a must visit, definitely it won't do a harm if you go to Grand Dukes Palace. If you are into museums better go to the old one (not far from the Cathedral closer to the river Neris). Somehow interior did not make the",

          "The museum steps you through the history of Lithuania from Medieval times. Interesting to discover the influence this country once had within Europe and the waxing and waning fortunes of its Grand Dukes. Rather beautiful castle in a simple style.",

          "The Grand Ducal Palace is more of a reconstruction than a restoration, but provides a fascinating insight to the history of both the nation of Lithuania and the castle complex. The tour starts underground in the excavated ruins of the original building and covers the history",
          "A friend gave us a special treat, arranging a tour with an English-speaking guide for us and his family of four (two of whom don't speak English). We were there for two hours and feel like we need to go back again! The museum is covers four different levels: a lower level that",
          "Wonderful plan to rebuild the palace as it should have been in the past. A great possibility to study in reality the history of this baltic country. Also super cheap as for the ticket.",
          "Went to the museum with a lot of expectations. The History of Lithuania has been portrayed across the museum, but quite sparsely. The Audio Guides are too elaborate and should be in sync along with walking speed with a short time at all the points of stoppage. Definitely",
          "This is palace was opened to the public in 2009 to celebrate millennium from Lithuania being mentioned in written sources (The Annals Quedlinburgenses). The reconstruction work was started in 2002, and some work is still ongoing (parts of the palace have not been opened yet).",
          "There isn't much I can say without sounding like I'm bragging. As a guest of the city and hosted at a sumptuous dinner with traditional entertainment and a guided tour of the museum, the treatment doesn't get better than this and neither does the experience. Greeted by guards",
          "Particularly enjoyed the exhibition of paintings by Romualdo Silinsko. A coffee shop would have been good - nothing available. NB it's very warm inside so if you are visiting in winter there is a cloakroom to the right as you enter to leave your outer clothing - we didn't",
          "Well laid out museum,they even check your coats in. The ground floors give thehistory of the buildings and the upper floorsalthkugh pretty much a recreation arevery well done. They have spent their money well on this project. The entrance fee for a senior and one adult was",

          "Visit Grand Dukes palace and you'll be surprised by the richness of Lithuanian history starting from 13th century when first brick castle was built here until 16th - 17th centuries - flourishing period of Lithuania. One of the most interesting museums in Lithuania and for sure",
          "Great place to touch and understand Lithuanian history, to see all the authentic things as well as artistic impressions of what life could have been hundreds of years ago. Lots and lots of information, for someone interested to read it all a day spent there could be too short. I",
          "This is one of the places that is worth to visit if you are in Vilnius. I now relate Vilnius excatly with this place.",
          "The lower floor/basement comprised the excavated old foundations of the palace viewed from elevated walkways, and a lot of information boards - in English. The upper floors had more recent displays with furniture etc. A couple of hours minimum needed to see anything worthwhile.",
          "As a Lithuanian, I have a bit of an issue with the building itself. It's exterior adornment is at best an educated guess as little in the way of drawings of the original exist. Building this new museum on the foundation of the actual \"palace\" means future study of the foundation",
          "this is a new museum that deserves a serious attention. An excellent blend of ancient artifacts and modern restoration. we paid extra for an English speaking tour guide and found it well worth the expense (you need to book personal tours in advance.) The Museum really makes",
          "This museum is only a year or so old and has been extremely well created in the area of the lower castle. Bilingual descriptions of the rulers of Lithuania ( and Poland) over the past 600 years were well presented and gave this reviewer a much clearer idea of the history of",
          "Perfect reconstruction work done for the Palace, very nice way to present the history of Grand Duchy Lithuania, while a bit pretentious form the \"historical truth\" side",
          "This museum was really magnificently renovated and contained far more objects than expected. It shows the history of Lithuania (and the old Lithuania empire) in a very structural way. Especially the ruins in the basement are impressing, while also the rooms upstairs look nice.",
          "Very lavish and instructive museum with a senior discount. You will learn that Lithuania once was a great power stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea.",
          "It was a very enjoyable excursion. A friend works there so we got a tour for free. It covers all the history of Lithuania in one trip. The ruins were very cool to see and the reconstruction was neat. It wasn't finished yet and we only got to see about half the building, but i'm",
          "This reconstructed palace is well worth a visit. Painstakingly recreated and almost empty, the palace does a great job of explaining Ancient Lithuanian history in elaborate detail-maybe too much detail! The spacious rooms are well decorated with authentic furnishings and the air",
          "Very nice walkthrough across eras and domains and dominations, with several links to many European royal families, kingdoms, and trades.",
          "Just kind of happened upon the Palace of the Grand Dukes while walking around Vilnius and ended up spending several hours there. The basement of the palace is opened up in a well laid out path to show the foundations of the medieval fortress on the same site and includes tons",
          "We stumbled upon this fantastic museum quite by accident, as it is relatively new and our Lithuanian host had never visited. The museum is very well laid out, the displays are well lit, with text in English as well as Lithuanian. And it is an amazing introduction to the rich",
          "It is very nice to have this place in Vilnius, quite new, so good for repeating visitors to see something new! Impresive exposition, friendly staff, ideally located just behind the Cathedral. Cosy and full of books and souvenirs nice small shop in front of ticket office. Highle",

          "This was one of the highlights of our trip to Lithuania. The museum only opened in July 2013 so everything is still very new. The very low entrance fee is excellent value - I really don't know how they do it! We thought we would kill an hour there - but were there for a whole",

          "I visited the Palace since CONVENE, a MICE trade fair was being organised in Vilnius and the local mayor was hosting a cocktail reception at this spectacular venue. Apparently it took years and loads of money to restore this beautiful Palace but it looks like it was worth it.",
          "Newly opened but already famous enough. Plan your time wisely - go early morning and, if possible, not during weekend. We've been there on Sunday and must say it was hard to see everything cuz of huge crowd of people everywhere. We were waiting for our turn to see an excibition.",

          "Not such a good experience. Bought tickets at 3pm At 3.25pm a security guard started chasing us out, saying we can come back tomorrow. Point is, we cannot. Wish I was told I would not have the time to see Exhibits 1 and 2 or listen to my audio guide. Rushed, rushed, rushed.... 3 stars for the exhibit Zero for that security guard",
          "A great visit!!! This museum is an amazing place:you have a small restaurant, can literally breath history and get to know the most important things about the Lithuanian history. Very unusual and modern, recommend!",

          "Excellent in depth musuem on the history of Lithuania, with all modern amenities and exhibits, built into the historical foundations. Disabled access to most areas. You have option of buying access to the whole musuem, or just specific sections. Was really one of the best museums I've seen, that focuses on national history.",
          "It is the best museum if you want to learn about history of Lithuania!\nTry to get a guided tour as there are a lot of information and it is easy to get overwhelmed.\nIt will take the most of the day to see whole palace and it's exhibits.",

          "Nice nad very intresting.",
          "Desperately recommend a tour. It's the only way to consumed this museum without getting overwhelmed I think.\n\nDespite me trying to rush through this museum, it took me probably 3 hours... It's big :)\n\nAlso, it can be a bit messy to navigate \u2026",

          "Cool museum with lots of Lithuanian history.  There are several tours available, so you can piece together your own experience here, and I appreciated that the signs and descriptions all included some English.  One tour contains more history and architecture, and the other visits many of the ceremonial halls.  Well worth seeing.",
          "Nice to see an one of the must see places\nhowever nothing spectacular. View / Panorama of the city from the top was beautiful.",
          "The museum is interesting and perfectly organised. I chose routes 2 and 3. The route 3 was very small and i found interest only in some information about the evolution of music. Route 2 is much more longer and better, showing the rooms \u2026",

          "Very nice place, must see if you ever visit Vilnius.",
          "Interesting Museum that tells the story of the Lithuanian rulers and their Vilnius castle. Museum has 4 tours, we went on 1 and 2 that show the rulers private rooms and the archaeology/history of the castle. Tours are very reasonably priced \u2026",

          "Everytime the best content and educational activities :)",
          "Amazing restored palace. The underground route is very nice. It was just 3.50 when we visited, so definitely great value for money. It\u2019s worth it to take the 1 euro audio tour, since there is a lot of reading. The VR experience of the history of the palace was the best part of my visit.",

The only thing is you still realize that you in a new building when you walk through but I guess there are no other way to do this. I will still recommend this to anyone.",
          "Nice, but the way that Polish-Lithuanian shared history is presented is just bit comical. Lithuanians gave Poland their rulers and many noble families which wielded power in Commonwelth. Poland shed a lot of blood fighting wars in the east \u2026",
          "very well done museum, easy to spend a long time learning about Lithuanian history. Would recommend to allow at least 2.5 hours for a visit, but could easily spend half a day there",
          "Did not find that interesting",
          "Interesting historical place of Lithuania. Many exiting old things- clothes, money, thrones, crowns and many more. Worth the price. Gonna spend couple hours exploring everything. Better take a guide he tells you thrilling history of the country's rich people life.",

          "The museum was good.  There was A LOT of information there - way more text (paragraphs and paragraphs) than there was actual items, and so it can be difficult to get through the whole thing.  I would definitely recommend the VR as that really explains the whole scope of things before you embark on the museum.",

          "It is a nice place, however you need a lot of time to check all the information and history. The ruins underneath are amazing though",
          "Best place I've seen in Vilnius considering that the adjacent cathedral is not much to see and, unlikely, the upper castle and tower of Gediminas was close to renovation.\nStarting from the medieval basement you'll be on a journey through \u2026",
          "We weren't told most of the exhibition was closed until after having bought tickets and trying to find the closed part...",
          "I despise the whole idea of this palace. Does not add any cultural credit to the Lithuanian heritage. You might find the escavation interesting, but bear in mind that the palace was completed after year 2000. Some cultural exbitions were present, like clothes and weapons from 13 century.",

          "Very beautiful place. Lots of history and good value.",
          "I recommend to visit only 1st and 2nd tours in this museum. 3rd and 4th might not worth it, there is not much guns in 3rd tour. 4th tour is exhibition, which might change from time to time.",

          "Nice place to visit while in the city",
          "Beautiful museum. Progresses from the excavated ruins and artifacts found in them through the history of Lithuania. Everything is very well presented in an interesting mix of relics and printed history (in English as well). Audio guide can be a bit verbose but gives good accompanying information. Well worth the 3 euro entrance fee!",

        "wiki": "Three Crosses (Lithuanian: Trys kry\u017eiai, Polish: G\u00f3ra Trzykrzyska) is a prominent monument in Vilnius, Lithuania, on the Hill of Three Crosses, originally known as the Bald Hill (Lithuanian: Plikasis kalnas), in Kalnai Park. According to a legend, seven Franciscan friars were beheaded on top of this hill. Wooden crosses were built in the location since the early 17th century. It soon became a symbol of the city and an integral part of the city's skyline. As wood rots, the crosses needed to be periodically replaced. In 1916, a concrete monument was designed by Polish\u2013Lithuanian architect and sculptor Antoni Wiwulski or Antanas Vivulskis in Lithuanian. It was torn down in 1950 by order of the Soviet authorities. A new monument designed by Henrikas \u0160ilgalis was erected in its place in 1989. The monument was depicted on 50 litas banknote. A spectacular panorama of the Vilnius Old Town can be observed from a small observation deck at the base of the crosses.\n\n\n== Legend ==\n\nAccording to the Bychowiec Chronicle, fourteen Franciscan friars were invited to Vilnius from Podolia by Petras Go\u0161tautas. The friars publicly preached the gospel and badmouthed Lithuanian gods. Angered city residents burned the monastery and killed all fourteen friars. Seven of them were beheaded on the Bleak Hill; the other seven were crucified and thrown into the Neris or Vilnia River. Historians debate the factual accuracy of the story. It could be an embellishment of a story from Chronica XXIV Generalium about two Franciscans murdered around 1340. It could also be an embellishment of a story from De Conformitate Vitae B. P. Francisco by Bartholomew Rinonico about five Franciscans martyrs. If the latter is the case, the event most likely occurred in 1369.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nRegardless of whether the legend about the Franciscan martyrs is true or not, their story spread from the early 16th century. The original wooden Three Crosses were built on the Bleak Hill, the place where seven friars were beheaded, sometime before 1649. That is the year when the crosses were depicted in a panegyric to Bishop Jerzy Tyszkiewicz. Around the same time Tyszkiewicz began a case to canonize the fourteen friars. There is some evidence that the crosses were built before 1636 as, according to Jan Nepomucen Fija\u0142ek, the crosses were also depicted on two silver portraits of St. Casimir that were made in 1636 and hung in Vilnius Cathedral. However, the portraits did not survive and Fija\u0142ek's claim cannot be verified.\nThe wooden crosses collapsed in 1869 and Tsarist authorities did not allow to rebuild them. The new monument from reinforced concrete designed by Antoni Wiwulski was erected in August 1916, while Vilnius was occupied by the Germans during World War I. The monument was demolished by Soviet authorities on May 30, 1950. Residents of Vilnius wanted them restored. During the Lithuanian independence movement, the monument was rebuilt on the old foundations according to the project of sculptor Henrikas \u0160ilgalis. The monument was unveiled on 14 June 1989. The rebuilt crosses now are 1.8 metres (5 ft 11 in) higher than those of 1916. Broken pieces of the old monument can be seen several meters below the rebuilt monument.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHill of Crosses\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Nice place for little break from noise from the city. Nice views, great place for good photos and for little walk.",
          "If you are after city view then this is worth the climb very steep as others have said but well worth the effort. Thoroughly enjoyed this city and this was just one of the many reasons why.",
          "It\u2019s quite a steep walk up the hill but it\u2019s worth it for the great view of Vilnius. Everywhere in Vilnius there is evidence of the past destruction carried out by the Nazis and the Soviets. The Hill of Three Crosses is no exception.",
          "Interesting spot to view the city from, and a very historical one too, although there are few remnants now. Steps down in front of the monument to the river are not very nice.",
          "Walked up to the Hill of Three Crosses on a clear morning. Used the stairs instead of the easier pavement. It was worth the extra effort. The view was gorgeous.",
          "We walked up the many steps from the river side, some of the steps a bit wobbly. Great view over the old town from the top. interesting plaque at the top explaining the history of the 3 crosses, we walked down a steep path with just a few steps that came down between the 3",
          "It was cold and windy, but you were rewarded with a great view of the city and close up of the crosses We arrived as the sun was setting, so it looked magical. It can be a tough walk for some, esp with mobility problems. Please note there are several steps to the crosses,",
          "The hill of three crosses can be reached from Gediminas Tower within 5 minutes on foot. It offers a great view of southwest Vilnius and doesn't cost you a penny.",
          "There are wooden stairs that you can use, no handrails, to get you to the top. Great views of the old town. We were told by a local there is another way up but got the impression that it was harder.",
          "We rambled up the hill, and whilst this took time, it was worthwhile. The views of Lithuania\u2019s capital are excellent. The monument itself is symbolic of the city and carries with it a legend of executed Franciscan friars. It is visible from Vilnius Square.",
          "My wife and I walks a lot, especially when we travel to new cities. The hotel where we were staying told us about the Hill of Three Crosses. It was about 45 minutes walk when we arrived at the parking area and then people get out of coaches or cars and start going up the first",
          "The memorial itself is simple and a worthy tribute the suffering of Christians over the years. There is a little information around the site explaining their meaning, but I suspect most people visit for the views of old town. We took the hard way up the wooden steps from the",
          "An experience to see such a multitude of crosses in various sizes. Suitable for low physical activity, with small steps on a gradual slope.",
          "We walked up to the three crosses which is definitely something to see. But knowing the full story is what is really important. The original crosses were put up I think around 1918. Then in 1950, I think the crosses were blown up by the Soviets. In 1989, the new crosses were",
          "Great view from there. Make walk if you can. Not to difficult. Great day or night. Explore stadium and more hiking through forest.",
          "This hill is located next to Gediminas Castle. The prominent three white crosses are overlooking the Old Town. The monument has changed many times. The present monument was built in 1989 to replace the one that was destroyed under Soviet rule.",
          "There are two routes to the summit of the hill, one is steeper than the other with over 200 wooden steps which are a bit rickety in places. Not for the unfit! However if you were to choose the more gentle route it is worth doing the round trip through the forest park, coming",
          "I would say this ''attraction'' is nothing special. But, if you would like to enjoy a view over the city for no additional charge, then this is a place to go.",
          "This attraction should be rated higher. Essentially it's a giant forest park on a hill and an excellent way to break the monotony of old town Vilnius. There is also an excellent view at the top, near the monument. Make sure to wear some decent shoes. It takes about and hour to",
          "A very gentle walk through the woodland beside a river to reach the base of the hill. To climb up there are a number of stone steps which lead onto earth filled steps. The climb is relatively easy with a few breaks along the way however some of the steps were a little precarious",
          "Great views from this iconic spot and very photogenic from the city. Set amongst trees the autumn leaves were colourful",
          "Put on your sneakers and get up the hill!! The view was amazing and the history of the crosses was very interesting. We were one of about 4 people at the top. Definitely worth the hike up!!!",
          "Another Highest Hill or Mountain in Vilnius , self climbing but nice trail road, on the top located 3 huge crosses in the memory of heroic monk, 3 or 4 times the were restored during difficult times. after climbing you can find a beautiful view on the all city but different than",
          "The hills with the 3 crosses are on top of an hill in a nice park. It is not terribly hard to hike up to the 3 crosses. The view from the top is ok, I prefer the view from the tower guarding the city. The park is very nice though.",
          "I wouldn\u2019t make a special effort to get here but if you are already close by it\u2019s worth a loon- it\u2019s a pretty viewing spot and actually looks good with photos taken at the ground level",
          "You get to see the best views for Vilnius from this place. This is a moderate hike up the hill. You should be there in about 20 minutes. A good work out after a nice lunch :). Views from this place are very nice. Also, a nice place to get some quiet time in Vilnius.",
          "Don't know what I expected from this place. Had seen pictures and thought it looked interesting. It is a constantly changing picture as people ring their own crosses. Worth the stop on route to Vilnius.",
          "Worth coming for the views over the city. Vilnius is pretty flat, so the view is pretty commanding from here. We came up from the Tower, through the Valley of Song, beside the park and Rover Neris. This is a much easier way to reach the crosses than coming from the Gardens up",
          "Worth the walk up the hundreds of steps to get there purely for the view over the city. Absolutely breathtaking.",
          "Good views. Personally I think it was worth the trek to the top but be aware there are a lot of steps / steep paths up. Peaceful place",
          "These stone crosses were erected in 1989, replacing previous crosses that have stood on the hill since the early 17th century. Legend has it that the crosses were built to commemorate 7 friars that were beheaded on the hill. There is an observation deck that sits at the base of",
          "It is recommended sightseeing in Vilnius. You can reach it from any point of old city. I'd say not difficult to raise on it. But the veiw from the top will impress you) The best selfy))) from there.",
          "The Hill of Three Crosses consists for many steps and walks to reach the top of the hill where the monument of the Three Crosses is located. Very interesting hill often visited by tourists. Great view of Vilnius from the top of the hill. The whole area needs improvement to",
          "Easy to acces by road or stairs. This place is free of charge and from the walking distance of the old town.",
          "It is a long steep walk, more than 200 steps on wooden stairs through the forest. It is worth the sweat. What a view over the city of Vilnius! Recommended in the morning and the evening.",
          "The view from the hill was magnificent. You can have the city overview in a glance. The climbing to the hill might be a problem for some people.",
          "Beautiful place to visit. Kids were fascinated by the numerous crosses. The Franciscan monastery is at the end of the hill & a must visit too.",
          "It's a bit of a walk uphill to get there, but it is definitely worth it for an elevated view of the city. I do not recommend doing this in the early afternoon when the sun is at its highest, as I did. The cool of the early morning or evening would be preferable. The site of",
          "The hills takes its name from the three crosses on its top, making the memory - according to the legend - of the martyrdom of Franciscan friars during the middle ages. The view you can enjoy from the top is breathtaking. You can reach the top via a gently sloping street off the",
          "It was an arduous trip up the hill but the view was well worth it - if you have the energy take the time to make the climb.",
          "In 1795, Russia annexed this land. In about 50 years later, there were two men who resented and revolted against them and were eliminated. Subsequent to these event, more suffering followed and crosses were laid here. In the early 90s, the pope visited here and proclaimed that",
          "It really is just three crosses on a hill, although they are of historical significance, when you learn about the atheist annexing by the soviets. It provides a good view of the city but is a steep climb and would be difficult for anyone who struggles with hills, and/or who",
          "View from this place definitelly worth the climb from beautiful gardens at the Vilnia river. The history and broken crosses from Soviet regime is interesting as well.",
          "Beautiful views of Old-town! Worth visiting and especially fun to climb the wooden stairs from Vilnele river side (You won\u2019t be able to get to the hill top with a stroller though).",
          "It can be a little tricky to get there if you take the path, so although the road can be a little longer, it is worth taking if you are not wearing the proper shoes, but view is definitely worth the walk up the hill",
          "Wanted to get a look at the view of Vilnius up high, and decided to trek up to the top of the Hill of Three Crosses. Gives you a great view over the old town, and new town and take a panoramic photo of the town.",
          "The hill is fun to climb and you get to see a great view of Vilnius Old Town and the river that passes by.",
          "We visited it after Gediminas Tower. Rising to the hill of Three Crosses is uneasy, to the top of the hill leads a wooden staircase. This location is especially beautiful at the sunset. Here is a great view of old Vilnius.",
          "Though I didn't actually walk up to the monument\u2026I did get to see it from Gediminas Tower and St John's Bell Tower. Its quite impressive and am sure a visit would have been worth it, given more time was available. The history associated with this monument is also worth reading",
          "It is quite the walk up the hill but the view is worth it. You can overlook the complete city. But prepare for an uphill walk.",
          "There are good views of the City and its surroundings from here. There is a gradual roadway up to the top but the more interesting routs is the c.300 step climb up from the banks of the little Vilnia river behind St Anne's Church. Read up about the history of these Crosses as it",
          "We didn't climb to these crosses, but I bet the view is great. Actually could see them from our hotel window. They are very prominent in the town.",
          "There is a big parking lot to leave the car. Then you have to walk a bit. The entrance is free of charge. Panorama of the City very nice.",
          "I'm not a religious person, so at first this hill of thousands of crosses, from huge to tiny, seemed to be an interesting curiously. But it does provide people with the opportunity to remember their dear ones, so that was nice.",
          "Quite the hike to get to the top of the hill but the trek is worthwhile to see the view of the city, especially the Old Town.",
          "We earned the breathtaking view at the Three Crosses. How? We took the stairs. There are a few ways to get to the Crosses. You can drive part of the way and walk a short distance. You can walk up the road. Or you can take the stairs. What stairs? The hundreds of wooden ones",
          "Its not so much the 3 crosses which are modern sculptures. Its the great view of the city where great photos can be taken.",
          "Although it is a fairly strenuous walk up the stairs it is worth the walk. Take regular breaks on a hot day but the view is beautiful. A must-do when in Lithuania.",
          "After the 240 steps to go up the view is super pretty, I think is the best place to have a view from the city",
          "It is a bit of a walk and you can see them from the cathedral if you are feeling lazy, But we enjoyed going and quite a view from the top.",
          "There is a long history of this hill, as crosses changed many times....it is situated at a nice park and the main benefit going there is the great panoramic view of Vilnius old town. Spectacular!",
          "This monument overlooks Old Town and dates back to the 17th century when 3 monks placed them there to pay tribute to a group of fellow monks who were martyred in the 14th century. Stalin had the crosses removed. Over the years the monument has changed many times, and the current",
          "Quite a hike to the top but it's well worth it for the fantastic views over Vilnius. The monument itself is a reproduction. The last version was destroyed by the Soviets, fragments of which are located near by.",
          "as said by others, a steep walk - 100 meters- to reach the observation point, should not prevent visitors to enjoy a realistic view of the city, its various monuments- churches synagogue gardens before walking them around",
          "It is a steep walk up to the top but it's well worth it for the lovely panoramic views from the top.",
          "The climb on a sunny day was a bit tiring though. Maybe seeing it from below from the Old Town or the park is just fine.",
          "A recognisable landmark and symbol of Vilnius. The three crosses on the hill adjacent to the upper castle are replicas of a monument destroyed by the soviets",
          "Probably the best panorama in Vilnius, you can see very well the city, and the hill is relax, super green and clean.",
          "Wet well manicured lawns and well mapped trail leads up to this. The hike though steep, is well marked and very doable by the average person, people with disabilities would have difficult time due the amount of stairs. Hands down, best view of town",
          "Getting to the top of that Hill requires some effort, that is for sure. There are about 200 stairs to climb from the bottom of the Hill all the way to the top. The access is easier from the Cathedral, as from St. Anne's Church, you have to walk along the river in an unofficial",
          "This is a long steep incline and nowhere to sit along the way. But well worth the effort. Beautiful view and a memorable structure.",
          "Again, one of the best view of Vilnius from this place. Other one is Gediminas tower. It is at a walkable distance from the Gediminas tower.",
          "Visited this place with my family and really enjoyed the views and environment of the place. Its was nice to walk in the park and my kid enjoyed playing on the vast table top hill. Its good for a full day family outing, in summer, to enjoy the nature and calmness of the place.",
          "Place offers good view to old town, but surely you need to make couple of steps and then you'll have it. You can approach 3 crosses from several directions. You better have comfortable shoes without heels.",
          "Short walk up through the trees (steps provided) to reach this fantastic monument. Not only is it a great way to remember the history but the hill also provides an amazing view of the city.",
          "I suggest visiting it on a sunny Autumn day as the park turns colors from green to gold, its warm and it's just a magical experience. The view from the top is just beautiful.",
          "The three crosses are not nice but the view is excellent. You could see old Vilinius THe parking car is a little bit small",
          "The view from the top is stunning but be prepared to take a few (1000) steps. You can take your time as it\u2019s worth it. On a good day you can see all the way to the horizon.",
          "The up-hill climb through the park is a nice one, and the views of the city are rewarding, particularly if the weather is sunny.",
          "A historic monument in Vilnius that\u2019s erected on top of a hill which serves a a symbol of mourning and hope. It\u2019s a trek to climb up but it\u2019s worth it as it also offers an excellent view of the city.",
          "This monument has a long history, as it was built-up at least 3 different times (destroyed once by the Teutonic knights in the 14th century and once by the Soviets in the 20th century). It therefore has an important historical meaning. Its location is impressive, overseeing the",
          "Nice place to visit. Good place to burn some calories as you have to climb stairs as well as climb the road to reach the structures. The surroundings is awsome with a river flowing at the base of the hill. A must visit if you are traveling to Vilnius.",
          "We visited this site at night after dinner one evening when it was dark for some pictures of the city lights. There is a small parking lot halfway up the hill, so it is possible to take a taxi to this area and then walk a shorter distance. The concrete steps aren't the best and",
          "Walked here long walk and very steep. Two ways to go up to the crosses. Went one way up steep hill and coming back down did the 200 steps. Fa\u00f1tastic view of Vilnius from top so worth the walk.",
          "it was a very tiring walk to the top of the hill but the views from above is fantastic. its as if you are carrying your own cross to the top but it was well worth the time and effort!",
          "The best place for take some scenic photos of Vilnius from above. You re leaving the car at the free parking and walk a very inclined road for about 400 metres. Totally worth it!",
          "With a quick walk to the top of the hill there is this site and from there, on top of the hill you can see all the city. Super!",
          "It is just breathtaking to see this view! A bunch of lovely hills can be seen. Definitely a must-visit place for panoramas' lovers!",
          "We Just had to Visit the 3 Crosses and the best route for us was through the park close to our Hotel then up the wooden steps (Over 200) to the Top of the hill where the crosses stand an energetic climb but we managed it and at the top a great panoramic view of the city and of",
          "I hiked to the top today! It was a great vantage point to look down at the old town. I will probably walk that hill every day while in town.",
          "Worth the climb for a good voew across the city. A little steep but more than manageable. Probably the best at sunset if you can time it right.",
          "We walked around the park where the three crosses are set... the park was bare and under disrepair. It was a little depressing but it was bitterly cold and not really in the \u2018high season\u2019 of leaved trees and flowers. It\u2019s something to see as you walk about exploring Vilnius, but",
          "Just a 15 minute walk from my accommodation, it doesn\u2019t take too long to get there from the old town. Bring walking shoes as there is a muddy path and a lot of stairs. The view at the top was worth the walk and offers beautiful picture opportunities of the city and the crosses.",
          "I didn't go because of the monument but because of the view. Its great and its free. Would recommend",
          "Nice walk up the hill and very nice view of the city..there is a parking at the hill for 0,40 euro/h",
          "Make sure you've had your breakfast before tackling this hill! A fantastic view of the city, I'd say the best view.",
          "We saw some really beautiful views. However... I wouldn\u2019t suggest this if A you\u2019re not very fit or B are trying to do it quickly. It took us a while and had to stop a few times on the way up... well worth it when you get to the top.",
          "A decent walk up to the monument, great bit of culture and fantastic views of the basilica and city, definitely worth it.",
          "This object requires a bit of phisical activity, because you have to climb up the hill, but the results are rewarding. The cross monument is seen from oldtown, so up close they are quite big crosses, but the most spectacula ir view from the hill to the city. Crosses light up in",
          "It's quite the trek to get up here - we came from the park side and up the wooden steps through woodland, but you can also access it from the other side. A steep climb either way, but worth it. Once you're there, the crosses themselves are a sight to behold even if you're not",
          "One of the iconic site in Vilnius, you can approach from different sides, bit of a steep climb in places but there are steps. Good photo opportunity at the top for the town and the 3 crosses. Worth the walk!",
          "We decided to climb the Hill of the Three Crosses, where a monument with three crosses was built upon. Legend says that seven Franciscan friars were murder on the spot and wooden crosses were built after to commemorate the event. Nowadays a beautiful panorama over the old town",
          "Climbed up this hill after visiting the tower of the castle. I have to say that the views from this vantage point were far superior. Would highly recommend making the climb to this hill - it\u2019s not very strenuous and only takes about 20 minutes",
          "The Hill of Three Crosses overlooks the old town and is visible from all round. Previous crosses on the same hill were pulled down during repression. They are in a moderate state of disrepair now. You can get to the top by foot or partway up by car. The more gentle route is via",
          "The hill of three crosses is located right on the hill next to the Gediminas castle and just like its neighboor, offers a great view upon the old town of Vilnius. It's an about 15 minute walk from the cathedral square and doesn't require particular physical skill for adults,",
          "We accidentally found out about that place. After New year's eve, it was not much crowded. You can have a wide view of Vilnius and also see the TV tower. It's a highlight of everyone's trip to Vilnius. The monument itself is also interesting because of its history.",
          "The three crosses is located in a park not far from the Gediminas castle. three crosses on this hill in the city center are thought to have been erected in the 17th century by Franciscan monks, to pay tribute to fellow monks that were murdered. The original crosses was made by",
          "Walk up to the hill via forest paths. At the top you get a great view of the city below. Worth the effort",
          "Definitely recommend going there, the view over Vilnius is stunning. And it's a nice walk through a small forest.",
          "The hill is located literally \"at the side\" of the Old Town and it takes no more than half an hour of walk to get there (it is uphill but all these \"climbing\" descriptions you can find here are greatly exaggerated, whatever route you take). Once you get there you are rewarded",
          "You can reach the summit of this hill which dominates the Old Town of Vilnius via a walking trail from the south side or a road on the north side. Its a strenuous uphill walk either way, but you'll be rewarded with a great panorama of Vilnius.",
          "You'll have to almost literally climb that hill, especially if you're heading to it from Bernadine Garden by wooden stairs, however, view on the city worth your efforts",
          "Interesting! I found the sheer number of crosses of all shapes and sizes quite overwhelming. It looked \"messy\" and almost tacky. However, I can appreciate that for many, this would be quite a moving and sacred place.",
          "Just like Gediminas Tower, going up allows you to admire a nice landscape of the city, apart from the Three Crosses themselves. Recommended.",
          "As I said in a title, the hill opens wonderful view all around Vilnius. Another plus is beautiful nature, near is a riwer, Bernardinai Gardens. Also this place is a meaningful for lithuanians.",
          "Set within beautiful parklands the Hill of Three Crosses offers amazing panoramic views over Vilnius and well worth the climb up to the top of the hill, its easier coming down haha!",
          "This hill with it's three crosses dominates the skyline over Vilnius. Legend has it that it is the site of the beheading of seven Franciscan friars way back. There have been crosses here to mark the spot since the early part of the seventeenth century and perhaps even earlier.",
          "lies in the middle of a park, although the guide said, that it was not a park because it is not tidy enough",
          "This hill easily has the best view of the city of Vilnius, and for free ! Our favourite time was around sun set. Do mind however that reaching this hill requires some medium level of activity as one would have to climb stairs there (wear good shoes), but I do not think this is",
          "It was absolutely worth the climb up the hill for the panoramic views at the top - we could see all the way from the barbican to the tv tower. This was the last thing we did on our visit to Vilnius, which was good as we could identify everywhere we had visited on our trip.",
          "this is the place to visit were you have to go top the hill to see the 3 crosses & to have a good look of the vilnius city too",
          "Excellent signage with descriptions in English on the way up. Great view with a map to identify the sights",
          "I got a taxi from the bus station in town to the Hill and spent about an hour there, taking so many pictures. It was beautiful and moving. It is completely free. Locals drive themselves and approach from various directions. A lone accordion player sits nearby on a bench,",
          "We had a nice trek up in the autumn afternoon to see the three crosses. The view from the top allows for some nice photos of Vilnius in the background. It takes about 15 minutes to walk up to the top.",
          "The tour guide advised us to climb the Hill and it was a good idea. The view was nice and we could also see the Gedimine Tower. The climb was easy and the park looked all yellow, green and red in October.",
          "The path from Uzupis is like an elvenpath form a fable. And the view is totally worth climbing 100+ stairs.",
          "I was taking pictures from other side of the town, looks very nice which standing in a mountain, the whole area is beautiful",
          "It's well worth the quiet walk to the Hill of three crosses to get a panoramic view over the city. After a long climb up the stairs, it's quite a spectacular view and not to be missed.",
          "A tribute to the martyrs the original crosses were wooden and the local residents would replace them once they rotted. However they were replaced with concrete ones in 1916 but were sadly destroyed by the Soviets in the 1950s. This has been replaced by a new monument which",
          "It\u2019s a beautiful sight overlooking Vilnius and worth the walk up. It\u2019s quite a few steep steps so you need to be in ok shape to do it. Interesting walk up through the trees and it\u2019s a well laid out route, so easy to follow. Great views from the top along with learning about the",
          "We walked from old town and it was quite close. The views were great and we had a really picturesque walk.",
          "The hill of crosses is a must when visiting this area, it is lit up of a night, it\u2019s quiet a steep walk if your unfit there is a road at the back that a taxi can park close to the summit if you couldn\u2019t walk Great views from the top",
          "It's a relatively easy location to get to, a 15 minute uphill walk, very rewarding views at the top, especially on a sunny day.",
          "We walked up here during day time and then later on during the night time.its worth seeing Vilnius from here. Highly recommend this walk.",
          "A lovely walk up through the woods from the Benedictine Gardens (though lots of wooden steps so perhaps approach from the river side if you're not so active). Amazing views across the old town from the top.",
          "It is worth climbing the small hill of Three Crosses for the view of the old part of Vilnius. Recommended.",
          "Steep path but relatively short walk up. Free, no admission fee. Good view of city from atop. Id see this in place of the castle nearby. Same views but no 5 euro fee.",
          "Unfortunately we didn't have the time in Vilnius to make the long climb to visit this monument but we did see it from various parts of our city bus tour and were very impressed! Apparently this is just the latest version of this monument and was unveiled in 1989.",
          "Staying in Vilnius for almost 6 months I have had the chance to visit I think everything there is to see in this amazing European city. One place that everybody was talking about all the time was the Hill of Three Crosses so I gave it a go. When me and my friends arrived at the",
          "From this point you can see the entire old town. The place can be a little crowded, but is a very nice place to see the sunset and to appreciate of view of the city.",
          "The hill of three crosses is a challenging climb, either by road on the north side or stairs on the south side, but you will be rewarded with a nice view over the city and the nearby Gedimina / castle hill.",
          "The only free way to get nice views of the old town. Recommended but not a must. It\u2019s a relatively short hike through park and up stairs",
          "Considering that the second best place to get a view of the city is overpriced, this does make an interesting site to visit, moreover in case you wanna burn some fat while traveling, the treck to reach there would be useful. A must visit I would say.",
          "It was about 1 mile (1.5k) from the Cathedral Square. It had a great view of the city and a great story about the spot. The story connects medieval times with soviet occupation after WW2 - through the fall of the Soviet Union.",
          "The views from up top were nice! Be careful of some steps on your way up and they look like they're broken and might seem wobbly, but they're stuck to the ground, so won't be unsafe to climb, but your foot must land on it at the right angle as they're not all straight!",
          "Great views from this hill. Free with nice views of a park on the way up. The crosses themselves are nice but the views are what you want to see. If possible, go in good weather.",
          "There are two routes available up to thus monument and it can be accessed by car. At the top you will find the original crosses which are laying down and the newer crosses with fantastic views across the city.",
          "I walked up from junction of Vilna and Neris rivers near Gediminas castle. Steep track up through the trees but less than 15 minutes walk. I went at 6-7pm on a sunny day and watched the hot-air balloons take-off and fly over the city. There is some history behind the crosses but",
          "Those stairs are horrible :(( but once you are up it is sooo worth it!!! You get beautiful views of Vilnius!! At night the hill is light up which provides other sort of views, but it's probably safer to climb those stairs with daylight :)",
          "After quite a steep climb over quite a few steps you will find yourself on the hill with an amazing view on Vilnius Old Town and beyond. Definitely worth the effort :)",
          "Whether you drive 80% of the way and walk, or take the scenic route; you should add this to your itinerary. The statue is nice and the panoramic view was the best in Vilnius.",
          "If you want to see the city panorama this is a great spot. The forest surrounding is also good for a walk and light hiking. The history of the placeis also worth knowing.",
          "Takes a bit of finding the entrance - it isn\u2019t a formal gate or anything and is really a worn down path that starts heading upwards. The eventual wooden staircase is broken in parts so be careful infact I avoided it for the downward journey. Worth the effort though at the top,",
          "If you like to take pictures or you like to see things from another point of view then you have to go to the hill.except from the nice view of the city you can also admire the nature and take also some pictures by the river",
          "You have to count with short excercise coming up, but it is well wort it! You will have an amazing view of Vilnius from up here",
          "I'd say that this place is definitely worth visiting if you are in Vilnius. First of all its a remarkable place, second, it opens an amazing view of the city and the Gediminas tower particularly. Don't go there just after taking meal as it'll be too hard to walk upstairs. The",
          "The monument sits on top of a steep hill, and offers great views of the city and the old castle mound. The walk up was hard for us as the day was humid, but we were glad to have made it. A word of caution, if you get the tourist map, it shows the three crosses being quite close",
          "You can see (almost) entire Vilnius Old Town from here, nice for photos. Also you can visit Kaln\u0173 Parkas (park) right next to the mountain.",
          "After a little hike you got a great view over a part of Vilnius.. There a two ways to get up the hill.. One is via a stairs and one is via an normal road, but it is steep..",
          "Great view of Vilnius from the hill, although make sure that anyone attempting the walk has stout footwear one. Great time is about 9:30pm so that you can witness the darkness enshrining the city and the lights come on!",
          "I believe that in the years to come more people will visit it it is high up in the mountain overlooking the vilnius vity",
          "It was an amazing experience to go to the Hill of Crosses, I have never seen anything like it and the amount of crosses has to be seen to be believed.",
          "The best place to get a beautiful panorama of Vilnius City. It's quite a walk up to reach so come prepare with good walking shoes and water!",
          "This is one of the best viewpoints to get Vilnius city panorama. Additionally the story of the three crosses is interesting but that one one can find in all guides. And actually there are two ways to reach the hilltop: the strenuous one, from the side of Vilnia river,",
          "After reading other reviews about the wooden syeps , we followed this route ,steep & abit off the track. The view was amazing A kiosk would make a fortune in the carpark selling drinks & snacks. On the way down we followed the car route , easier to walk down & quicker to get",
          "I would recommend to go up the hill to get the best view of the city and that for free. The way is of a lot of wooden stairs without any handrail or places to rest, though.",
          "Wooden crosses were built in the location since the early 17th century, and according to the placard on the hill (in English) have been reconstructed over time. The walk up to the crosses is relatively easy (good for a morning run as well). Just below the current crosses, some",
          "You have to climb up the hill from a side and the view is phenomenon, over seeing the whole city. Good place though but you need a good legs to walk up there.",
          "Been there several times with different types of companies, with brother/family/friends/boyfriend, and all of them was hypnotized with this place and the view. My recommendations for all of you to come here at the evening, when its darker than usually, and you will see the magic",
          "Even on a hot day like we had, we enjoyed the walk up to the Three Crosses for the view. The crosses are being refurbished as of June 2018 and had building material and fencing at the bottom of the crosses. The view is nice though.",
          "The climb is worth the view and the sculpture is humbling. Very serene and a good place for meditation or reflection. The view shows so many beautiful churches castle and the old city of Vilnius.",
          "Its a fair walk to get up there, but the views more than make up for it, it was a nice summers days when we went up, and there was also some Singing going on in the Park with lots of stalls, so we spent a couple of hours wandering around after going to see the Crosses",
          "very nice, great time spent there, great for kids to run and play.great view on the city and especially the old city .",
          "This is definitely one of those \"must see\". The view from the Hill is beautiful. There are 2 ways how to get up to hill, and if you hate stairs (cos' they are brutally looong), there's another way, less \"challenging\" that leads on the road (I think you have to cross one bridge",
          "This is a nice trek you must do if you are in Vilnius. I recommend you take the road to the back of the hill and walk through the forest on your way back to the old city. The view is amaizing and the trek takes about 1 hours of you take it very slow. Wear good shoes as it can be",
          "You have to deserve the view as there are quite a number of steep steps to get to the three crosses but you will not be disappointed ! Extensive view on the city and its many churches !",
          "Not in the league of the Hill of Crosses of Lithuania but still well worth a a visit, overlooking the River and Old Town of Vilnius and easily seen from there it is a worthy monument to go and see with some fantastic views over the city.",
          "Thousands of crosses You can walk through Take pictures and videos It\u2019s amazingly beautiful A must go for travelers",
          "The path through the park and up the hill to the crosses was easy to travel, well-maintained and worth the walk. Beautiful views and the three crosses are impressive.",
          "Quirky place, nothing like I had seen before. However coupled with the history of the site, makes for an intresting visit. It's unlikely you will stay long, but a quick walk through the area should ensure you see all you need to.",
          "Unfortunately the Three Crosses were under renovation when we went up. However, we got the most amazing sunset view of the city up there. Could not stop taking photos. It is a walk up but a definite must visit for the awesome view",
          "The climb is reasonable and not too hard and you are treated to great views of the city of Vilnius. The viewpoint is higher than the old castle which you can also see from there.",
          "It is a little but manageable climb to the top via established paths and wooden steps. The symbolic crosses are well maintained, but there is no information (legible) so read up first. View from the top across the old town was magnificent and you can walk a different way back",
          "From Bernardinai Garden below, a short climb up 200 steps on a forested hill will take you to the Three Crosses. There is another route up, but the steps from the Garden is the way to go. It may be strenuous for some, but one can rest on the side while climbing. There no",
          "Wear trainers!! We wore sandals and this made the climb a bit harder. Not a long climb but some killer wobbly steps. Just be careful as some are coming loose. Great view from the top.",
          "This place is amazing because from here you can see all Vilnius. Is very nice and is an important place for the story of Vilnius as well.",
          "We took the hard way up from the Bernardinu Park. The steps were steep and hard going. The way up from the Funicular end (the Funicular was under repair) I think would be an easier walk up the road then pathway.",
          "A bit of a work-out but definitely worth the trip! Amazing panoramic views of the city which were especially rewarding at sunset. A Vilnius \"must\".",
          "Well worth a trek up here for the view across Vilnius. Easy road access up from the northwest or by steps from the southwest.",
          "We were travelling this way so stopped in. It is an interesting story but there are much more interesting sights to see in this area.",
          "The steps up to this monument are very Steep, I counted over 230 steps so it's not for the unfit or unsteady. Great view across the city. With gedimas Tower shut it gives the alternative view!",
          "It was quite a big job to climb the mountain. The crosses are not important for me. I climbed to see the view from this mountain.",
          "I went up from Bernardine Park, which is pretty straightforward if you follow the touristic maps on the trail. The three crosses itself have zero artistic value, but get you a nice picture if the sky is clear and sunny. The view is certainly privileged, but I still prefer the",
          "The view of the city is good and you should probably go there when the sun starts to set. The crosses themselves doesn\u2019t interest me that much.",
          "Be prepared to walk for about 5-10 minutes up to these crosses before being rewarded with a stunning panoramic view of the city. Best time to visit is to watch either sunrise or sunset (the latter of which is better in my opinion)",
          "these are up a large hill you may not want to walk... it is steep climb. you can see them from far away.",
          "Realy hard to get there. The road to there very hard , only by foot. But if you are there, you can see really nice view, and see all the interesting places in centrum of Vilnius. Recommended to visit this place.",
          "Whilst the Three Crosses give a great view of the city and the landmarks it is a seriously big climb for a nearly 70 yer old. The best way is to go up the back way using the road as the front steps are steep and hard work but easier coming down that way.",
          "Wow..its quite a walk up very steep stairs and hills but well worth it when you arrive at the top. The views are breathtaking- literally.",
          "It was a beautiful day so we took the opportunity to visit this historic landmark on top of the hill. You won't be the only one up here as many people visit and take photos and selfies at these crosses. The old crosses that the Russians knocked down decades ago are just below",
          "We walked up the hill which is very steep! Once up at the top we had a lovely view of Vilnius. The monument itself is stunning too.",
          "A good walk up the stairs (a few of them need a bit of repair) so perfect if you're fit, but even if you aren't it's not too far and very doable. Really great view of the entire city so well worth the climb",
          "Great view of old town, short walk from centre, park near cathedral up to hill. Can be nice to spend some time having picnic up on the hill, you ahve to take everything there is no opportunity to purchase refresmenents up on the hill or on the way up.",
          "It\u2019s a bit of a hike to get up here The easiest is to walk up the road But, it\u2019s worth it for the view You can probably also drive on the road. But you will still have a lot of Stairs to get to the Crossed You look down on all of Vilnius",
          "Near sunset good time to visit for panoramic photos. Lots of stairs so be prepared, but worth it at the top.",
          "A free 30 minute walk up the hill is absolutely worth it. The view over vilnius' rooftops is amazing.",
          "It is hard to climbe these stairs up, but the view is worth it. You can see old town, Gediminas' tower, Cathedral and other places from above",
          "Cross the river and climb the stairs to get one of the best views of Vilnius. The three crosses have been pulled down in the past by different regimes.",
          "It's an easy walk up to the three crosses. And you are rewarded with spectacular views over the city.",
          "I made the mistake of trying to go up the hill from the wring side; which did not work! But on discovering the correct way it is very easy to get up to the top, where there is an exceptional view of the city.",
          "Situated behind Vilnius cathederal and adjacent to gediminas tower and Saint Annes church,Bernadine gardens.Follow the path alongside a small river until you come to the wooden steps to the top of the hill where the three crosses are situated.Be aware these are really really",
          "The climb up to the top is not too hard and is well worth it. You get a great view of the city and it is great to do on your first day in the city to orient yourself.",
          "Lovely walk up to the crosses, and took the stairs back down towards the river. We enjoyed it so much we did it twice!",
          "Very good view over the city. You need to walk a bit to reach the top of the mountain but it worth it at the end",
          "Though I recommend taking the back way, the stairs are a bit steep and not in the best shape. It is absolutely worth the hike up though.",
          "Great vantage point over the city of Vilnius. The three crosses monument itself is very striking. For photos looking over town, I found the natural lighting of the afternoon sun made it harder to capture the skyline on my camera.",
          "Well worth the steep walk to the Hill of Three Crosses for the amazing views (and the great laugh slipping and sliding in the snow and ice).",
          "It is worth some extra time and energy to go all the way up this monument. Although referring to a 17th century event, recent history has also left its marks there. The view and the walk in the park will compensate you - even if you choose the fast way via the long wooden",
          "A good spot for a view over the city, but a long climb up from the Uzupis side (350 steps plus part with no steps) A few seats at the top to sit and admire the view would be lovely especially after the climb! Signs weren\u2019t always obvious so we took a few wring turns in trying",
          "Beautiful location above the city, with great views. I would recommend walking up the back way (near the Castle) as it is a bit gentler - the other route has steep steps. Beautiful walks along the river nearby too",
          "You might have to do a little bit of hiking to get to this place, which could be tough in the snowy season. Unfortunately, not many signs are there to guide the tourists as well. But once you find your way to the monument, you would certainly enjoy it. On the one hand, there",
          "lovely place to see the overall view of vilnius, bit of a climb up some very steep steps but worth it when you get there a must while in vilnius",
          "I mean, it\u2019s different and unique, i would definitely not go there just to visit that but if you\u2019re on your way to somewhere else and you can re-route a bit to stop by is definitely worth a look.",
          "Certainly worth a walk up on a clear day as the hill does offer a lovely view of Vilnius and the surrounding area (including the nearby TV tower). It's also interesting seeing the remains of the original destroyed crosses and the replacements erected in their place.",
          "The Stairs up to three crosses in Vilnius are very unsafe! There is no hand rail and some of the wooden stairs are rotting in places. Are the wooden stairs secured into the ground anyway? I couldn\u2019t see evidence of this. If there was a landslide while a lot of people were",
          "If you're able to, then it is definitely worth the fairly steep climb up the steps to reach the top. You can see the old crosses laying down, and the current crosses very close up. Great views across Vilnius",
          "Amazing view of Vilnius! Despite a long(ish) and steep walk it is worth it! Nicely maintained wooden steps guides you through a small forest to the top of the hill. A must to visit when in Vilnius.",
          "there are 2 ways up the hill... the steps or the road, choose wisely according to ability... great view of the city..",
          "It's a bit of a challenging walk up the forest hillside to reach the three crosses, but once you're there, the view over the whole city is breath-taking. When I wen tup there were quite a few people around, including a few people having picnics - it seems a popular place to stop",
          "Definitely worth the steep walk up the steps or there is a more gentle incline around the back. Great views over the whole city. Great place to take some photos",
          "Enjoyed the climb but as we climbed in the ice and snow it was a bit hazardous at points. Much better to climb up the path from the car park side in the snow rather than the steps from the park. The step don't have a rail and I wouldn't have liked to go back down that way. Great",
          "I highly recommend a visit to the Hill of Three Crosses. We did the walk for sunset and the view is beautiful. A definite must when you're in Vilnius!",
          "Highest land point (not tv mast), a challenging climb in the snow but on a beautiful fresh day the views are great. Just watch for the stairs down on the city side...they nicely end about 4 steps before the end so you have to jump down",
          "Walked up here and was pleasantly surprised by the view. It is different enough than from the castle to make it worth the walk. The path up from the Bernadise gardens is quite step and steps are not in great condition, the other side paved and there is parking.",
          "Went for a nice walk from the gate of dawn down dvasios along the bastion through the park along maironio beside the river vilnia then right up uzupio then left through a pedestrian passageway 'jono meko skersvejis' then across the bridge into Bernadine gardens through the park",
          "The view we had was with snow. That was pretty cool! And a challenge to climb. From the other side you have a nice view over the old town.",
          "On a day when you are just wandering around and enjoying life a small walk up to the Three Crosses is a nice option.",
          "Well worth the climb even using the wooden stairs which were gritted. We are mid 50s and it was easy. Awesome view of the city and not to be missed.",
          "I believe this is a place you should definitely visit, when you come to Vilnius. The panorama from there is spectacular.",
          "Found the road upto the 3 crosses. Would have had great views had it not been snowing. Came down the wooden steps way but do be careful as some are in need of repair, while others \"wobble\". Having made it down walked along river and through park at other side. Very nice.",
          "It\u2019s a bit of a trek up the steps especially in the snow so use the road that takes you up there (we only found that on the way down!). Some fantastic views of the city once you get there.",
          "We visited with snow and ice making walk hazardous. View great. Be careful climbing wooden steps they can be very slippy!",
          "Lots of steps to access the top or a steep climb along the main road. We visited in -9 weather, snow and ice, it was cold, but worth it! There was a film scene being shot at the top, right next to the crosses and the view, and we were asked to be extras! :) No idea what the",
          "We came up form the river side, and the climb is tough (for 2 60 year olds). But there is a great view form the top. The walk down the other side is a bit easier!",
          "There are several ways up to the top for a great view of Vilnius.There is a paved road, but also wooden steps and makeshift trails which are eroding and require some caution. I like to go up the wooden steps which are reached by a bridge from Bernardine Gardens.",
          "It seems a long walk, but it isn't and the rewards are worth it, great views of the city. We went in snow and the path back was hazardous, The Crosses are a little tatty close up but they have an interesting history which is worth investigating.",
          "Absolutely stunning place to go to see the panorama of Vilnius city. I come here all the time. This time it happened to be in winter time when it was snowing and freezing haa! But I enjoyed the experience! Any time Vilnius!",
          "The site itself is a historical landmark, important as a symbol of resistance and national identity. According to legend, it's a memorial to Franciscan monks who were killed in that spot; but it's more important as one of the symbols of the city and Lithuania, as it has been",
          "Perfect romantic spot and catching one of the best views across Vilnius! Close to the castle area. Must visit!",
          "Glad we made the easy one mile walk up to the Three Crosses. The snow was falling and the quiet forest a beautiful haven. From the hill itself enjoy great views over the old town. Certainly worth a stroll.",
          "The view beats the object of your climb and go on a windless day as there always seems to be a chilling breeze",
          "Had a good yomp upto the 3 crosses via the step trail in the snow xx quite tough going with no hand rails on the steps but a great view point at the top . Certainly walked off breakfast",
          "A lovely walk in the snow along the river then up the steps to the top for some wonderful views over Vilnius.",
          "To get to the hill of Three Crosses, you need to climb the hill (of course :-) ) using some wooden stairs, without hand rail and quite slippery during the winter/raining days. However, once in the top of the hill, the view is amazing. So, if you manage to safely get up and get",
          "I visited in January when it was -11c and snowing. The views of Vilnius were amazing even with the weather and definitely worth the walk up. I went up by the stairs which are quite steep and wouldn't be suitable for very young children or those with mobility issues and came back",
          "It was a nice easy walk from Vilnius up to the Hill of 3 crosses. Great views down over the city. On the way down we walked to Uzupis which was a really cool neighborhood",
          "Short and easy walk to the top of the hill. Nice view of the city, but it takes like 30 minutes to go up and down so don\u2019t plan to stay there all morning!",
          "We stumbled across this when trying to find access up to the castle on the hill. It\u2019s quite a steep walk but well worth it for the views. It is dark so safer to do this during early evening so you don\u2019t slip over!",
          "It takes a while to walk up to the top, but it is worth it: when you are at the top you see the whole city.",
          "Worth the steep hike up - either the paved road or wooden steps on the other side. Gorgeous views of Vilnius and the crosses themselves are beautiful.",
          "It\u2019s a steeper and longer walk by the Cathedral but as it\u2019s a road is manageable. The shorter route is via the park. It\u2019s magnificent when it\u2019s dark but you can\u2019t see the town at night. We went in the morning and could see miles on end,.",
          "A 15-minute climb on a hill overlooking the city and the Gediminas Tower. Most of the ascent is over a wooden staircase, so no hiking/trekking equipment is required.",
          "Much more interesting than I thought. Take the time to learn about the history of the site. It's fascinating.",
          "The stairs will take you on top of the hill with little effort, and the view on the city is worth it. The crosses themselves are quite old and not really original.",
          "It\u2019s near the Crowne Placa VNO. Just move out the Hotel to your left. You will face one of this places.",
          "Lovely walk with the husband and a cracking view over vilnius. Make sure you wear good footwear, especially if you do it in winter like we did, and it's icy! Nice walk to work up an appetite and to appreciate some of the struggles that Lithuanians had.",
          "The Gedimino tower is closed for renovation, so the view from the three crosses is worth the lovely walk through the park and up the hill. It was snowy when we went, so the wooden steps which are quite steep were a bit slippery but still accessible. The crosses & the view is",
          "Incorporated into my morning run - be prepared for a slog up the hill to get here! While the Gediminas Tower is closed for repairs to its hill, this place gives you one of the best views over the city. There is a little information on the monument when you reach the crosses,",
          "We walked up to the hill of 3 crosses on a cold winter, overcast day. There is a little bit of information on the guides as you make your way up, but once there apart from the view, there is nothing else to do. The city bus tour mentions this site a few times and gives you",
          "We hiked the hill! Once we located the 3 crosses we felt the hike was worth the effort! Great view of the city... the crosses themselves need some attention. The history behind the crosses made it more special.. Don\u2019t miss the 3 crosses on the ground behind them... we hiked",
          "We went to the Hill of Three Crosses on our first day in Vilnius just as we arrived at 5 pm. It was a steep climb to get to the top of the hill but we were glad we did when we got there. The monument commemorates Franciscan missionaries who were martyred by pagans long ago.",
          "It is one of the best place to explore Vilnius Old Town panoramic view. I would suggest to include it in your must do list. And it is on the walking distance from center/Old town.",
          "The magnificent panorama of Vilnius city opens from the Hill of Three Crosses. Energetically very strong place.",
          "Rather than take the road we hiked up the side of the \u2018mountain\u2019. It was lovely walking through the autumn trees and the view from the top was great.",
          "We went to the hill on a sunny day. The walk is quite steep, but the view make it worth the effort. From the top we could see the entire Old Town of Vilnius, and point out exciting places to see.",
          "A fantastic place to visit (even if the walk up is a bit of an effort) the scenery was spectacular and the views of the city nearly as good. Recommended",
          "Whatever your faith you will have a hard heart if you are not moved by these numerous momentoes to loved ones and tokens of thanks",
          "A little bit of walk up the hill and it was a hot day. Worth the visit because of the good view of Vilnius from the hill.",
          "This is impressive from all angles as it is placed high on a hill and can be seen from quite a distance",
          "Stunning view during daytime, and I can only imagine it would be totally awesome to see the view at night. A nice walk to a romantic place",
          "Done this place on a day trip from Vilnius. It really is an amazing place, from the outside it's a breath taking array of Crosses in all different sizes spread across the landscape, then you walk through the middle and its like being on a walkway through an enormous bonfure made",
          "I'm not religious but had to stop and see this Must be millions of crosses there Can feel something special about this place",
          "Okay....let me see if I can spend 67 more characters here....there is a hill, not a big one, and on that hill were, and now are again, three crosses. There is a view, and a bit of history....and...that's....it. The view is better from Gedimino Tower.",
          "The crosses are placed high on a hill looking down on vilnius. You get great views of the city after a short walk up a reasonably steep hill.",
          "It is kind of special historical place but it is one of the best place to see the old town of the Vilnius- nice panorama. Free of charge :)",
          "The hill is close the old town and is reached via a climb through forests. It offers good views of the town.",
          "Being new here I had to do the hike up. The views are remarkable. There are no better spots. Two ways up one by paved road and one by steps. We went on a clear day.",
          "I think this is the best view of Vilnius I've seen. Perhaps from a hot air balloon or office tower one can get a better view. Drive part way than walk the rest. The Communists blew this up but it was rebuilt.",
          "Nice paniramic view, but it is far from city center, need to go up to hill. No restaurants. Nice surroundings, best time to go of course in summer.",
          "Definitely a tongue in cheek heading, depending on your belief system. Our Lithuanian guide described that the act of placing a cross here is an expression of hope, rather than a religious rite. To us it seemed bizarre, but 100's-1000's of crosses of all types planted on a",
          "A great sight. Worth the climb up the hill to see it. We could actually see this from our hotel room. It was lighted at night!",
          "06 July, 2017. One of the prominent tourist attractions in the Old Town of Vilnius is the Hill of the Three crosses, a white structure which can be viewed from a large distance around (including from the top of Gediminas Hill), and is frequented by tourists for its significance,",
          "You must have read up some information before you understand why people are putting wooden crosses on the hill.. Fortunally my Lithuanian friends were near hand to give me some history about it. The place is really not suitable for the disabled as you have lots of stairs to",
          "View is nice and also worth to climb up the mountain to take a look the whole picture of Vilnius city. Its easy to find a way and go upstairs!",
          "We climbed up the hill on a lovely fine day so had full benefit of the great view from the top. Interesting to read about the history of destruction and reconstruction and encouraging to see the determination to restore something of significance to local people. Incidentally I",
          "Hiked up the hill and photographed the entire city. However, I never could get a shot of all three crosses, just two from all angles. From the hill, they are distant.",
          "Well the food is great in Vilnius so you need to work it off somehow. What better way than to walk to the highest point and view the city from above. It's worth the walk.",
          "It is some walking up the hill but the view is rewarding. you will see all town at a glance. three crosses ia a must if you have 2+ days in Vilnius",
          "Nice viewpoint to see Vilnius and surroundings. About 20-30 minutes walk from the city centre (cathedral). It is loocated on a hill and you must climb the wooden stairs (see photo). Could be a dirty trip if raining. There is only a monument on the top - no bars, no shops with",
          "The steps leading up to the Hill of Three Crosses were steep and not in the best condition. There are a couple of hundred steps but worth the climb for the view and the atmosphere at the top. The forest surrounding the site is beautiful. Once at the top, take the road down if",
          "Not very difficult to reach, a bit of climb but not so heavy, in a lovely park. We did it on a cloudy day, I suppose in the sun, views are even nicer.",
          "Soviet state told the locals they could not do something and this is proof of their determination. There are thousands of crosses on this hill. The human spirit could not be stopped. Very unique stop to see.",
          "I went behind the cathedral and came down from Uzupis side. It takes around 20 mins to go up in the hill. But there are no steps but the road. When I went down I had steps. you will have beautiful view on the city. Go there in evening to see beautiful colorful sky too.",
          "Went for a run through the park and saw stairs across the river so made my way to them. It led to the three crosses monument. The trails are moderately maintained. Worth the climb if you're able. The view from the monument is lovely.",
          "It is an uphill climb to get here (you can take a car up most of the way from the river), but well worth the effort. The crosses were installed after pagans killed 14 Franciscans near here, The original concrete crosses were destroyed by either the Germans or the Russians,",
          "The climb up, may for some be a good effort, but if yu there, the view even tops the Gemidini tower, in addition the whole plateau offers a nice walk around and if with like some people are using the akoustik valley.",
          "We went for a jog up the hill in the Morning. The view was alright but the run through the park to get there was the best part.",
          "We climbed on it with stretching our legs and views being our priorities - and one can sure enjoy the views of Vilnius with well-exposed Gediminas Tower from here. Definitely not for people with mobility issues - consider funicular to Gediminas Hill instead. Our secondary",
          "You really have to be fit to be able to get up this hill to the top unless you are going to take it very slow. It was a really hot day and I was exhausted by the time I made it up there. But it was very worth it so take your time and go for the views.",
          "steep walk to get there but nice view, and another place checked off on the places to visit in Vilnius",
          "Do make time to climb the hill! Be aware that walking from Cathedral Square the path can be rough and there are no handrails, so care is needed. However, it is an enjoyable walk and great to see the city from this height. Really brings home the fascinating architecture",
          "Beautiful spot, very pretty on a sensational day. Vilnius is full of history and the streets were quiet.",
          "We walked from old town here behind the Cathedral and turned right and walked next to the river and across a small bridge- take the next right and bear left up the road close to the parking lot- the hill is further up the road, keep to the right and they will be up to the right.",
          "Three white crosses can be seen on the highest hill of Vilnius. The crosses have a rich history and according to a legend 7 Franciscans missionary were killed by pagans in the 14th century. They were destroyed and resurrected and then blown up by the Soviets. In 1989 they",
          "Its a nice stroll trhough the park all up hill on the way there though, past the old auitorium to the 3 crosses nice views of the city form here.",
          "First you climb some stairs, i didn't find it challenging and when you get up there you have a great view. It is absolutely a must see spot.",
          "Not easy to find, but a great walk through the forest. Interesting history, with wonderful view of city. No costs.",
          "The monument has changed many times, and the current one was built in 1989 at the beginning of the Rebirth movement. It was built to replace the one that had been removed by the Soviet authorities in the 1950s, pieces of which still remain on the far side of the slope. The Hill",
          "Took the stairs, was a little hard, not gonna lie. Beautiful road though. It was worth the view of this beautiful city!!",
          "Me and my husband visited here in June 2017. It's just next to Bernardine Gardens and can also be accessed from there. It's a quick 5 minute walk up to the top on wooden steps and the view of the old town is amazing. There's plenty of grass verge around it so would also be ideal",
          "Really like this place. Not many people on a rainy day. It took me 15 mins to climb the hill, not a lot of efforts. But the view up there is really good--you can see the whole city.",
          "Walking up is just fine. The lengthy stairs are in good shape but uneven in distance from each other. No matter, just go up. The highest lookout terrace of Vilnius is waiting for you upstairs. Choose the hill with the Tower instead of this for dusk and full panorama, since from",
          "a nice little walk from the old town and great view over the city - watch out for the stairs though - a greta way to walk off a lunch",
          "The place is outside the Old Town but not the long walk (20min). It has one of the best panoramic views of the Old Town.",
          "To reach the three crosses it is required to walk for a while (from the main streets of the city). But the view from above, more than the monument itself, it is completely worth it.",
          "We were there with couple of friends, just chilling and having good time. It is really beutiful view on the city centre of Vilnius.",
          "You can see the old town and the newer parts of town very well from here. It's also in some nice parkland which is good for walking in.",
          "Good view. Need to try when visit Lithuania. Better to come in the morning so there is not blocking light for the photo.",
          "We visited here yesterday ; and even though it was a bit of a climb ; once at the top , you are afforded views all over Vilnius and they are truly breathtaking, as is the three crosses monument itself; which is a symbol of Lithuania and it's Christian roots",
          "The crosses are nice, but for most people, the fantastic views of Vilnius are the real draw. Don't let the stairs scare you off. For some reason, they are quite gentle to climb.",
          "Walking up all the stairs was totally worth this great view! You can see all of the old town and the nice greenery.",
          "Once I decided to take my daughter to this hill. She found it interesting because found out new things about Lithuanian history, there is a plate where you can read it on your own. We climbed there through one side, from the main street, and climbed down through the other side",
          "Well worth the walk for the amazing views across Vilnius. We took the wooden steps up which was great fun (definitely wouldn't be allowed under UK health & safety rules) - rickety, wobbly and steep. The walk through the park was also very beautiful as you made your way up.",
          "Besides the giving a good view over the city and the Gediminas Tower, the history about the place is also interesting.",
          "There is a bit of history around this almost sacred place. The ninety six steps and steep incline make the visit well bearable. I did it twice in three days it was so well worth the hike.",
          "Providing great view of Vilnius, and a nice walk in the woods. Watch out for the many nesting boxes in the trees. Interesting to see the old crosses which were torn down by the communists resting below the new crosses. Well maintained hill, but stairs are steep and many. If you",
          "It is very difficult to climb on this hill, but it worths it, because you can see very beautiful view from it's top.",
          "Despite its tragic history, the place is relaxing and peaceful. It was sunny and wereally enjoyed the nature.",
          "The view from the top is absolutely incredible, photos really don't do it justice so if you feel up to the climb this really is a must see. We took a path up some old wooden stairs which was quite an adventure, several steps are broken and a little wobbly but if you take your",
          "Amazing views over the town and a scenic walk to the top. There's a beautiful park at the bottom of the hill too.",
          "Slightly removed from the Old Town of Vilnius, the Crosses Hill is definitely one of the must-visit local landmarks. From the top, one is rewarded for the trek up the hill with a stunning view of the city - both old and new. If you make it up for sunset, you can see the whole",
          "It allows you to contemplate Vilnius in another perspective since you will be on a higher spot, although I must say that to get there requires to be in a good shape!",
          "Not for the unfit!! A dirt track along the river leads to the wooden stairs that lead up the hill. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes. The stairs are in a state of disrepair, many steps are broken or wobbly, be careful when it's damp it's a bit slippery as well. The climb is",
          "This place offers an exceptional view on the entire Vilnius city, including the Old Town and the newer districts.",
          "Great view from the hill! The steers to the hill is awful, partly broken. Must see and climb if you in Vilnius!",
          "It does have some great panoramic views of the whole city including the famous TV tower in the background, but the climb is a. Little steep and precarious. Wooden steps have been built into the hillside, some of them are broken, and there is no rail at all. There is not really",
          "The Hill of Three Crosses has it's own story. It's worth to visit while in Vilnius. Since you'll be climbing up hill, you'll also get a good exercise.",
          "We followed the path through Bernadine Gardens to find the route to the top of the Hill of Three Crosses. There are large map display boards which make it easy. About half way up the path turns into a wooden stairway. Some of the steps have become dislodged which looks a",
          "It's a hill with three crosses on it. Gentle path up and down and a great view of vilnius from the top.",
          "Be sure you are quite fit though! The climb is fairly steep and if there are wooden steps in most places, they tend to be in poor condition. The views are worth it though. It's a lovely location surrounded by trees and birdsong (there are numerous birdhouses in the forest).",
          "We saw the 3 crosses from some of our walks. Fortunately a friend drove us up the hill. Unfortunately it was a bit foggy and overcast. Still, the view was great, and we could see many landmarks that we visited or walked by at street level. Also interesting were the",
          "Getting up here was more challenging than I anticipated - I did not wear proper shoes as I did not realize it would be a mini hike! But once you make it up the hill, the views are outstanding. I was here for sunset and it was 30 minutes of pure beauty watching the colors of the",
          "The views from the top are lovely. Enter through Bernadine Gardens and up the steep, warn wooden stairs. Currently the best way to view the Tower. I also liked the old, ruined crosses laying down.",
          "You will have a walk to reach there and it take almost 15 minutes from Cathedral square. It was amazing view from the hill. A must see place if you want to see the whole city. A panoramic view of the city. The hill has legend too.",
          "Nice place to walk, a good point with city-view, and boards with description of places and some historical facts make the trip interesting and easy",
          "It was a nice walk uphill to reach the top. I took it from the park bellow up the wooden broken stairs until I reached the top. the view was nice but the crosses are not well maintained. going down i took the paved road. abit longer but safer for older people.",
          "Great place. I love climbing hills and seeing the city from a above. It was rather cold but the view was great. The crosses make for some great photos. Enjoy walking around the whole hill as well. There are several places to explore.",
          "It is well worth the short walk up hill to reach the Three Crosses. It was windy when we visited but the views made it worth it.",
          "This is better than Gediminas tower hill. Great view of The Old Town. Doubt that you can get any better photos than from there.",
          "Climb the rickety stairs that go on forever, and then wait for your reward: a wonderful view over the city and beautiful crosses reaching skyward.",
          "Stunning view of the old town after a short walk up to the Hill of Crosses. As the name suggests, it is a huge monument with three stone crosses looking down over the old town. The views from up here are marvellous. it is not a tough climb but I did it in thick snow! Not so easy",
          "We hiked up the hill in winter and the stairs vere slippery so you have to be careful. The view from the hill is worth the hike because you can see all over Vilnius. Does not take to long to hike up there.",
          "A good climb. The views at the top are great. You hike up through a beautiful forest. At the top you can see the Old Town and across the river to the newer parts of Vilnius. Some plaques at the top to let you know the history. (like much in Lithuania the Russians tried to",
          "We headed up the hill of the three crosses on a very cold snowy day but wrapped up warm it was still a nice walk. The crosses are nice and the views from the top of the hill were lovely even though it was dull, snowy and murky. They must be stunning on a clear sunny day.",
          "We saw the crosses on a hill in the distance as we climbed the mount up to Germany's fort and the views from the top All we can say is it was to make a distant photo , should we have taken the time to climb up the hill , very steep hill on which the crosses stood , so unless",
          "Enjoyable walk up to the 3 crosses even in February. We wen. up via the arsenal side and came down the Bernadine gardens side - lots of steps, The crosses themselves are in need of a bit if tlc but a good view of Vilnius is offered at the top.",
          "Because the Gedeminas tower was closed, we decided to climb up to the 3 crosses to get a view of the city. Getting up, despite the ice was fine, however getting back down proved to be more challenging!!! We decided to walk down to Uzupis, but ended up having to scale down a",
          "Whether you want to have comparatively long and uphill walk \u2013 it is for you! And it worth! You will have the best view on Vilnius, including you could have from the Gediminas Tower, since here you are ABOVE the Tower! So if you have enough stamina, I would recommend going here",
          "We visited during February which made the walk up to the Three Crosses a little treacherous, but the view was definitely worth it!",
          "This hill is so high to someone who doesn't like to do any sport haha. The view is really cool, you should see it!! Totally worth the effort you put on it to reach the top!",
          "For hike lovers right in the middle of the old town unbelievable panorama of the old and new town. You can plan you trip to your time table, it takes around 30-45 from the bottom to the crosses",
          "Take my advice and take the bus . I live hiking and walking but even so after a long day - having walked more than 10 km - it was a struggle. It's on a steep hill , it was snowing and very cold ... 2-3 km from old town . The views on top make it worth while. Instead of walking",
          "This attractions from the hill on the east offer you a good view of the city of Vilnius. You could see the view of the city stretch from the north, the west and all the way to the South. Its a stunning view.",
          "Climb was a bit difficult because of the ice but worth it. Very nice that again here a sign with the legend and factual history of the hill.",
          "Even on a cold snowy day, this was an energetic walk up the steps from the River Vilnius to the top where the views are stunning. A walk down the other side to the main river provides a less steep climb",
          "To get to the top of the hill,you have to climb wooden steps,that are in such awful condition that i'm not really how we got up and down(!) the hill safe and sound.",
          "Not much to say, just a great sight, definetly worth visiting and seing. You can see city from top there and it is very inspirational (inspiring)",
          "One of the places with amazing view of the city! However takes some time and effort to get there, but is worth it!",
          "It is a long climb up to this site but it is wort every step. You can get a good view up here. The three big tall crosses were very enchanting and breathtaking.",
          "A short walk up the hill, not that high up, great view of the city! It was a good walk even on a cloudy day.",
          "Good view to Vilnius old Town. Long way to Hill but, if you find sunny day, you must see this view. If you need, you can park your car a half way to hill.",
          "Landmark and symbol of Vilnius. The Three Crosses are on a hill adjacent to the Upper Castle. You can climb up the steps for the view.",
          "Just took pictures from the garden below but you can climb up the hill and enjoy this magnificient view of the three crosses",
          "We visited this in December 2016. There was a lot of snow on the ground, which was quite compacted. There are 238 steps to climb with a number of other smaller hills to climb. However, when you arrive at the top it is definitely the view and understanding of the monument.",
          "I only go to religious sites because they are culturally interesting and not for their purpose. This site is very unique but popular with the crowds. We went by car so it was easy to reach.",
          "Everyone visiting Vilnius should visit Hill of three crosses. From this viewpoint you can see all Vilnius Old Town. There is couple of legends about the origin of three crosses monument so try to read it before visiting. Remember that the way up the hill is not easy and it might",
          "Not really sure how to review this place. It's a nice park with a small river running around it and you walk up a hill to where the 3 crosses are. Great views over the city on a clear day but not much else to do up there.",
          "The walk up the hill to the three crosses starts in a lovely park and then progresses in zig zags up the hill through fairly open trees. it's fairly steep although not difficult but it's worth it for the views of the city and river from alongside the crosses at the top.",
          "We visited the place during the night. We went through a steep, dark path in the forest followed by concrete steps. There is no wheelchair access and the crosses themselves are not that impressive, but the city view is pretty neat.",
          "Everything here is breath taking: both the view from the top, and the way up! Be prepared (physically and mentally) for a steep climb! That was definitely something I was not expecting once I started the \"trip\" but the view more than compensated",
          "The hill of three crosses is on a hill next to Gediminas hill but on the other side of Vilnia river. Therefore, it's more difficult to reach. Apart from that you see it perfectly once up at the central Gediminas hill, which also offers better views, so there's really no need to",
          "It is a large hill that used to be the site of a wooden castle in medieval times. Currently a park with a monument composed of three white crosses. If it is a sunny, warm day it is a nice walk exporing the hill, but not really worth the ascent in the cold or wet weather.",
          "Walked to the top of the hill. Excellent views of the town. Lovely in snowy weather and great walk back down through the woods along the river bank.",
          "This is an easy walk from Gediminas Tower, but the climb up the hill to the tower is strenuous. I watched as several people were unable to complete it. In addition, there are several broken steps. All that said, being at the crosses is spectacular and worth the effort. The",
          "You can read some historical fact on the way to the top. This may be the highest place on the city, so you should go there and take a look around on the places which you have already visited. Must seen place",
          "This hill is very popular by local and also by tourists. The families and also the tourists are comming here for enjoying beautiful view and great sunrise. It is very nice for calm evening spend with family or friends.",
          "The view of Vilnius panorama is amazing you can see the old town, the all city nice place to walk, forest, nature",
          "It was cool to visit Hill of Three Crosses. We view of Vilnius panorama was amazing. You can see all the city centre and west side of the city from there!",
          "This is the best view of Vilnius but its quite a walk. You can see it from the Tower very well as you walk up to the circular driveway as you approach the tower.",
          "The place in Vilnius Centre on a big hill from where you can see all capital of Lithuania, amazing view. The place you must visit!",
          "I did not climb to the top, since it was foggy. But I think it is worth for the view, unless you have already climbed to the castle hill.",
          "An enjoyable climb up the hill to view the crosses. There is a lack of signage as to how to get to the top. Cross the canal near the tennis courts, follow the paved path until you see a dirt path going up the hill on your left. There are wooden steps part of the way.",
          "From the hill you may see all the city and Gediminas castle. Definately worth to climb for panoramic view. You will get interesting expirience and nice photos for free\ud83d\ude0a.",
          "A little bit of walk with more than 500steps, but it is worth it! Great view of the city, even the Gediminas Tower.",
          "According to historical information. This hill / crosses are a memorial to monks who were crucified in Vinius. I did not climb the hill, but got a fine view from the top of Castle Hill which is nearby.",
          "Climbing to Hill of three crosses could be dangerous and quite hard as for low hill. Some steps are broken, so be cautious, you could broke or spin ankle! It's better to go there in summer when is warm and dry, because view is nice, you see all the old town but worst part is it",
          "A bit long way in the forest, but if you are on the top, you can enjoy a beautiful view. Recommended in nice weather.",
          "It's a stroll to the three crosses however, it's worth the walk to see the fantastic views over the city.",
          "It is a little climb to the 3 cross' but the view is definitely worth it as you can see all over the city!",
          "Interesting history we walked through the park and up the hill...not too far from City centre ..hill up to crosses quiet steep but worth the climb..am sure you could go by taxi if not able to walk far",
          "When we reached the place with the party of tourists I had an eerie sensation from the distance as I saw a hill covered with crosses, but as I got nearer I began to understand the great faith of the Lithuanians and their indomitable resistance against the communist authorities",
          "Take a short hike to the top of the hill of three crosses. It is a great location to great location to view the city of Vilnius.",
          "Another nice view of the city, not a hard walk so would recommend it, the weather was ok for me, but can imagine it not being that enjoyable in bad weather.",
          "Amazing view of the whole town! Walking might take a while but it's enjoyable as you can pass across the forest /park along the river",
          "Don't miss this place. You can reach it taking the steps from the Bernardinai gardens. Probably the highest place in Vilnius, which offers stunning views.",
          "Nice to get into a bit of countryside in the middle of a city visit. The story of the 3 crosses adds to your understanding of Lithuanian history, and it's a nice view from the top. Suggest going up the steps on the SW side then down the path and road on the opposite side.",
          "Struggling up the steep side of the hill, I finally had the opportunity to get photos of the crosses. Um\u2026 Ever try to take pix of trees when standing at the base? I deleted them, focusing on the view, especially of U\u017eupis. I located the distinctive red brick Baroque Saint Anne",
          "An amazing place to see and a great panorama over the city and its fortress. There are also explanations regarding the history and the meaning of these three crosses. One bad point though, at night there is no light at all in the park leading to the crosses, bring your torch",
          "A steep climb up from the front, less steep from the back. Walking through the gardens yo get there is an added bonus. But well worth it to see a wonderful panorama of the city. The crosses themselves are attractive, but it's quite difficult to get sufficient perspective to",
          "Although you need to go up the hill - it's worth it! And a very positive thing - while we were there (end of August) not many people, so you can enjoy the view in peace and quiet! :)",

          "You can see almost the whole Vilnius old town from here. In a good weather and clear sky I recommend taking a camera with you, you will not regret it, does not matter if it is day or night time. But be prepared to climb a lot, because there is no elevator or any other lifting",
          "Bit of a climb to get to the 3 Crosses but a great view and worth the effort. Come up from the river side, but only if you are fit enough!",

          "It is not very hard to climb a most of hills, but hill of Three Crosses is good known not only by one of the best view in Vilnius, but also as one of most terrible stairs. Also, if you want to enjoy night view - there is no normal light, just few bulbs so it is not very safe.",

          "Its a very steep hill up to the top of the hill, whichever direction you come at it, but the views of the Old Town and Gediminas Tower are amazing! The structure itself is really impressive too. Try to come on a clear day for the best views.",

          "15 minutes steep walk up the hill was really worth it. When we came up we could see both old and new Vilnius. And the view was better than from Gediminas Tower, since the altitude was higher.",
          "Nice view of the city but without a cab or car I doubt you would want to walk it. The crosses has been there in some form since the 16th century",

          "The walk to the Crosses is steep, but the views are worthwhile. I recommend taking the road up the back instead of the stairs on the other side, due to the stairs being unstable and some planks are even missing.",

          "The walk up the hill is pleasant -- and if you do it fast enough, can count as a work out -- and there weren't any crowds up at the top. Photographers: The view would have perfect lighting in the morning! It's very green and great for nature lovers and peace lovers. Make sure,",
          "From the viewing platform, you get a similar view of the city as from Gediminas Tower, except you can also have Gediminas Tower in your photo! When you go down the stairs from the viewing platform, note the ruins of the original three crosses on the ground, which are now",

        "wiki": "The Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights (Lithuanian: Okupacij\u0173 ir laisv\u0117s kov\u0173 muziejus), previously the Museum of Genocide Victims (Lithuanian: Genocido auk\u0173 muziejus), in Vilnius, Lithuania was established in 1992 by order of the Minister of Culture and Education and the President of the Lithuanian Union of Political Prisoners and Deportees. In 1997 it was transferred to the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania. The museum is located in the former KGB headquarters across from the Luki\u0161k\u0117s Square; therefore, it is informally referred to as the KGB Museum.The museum is dedicated mostly to collecting and exhibiting documents relating to the 50-year occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union, the anti-Soviet Lithuanian partisans, and the victims of the arrests, deportations, and executions that took place during this period. Before 2018, the museum was known as the Museum of Genocide Victims, reflecting a broadened definition of the term \"genocide\" used by the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre. Although these events are considered a genocide only by a few historians, just a small part of the space is devoted to the Holocaust in Lithuania, the event that is universally considered a genocide. In 2018, the museum was thus renamed the Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights.\n\n\n== History of the building ==\n\nDuring the 19th century, Lithuania was part of the Russian Empire. The building, completed in 1890, originally housed the court of the Vilna Governorate. The German Empire used it during its World War I occupation of the country. After independence was declared, it served as a conscription center for the newly formed Lithuanian army and as the Vilnius commander's headquarters. During the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, the city was briefly taken by the Bolsheviks, and the building housed commissariats and a revolutionary tribunal. Following \u017beligowski's Mutiny of 1920, Vilnius and its surroundings were incorporated into Poland, and the building housed the courts of justice for the Wilno Voivodship.\nLithuania was invaded by the Soviet Union in 1940, and following an ultimatum, became a Soviet Socialist Republic. Mass arrests and deportations followed, and the building's basement became a prison. In 1941 Nazi Germany invaded the country; the building then housed the Gestapo headquarters. Inscriptions on the cell walls from this era remain. The Soviets retook the country in 1944, and from then until independence was re-established in 1991, the building was used by the KGB, housing offices, a prison, and an interrogation center. Over 1,000 prisoners were executed in the basement between 1944 and the early 1960s, about one-third for resisting the occupation. Most bodies were buried in the Tuskul\u0117nai Manor, which underwent reconstruction and hosts a branch of the museum.In addition to housing the museum, the building now serves as a courthouse and as the repository of the Lithuanian Special Archives.\n\n\n== Collections ==\n\nThe non-violent aspect of the resistance is represented by various books, underground publications, documents, and photographs. The collection pertaining to the Forest Brothers' armed resistance includes documents and photographs of the partisans. A section devoted to the victims of deportations, arrests, and executions holds photographs, documents, and personal belongings; this collection is continually expanded by donations from the public, seeing the museum as the best means of preserving the materials.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nNo exposition devoted to the Holocaust in Lithuania existed in the Museum of Genocide Victims until 2011, despite the fact that more Jews were killed in Lithuania than in Germany, both in relative and absolute numbers, and that only a few historians believe Soviet repression against the Lithuanians constituted a genocide. To address international criticism, a small exposition describing the Holocaust in Lithuania was added in 2011.  In April 2018, after a piece by Rod Nordland in The New York Times quoted Dovid Katz as saying the museum was \"a 21st-century version of Holocaust denial\", the museum changed its name to the Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights. As of 2020, the museum \"focuses almost entirely on the murder of the Lithuanian non-Jewish population, while perpetrators of the Holocaust are lauded as victims in their countries\u2019 struggle against Soviet occupation.\"\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial website - History of the building\nOfficial website - The former execution camera\nOfficial website - Collections",

          "This is a great must see museum. There is a lot of information. The first floor of the museum covers the fight for Lithuanian indepencdence, the second floor covers life under the KGB, and the basement allows vistors a look inside the KGB prison and explains what life was like",
          "We have just returned home from a trip to Vilnius and whist there we visited the KGB museum. The entry price is \u20ac4 which I felt was very reasonable. We learned a lot about the Russification of Lithuania and how the KGB operated until Lithuania finally regained their independence",
          "This place is amazing. You'll be entering a building where the bureaucratic machinery of true evil did its work -- first, Nazis, and then the Soviets/KGB. Over a thousand people were murdered in that building -- and how many thousands and thousands more suffered unspeakable",

          "This museum provides a very detailed view of life under the repressive Nazi and Soviet eras of Vilnius\u2019s history. I think it\u2019s great for anyone who is genuinely interested in life under these occupiers, but isn\u2019t a \u201cmust see\u201d museum.",

          "Wow. 5 euros expensive to pay respect to all those Lithuanians that suffered? I think not!! Loads to see if you have the inclination to do so, which hopefully you do. Interesting exhibits upstairs about 20th century Lithuanian life and the struggles and suffering their people",
          "Always find it hard to review things like this. Seeing the cells particularly the padded cell and the rooms that were used for torture will stay with me forever. The fact that they were used as recent as the 90\u2019s came as a real shock. I think this is a place that should not be",
          "this museum was really interesting, dont't miss the chance to visit, a tribute to the suffering of lithuanian peple during soviet occupation",
          "This place presents the history of occupied Lithuania in past times and how these people managed to overcome that and become what they are today. A great place where you can learn more about Soviet and Nazi oppression against Lithuanians",

          "This is a very sobering experience, but we all need to know what happened in those dark days. We had a tour, but I believe you can also walk around on your own and spend more time there. Highly recommend all do this, but not for children.",
          "A chilling place to visit. To stand where hundreds of victims of Soviet oppression where tortured and executed is very disturbing. A must visit if visiting Vilineus.",
          "The museum is definitely worth seeing, it leaves you a bit sad, but at the same time you understand the painful history Lithuanian people had to experience better. After the tour it will leave you thinking about it for some more time. I wouldn't go there a second time, but it",

          "A truly emotional experience. Hard to comprehend some of the artefacts and stories on display here. A damming indictment of humanity really. All displays are tastefully and respectfully presented. W well worth the visit, allow about 90 mins. Four euros entry fee.",
          "The KGB museum is very educational, and I learned a lot. It is also very harrowing, especially the KGB cells and execution chamber underneath. It is important that we learn and remember though, and I highly recommend visiting.",
          "Was taken here by my partner- who is Lithuanian, so I could see the suffering they went through at the hands of the soviet regime. Truly a harrowing experience.",
          "This place is a testimony to Soviet atrocities committed in Lithuania. It is a must see place, esp. for those younger people who don't know much about Soviet times. The most amazing part is the section that talks about Partisan's resistance to Soviet occupation. The basement",
          "I was initially reluctant to go in here having walked past it a few times and seen all the pictures and names carved outside. I had done my research on the area and this building left me feeling very uncomfortable. However enter inside I did and I am so glad I did. The",
          "This place truly helps you appreciate what the country went through and how they persevered. It was very crowded, but definitely worth spending the time to read the documents and displays.",
          "Perhaps because of the popularity of this Museum is the reason why the staff is indifferent !! Both young people at the cash desk were more interested in their smartphones and the PC even though people were queuing up to gain entrance or ask questions. The following day was a",
          "A must visit. I learned a lot. Naturally though be prepared to see some heavy stuff, particularly the KGB cells and execution chamber.",
          "A great place for learning about the history of Lithuania, particularly the relation between the Soviet Union and Lithuania. The prison downstairs is very impressive.",
          "Cheap entrance (only 1 euro for seniors!). Old ways of informing the visitors, but you can feel the cold of the occupation history (Soviet Union, Germany and Soviet Union again). The place is just as worn down as it was. This is good because it gets you thinking",
          "The museum is really interesting and gives comprehensive overview over the history of Lithuania. The place was very cramped though and sometimes it was hard to move. The KGB prison in the basement was also very interesting.",
          "I am very fascinated with world history and was excited to go to this KGB museum during my visit to Vilnius, but was a little disappointed. I found the layout of the museum to be a little difficult to maneuver with the flow of people. I understand a historic building like this",
          "Intensive collection of materials covering Lithuania under Soviet rule. You can spend hours reading the materials at each exhibit. It is very comprehensive. The prisoner cells in the basement are so eerie!!",
          "Whilst most of us Westeners were involved figting Korea, Vietnam and our own scrapes the people of the Baltics were busy with their own battles in their backyards. We all need to know, understand and remember. A visit to this museum is a must. Maybe the current U.S. President",
          "Informative with a Russia is the bad guy twist. Terrible things done to a lot of different people/ races. Decent collection of post war stuff.",
          "Excellent museum, disturbing and moving as well as very interesting to learn about the occupation periods. You will need a drink after a visit!",
          "A thought provoking visit to this museum. I learnt so much about the troubled history of this beautiful country. Only 4euro each and very well laid out. Particularly chilling was the basement which houses the KGB prison and execution chamber which was still being put to use in",
          "I didn't know much about the recent history of Lithuania, but the contents of this museum were concerning, considering it covered such a recent period. Quite comprehensive with lots of information. worth a visit",
          "Be sure to get an audio guide. I don\u2019t usually do museums, and if I do I skit around and get out ASAP. This place captured me I was in there over 3 hours. When I left my knowledge of the Baltic\u2019s and what the KGB did was 10k% improved. Saddened but pleased I went.",
          "Informative museum about what Lithuania went through not so long ago. A lot to read and take in. It will take a long time if you read the text in every room and take time to appreciate the history. Well worth a visit.",
          "Visited here on 15th September. An excellent museum that teaches you about the history of the USSR and their prescence in Lithuania.",
          "The Baltic States are rightly proud of their individual heritage and identity. This museum gives an insight into the repression of identity under the Soviet Union. There is plenty of information, well laid-out in the exhibition spaces and, downstairs, in the cells themselves.",
          "We visited this Museum of Genocide Victims, also called as KGB Museum and felt sad about the brutalities and notoriety of erstwhile Soviet Union. This premises was used by monsterous KGB as headquarters and also as prison from 1940 to 1991. Underground cells, exhibits of Soviet",
          "Museum and building overall are great, BUT. All the main historical facts are represented in written texts, and as there are audio guide numbers, so me and guests from UK were expecting to get an audio guide. Sadly we were left dissapointed, because none of the audio guides were",
          "To think that this facility was used by the KGB as recently as 1993...wow. Impeccably documented, with rooms filled with the stories of those who had been there. It was a real sobering experience.",
          "The museum itself is brilliantly laid out and informative but it is the KGB prison downstairs that really stuns and is so affecting,,,a truly moving and sobering experience",
          "The KGB were housed in this rather boring but stately building. It was their HQ for unleashing a terror campaign of murder, imprisonment and expulsion on the Lithuanian population. The first and second floors of the building provide a comprehensive and detailed narrative of",
          "Lithuania went through years of turmoil. I'm sure it can be felt in this most austere reminder of darker days. I lost my friends and walked round most of it on my own. The torture cells and execution chamber are chilling. So much to read and take in throughout this excellent",
          "One of the most moving museums I have ever visited. Plenty of information on both times Lithuania was ruled by the USSR in 1940 to 1941 and 1944 to 1989, also occupied by Nazi Germany at one point too. Seeing all the memorabilia was very interesting including all the",
          "The museum came highly recommended, so I made a concerted effort to see it on my last day in Vilnius and Lithuania. Very compelling. I was amazed at how \u201crecent\u201d some of the activities of eavesdropping were. The Lithuanian people have been through lots and are so committed to",
          "Large museum with lots to see. Good descriptions of how the building and rooms were used and lots of rooms to explore. Educational to further understand the horrific treatment of persecuted individuals and hopefully keep a living memory to prevent repetition in the future.",
          "There should be seen. All 3 floors. Basement was prison during soviet invention. There was Nazi headquarter during second war. Still KGB evidances at there",
          "When people ask \u2018How was it?\u2019... enjoyable is not the word. I went to find out more about the Lithuania\u2019s history. The top two floors give you a breakdown of what has happened to this beautiful country. You need to read a lot of information on boards on these floors. The KGB",
          "Am not a local but did go in - enough English on the printed boards to help. Weird knowing alot of this happened not really all that many years back.",
          "This museum was established in 1992 in a former KGB building as a symbol to all Eastern Europeans of the Soviet occupation & brutality and to remind future generations of the time between 1940 to 1990 so that history is never repeated!! The museum includes the authentic prison",
          "Very informative, with lots of reading in rather small crowded rooms. It was a very warm day, plus many tourists meant that we rather \u201craced\u201d through the museum. I am sure it would have been a different experience on a cooler less crowded day. However we were able to purchase",
          "This museum is a must! On the ground floor there is an exhibition explaining about the kgb but go down the stairs and you are hit by what it was really like. We went with a guide who explained the various rooms to us. It is unimaginable what horror greeted them in these cells!",
          "Really worth coming and having a look. Learnt a lot about the struggles of the Lithuanian people. \u20ac4 There are some \u201cGorey\u201d bits ( execution room video) so if you are taking young children please monitor what they are allowed to see",
          "If you really want to know the evils of communism, this is the place to visit. The museum is located within actual former KGB facilties. It is very sad to see the history of how Russia surpressed the Lithuanians.",
          "The Museum of Genocide Victims is housed in the former KGB building which became the headquarters of the Gestapo in 1941 and then the KGB in 1944. The KGB stayed until 1991 when Lithuania became independent from the Soviet Union. The museum is divided into two parts \u2013 the",
          "I was really excited to visit this museum; however, it felt more like reading a history on walls than a museum. The rooms are very small, and I went at a particularly crowded time. It was hot and stuffy. The text was sometimes difficult to read because it was usually white type",
          "Creepy cells, torture rooms and execution room. Worth of visiting. Audioguide helps you to undrestand events better.",
          "Good exhibition - maybe slightly confusing and toi much text mut overall really good! Getting to know the prison was creepy and super interesting!",
          "A must in Lithuania. To remember for good, events like that are still present in many parts of the world, and in Europe it happened just few decades ago..",
          "Best place to feel a horror, despair, brutality of any terror machine. Visiting a place of Soviet tortures reminds me traveling through G.Orwell, A.Johnson books.",
          "If you visit one museum in Vilnius, let it be this one. A combination of actual prison cells (left as authentic as possible after the KGB left), and the uplifting struggle and daily life of the Lithuanian people during Soviet occupation.",
          "This museum is very well done, a full picture of lithuania in world wars and under soviet rule. The prison cells are horrific but tastefully explained.",
          "A sobering but necessary visit. You need two hours at least to read everything. It was a good introduction to the recent history of Lithuania.",
          "Learned so much of Lithuania's shocking past. This really moved me. Would recommend and very reasonable entry price.",
          "The Baltics had it worse than other countries during World War II and after because it was caught between Germany and Russia and there were no good choices. Really brings the partisan effort to life and what they went through to get to independence.",
          "To see the cells where political prisoners were kept and the torture methods used it's amazing any one survived although many didn't. Certainly worth a visit.",
          "I visited here with my 9yo son as I think it\u2019s important for kids to see what happened in the not too distant past. The museum is relatively basic but with good exhibits in English. Yes, some of it is shocking, but i think that\u2019s better than ignoring the past. Entrance fee is",
          "I did not learn much about the Soviet Occupation of Lithuania in school or growing up. As others have mentioned, the basement with the cells and the execution chamber is certainly the most chilling. I learned so much in the upper two floors about the Lithuanian resistance, KGB",
          "It is hard to say whether this museum is enjoyable to visit. It is important to visit though. Expertly curated, the museum documents the occupation years from the Second World War with detail yet seemingly without over propagandist method. Above all, it is a reminder of",
          "This museum shows the last years of Lithuania's history. It's an important experience if you want to better understand how and why Lithuania became what it is, take a close look at the dark pages of lithuanian and european history. It's a very organised and comprehensive",
          "I have to start by saying that I didn't go in. I went on a Tuesday to find that the museum is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, and I was leaving the city the next day. That said, there was still a lot to see externally. The names of people who died during the Soviet repression",
          "The museum is a must but there is a rewriting of history. It highlights the freedom fighting of Lithuanians and their suffering but, for two exceptions, downplays the Jews who suffered the most. It highlights 300 priests who were prisoners. So compare 200,000 murdered Jews",
          "This museum is a little tricky to find but well worth the visit. It's slightly out from the center of town, but an easy walk. It is in the old KGB gaol which is fascinating, as most of it is how it was, when prisoners were kept there. It is a wonderful display of the history of",
          "It is very informative and you shouldn\u2019t miss it. It presents lots of pictures and objects of the period, and it is unfortunately also very realistic since it is located in the actual KGB premises with prison, execution room and so on. I don\u2019t rate it 5 stars since it isn\u2019t top",
          "This is not a museum for quick or easy visit. You visit torture and execution chambers. I had not fully taken in what we were visiting or the horror of it- akin to visiting one of the concentration camps. This is a important site to visit and should serve a reminder of the",
          "This is a three floor exhibition set in the centre of Vilnius. The first two floors begin with information and artefacts relating to those that tried to resist first the invasion by Germany in 1941 then the move towards Russification during the Soviet era. Outside each room is",
          "The basement was my favourite part of the trip, but albeit because it was a bit eerie, and trying to imagine being a prisoner there, was horrific. Even the outside part with where prisoners got outdoor time, is eye opening! Upstairs has a range of things on show, which was",
          "I have visited many of the e termination camps in Austria, Poland etc. And found this was \u201cmore of the same\u201d -a look into the terrible things man has found to threaten, torture and extract information or whatever needed in needed times. I can\u2019t understand it and hated looking",
          "This museum is excellent. I spent two hours here in July 2019. I was very impressed with the displays regarding the Soviet occupation of Lithuania during and following World War II. Of course, there is much sadness in the stories, but it is also inspiring and uplifting to",
          "The museum is small; most of the exhibits are descriptive in nature. But the basement is full of the tiny cells where the accused were held and interrogated. The cells are small, claustrophobic, unforgiving. The entire tour can be done in an hour; the exhibits are not that",
          "This museum glorifies Lithuania during WWII and the Soviet period. I love Lithuania, but these were dark years, which this museum papers over. It provides inaccurate information about the involvement of Lithuanians in the Holocaust, and gives the impression that Lithuanians",
          "Regrettably this was closed for St John's Day; however, they did have a number of interesting displays, monuments, etc., around and on the exterior of the building. There were a number of memorials to the lost souls during Lithuania's occupation; well worth a visit even if the",
          "Lot of sad history presented, interesting to read about what people went through. Some potential to make it more interesting.",
          "I bring my foreign friends there. So they learn Lithuanian history and what happened for us with Russians. They don\u2019t make any comments about me being somewhat Russian after. Definitely a recommend.",
          "Although the museum was experiencing some air conditioning issues, they were open and because of the problem did not charge admission. Even through I have been to Vilnius numerous times this was my first visit to the museum. It was both educational and interesting and nothing is",
          "Known as KGB museum shows all the suffering of Lithuanian nation.The exhibition is outdated but so authentic. Highly recommended. Not accesible for disabled clients.",
          "Well worth time spent here especially the execution room and film. This has been my 2nd visit. I have in the past taken a Russian friend. She did not like it at all but did not explain why.",
          "Very good displays covering occupation, mainly by the USSR but also by the Nazis. Got there at 3:30. It closed at 5:00, so didn't see everything.",
          "The building doesn't feel as it has changed much since it was occupied by the Soviets. It feels gritty and rough. The tour of the building starts in the basement, where you walk down the same steps as those who were held there as prisoners. You see the entire trail of their",
          "Cheap museum but very interesting location. The information was all written clearly in Lithuanian and English. Go if you should know more about the way Lithuanian were treated by the USSR and Germany around 1940.",
          "A must visit site. Scares me how it is just so natural and was part of daily life. The cells with the water - won't give too much away - are haunting.",
          "An important and horrifying aspect of the Russian occupation and the way the KGB dealt with dissent. A must see, especially for anyone that thinks we have it bad in North America.",
          "Step by step tour with a guide showing where Russian prisoners were held and how they were processed and treated. Very knowledgeable onsite guide.",
          "While the topic was new to us and very interesting, there is so much text in this museum that we quickly got overwhelmed and fatigued. If the text was cut in half in each room the impact would be much greater. Also, the rooms and hallways are very small and there were several",
          "Lots of displays and information. Unbelievable how the old Soviet Union treated people. It was surreal to walk into old jail cells, see actual uniforms, and see the execution chamber. Makes one really appreciate freedom.",
          "My friend and I visited the museum on 16th May. We are very interested in 20th century history and it was our first visit to the Baltics so we wanted to learn and understand the experience of Lithuanians under Soviet regime and the Nazi regime. The museum was formally the",
          "Very impressive and informative site. After the visit, one realizes that freedom should not be taken for granted. This is horrible history for Lithuania. A recent reminder of history in regards to the way of life then such as cells to execution room. Something you have to see",
          "The old Soviet Union really had their thumb on Lithuania. There are lots of interesting displays - photos, etc. and of course the \"cells\" for political prisoners. They're glad to be part of the E'U now...",
          "Price: 4 euro, 2 euro to take photos, 3 euro audio guide, 10 euro guided tour Description: museum detailing the crimes committed during world war 2 and the Soviet occupation. Three floors. We visited on the day of mourning so the museum was free. It is not open Sunday or",
          "All of you missing in this dramatic museum are the low life communists.... as this museum is the real dramatic deal of realists....I will recommend...",
          "Very impressive. After a visit you will realise again that real freedom is not something to be taken for granted",
          "It was free entry the day I visited, not sure it would have been worth \u20ac4 though. The prison was quite interesting if you are into Soviet history, but having been to Auschwitz and Robben Island it\u2019s nothing in comparison. It\u2019s a bit of a walk from the old town area too.",
          "Walk up from old town is worth understanding the more horrible history of Lithuania. In the original building used by Nazi and then KGB the People's history is compellingly portrayed. Cells to execution rooms are a grim reminder of very recent history.",
          "This was the Old KGB buildings but now more of s student movement and it has all the names of people mostly died young during the World War 11 years or shortly after on the walls",
          "The highlight of our trip to Vilnius. Get a guide to take you through this depressing but historic museum. The artwork by the children prior to entering the museum is haunting",
          "Very inexpensive museum. The execution room is not for the faint hearted. It it brutal and confronting. The history of the KGB was largely what we were expecting but nevertheless it was well worth the visit. A huge building with only a tiny portion open but you can easily",
          "This museum is a chaotic jumble of random stuff. The organization is very poor. It is a pity given the importance of the topic.",
          "The building housed the former headquarters of the Russian KGB and before them the Gestapo. It is now an interesting but 'grizzly' museum dedicated to the thousands of Lithuanians who were murdered or deported by the KGB from WW II until the 1960's.The basement brought home the",
          "Highly recomend to visit with teenagers whose are to far from real events of our lives. There you can feel what was real communism. Refined terror in every sense...",
          "This is a good place to spend a couple of hours and it's definitely worth going round the basement prison.",
          "The building is split over three floors. In the basement, the exhibit presents the KGB cells, interrogation rooms and the torture rooms. There are some grueling descriptions of what actions were conducted in this place, as well as testimonies of the detainees' conditions and",
          "It was a lot of reading in this museum, to much for me. But the KGB prisoncells in the basement was very scary and real and something i highly recommend.",
          "My partner and I learnt a lot about the occupation of Russian troops in Lithuania. A lot of information I previously did not know. Great combination of visual and written depictions. Going downstairs into the former dungeon cells and torture rooms was eerie.",
          "Having visited many a genocide museum across the world, we were recommended this one. It did not disappoint. We learned plenty on a subject we knew very little about. I recommend doing the museum first then going downstairs to the KGB prison as this was better in my opinion.",
          "Visited this place as a couple. Great museum. Very informative from start to finish and a good size. Could spend a couple of hours here if you wanted but we completed it in an hour. Good value for money, slightly crowded on the day we visited but no one can change that. Well",
          "This is a must visit in Vilnius. The displays are excellent and the amount of reading is not overwhelming although there is a lot. Don\u2019t try and do the whole lot.",
          "We had a bit of trouble locating this museum as the name on the building is not KGB and even the sign on the corner in English says Genocide Museum. The entrance is around the corner though massive doors and up steps into a really depressing closed-in hallway. However, the",
          "We visited with friends whilst we were on a tour of the Baltic capitals. This was a very informative but sobering visit which provided an insight into occupation by both the Soviet Union and the Nazis.",
          "It is quite frightening to think how recently the prison was operating and so we had a sombre stroll through the cells. Worth visiting to help understand the recent history of Lithuania.",
          "I visited the museum and gained entry for free due to it being International Musuem day. Very humbling to realise how the people had been treated from WW2 onwards. Worth a visit.",
          "So glad we toured this to see how the Russian politics really work. So glad the Lithuania persevered. Anyone believing in socialism should come here.",
          "This museum is really good and interesting. There are many facts which let you get better understanding. We spent almost 3hours to go around, so it's really worth it.",
          "As the name \"Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights\" indicates, the exhibits give the Lithuanian perspective of being caught between Germany and Russia. The grim basement houses prison cells, padded rooms, and the execution chamber. The upper level is well-curated, provides",
          "If you want to understand Lithuania today, you must go here. It\u2019s worth the time and effort. A powerful reminder of a history that remains important now.",
          "Looking at the building\u2019s photo, one thinks of a stately appointed location for the country\u2019s recent history defining memorial. Well, the museum has only half-a-wing on each floor, plus a part of the basement and yard, and the appearance inside is no match to the freshly painted",
          "Lot's of information, not just about the KGB but also about the Nazi occupation and the partisan resistance to both foreign powers. The prison section is the most harrowing especially the execution chamber and the exercise hard strangely enough. Well worth a few hours of your",
          "We were curious to see this and were not disappointed. To be honest, it was a little macabre but confirmed what we believed. There are many, many exhibits and translations. Very well put together. Worth a visit.",
          "was different than i expected, it showed you all about the partisans and the Lithuanian people back in the war days. expected a couple of rooms, but there was 3 floors with the cells downstairs, the place was easy to find and not over priced",
          "For such a sensitive topic, the museum was very well done. It had a lot of information available to read, as well as pictures/ videos/ artefacts. They even have the prison cells (including execution room) in tact downstairs. Definitely recommend visiting here, to see such an",
          "Good place plenty to experience,host on the ticket desk very stern,won\u2019t get a smile or any form of greeting but the venue is worth a look",
          "Full of History, me and my boyfriend loved it. The Chambers are so authentic you can feel the pain people felt in there. Unique and emotional experience.",
          "Geography dealt the Baltic States a cruel blow when it gave them large, imperialistic powers as neighbours. The Nazi's and Soviets made Lithuania suffer, but this museum reveals the absolute courage of some of the citizens of this country in resisting. I never knew that",
          "A must place to g. Start with the basement and beware it is not easy to see but it's very important to know to remember and to pass It to other",
          "The place is well looked after, the interaction with staff is minimal but they are professionals. The exhibition was well presented and all the information is in English. The highlight is the prisons in the basement.",
          "visited beacuse it was part of our tour-well worth the visit-sad, somber, educational something we don't ever want repeated-showed how the city/county of Vilnius suffered under the occupation of the Gereman Nazi's & then the communist Russians. we did have a guide [that spoke",
          "Our visit to the KGB museum was an informative tour and somewhat emotional connection to the almost 55 years Lithuanian people's suffered under occupation by the USSR and Nazi Third Reich. It worth a visit to learn anout and remember this period in Lithuanian and World history.",
          "So must history. Creepy and a bit depressing but one must not deny what happened in this building of horrors.",
          "The museum chronicles the grim part of Lithuania\u2019s history under the Nazi and Soviet occupation. The upper floor covers the timeline of the partisans resistance against the occupiers, and the day to day life during that period. There\u2019s a lot of information to read and take it so",
          "Very well posited and descriptive Museum, depicting the recent history of the country throughout both the German and Soviet occupation. A big collection of items from these periods, as well as important information (all in English as well). The prison at the basement has all",
          "Very impressive museum with tons of information about the occupation of the Russians and some info on the German occupation too. Very well realized. To me is a must to see.",
          "The museum is great. I learned and felt the struggle of Lithuanians during the Soviet occupation. I would very much recommend this museum for anyone interested in understanding the history of Lithuania and of the other occupied countries. I would maybe skip seeing the basement,",
          "Really interesting, gave a good overview about recent Lithuanian history and how people were oppressed by the Soviets. The museum is located in the actual KGB office, so you can go down to the cellars and see where prisoners were kept and read about how they were tortured etc -",
          "We went to the KGB museum at Vilnius. The official names seem a little confused. As a person lived in Communist ruling this place caused recall of the dark periods under Soviet Union. I admired people in Baltic countries constant resistance and fighting. I also learned how the",
          "This museum is free to enter. The ground floor is mostly information and items about the freedom fighters in Lithuania. The basement is a KGB prison showing you cells, solitary confinement, torture rooms, execution chamber, and lots of other nightmare inducing things. We didn\u2019t",

          "We knew very little about the history of Lithuania under the Soviet Occupation. However this museum is very informative and detailed. The museum is very haunting and heartbreaking but very important to see. The KGB prison is in particular very eye- opening. Very reasonably",
          "KGB museum is definitely a place to visit in order to understand the history of Lithuania, information was detailed enough with some visuals to create imagination of what really happened in the soviet days..... will recommend it always",
          "A very drab and run down building which has been left as it was a stark reminder of the inhumanity that existed and still exists in our world today. I was shocked at how recent some of the atrocities were and how much had happened in my lifetime without me being aware. I was",
          "I visited this former KGB prison with my younger son (10 years old) and we both were deeply impressed. This was a cruel place where KGB kept and tortured Lithuanian residents and partisans - Lithuanian freedom fighters. It helped us to understand better the history of Lithuania",
          "Compact enough museum with interesting content and well narrated. Particularly the jail area was informative. Stepping into the old cells gave you a idea what it was like and the courtyard and death chamber gave an accurate picture of the horrors.",
          "Big place and lots to see. Found some parts very depressing but that's how it was . Hard to think people were so cruel. Well worth a visit and not expensive to go in",
          "Despite the English name, the museum actually covers more than the KGB - the upper floors contain exhibits on Lithuania's modern history of oppression and resistance under the Nazis and the USSR. The lower floors contain the cells, execution rooms and prison yard used by the",
          "Our tour of this museum what led by a local man who had lost relatives in this prison. He has spent the last 20 years studying the archives to identify collaborators. So this is very personal to him and really made the atrocities come alive. this tour is very informative, you",
          "Spent an hour browsing artifacts and exploring the history of the KGB in Lithuania. Well worth a visit if you're into history.",
          "The KGB museum was one of our must do's on a visit to Vilnius. We found it well worth taking the time understanding how awfully people were treated and dealt with in those dark days.",
          "Great museum with a lot of reading material. We spend >2 hours here but not everyone spends that long. Well worth the 3 euro entrance fee. Provides good context for Russian occupation. Closed Tuesdays, maybe Mondays as well.",
          "This building contains some of the most inhuman revelations of Russian terror. Be prepared to experience the cells of death and torture.",
          "Recommended as the museum to see; very informative with a good overview to Lithuanian history through the soviet and nazi occupations. Definitely worth a visit; definitely extended my education on the history of the region.",
          "Very well presented exhibition highlighting the challenges and strengths of the country and the people. The museum is split over three levels with lots of artefacts.",
          "We came there lait, went just to the cellar. Tells a lot about how it was \ud83d\ude14 recommended , at lot to learn",
          "This museum is a must visit on any trip to Vilnius. So much history under one roof explained by brilliant exhibits.",
          "Just a really strange but interesting experience. Cliche.... but it was a really eerie feeling the moment we walked through the door.",
          "But still - very interesting and disturbing historical place to visit. Important part of history. It have the same martyr-like feeling as many Polish museums do and we had a feeling that it is also slightly forgetful about things that we did ourselves as nations. Some parts of",
          "Very reasonably priced to get in. We didn't bother with the audio tour - there's plenty of information on boards which are in Lithuanian and English. Also plenty of artefacts. Tells a harrowing story of this country's history, as well as allowing access to the prison, exercise",
          "An interesting but disturbing place to visit. Lots of information on the fight against the Soviets which lasted many years longer than most think. But it is harrowing and down in the prison cell level it is has an awful feel of oppression / depression about it. Everyone should",
          "I spent approximately 1.5 hours there on a Friday morning. I did not do the audio tour, but I feel that if you read everything you will need 2 hours. All the materials are in Lithuanian and English except for the Execution chamber. The museum chronicles the period from the 1930s",
          "This is a a visit that leaves you feeling a somewhat different person when you leave to when you went in. The top floor is mainly exhibits with lots of detail of this dreadful place used by both the Gestapo and KGB. The really chilling part though is the below ground cells and",
          "I always think when visiting a city for the first time it's important to try and learn the most important aspects of their history. This museum does that for Vilnius and Lithuania as a whole. The museum is 3 floors. 2 layout the the story of the country's occupied history.",
          "Caught the number 1 trolley bus here from the station and had to ask for directions to this building tucked away in a side road with very little signage. The ground floor houses the offices of the old KGB and has displays in dual language with archive photos and memorabilia over",
          "Go check it out.Interesting and intense. Heavy topics worth knowing about. Descriptions are extensive and you get the history of what went down till quite recently. There is a aura of dread, grief, sad vibes and its crazy what people can do to people. The padded room with the",
          "This place is more than just a museum about the KGB. It looks at Vilnius's occupation by the Germans during WW1, their liberation before it was quickly reclaimed as a USSR state and the time from then until its modern liberation to an independent state. Its set over three floors",
          "A very interesting place to view a disturbing part of history. Informative and well set out for English visitors. We learnt a lot about this time and about the KGB which has up to now been something we had heard was a terrible time but did not realise quite how bad. This sort of",
          "Excellent museum showing the history and methods of KGB in Lithuania. Worth visiting though the untold part of the story is how were the secret service operated in other countries at that time to compare. And how is Lithuanian modern secret service work in the country.",
          "Hard to believe that this type of complex was still going strong into the 1980's.The underground cell complex had a reception cell (little more than a broom cupboard) when a poor soul had to stand to await processing into this particular hotel. Funny thing was the conditions",
          "very good and interesting museum but it has limited capacity for foreign visitors. Both guided tours and audioguids was unavailable due to to high demand.",
          "We are in 2019 and everywhere is forbidden to be a fascist ( I do agree for it) but it is not forbidden to be communist .. I think you need to be there to understand what communism is able to do via idiotic philosophy which leads to authoritarian dictators and military control",
          "Most detailed, informative and interactive museum in Lithuania. Absolutely fascinating! Make sure you bring cash for your entrance fee.",
          "Really interesting place with detailed audio guides.We spent a few hours here and could have easily spent longer however had to leave to get some food!Some of the tour was quite harrowing and you should be aware of this before going.",
          "Wow - this place is intense, and very well done. A through exploration of the Soviet era and the horrors of the prison. This place should be on your list of places to see - but be warned it isn't appropriate for children, or people who have suffered trauma. The audio made a",
          "The museum itself can be interesting, and I do think it is important to know about the NKV and the Soviet Occupation. The problem is that some things presented in the museum are historically wrong. For example the fact that it's called \"Genocide Museum\" even though it is NOT",
          "We visited this Saturday gone and were surprised to note that that day entry to the museum was free! The museum is housed in the old KGB headquarters. Takes about 2 hours to see everything. The old prison including execution chamber and exercise rooms demonstrated vividly the",
          "We have visited a fair few museums of this kind. This one was interesting as the building was used by the Gestapo and the KGB. A good insight into Lithuanian life under Russian rule. Worth a visit.",
          "This free to enter museum explores the Nazi extermination of the Lithuanian Jews, the murder Lithuanian citizens by the Soviets and the Partisan struggles. It is spread across three floors in the former KGB headquarters of Vilnius. Very dark and to think the brutalisation isn't",
          "The museum is remarkable for the clever and respectful way it tells the story of some of Lithuania and Europe\u2019s very dark times. This is not an easy visit but important reminder of the worst of humanity as well as an excellent education of the country\u2019s history. Not to be",
          "Very good in a very bad way. after you have been there you understand what it was like to be under the boot of Russia. A must see. You understand why the Lithuanian's have no Love for Russians. See for yourself. Just as they left it.",
          "Must visit for anyone interested to learn more about Lithuanian and its past. Well documented; structured and displayed historic events",
          "Quite astonishing to see this place. The cells, padded or otherwise, torture rooms, straight jacket - its all very spooky. But absolutely worthwhile to understand very recent history.",
          "The last Russian troops only left in 1993 - 15 years ago yet the country\u2019s spirit today is not only strong but confident. This museum of Nazi & Soviet repression and torture reminds us not to take freedom for granted. Should be a compulsory visit for those who never had to",
          "This is a grim reminder of inhumanity and just how recently it happened. Vilnius has a facade of normality that we in 'the west' take for granted. You can stroll up the main shopping street to this building and inside you find out the grim and sad background of Lithuania",
          "This museum details the horrors and tragedies that afflicted poor Lithuania for nearly 60 years. The effect is all the more moving because of the host of personal stories of deportation, suffering, resistance, hunger, in some cases return and in many more, death. But the tone is",
          "Very interesting but lots of information to take in. Cheap at \u20ac4 however the staff seemed rude/disinterested. The prisoner cells were the highlight while at the same time being unsettling.",
          "Amazing museum to visit, well appointed displays with everything translated into English, the prison below and execution chambers will leave you feeling with a chill of horror. Fantastic value at \u20ac4 each.",
          "This is a nice museum which shows a sad history of arrests and executions.Unbelievable that it took untill 1991 before the killing stopped and the country was free. The most interesting part of the museum is the cellar with tje prison cells.",
          "Having visited the KGB corner house in Riga, Latvia, we very much wanted to visit this exhibit whilst we were in Vilnius. The upstairs exhibition regarding the Lithuanian resistance is interesting but very wordy. The prison downstairs is quite disturbing although I found this",
          "The entrance fee is 4 euro, some people had audio guides but we didn\u2019t get offered those or see them advertised. The upstairs is a series of rooms filled with the story of occupation, first by the Red Army, then the Germans in the Second World War and then back to the Red Army,",
          "There\u2019s a lot of reading, so many artefacts, and the lower floor prison cells is a MUST see, including the execution chamber with their horrific short video. Very much worth the entry fee.",
          "It may not be everyone\u2019s first choice for a tourist destination but if you want to understand the history of Lithuania better and see history from any other perspective then a trip here is worth the time - access is hard as there a steps to all floors but the staff can help",
          "We visited here for 2 hours on a Sunday morning and it was very moving. The displays were very informative and revealed a very bleak and upsetting chapter in Lithuania's history. There is a lot of information about the occupation and the resistance as I must admit now knowing",
          "Interesting layout and setup, very informative. Nice ladies working there. Good location. For those who want to learn in more detail a must visit.",
          "We thought a lot about visiting that museum. It was interesting but nevertheless very moving, terrifying and apalling. I wouldn't go there with children.",
          "A sad going back in time seeing the people of Lithuania being surpressed by different dictatorships for decades up until 1990 when they were finally free again.",
          "We visited the KGB museum which was really interesting. Upstairs offered information about Lithuanian history and the Soviet rule during the 50's until the early 90's. Downstairs, you could visit the custody area, exercise yard and execution rooms. This was all open until the",
          "The museum is a stark reminder of state brutality at its worst. The Baltic States have endured terrible persecution by their bigger aggresive neighbours which is portrayed in this interesting museum. The disturbing aspect was only a couple of decades ago that it stopped. Our",
          "Very good exhibition on the history of ruthless oppression. You can still sense the violent athmosphere here. Prison with excecution chamber is creepy. And most astonishing is that this arbitrary KGB history is not so far in the past.",
          "Having spent the last 25 years working in prisons in UK I considered it necessary to visit the KGB museum. The display about the freedom fighters and underground armed groups was fascinating - and only stopped when the Russians left in 1993! Poignant and sobering. The cells were",
          "Having visited a few Eastern European countries, I try to visit museums of 20th century history to get a clearer idea of what happened. The Gestapo interigation centre in Koln, Passage of Terror in Krakow, Austwich, Gda\u0144sk, all have stark insights into struggles against",
          "Thorough historical information well presented of this horrific period. Sad to think similar things going on in other countries now.",
          "Complete information about these terrible events relating Jewish persecutions and crimes. Photos, Documents, pictures, clear explanations, Interviews, tec. Unmissable if you go to Vilnius",
          "This is a scary and very educational place. Everyone should go there to learn about the situation and life of the Lithuanian and Baltic people from just before WW2 and until they became independent from Soviet in 1990. The rooms tells the story with historical pictures and",
          "You should definitely visit this museum, especially if you're not familiar with Eastern European history in 20th century - this will give you a clear view of what have been happening behind the Iron Curtain",
          "Fascinating insight into Soviet times. The cells were quite confronting. We were there in a relatively mild November (but still very cold!), so it was easy to imagine the hardship faced by the prisoners.",
          "An interesting exposition, not that big, but certainly worth a visit so to never forget the horrors of the past. Take your time",
          "We were a little rushed as we had made a booking with an escape room, but there was lots to see and experience. It was thought provoking as it doesn't seem that far back in history that the atrocities took place and there was a definite atmosphere to the place.",
          "Particularly the prison got to me, but also the KGB rooms upstairs, where you can still see the spy rooms (for listening into phone calls for example). I certainly recommend visiting this when in Vilnius. And then take a very looooong break with good food and strong coffee to",
          "I have visited a similar museum in Riga so expected to be less disturbed by this one. Not that I am suggesting that Lithuanians suffered any less \u2013 merely that I already had some insight. I was wrong. This is a very disturbing view of life in Lithuania under Soviet rule. The",
          "And it is also is hard to review...yes, we went to see and learn; we walked away with sad reflection in how horrible war truly is. Such a beautiful city and to be in the execution chamber where 1,200 humans were killed just doesn't go away in your thoughts. Can't say I honestly",
          "This museum located close to the city centre reveils in a very honest way, the history of the period when Lithuania was occupied by the Russians. It tells the story of surpression and corruption in a very fact-based way. And the fact that you are walking through the same",
          "Very interesting museum, top floors consist of many rooms with lots of information inside, basement area is the old prison, with original cells, outdoor areas and execution chamber. Not for the faint hearted! Some bits distressing to see but important to know the history of this",
          "This place was the site of indoctrination, torture and execution. It was closed on both the Tuesday and Thursday when we tried to visit. A hint of what it contains is shown on the many helpful posters on the railings outside detailing the (mainly political) victims. It seems",
          "anyone with an interest in political history, how Man can react to his fellow Man, and bravery...should visit this place. Awful things happened here during the Soviet occupation that should never be forgotten. Simple, stark and it gets a message over just how cruel and sadistic",
          "We were taken to this museum as part of our tour of the Baltic States. It gave an insight into the recent history of Lithuania and was very thought provoking. The cells and execution area in the basement have been left just as they were when the KGB left. Very hard to imagine",
          "This is not a museum for the weak of heart as it covers the very harish way that the KGB treated the people that they belived had commited a crime against the State. You can go down in the basement and see the actual cells used to detain and to question people to determine if",
          "I have conflicting views about this museum. Firstly it is very worthwhile and really well put together. However it is only fair to say that my visit here rather sucked the joy out of me. Don't get me wrong it is important to remember the things that happened in the past. In the",
          "We went on a Friday morning and it was not too busy so you can look at the exebition and prison properly without pushing with others. The tickets were only 4\u20ac per person and it was worth visiting it.",
          "It was a good suprise to visit this museum. You absolutly get an understanding for Lithuania\u2019s history and influences. Good information in english and I think you have to spend at least 2 hours in this place!",
          "If you\u2019ve the time, this is worth a visit. A little upsetting but gives a good insight into the history of war time.",
          "It's difficult to imagine the suffering that took place here. The museum is only small but very informative. On the bottom floor you can visit the prison cells and execution chamber. Just 4 euros to visit, and only 1 euro for students and seniors.",
          "The KGB house, as the name indicates, was the former KGB headquarters in Vilnius, as well as housing the Gestapo during WWII. The exhibition is very complete, and the entrance is affordable, especially if you're a student since you'll only pay one euro. It has signs in English",
          "A must-do visit if ever there was one. A tangible insight into the potential for man's inhumanity to man. The water torture cells were somehow the worst of it, but what jars is the fact that the building is in a city centre street which passers-by must have walked alongside",
          "We visited this museum whilst on a short break in Vilnius and I would thoroughly recommend it, particularly if you are interested in espionage and to see the suffering that Lithuanian people went through at the hands of the KGB. The prison cells and execution chambers were",
          "We had heard a lot about this particular venue/attraction and decided to take a look for ourselves. Firstly, the building itself is quite something in its own architectural right and from the outside, the uninitiated would never have guessed that such a building had such a dark",
          "Really heavy and a great experience! You will umderstand the recent history of Lithania! It\u2019s a must go!!",
          "Interesting place to visit to get a feeling of how the local people actually suffered. Being able to go into the cells and see the execution chamber gave you a real feeling of what it was like. Highly recommended.",
          "This museum is both sobering and fascinating. The facts and photos relating to decades of occupation are starkly set out in the grim interior of the old KGB building.",
          "Not much to say...a very educational (but sad) visit, highly recommended. It made us realising, once again, how cruel can the human being be...",
          "You really shouldn't miss a visit to this museum if you get the chance, and well worth booking a guide. As with all these types of experiences, the history of the place is harrowing and tragic but important to understand something of the history of this city.",
          "Very interesting and at times, graphic examples of suffering. I found that there was too much to read in the exhibits though. I couldn't take it all in.",
          "Didn\u2019t do the tour, but found it very chilling to see what the people must have suffered, learned a lot about the occupation of Lithuania that I knew little about, worth a visit.",
          "An excellent museum for understanding the Lithuanian past. Informative and has a lot of information from WWII until the 1990s. Haunting but educational and relevant. A must see if in Vilnius.",
          "basement area is where the prison area was and an area set aside for executions.Sadly you can still see bullett holes. other floors take you through history from the 40s to presnt day. a good hour to see the whole musuem. you can hire audio but there is a lot to read in English",
          "Interesting displays on the history of lithuanians during the soviet and ww2 period. There is also a kgb prison in the basement of the musuem. Good for understanding the pains of the locals who lived through this period of sad history.",
          "A startlingly severe gray overtone makes this a sad but educational place to be. Add this to the history of the country and you have a deep appreciation for the people and the country. Would recommend this one as a must for the cit.y.",
          "We were in a group and visited the museum. The stories and history are very interesting and of course disturbing. I had no idea of how cruel the Lithuanian people were tortured and imprisoned. It was definitely eye-opening and I strongly recommend visiting the museum if you",
          "Fascinating museum that left me mentally exhausted. It\u2019s one thing to hear/read the stories of the horrors that happened during the occupation and brain washing -but to see the cells where the non-conformists were kept and tortured is another. The museum covers many aspects of",
          "This museum exposes the cruelty, torture and cultural attacks on Lithuania during the time it was part of the USSR. I thought I knew something about that period, but this museum was a shock. Our guides uncle was one of the persons the exhibit mentioned as persecuted during this",
          "Went with a friend, the lady on the front desk was lovely making a joke about man has to pay and laughing us! The museum itself was amazing really interesting and gave you a real sense of being there! The prison cells were unbelievable, very eerie and spooky but very",
          "The KGB museum is a place with a lot of history and you have to visit it. Especially the basement is a place with a tragic story that shows you what a man can do to his fellow man. There is no way to get out of there without feeling sorrow, anger and resentment.",

          "The 20th Century history of events in Lithuania is well depicted in this small museum with artefacts. The basements cells and execution chamber are particularly poignant. A suitably kept museum of the horrors of the events that took place in this building and in the country",
          "A moving and interesting collection of stories and artefacts surrounding the soviet and German occupation of Lithuania from WW2 and the subsequent collapse of soviet rule in 1991. However it\u2019s incredibly biased and I wasn\u2019t sure how much to believe. There was literally no",
          "This is the real deal, the real buildings. The prisoner cells are in the basement and you can walk into them and see them. The most troubling is the water cell. Reasonable fee of 2 euros to enter.",
          "This was a sobering but very valuable experience to better understand the history of Lithuania in the last ~75 years.",
          "This building was used by both the KGB and the Nazis during their invasions of Lithuania. I have visited many concentration camps around the World, so may be inured to the grim environment that terror creates. But it was easy to imagine the ghastly circumstances of the poor",

But it is solely the museum of Lithuanian victims and only Soviet occupation, the Nazi occupation is simply skipped, obviously in order to avoid",
          "Fascinating displays detailing the Nazi and Soviet occupations of Lithuania and the negative consequences for the Lithuanian people of both. Large display of surveillance equipment used by the Soviets during the 50 year occupation, and weaponry used by the Nazis, Soviets and",
          "We went through the museum with a guide as part of a tour group. There were about 20 of us, and given narrow corridors, small rooms, and other tour groups walking through, we couldn\u2019t see what the guide was trying to describe. If you can get on a guided tour, be sure there are",
          "the first part is more general information, the second part out in the courtyard and underground thats what really grabs you and fills you with emotion. Its crazy how this could be happening so centrally in town and no one could stop.",
          "This place was the HQ of KGB in Lithuania and not only them but also NKVD during Nazi occupancy :( on the 1st and 2nd floor you can find lots about the life in that time, many artifacts, surveillance room and many more (like KGB structure, documents, ...) What stuck me the most",
          "A sad reminder of some of the trials and tribulations that some of the Lithuanian people had to endure in our recent history. The museum is pretty much untouched. The space are very confined and camped but still presented very well.",
          "We went to this rather reluctantly but in the end we were glad that we had experienced this grim place for ourselves. If ever a reminder was needed about the dangers of political extremes, this ex-KGB HQ provides one. More uplifting were the exhibits relating to the brave men",
          "When I first heard there is a KGB Museum in Vilnius I told myself I need to see it. Once I got there I find out that the place I am about to see really was their headquarters in Vilnius and people got killed there and not only... But people were tortured there. If you start off",
          "As you walk up to the building, pay attention to all the victims of the KGB in Vilnius carved into the stones on the outside. I think the entrance with head audios was around 6\u20ac. The story of what happened there is horrible. The \u201cdeath\u201d room where you walk on glass above the",
          "An absolute must to visit this museum . Having been to the other Baltic Capital cities and seen similar establishments we were just as enthralled with the stories here as well. As a group of 6 we paid a small extra charge for the personal guide. This was a revelation as it opens",
          "The KGB museum is one of those places that show us how really horrible people can be to each other. Fear was the tactic used to try to control people and the Soviets were masters in fear. The 1st two floors are displays of the history of the KGB and Nazis in Lithuania. There",

          "A visit to this place makes you realise how bad it must have been living under Nazi and then Soviet occupation. You can almost feel an evil presence in there and to be honest I was glad to leave.",

          "Be sure to come here to help understand the cruelty of the KGB in Lithuania. I would advise taking a tour if possible to help you understand it all",
          "I almost didn\u2019t go as I have been to other kgb museums and been underwhelmed but this one was and has the best history. Sad to say how poorly the people of Lithuania were treated and this place shows it and since it was the actual prison it makes it even more real and to see",
          "The place is quite unique, plagued with a long history of horrors committed here by different agencies it has housed since its inception, this does make an interesting sight, I liked how they have tried to make every room tell a story, and if you can, please look through the",

          "perhaps a bit disturbing thinking of what happened in the cells and in the building. Impressive sombre architecture.",
          "This museum is definitely worth a visit. The museum is divided into two parts \u2013 the upper two floors document the Lithuanian resistance against the Soviet occupiers, the deportations of Lithuanians to Siberia, and day-to-day life in Lithuania under Soviet occupation. The other",
          "This building acted as a incarceration centre for KGB and Gestapo prisoners during and after the war. It presents everything with pictures and a multitude of languages including English. Lots of small rooms - each telling a story of Lithuanian resistance during WW11 and during",
          "I found the museum to be interesting and detailed with preserving the memory of the suffering of the Lithuanian people. The upper level when busy can be a nightmare to get around as the rooms are small and there is lots to read. It can also get very hot which makes it",
          "A very unique museum; by combining the surviving elements of the building (such as the execution chamber) with historical commentary and artefacts, this makes for an essential visit for any tourist to Vilnius. It puts the rest of the city in its appropriate historical context.",
          "This is a subject matter that I find fascinating and a really important part of the country's history but I felt that the museum didn't quite do it justice. Whilst the exhibition downstairs showing the old KGB prison area is undoubtedly chilling, the upstairs areas aren't well",
          "The former KGB prison is largely aimed at telling the story of Lithuanian resistance to Soviet rule. This story is largely unfamiliar to westerners, so it is a useful educational experience. What it fails to tell is the role of western intelligence agencies in encouraging the",
          "I think everyone must be familiar with history. This museum is a perfect place to learn about IIWW and soviet regime. it was Original KGB office",
          "A great museum to find out more about the Cold War and Communist regime and its impact on Lithuania.",
          "It really is a dark looking building, previously the justice department before being taken over by the KGB. Quite a dark history. They brought in political prisoners during the night so as not to alarm the locals. They were taken to a cell where a soldier sat at the desk, shot",
          "This is a great insight on the atrocities of communism in the Soviet Union. A perfect example that nazi ideas and practices are exactly the same as communist ones as described and witnesses by the people who suffered. A must see for all and especially for the priviliged people",
          "It\u2019s bigger than you think as you have the prison area too. Watch your head in the execution room I\u2019m 6ft 2 and got a nasty crack on the head!! Pretty harrowing story over all but don\u2019t avoid it just for that reason.",
          "I didn't. This is an excellent museum dedicated to the 1939-1953 period where it acted as a torture centre for the KGB and Gestapo. After the Soviets reoccupies Lithuania in 1944, there was a guerrilla war undertaken by Lithuanians against the rule of Stalin. It finally ended",
          "I was reluctant to go but it was not that gruesome to see just sad to think such things happen. The building above looks normal then you go down to where people were interrogated and tortured. There is an abundance of information and a guide makes it more significant.",
          "You go into this ordinary looking government building and then downstairs to the cells. Tiny boxes with no light to soften you up, listening rooms for the soldiers, padded cells, larger cells holding more people, on and on down two corridors and then up to the executuion room",
          "This museum provides insight in KGB ways of working. Chilling. It also is an ode to the many brave Lithuanian partizans. For decades they fought for their freedom which finally came after the 1989 Singing Revolution. I learned so much. As deed our teenage kids. Absolutely a must",
          "The review of history is worthwhile for everyone to understand the past and prevent it from repeating itself. Very sad events, but also shows the brave Lithuanians we must remember.",
          "A must to understand the character of the inhabitants.The underground is only for adults and courageous ones",
          "We only had a little less than an hour to visit, as it was close to closing time when we arrived, but we managed to see almost everything. You start in the basement and work your way up. The building itself (the cells, isolation rooms, etc) is a must-see. The exhibits are worth",
          "We stumbled on this building while looking for another attraction, which happened to be 180 degrees in the opposite direction. Although the museum was closed that day, the outside of the building is lined with the faces and stories of some of the people who were 'processed' by",
          "Very educational-I guess I am glad I went. However the experience of so many Jews and Lithuanian christians who were murdered from here in the nearby forest is very sad. Think well before you visit the final execution chamber and the video which recreates the murder of so many.",
          "This museum had lots of information about both the nazi and Soviet occupation of Lithuania. Lots of boards to read and lots to see. It was quite crowded in some places. Downstairs was the KGB cells etc - this was very hard to look at and very moving. Important to keep this",
          "This museum, located in the former HQs of the KGB is a revealing, and at times a disturbing, look look at the nearly 50 years of Soviet occupation. There are many exhibits with lots of photos and artefacts from this time. Find in the basement the prison cells, solitary",
          "This museum is both fascinating and terrifying. The exhibits don't hold back and it is very sad to see the things that one human being is capable of doing to another. A must see while you are in this lovely city, but only go to the execution chamber if you are of a strong",
          "My wife and I recently visited this structure/museum while in Vilnius. The conditions of the prisoners had to live & survival are unbelievable. The Russian KGB mistreated their prisoners beyond belief. A very sobering experience!",
          "When I did my initial research on our trip, this museum did not catch my eye. I heard about it from one of our small tour guides. It is a must see to understand just how bad Russian rule is. Be sure to get the headphones, which were across from where you get tickets. They",
          "This is the place where the Genocide Museum is and that part of the exhibition is both quite confusing and unorganised. If you, on the other hand, wish to visit a good example of a KGB-building this is the place in Vilnius. And if you like cats, there is a nice cat cafe just a",
          "This was a really interesting and thought provoking museum which was also really sad. The kgb cells in the basement were really chilling.",
          "I found this museum very informative and impactful. But if you are really interested in history, make sure to set at least 4 to 5 hours for it. The audio guide is great, I truly recommend it. Unfortunately I only arrived there at around 2 and did not have the time to listen to",
          "This is not an easy museum but it tells you a lot about the resilience of the Lithuanian people. Glad I visited",
          "Visited this Museum a few days ago on recommendation of several locals. Overall, it was a great visit and a must visit for anyone wanting to know more about the recent (Soviet) history of Lithuania. I would recommend visiting in the early days of your trip as it really helps",
          "An excellent museum that portrays one of the dark chapters of Lithuania's 20th century history. We spent hours going through the exhibits and found it an emotional experience.",
          "Hard to comprehend that some of this happened in our lifetime!! Well presented but too much information to take on board.",
          "It is very interesting to visit this museum in the old head quarters of mainly KGB but also the Nazis. Scary to see the prison and execution part in the cellar level. We must never forget the horrors in these eastern European countries.",
          "The museum is situated in a former court building used as a headquarters by both the Gestapo and later the NKVD (precursor of the KGB). The basement was used as a prison, a building in the courtyard as an execution chamber. The museum tour is not for the squeamish. There is an",
          "You'll notice there is plentiful amount of information already outside before you even enter the museum, set into the walls of the same building the museum is housed in - they are there to commemorate those who lost their lives due to KGB's actions. The museum itself is on",
          "This museum is worth checking out. In the basement you got too see the prison cells and read about the history. The upper part was the history. It cost 4\u20ac to Get in unless you have an international studentcard you will not get the studentprice.",
          "Quite a scary place with a old and dark history. I have been there twice and can recommend it for people who are interested in history, not for kids I would say.",
          "This was the very first place I went in Vilnius and I'm so glad I did. It informed my whole experience of the city and I appreciated the fight of the people to rebuild out of such devastation. The stories of women in the museum is especially powerful. How they fought equally and",
          "If you you want to touch a real story of prisoniers of KGB, get the guide to get real feelings of all it. If you visit just empty cells by yourself, it won't give such experience",
          "It's difficult to express how such museums make you feel, but this is a very interesting space, and good that such history is maintained rather than hidden, and put out there as a reminder of how humans have treated one another. For only 4 euros this museum shouldn't be",
          "The Museum of Genocide Victims focuses on the Soviet Occupation, since the building was used by the KGB as a prison. You can visit the prison cells and see exhibits on three floors about the horrible things that were done to the Lithuanian people. However, these tortures and",
          "If you have any imagination, you'll find this a chilling reminder of man's infinite capacity to be cruel to his fellow man, yet also an affirmation of man's capacity to fight for freedom.",
          "Can easily spend half a day here reading all the information & learning about the troubled history of Lithuania. You need to have a genuine interest in its history or at least want to learn about it to fully engage with all the bits in the museum, there's lots to read.",
          "An excellent audio-guide (I used English) for 3 euros on top of your 4 euro adult admission contains nearly 300 tracks, and you would need to be there for 3-4 hours to listen to all of them. Most written information in both Lithuanian and English. Contains thorough exhibits on",
          "The KGB left in 1991 , to think people were still incarcerated in this hell hole , to stand in the room where people were executed, really makes you reflect on the evil that human beings can inflict in the name of ideology.",
          "This is an important part of history. The Soviet Union hid the atrocities for more than 50 years. Even if you aren't a history buff, you will find it informative.",
          "We went through all the halls of this genocide museum. Everything inspires sadness and, at the same time, hatred or mercy towards the helplessness of the wicked and then brutally executed. You can see: the waiting place (3 hours) until all the documents, the detention cells, the",
          "Well organised museum. A good reminder of the Lithuania's painful past. The museum is just of a perfect size and layout for an informative and unforgettable visit. Highly recommended",
          "It is a smaller exhibition which explains the oppression and suffering of the Lithuanian people and the KGB history and shows the KGB cells in the basement. We were there in the low season and still it was a bit crowded because of the small rooms and corridors. Also it was very",

          "E4 entry plus E3 for the audio which is a relief from the mountain of detailed text. Interesting but heavy exhibition with access to restored rooms to give you glimpse what has been. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.",
          "Like similar museums in other eastern European capitals, the KGB Museum chronicles the many abuses locals suffered during the Communist era. If you've been to similar museums in Prague or Sofia, this one will feel similar ... except for the largely unknown (to me at least)",
          "OK it's not the most cheerful thing you are going to do in Vilnius but a great place to find out more of Lithuanian history under the Russians. Currently an interesting exhibition just outside of school children's paintings related to this terrible period of Lithuanian history",
          "Had a break in Vilnius in June 2018 and we decided to visit this museum. A real eye opener and makes you fully appreciate what some governments were doing 40 years after the end of WW2. Very sobering and makes you wonder if some goverments are still doing this today. Overall",
          "I admired it a lot, it is one of my favourite museums, where i received so big float of information about history of Lithuania!",
          "This is quite a large display in the former gestapo/kgb HQ. Lots of photos and information and gives you a real flavour of Lithuania's recent history .... very sad and sobering. The ground floor contains the original cells - you can only imagine what went on there and the",
          "Grim history of what these people have endured. Excellent display. Be prepared for the execution chamber as it ways heavy. The conditions they\u2019ve had to endure even decades after the war are unbelievable. I have much respect for what they\u2019ve gone through and what little they",
          "I won't say this is a good place to visit because the subject matter is not pleasant but it is very respectfully told and honest about the brutality of that period of the country's history. It is a must place to visit to remember that brutal history so it is never repeated. The",
          "The museum is worth a visit. Entrance fee is 4 euro The lady on reception desk is very rude . She was screaming for 4 euro when we went there. Staff training in customer service is needed. We had student id from uni but wasn't accepted . Was barking at us that they only",
          "Fascinating place but be prepared for the gruesome as well. Well laid out displays and then there are the cells which give an idea of how dreadful things were back in the day but actually not that long ago.",
          "the museum covers the full range of lithuanians' experiences under nazi and communist rule -- in the same space where a lot of the activities took place -- good range of pictures and items -- fully absorbing",
          "Half of the exhibits are about the arrests and deportations of the Lithuanians and the varoius resistance movements (including those Lithuanians who helped save their Jewish neighbors.) The other half shows the history of the KGB and their activity in Lithuania . The basement",
          "Too many Americans don't understand how bad things were for people under the USSR. Our guide is an archivist there and lost grandfather and other relatives to the KGB. Neighbors turned in neighbors, friends and family. He found that his favorite teacher was an informant. Small",
          "This museum brings home the awful truth of living under Soviet rule and the terrible crimes carried out by the KGB. Still well worth the visit for those of us who have grown up and lived a free life in the west.",
          "The KGB Museum is not for the faint hearted. You need less than one hour to see were people were held, tortured and executed. The walls were painted many times so no trace was left behind of the prison cell 's occupants.",
          "If you only visit one place in Vilnius make sure it is this one to learn about all the terrible things the Lithuanian people have had to endure during the last 100 years. A very sobering experience.",
          "Allow at least 2 hours to go through the three levels and definitely not a place for kids. There are many photographs, drawings, stories etc from plenty of historians and people who survived. The rooms are steeped in history and gives you an understanding of what the Lithuanian",
          "If you remember the cold war and even if you don't this place is well worth a visit. I didn't know the Lithuanian story from 1918 and it's a tale of a small country being over run by it's big neighbours but staying strong until independence. The KGB jail is very atmospheric.",
          "The KGB Museum gives a well-done portrayal of partisan life in Soviet times as well as highlights the fear looming for the Soviet KGB. Definitely a must see to understand the history of the country and the city, but be prepared that the sights can be a bit disturbing and sad.",
          "This is a must visit. Very interesting. I spent 3 hours there. It's just over wellming. It's only a short walk from the main street. Cost 4 or 5 euro and some more for English head set. It's very earey scared in the basement where the killings happened also the padded",
          "Decided to visit this museum and see for ourselves the atrocities of war and how the Lithuanian people suffered under its enemies..There were 3 floors, each depicting its history and the basement floor was the most gruesome area as it contained the execution chamber and the",
          "A lot of information to try and take in and it\u2019s a very sad story. It shows how amazing the people have been to create such a great city after so many years of Soviet oppression.",
          "This is quite emotionally heavy place. At first you will see the historical exposition of the specific period of time and later you are taken to the jail cells, execution room and stuff like that. I went out early, because i was feeling very uneasy.",
          "Go and have a look at the old cells used by the KGB , strange to think it is relatively recent history , Good exhibition in english",
          "Bit difficult what to say, but walking round, and reading the bios of some of the people who where held there, makes one feel sad, but well worth he visit",
          "Although this building was used by the Nazi SS briefly, the Museum is essentialy about the behaviour of the KGB and the Incarceration, Murder and Exile to Siberia of many thousands of Lithuanians during the Soviet occupation period. The KGB offices are mainly occupied by",
          "For me this part of history was totally new info so I found this museum educating and interesting. Old cells were creepy.",
          "A eye opener what went on behind the walls of a lovely building.Upsetting thinking about all the Jewish people and everyone else who died here.",
          "We were among the few when we entered, so the small rooms filled with exhibits were not as claustrophobic as they later became when hordes of tour groups entered. The three floors offer numerous exhibits with a substantial amount of information written in English, so one can",
          "I think everyone should see this place (OK, apart from small kids). It provides an excellent overview of what the Nazi and Soviet occupying forces did to the people of Lithuania - and what any totalitarian regime is capable of doing if others dont stand up to them. We already",
          "Slightly claustrophobic but the rooms are full of interesting and comprehensive information. The cells below and the execution chamber are haunting",
          "Went today. \u20ac4 each + \u20ac2 if you want to take photos (just use mobile phone). Interesting looking at the cells and execution room.",

          "Sobering exhibit. Well done and was appalled at learning how many Lithuanians had been deported. English captions.",
          "A place that rewrites history, and which honours nazi-collaborators such as the \"forest brothers\"... not one plaque mentions how lithuanian collaborators took part in Holocaust activities.",
          "A little underwhelming but still with a visit. The cells in the basement were well preserved and thought provoking but the exhibits elsewhere are a little wordy and repetitive. I was constantly comparing to the house of horrors in Budapest which never lost my attention or",
          "An extremely interesting and informative history on Lithuania's fight for self determination and government despite repeated invasion and occupations by Russia, Soviets, and Nazis. This is a testament to to the strength and will of a nation which resisted occupation, torture,",
          "A jump in the atrocieties of the past. Small but interesting museum on the practice of brutal governments to oppress people.",
          "This is an absolute must see attraction when visiting Vilnius. It is amazing because the cells are in such good condition still and it was so relatively recently that this was used. Don't rush and see everything,",
          "Opted not to pay for the audio tour and there was sufficient information in English to understand what was happening in the prison.",
          "This museum said it all. It's not easy to see some of the exhibits but important learning. Some of the areas were in close quarters and because of a tour, we couldn't even get into some of the rooms to see the exhibits. Be prepared for some troubling and heart wrenching",
          "This museum is set in a former KGB prison on the main street in the center of Vilnius. The lower level contains holding cells, torture cells, a padded cell and a killing area. An upper level has exhibits explaining the history of communist and Nazi brutality in Lithuania. It",
          "A very interesting place. Take time to look at the ground and first floor exhibition before visiting the macabre KGB cells. It gives you an understanding of the suffering of the Lithuanian people under German and Soviet control. I think many people just go down to the cells",
          "A well thought out and organised museum which shows chronologically the struggle of the Lithuanian people during both Soviet and German occupation. Learnt a great deal about the KGB and their history in Vilnius.",
          "this is a intresting place but see how far you are from them to me the 2 hr ride there and 2 hours back are not worth it... very intresting",
          "Quite a sad place obviously but worth a look around with a guide to get the history. Need about 60-90 minutes.",
          "Not a fun experience, but very important. Seeing the exhibition really made me think and feeling strongly for the victims.",
          "My trip to Vilnius was based on visiting this museum. The previous year I had been to the KGB Museum in Riga,Latvia and they recommended this one to everyone on the tour. I had booked a tour in English in advance for 10 Euros each plus entrance fees. We arrived 40 minutes",
          "KGB museum is very good gives you a history of what life was like under Soviet occupation not to be missed",
          "The museum tells the story of the heartbreaking experiences of Lithunanians during the invasion by the Germans then the Russians who treated the Lithunanians terribly, deporting them and taking their possessions as well as murdering them. Only in recent years has the country",
          "Be prepared to read and be moved by what this poor nation has suffered. The name is slightly misleading as the story is much more than the KGB. Like others of all the rooms the most disturbing was the padded cell, like the fear was caught in the walls. A real eye opener.",
          "The museum has a well organised collection of soviet memorabilia. Moreover, it offers an in depth explanation of the KGB and its operations in Lithuania. Most interesting part included the prison cells and the execution room. This museum is worth a visit, however it might",
          "It is a must in Vilnius! It costs EU 4,0 a d worth the money! You can see how this people suffer under the Nazi and the Soviets under the dictator Stalin!! No one is better than the other!",
          "We are glad we visited this museum to remind ourselves of how cruel the Soviets were -- and how the Russians could still be. From the Holocaust and the Soviets' treatment of their socialist (i.e. occupied) republics comes the same message: \"Never forget.\" From 1939 and the",
          "The formal facade of this museum gives little indication of the horrific history that is told within. Most of the exhibtion centres on Soviet occupation and represiion from 1941 until 1991. You are able to see the prison cells, KGB quarters and - if you are feeling strong enough",
          "Never knew quite All of the history about the Soviet Occupation of Lithuania & the other Baltic countries. Opened my eyes to how Horrible it was to be spied on by the Government & also even neighbors",
          "This is a museum about RUSSIAN genocide during the two occupations of Lithuania by the then USSR.Trying to find the museum was a little difficult as there are road signs pointing to museum unfortunately I went to a small museum dedicated to a famous Lithuanian professor author",
          "Some things that you might see are rather scary but the museum gives perfect overview of the Lithuanian history",
          "Sad sad sad. But probably no more so than any accounts of oppression. History shows we don't treat each other well. Misery and brutality reign episodically. Important that we understand that history should not repeat itself but it does. Need to counterbalance the visit with",
          "A friend of mine proposed to me going to this museum, which I didn't know before. I was impressed about the cells of the prisoners, the place of the execution etc. A live history!",
          "Really interesting and moving museum. Makes you think and hope these things should never happen . Look out for the bricks on the building that have the names of some of the people executed in this building.",
          "The Museum was the only planned cultural activity planned for this trip. Recommend people to go and experience the history that took place in this building.",
          "I was hesitant to visit as it seems such a morbid thing to do on holiday, but I do highly recommend going on so many levels. There are 3 sections to the building. The first shows the history of the Soviet occupation after WW2 and how the Lithuania Partisans came to be.The second",
          "Disturbing, yes, but totally a must see in Vilnius. No joy to be had but rather a sobering thoughtful experience which left us full of questions. How did that all happen and with such little impact on those of us living in blessed ignorance in the UK at the time. Go for the",
          "Went here on Saturday morning as it was on the Trip Advisor list. Didn\u2019t really know what to expect. I gained a lot of information about the history of occupied Lithuania and their battles. The downstairs is also very interesting!",
          "We really enjoyed this small museum dedicated to the victims of the Soviet genocide. Lots of information about KGB techniques lots of opportunity to visit the cells which they committed their atrocities. I would recommend you see this while you\u2019re in town.",
          "This is a well curated display that informs you about a sad part of Lithuanian history. It is a self guided tour, well documented and directed so you can go as fast or as slow as you want. It will take some time to read all the material if you choose to do so. I would not",
          "It was interesting, but it's sad to see what has happend in Our future. It is a lot of text to read, if you want to understand everything.",
          "We visited the museum on a lovely spring day full of sunshine- we left feeling very moved . Our grandfather was Lithuanian and came to the UK after WW2 but never got to go back home so I went to honour his memory , and to learn more.It\u2019s an elegant looking building with a sad ,",
          "The k.g.b museum or should i say the museum of genocide victims is a must visit if you're in vilnius.the building was The Gestapo headquarters office in vilnius in the period of ww2 and after the k.g.b held there the headquarter office and a prison down in the basement. There",
          "The museum was formerly the headquarters of the KGB. The basement contains prison cells and torture cells. The execution cell now shows a video depicting the horrors that took place there.",
          "If you are interested in Lithuania history, that`s definitely one must go place. The Museum brings a detailed history about what happen during Sovietc government and also on WWII.",
          "Easily the most terrifying basement I\u2019ve been in. The museum is set up in way that beat remembers those who tragically lost their lives. Well worth the visit.",
          "This is an extraordinary commemoration of those tortured and murdered under Soviet occupation in Lithuania, and the complexities of the history of this region. It is especially powerful for being housed in the former KGB headquarters/prison and murder site. Should not be missed",
          "a place to see and learn a great deal of lithuanian history, really interesting history of the cruel and despicable things that these poor people endured during the soviet and german rein",
          "We stumbled across this museum late on 1st day of our visit and planned to go on a subsequent day but noticed it was closed on those ( closed Monday and Tuesday) We therefore only had 75 minutes but in fact I felt that was sufficient. In my 50s I found it interesting but I",
          "Remarkable collection describing the occupation and genocide. Fascinating collection of artifacts. Eery basement with the prison cells. It can be busy with school groups, so make sure to leave yourself plenty of time to visit so you don\u2019t miss anything.",
          "This museum is well presented but with too much reading. This could be told more effectively if it was all more concise. The museum is more about the Nazi and Soviet occupations, particularly the KGB. It only briefly tells the sad story of the Holocaust. The museum tells the",
          "Certainly worth visiting, the museum contains lots of information and does a good job of providing a good picture of Lithuanian history during a very difficult period. Just a forewarning, there is a lot to read and some of the signs are difficult to read due to the font and",
          "You could still feel the fear and pain of people who had to spend their last days of their lives. It's the place that I feel the power of \"never again!\". But sadly it won't change anything for people who had to suffer. I suggest visiting this place.",
          "This isn't exactly a fun place to go to in Vilnius and yet if you don't go you'll never fully understand this city and Lithuania. As you exit the building with your soul shaken and your heart aching for all the lives lost, remember that they had lived here, had hobbies, families",
          "Everyone knows the atrocities nazis did but few know that also Soviet Union was guilty of actual ethnic cleansing. One of those places they did such things were the Baltic states, and among them Lithuania. This great museum documents this process very thouroughly. The museum has",

          "If you want to know how cruel people can be to each other, this is the place to go. Really touching. I am so happy we Finns avoided the destiny of our baltic friends. It was not easy though. Hard fight. Remember to respect the sovereignity of your home country.",
          "I\u2019ve always been intrigued by the Cold War and expected a somber setting with rooms full of files on people the KGB had spied upon. Not quite that really a thought provoking display of how Lithuania has suffered under Russian and German occupations. The depiction of executions",
          "A must-see when in Vilnius. Reading about the horrible fate of the Jews and how the people of Lithuania was treated from 1930\u2019s to 1980\u2019s is both interesting and horrifying. Going downstairs to see the execution room and solitary cells are definitely terrifying. \u20ac4/person.",
          "Worth a visit to get a better understanding of the history of Lithuania and the fight they have had to get independence.",

          "It was a very moving experience to see the history of Lithuania in the 20th century caught between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. The barbarity of both of these regimes is captured with heart rendering accuracy through the stories and exhibits in the museum. This is difficult",
          "You wouldn't know that this exists from the outside, let alone its dark history. I have travelled 40 countries and consider myself \"aware\" of the abuses and genocides the Nazis and Soviets inflicted but couldn't prepare for this museam. Enter on the first floor and you would",

          "We spent a couple of hours looking round the various rooms and cells. Mostly visual presentations on the walls but 90% in English. It makes you understand what a terrible time the Lithuanians had from the Second World War until they left the Soviet Union in recent times.",
          "... but you pretty much have to read it all yourself. 99% was translated to English. The prison in the basement was interesting. Make sure you go outside, labeled the exercise yard or you will miss the execution chamber. It could really do with some videos/ graphics to",

          "Very interesting and eye opening museum about Lithuania's history. 3 floors with lots too see, cheap entrance fee. The KGB prison on the bottom floor was my favourite part. Not too busy either so you can take your time to enjoy every exhibit.",
          "A must if you visit Vilnius, great to find out the history , which shocked us !! Very interesting Would really recommend it",
          "Luckily, there were only a few other visitors when we were there, so we really had the chance to see and experience everything. Especially the cells and execution rooms were haunting. Impressive museum, and not too expensive.",
          "As a history teacher, this is a must visit museum! Such a fantastic learning experience, about elements of Lithuanian history that I had no knowledge of. I would definitely recommend",
          "Interesting place with a lot of photos about the anti soviet resistance. The prison was quite moving especially the wet cell.",
          "We had an hour round the KGB museum and some of it's a bit harrowing, but it's sooo important that the abuse Lithuanians suffered over the years is not forgotten.",

          "Really interesting and harrowing museum . Information on exhibits also in English . Basement prison was an eye opener . Must visit in Vilnius",
          "An interesting museum with some great artefacts and info. The kgb prison was very moving and hard to comprehend the cruelty",
          "This was a very interesting tour. The photos were great and there were English translations of everything. The basement held the KGB prison and it was a scary visit. I can't imagine what those prisoners had to endure.",
          "A relatively unique and sobering experience and definitely worth seeing for a paltry entrance fee. The first 2 floors tell the story in words, pictures and artefacts but the reality of this place kicks in below ground in the prison/torture facility, truly horrendous. I thought",
          "Went not knowing what to really expect. The museum is very informative and interesting. Spent hours there. Would highly recommend. Came away dissapointed with the human race.",
          "Visited in January 18 and is well worth the visit. It\u2019s not a massive museum so can do it easily within a couple of hours so even if only there for a day or two then it\u2019s something I would recommend. Lots of interesting facts and the cells in the basement bring it all to life.",
          "This museum takes visitors through the history of control through fear managed by Poland Germany and Russia. Long may it remain a museum to remind people how bad the alternatives can be. Make sure to check out the execution room with the numbers executed by the KGB being",
          "Allow at least a couple of hours to do this justice. Really worthwhile to help understand the history and how Vilnius has evolved, and quite shocking to realise how recently this was part of 'normal' life. The museum has been very well done and I was so glad we did it early-on",
          "This was very emotional for me, so if you are going to visit this museum be ready to show those emotions. they do have guided tours, but we decided to visit on our own. I am glad I did, because I was able to speed through some of the locations and leave soon than i thought i",
          "The KGB Museum is an incredibly sobering experience but it's definitely worth visiting. The museum charts the history of Vilnius form before WW2 until the collapse of communism and is packed with information. In fact there's probably even too much too read, but it's extremely",

There\u2019s a prison , really good set up, you can see exactly how inmates had to stay in the prison - their rooms, bathrooms, out yard, and even execution room. Sad. I do recommend everyone visiting the museum - you can spend even 2 hours there as it\u2019s so big.",

          "Definitely this is not a place to be happy or celebrate. Instead, it makes us think about the past, and it teaches us what we should not repeat. Even though it's a creepy/dense atmosphere, I strongly believe that all of us should visit this place to learn from it.",

The exhibits are interesting and informative and the prison in the basement is quite shocking and thought provoking.",

          "KGB prison is worth seeing.",
          "Ok, so love is probably the wrong word.\nA deeply moving place, well presented without fanfare or judgement.  Presents facts (as they see them). Worth the fee to get in. Don't take youngsters! But others should be ok, it is graphic in parts, but then so is the history.",

          "The Genocide Victims museum is probably the best I have seen for a long time. It is located close to the centre of town and it took me 3 hours to go through. It left a lasting expression on me. I think everyone should visit this museum.",

          "Important history well worth seeing. The story is grim but it is very important to know and not forget how people can act in a given setting.  \n\nIt is also interesting to visit the kgb museums in the other baltic states to compare and \u2026",
          "Be sure that your nerves are strong enough when you enter this museum, especially when you go downstairs to the KGB prison. Definitely a must-see place: soviet cruelty mustn't be forgotten or ignored. All the more so as Russia continues this \"tradition\"...",
          "Disturbing and unforgettable",
          "This museum was the best from all three Baltic states who have very similar 20. century history.",
          "This a place to go, to understand and to know more about the Lithuanian history. It's a disturbing but interesting museum in former KGB headquarters. There is a good audio guide and even some texts are in French. I spent 2 hours with \u2026",
          "An extremely well preserved jail, it's very impressive to see history come to life like that in an exhibit.",

          "Great cellar. Rude receptionist, Charges 2\u20ac for photos. Great historiy and preserved building. Recommend audioguide for english speakers.",

          "A recommended museum if you visit Vilnius! Really interesting to see how Lithuania suffered during the Nazi and Stalin era\u2019s. Although there is a lot of information it doesn\u2019t take you a very long time to see it all, that\u2019s convient if you \u2026",
          "A good museum that we can see and read the Lithuanian history under occupation of Nazi and most of all under USSR. Here you can visit also the KGB Prison where all persons againts Soviet will be interrogated, detained, violently persecuted and then executed. If you are too sensitive, you can feel and perhaps see the unseen.",
          "Very instructive and well worth the 4\u20ac entrance fee. It has a lot of artifacts and you can visit a real KGB prison and execution room. An amazing experience for history buffs.",
          "Very interesting place. The KGB jail was frigthened !",
          "This Genocide Victims Museum was established in 1992 and since that time it is the best museum for me with a big black history.

Everybody in the World must see this place to understand that Soviets were the same as Nazi.",
          "Must visit place to understand history of Lithuania",
          "Very sad environment and emotionally draining to see the prison and read stories and see real pictures and memories. Amazingly collection of stories. Worth to see!",
          "Probably the best museum in Lithuania",
          "Fascinating museum with a whole floor dedicated to the ex KGB prison which was in the basement. Goose bumps for sure.",
          "One of the most touching places in Vilnius which you have to visit. You will be disturbed after the visit, knowing how much Lithuanians had to suffer in the hands of Nazis and Soviets. Taking an audio guide is recommended, as you learn a lot. Totally worth the money.",
          "Warning! The things you experience in there are heavy and will make you think. It shows you sooo much more than any history book could possibly show you. This is not a fun afternoon type place. Come here to learn and experience recent history about a harsh and sad reality.",
          "If you like history and specially history in Europe in regards to the second world War this is the place to visit when in Vilnius its a small building but you will see how life was back then and how they treated people in jail.",
          "Good museums! Don't have information on russian language. But have audiogid on russian for 3\u20ac.",

          "A must see for all visitors interested in Lithuania\u2019s history.  Chilling, comprehensive and an informative museum showing our nation\u2019s difficult challenges with both nazi and soviet repression.  I am most moved with how the Lithuanians had the courage, strength and perseverance to overcome such evil.",
          "Moving place. Reminder that not everyone gets the freedoms we're used to and that it's worth fighting for.",
          "Very interesting museum. Must visit the KGB prison underground. So impressive",

          "Super well done museum. Exhibits all have English translations. Explains the occupations of the Nazis and the Soviets.",
          "Grim but well presented. Leaves you in no doubt of the horrors that occurred in our past. Never forget \ud83c\udf38",
          "The real national museum of Lithuanians, all their real history starts there, when they were killed, deported and mistreated by other Lithuanias (KGB section and photos). A bit weird how an annexation with referendum, approved by Parliament It is called\n \"Occupation\". But everyday can write their history. Highly recommended!!",
          "A place never to forget..everybody should see this",
          "a five star museum. lots of information. nicely curated. the museum itself housed in the historic building that is entirely associated with the content of the museum. even then, I think the naming of the museum should have been different. \u2026",
          "Great collection from the darkest times of lithuanian history. Worth visiting.",
          "Must see atleast once in a lifetime",

          "Interesting and shocking",
          "Well worth a visit, not a pleasant experience by any means. The cells in the basement are particularly harrowing, never fails to amaze me the depths to which human beings can go to hurt others, as Hannah Arendts book title so eloquently puts it, The Banality of Evil.",
          "Very important reminder of an awful part of history. Respectfully preserved and very informative, well worth a visit",
          "The visit of the ancient cells of the KGB was really something not to miss. The atmosphere is for sure very heavy, in the memory of the fallen.",
          "Just a propaganda museum. Not a single reference about the alliance between Nazis and Lithuanians. Former Nazis that had been excecuted presented as rebels. A museum has to be historical correct and present both sides of history.",
          "Lots of information and some great preserved items",
          "I found it rather depressing, probably my least favorite site in Vilnius.",
          "Very interesting museum. You can feel the cruelty of occupation",
          "It is very usual that museums are closed on Mondays. But this one is closed on Tuesdays, too. So there was no chance for us to visit this important museum. What a pity!",
          "Small museum + prision visit in basement floor. 1~1,5 hour visit, cost 4 euros. Is more aboutthe story of soviet ocupation in the initial years than a KGB museu. Panels are very well written in english and luthuanian.",
          "Touching. We should never forget the past to appreciate the present and be smart in building our future",
          "Very interesting museum about the dark times of Lithuania. The basement prison and the execution chamber is shocking...",
          "Very informative and well delivered museum. Especially the cellar part where everything is kept pretty much authentic. Shows the horrible history of Soviet occupation in Lithuania.",
          "Good but too much information",
          "Interesting but a bit creepy",
          "Really interesting place",
          "It should really be called the Freedom fighters museum because there's really a whole story about the Lithuanian people and their history of battling for what they believe.  The museum was touching and eerie and really educational.",
          "All Should go and withness the sadness and cruelties commited by the communists \n\nPeter & Fernanda from Denmark",
          "Interesting museum, but be aware that you can only pay in cash there! Students have to hold an ISIC card, otherwise they don't get the discount. You can easily spend half a day in the museum and it's worth it",
          "Worth visiting. Shows the hardship of life during occupation periods by Nazis (Germany) and Communists (USSR)",
          "An atmospheric museum that is imporant to remind us of what was so that we hopefully learn from it. We were in a group that was a bit too big for the place and the guide went through everything too quickly for my liking, but his \u2026",

          "A lot of reading included but not much of seeing.",
          "If you go to Vilnius, you should visit this place. The underground floor is awesome.",
          "Really sad place but great museum as you get to feel a part of what happened. It's a real German prison and you can visit a room where executions happened..",
          "So moving. The history of Eastern Europe is fascinating",
          "Emotional museum, definitely worth a visit in order for everyone to understand the tragedies underwent by this community.",
          "Very informative. Especially the cellar floor with prisons is shocking. There is a lot to see and read. Audio guides were available in english. We spent about 2h there, but I think it takes at least 3 or 4 hours to hear all of the audio guide.\nAll in all I can highly recommend a visit.",
          "First floor displaying the details of Lithuanian KGB connections go a bit too much into detail to stay interesting for a foreigner, but the basement and the third floor are excellent. The original cells are fantastic and tell a story in a unique way, while the third floor tells a lot about the KGB as a whole. Whole-heartedly recommend.",
          "Very interesting place to visit. Staff isn't very helpful and their English could be improved.",
          "Very humbling but an important thing to see. Definitely a must see",
          "Thought provoking - hidden history",
          "Try and go at off peak times - it can be very crowded with large tour groups in tiny exhibition rooms.",
          "Very dark and kind of depressing, but an important place to visit so you can see what Lithuania has been through, and then appreciate how fantastic is it these days despite its many hardships.\nNote that this is one of the few places that \u2026",
          "The museum deserves a visit or two! It is very well structured. And the story they tell there deserves to be known from as many people as possible.",
          "Really interesting place. The exhibitions are really well put together and it's very informative.",
          "I haven't been to many museums, but I visited this when I was in Vilnius with a string orchestra. It was a memorable experience, and I learned a whole lot about what it was like in the times of the genocides. The museum guides was very \u2026",
          "Very interesting museum with lots of information and good exhibitions. The prison downstairs and execution chamber is unsettling to see, but worth a visit.",
          "Very tiny place for prisoners to keep if whey was breaking rules",
          "Haunting but must see.",
          "This is a must-see exhibit. It is mind blowing to think of the hardships the local people endured at the hands of the KGB; this exhibit helps to get some understanding of the scale of it.",
          "Scarey. Do not take kids.",
          "Hard truth to be seen...a must",
          "Had no idea of the terror and hate that existed behind the iron curtain during my lifetime. Such an eye-opening experience, shocking and appalling that such horrific things happened, we must ensure it is never repeated.",
          "A must go. A creepy reminder of \u262d authoritarian crimes",
          "Good museum to experience the russian  repression of lithuanian people",
          "Absolutely fascinating and quite educational as well. The guides are amazing as well, they give you an honest opinion and many disgusting facts that the government tries to hide.",
          "This was an extraordinary museum filled with details of the imprisonment and killing of Lithuanians during the occupation of Lethuania. This is well worth the visit. I would have liked to spent many hours there. I would recommend that the \u2026",

          "The prison at the lower level were scary, specifically the execution chamber",
          "Perfect, the guide is wonderful, very strong emotions",
          "Spent 3 hours - could have spent longer! Used a very good audio guide, can go as fast or slow as you want. Disturbing and fascinating history.",
          "Great place with big part of  history of the  NKWD - \"must see\".",
          "Impressive visit, be sure to book a guide!",
          "See our history and why we adore freedom.",
          "Very interesting place to learn about the Lithuanian occupation, not a big tour but lots of information",
          "Visited museum twice, 1st time in 2008 named \"Ocupation museum\" and reflected both occupations - soviet and german. Now U will not find anything abt german invasion during WW2, chameleon way of changing attitude lithuanians to own history is looking strange in this case. Better to use guide.",
          "Not sure you can \"like\" a place like this but the exhibition was very informative and showed how the Lithuanians were treated under German and Russian occupation. Very well set out but difficult to imagine the suffering. If you are in Vilnius you have to go!",
          "Unfriendly staff and the main exhibition is a bit unstructured. The prison exhibition in the basement makes it well worth a visit though. The cells really make the history crawl in under your skin.",

          "The prison serves as a grim reminder of the past their is a lot of information to take in if you like reading",
          "This is very interesting to visit, you don't need guide - everything is written on boards near rooms. Worth to go there!",
          "A very interesting place, kept true to history you can really get a feel for the past here and will want to allow 2-3 hours for a tour. Well worth it.",
          "Well worth the reasonable fee. The museum leads you through several rooms with easy to follow numbers and signs. Good information about the brutality of the KGB and Lithuanian struggle for independence. The term genocide is a little misleading because the KGB were killing political dissidents, not an ethnic group.",
          "Very interesting to see the history around the 2nd world war and more recently with indepence. The cells were a reminder of what the people had to go through in the hands of the KGB !! And the folks carted off to the concentration camps. \u2026",
          "Very very interesting,a must see attractions",
          "The museum itself is amazing. You will see historical and an authentic stuff related to the Lithuanian history in 1940-1956 but I wish there was more exhibits.",
          "Lovely museum well put together tells the story of lithuania during Soviet occupation as well as giving some background history of Lithuania pre occupation. However the ladies at the desk could be a little more pleasant.",

          "Interesting museum. Most of the exhibits have texts also in English. Helpful staff.",
          "One of the 'musts'\nLeaves a bitter aftertaste thought cuz of the history of the place",
          "Good to see the culprits named and shamed here. Excellent museum but not light hearted.",
          "We should never forget our history",
          "Interesting to see the old KGB office and the cells. It allso displays earlier Lithuanian history (1920 ++)",
          "Difficult to review such a solemn place. The basement with the execution chamber was cold and chilling yet, emotional and terribly sad. Mans inhumanity to man was never far from my mind as we walked beneath what was essentially an office \u2026",
          "Interesting place for some cruel history. Spare up a couple of hours at least.",
          "Very interesting stuff, the upstairs exhibition was obviously less immersive but was very informative. Audioguide is a bit messy but well worth the money.",
          "Very informative but kind of depressing, especially the prison downstairs. This is a dark part of history; but worth a visit for anyone interested in history",
          "This is a heartwrenching walk through history but also a must visit for everyone who is interested in European history.",
          "A great place to learn about the bad times years ago. This place has so much to tell, and do use some hours to read about the terrible period of the crazy KGB times.",

          "Do not forget. ... there are country still with these problems",
          "The original building includes the prison cellar which is extremely impressive. That part alone would be 5 stars to me. Upstairs the areas are very small for the amount of people there and there is so much text to read that you need to \u2026",
          "Everyone should see this but it is distressing. Yet another depressing example of a Soviet attempt to destroy the culture of another nation.",
          "Spooky",
          "Best of all genocide museums of Baltia. Several floors to explore.",
          "Not Pleasant, but needs to be seen\nVisiting this former prison gives you some insight regarding the viewpoint of the Baltic States towards their huge Eastern neighbour. The prison was actually used by both the Soviets and Nazis during their \u2026",
          "Good museum. Seems to focus on Soviet crimes and genocide on and actions of ethnic Lithuanians. Has english descriptions. A good overview of Lithuanian history during the 20th century. Basement is a must see.",
          "In May 2018, this place is cash only. At 4 euros an adult, its well worth it",
          "Incredible! This museum is the best example of how people should keep, protect and honor the memory of their nation.",

          "Very informative and worth a visit when in Vilnius.",

          "very sad but dann very good",
          "So sad but so important to see this. The Lithuanians had a horrific time in the 20th century; first with the Nazis then the Soviets. Highly recommend.",
          "A dark part of history. Well worth a visit. I would suggest reading up on the history first which will prepare you and give you greater understanding without having to read all the notices. Make sure you visit the cells",
          "I learned so much at this museum! A very sad part of Lithuania's history, but necessary to learn about. Tickets are 4\u20ac. We spent about 1.5 hours. It's not really stroller/wheelchair friendly. There are small double doors to get through and \u2026",
          "Thought provoking and gut wrentching coming here. Spent a good two hours here taking everything in...",

          "Absolutely fascinating and a must see. Tells the gruesome story of the KGB in Vilnius in a way that sends a chill down the spine from the moment you walk through the doors. The execution room is a sobering experience.",

          "Neccesary place to visit for everyone especially  for people from former Soviet Union",

          "Very interesting museum. Dark side of the soviet history",
          "Very informative and interesting to learn about the hardships of the Lithuanian people. Though I think it is too much centered on the Soviet times part. I wish there would be more information the crimes commited by Nazis.",
          "This place is the previous KGB secret prison, nowadays a museum to learn about lithuanian miserable history during the 20th. As a small country between Nazi Germany and USSR, it was colonized by his neighbours by turns. Each time there were \u2026",

          "The place where cruelty was on the top in the past...",
          "Its a good museum space, still too politically distorted. Yes, all prisons of the first half of twentienth century are horrible. Still I cannot reject the feeling that I only see half of the picture there... KGB versus Lithuana...",

        "wiki": "St. Anne's Church (Lithuanian: \u0160v. Onos ba\u017eny\u010dia; Polish: Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u015bw. Anny) is a Roman Catholic church in Vilnius' Old Town, on the right bank of the Vilnia River established circa 1495\u20131500. It is a prominent example of both Flamboyant Gothic and Brick Gothic styles. St. Anne's is a prominent landmark in the Old Town of Vilnius that enabled the district to be included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites. And it is one of the most interesting examples of Gothic architecture in Lithuania.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first church at this site, constructed of wood, was built for Anna, Grand Duchess of Lithuania, the first wife of Vytautas the Great. Originally intended for the use of Catholic Germans and other visiting Catholics, it was destroyed by a fire in 1419. The present brick church was constructed on the initiative of the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Alexander I Jagiellon in 1495\u20131500; the exterior of the church has remained almost unchanged since then. A  reconstruction of the church, funded by Miko\u0142aj \"the Black\" Radziwi\u0142\u0142 and Jerzy Radziwi\u0142\u0142, was carried out following severe fire damage, in 1582. Abraomas Kulvietis preached in the church between 1538 and 1541. In 1747, the church underwent a repair under supervision of Johann Christoph Glaubitz. In 1762, side arches of the main portal were hidden in order to strengthen the support for the facade. \nAccording to a well-known legend, Emperor Napoleon, after seeing the church during  the Franco-Russian War in 1812, expressed a wish to carry the  church home with him to Paris  'in the palm of his hand'. The church was renovated in 1902\u20131909 when the side arches were uncovered and the walls were strengthened with iron. During the Soviet Era, the church remained open and was even renovated between 1960\u20131970 when the towers were in bad shape. On August 23, 1987 the Lithuanian Freedom League held a  rally in a square near the church and the monument of Adam Mickiewicz to protest the ongoing Soviet occupation, which was broken up by the militia. Most recent reconstruction followed in 2009: the roofing was replaced, facade elements were reinforced and long-missing side spires were rebuilt. \nOn June 13, 2018 St. Anne's Church was dedicated by The Archbishop of Vilnius, Gintaras Gru\u0161as, to be used exclusively to celebrate Mass in the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe design of the church building is attributed to either Michael  Enkinger, the architect of a church of the same name in Warsaw, or to Benedikt Rejt. However, neither of the  attributions is attested by written sources. St. Anne's Church is part  of an ensemble, comprising the much larger Gothic Church of St. Francis and Bernadine, as well as a monastery. \nA novel approach to bricks as a construction material was employed in the church's construction.  The main fa\u00e7ade, designed in the Flamboyant Gothic style, is its most striking feature. Traditional Gothic elements and shapes were used in unique ways; Gothic arches are framed by rectangular elements dominating a symmetrical and proportionate fa\u00e7ade, creating an impression of dynamism. According to Lithuanian architect and art historian Vladas Dr\u0117ma,  patterns from the Pillars of Gediminas are echoed in the church's fa\u00e7ade.\nThe church has one nave and two towers. It was built using 33 different kinds of clay bricks and painted in red. The interior is decorated in the Baroque style, as is its altar. The imitative neo-Gothic bell tower, constructed in the 1870s to Chagin's designs, stands nearby.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe European Route of Brick Gothic",

          "Nice church but maybe nicer from outside but it\u2019s free so it\u2019s worth having a look inside. Nice calm atmosphere",
          "first saw it in the snow. it was breathtaking. later saw it in the summer. so many chapels. it is a living church. worth a visit.",
          "This is the real deal! Not commercial, most things are handmade, often by children. Church has great energy. Lots of locals who come for mass and celebrations. They feel part of it and it feels part of the community. Church does attract tourists, but does not exist for them, as",
          "A lovely sight near to our hotel along side bigger St Bernadine church, beautiful especially during sunset time when people passing along and some stays around it.",
          "We came to visit the church (given how much Napoleon loved it), and while it was lovely from the outside, we couldn\u2019t visit the inside. It looked like the door from the nearby Benedictine church was locked. Still, the exterior is quite striking and a great example of brick",

          "After roaming Vilnius and uncovering many churches and cathedrals throughout the Old Town, I found St Anne\u2019s Church to be a little underwhelming. I appreciate it carries a lot of history, and is hugely impressive and flamboyant on the outside, but inside it felt a little blander",
          "The church inside is really small and isn't open often I got lucky and went in during a mass....it is really tiny. The bricks are cool. The church next door has a cooler inside",

          "This is one of the top things to see in Vilnius but there are so many churches in the old town this was just another, and not that impressive (for me anyway).",
          "Worth a visit for the view from the outside. Only a short walk from the main square. Many tours will pass it.",

          "The exterior is unusual for a Church, being built in red bricks. This gives it a distinctive look that is sure to attract the eye. There is also no Church front, the entrance giving right on the sidewalk, which is also unusual. Once you step inside, you are struck by two",

          "I've seen so many churches and cathedrals in Europe, I've lost count. After a while, they are much of a muchness, very similar to one another. However, St Anne's stands out uniquely, with its exquisite spires and slender ornate shape Inside it is rather simple and unasuming,",
          "Stop by this church to view the inside, which is mostly wood with some frescos on the walls. Well preserved and well worth a stop",

          "A really nice church and quite different from others I have seen. Unfortunately this review only goes for the exterior since I didn't go inside. What is quite unusual also is the fact that st. Anne\u00b4s is a Gothic church compared among the numerous Baroque churches in this city.",

          "This place is absolutely amazing. The church just pops up from everything else you will see in town. It is very challenging to find the right angle for the picture, but worth trying. The inside is not as impressive as the outside, but I really recommend to enter, specially to",
          "I fell in love repeatedly with this church over and over. Each time it calibrates my hearth. It's an impressive landmark. It's such a shame the new city's architecture is just subpar when comparing to the old city. Combine the visit to the Church together with the view of the",
          "One of the most beautiful sites to visit in Vilnius. It is a historical fact that when Napoleon was in Lithuania and he saw that church he wanted to break it down and bring it to France. That\u2019s how he was amazed with the beauty of that church. Thankfully it wasn\u2019t possible so",
          "It is easy for one to become overwhelmed with religious architecture in the gorgeously \u00fcber-Catholic Lithuanian capital, but Saint Anne\u2019s is so vividly unique on the outside that one can overcome the onset of church fatigue. Externally, this is likely the apex of church design",

          "St Annes's church is a little jewe which is almost overwhelmed by the massibe bulk of St Bernard's which stands behind. But it is the intricate brickwork of the facade, exterior walls and tower which make it special. The interior is quite plain, although the stained glass is",
          "My google map was little tired when i type this address but have managed. It is huge church and historically Napoleon wanted to have this church, no doubt. Worth to visit and close to the bernadine garden",
          "You can't beat this church for it's photogenic nature. However, inside is nothing special. I can see why Napoleon wished to send it home with him.",
          "This Gothic gem has a great spot for pics across the street. Folklore says Napoleon was in awe with the facade and wished he could bring it back to Paris on the palm of his hand. Another good viewing angle is to the side of the statue of Adam Mickiewicz- a Polish poet who",
          "I recommend seeing it first with a guided tour - it usually provides a lot of interesting info about it. Then go by yourself and just enjoy the lovely architecture. There's a good shot you'll also catch a wedding there.",
          "As Napoleon waged his war against Russia, he stopped at the Church and was heard to say (my interpretation)... 'My dream is to pick up this beauty and carry it home in the palm of my hand to Paris...' Vilnius has many beautiful churches, but this one is a must.",

          "Beautiful church in gothic architecture style and the interior is also very beautiful. A must visit if you are in Vilnius. No entrance fee and photos are allowed inside. If you wish you can donate some money to the church and buy a suvernior. Active church and you should free",
          "The architecture of this church from the outside is very interesting but what is surprising is the relatively small side of its inside ! Worth a visit while in Vilnius .",
          "It seems that as you leave one church in this area you arrive at the next but like all the others beautiful architecture inside and out and worth a visit",
          "You will see the spiers of this wonderful church far away: slender and red, heading for the sky. It is said that Napoleon loved it a lot. It is huge and you will actually visit not one but two religious places.",

          "This church is not as good as the adjacent Bernardine Church, in my opinion. It does not have the distinctive architectural elements that make it stand out. But if you are visiting the Bernardine Church, it is worth sticking your head in to see it.",

          "Not much to say here, I am not a big church guy. This is some great architecture and for anyone who loves old churches this is for you. I was content on a short visit.",
          "This small Church stands out thanks to its elegant gothic brickwork. To be contemplated from the outside.",
          "Built at the end of the gothic era with many different types of red bricks. We did not go inside since we were on a walking tour",
          "One of my favorite churches also found in old town. It is a typical example of a gothic architecture and was recently updated as it was constructed in the 1500's and this beauty will not disappoint.",
          "What can i say? Really beautiful church from the outside. The inside was also really nice but the overall view of the structure was in my opinion better than the inside.",
          "Easy to find and well worth a look inside very ornate church and one of many in vilnius be careful not to be all churched out by the end of your trip .",
          "It is a typical example of Gothic building and the brick were painted in red. It is difference from other church which is very close to the street. The interior design is Baroque style and looks little small than what I expect as the appearance is huge. It is an important",
          "Beautiful church, very old and full of charm. We saw it for the first time at night and it was stunning.",
          "The facade is what stands out, with the various types of red brick made into gothic patterns. The inside (free entry) was comparatively forgettable.",
          "It's a beautiful Gothic Church which is a key symbol to Vilnius and the city constructed entirely with red brick. The church of St Anne is a masterpiece of the late Gothic period. The church, which has survived to the present day without changing for over 500 years, has become",
          "This church is different to all others in the various style in the city. St Anne's is red brick, using over 30 different types of brick Adjacent to Uzupis republic so easy to visit together",
          "The interior of these churches is not as decorative as the outside. If you are in need of seeing the inside of churches, then visit.",
          "The Saturday we went -1st July- we saw two christenings in progress (in same church), and several families preparing. Interesting church.",
          "A definite photo stop. Unique, impressive, eye catching architecture. The exterior brownish red brick stands out among all the churches in old town. We did not go inside just stopped for photos.",
          "Beautiful building, very fascinating when snowing at night, at late evening when the street is in city lights. You can take beautiful photos there.",
          "The chuch is worth a visit, it is quite different from most churches I have seen in the world. Really interesting is the architecture with it's separate tower and the neighbouring St.Bernhard church.",
          "An impressive Roman Catholic church in the Old Town, on the right bank of the Vilnia River. It's a prominent example of both Flamboyant Gothic (characterized by its dramatic attention to detail and the ogee arch) and Brick Gothic styles. It's incredible that the exterior of the",
          "St. Anne's is the only Gothic church I saw among many later churches. It is on a pretty square off to the left of the main street of Old Town as you walk from the Cathedral square. Our Road Scholar group was only able to see the exterior. I wish I had gone back to check out the",
          "One of the very few gothic churches in town. There is nothing special inside. So do not be upset if churche is closed. Everything what is worth to see is outside.",
          "Beautiful church, especially by its unique exterior. It is just a few steps from the main streets so it is worth the visit.",
          "At some point on a tour all churches start looking alike but this one was unique and definitely worth a visit.",
          "Very impresive gothic style church. Worth visiting while you are walking the Vilnius old town. Interesting point on your way to or back from Uzupis",
          "Vilnius has a large collection of picturesque churches in a range of styles. This one probably has the most unusual facade. Its ornate brickwork facade is highly photogenic. It consists of spires, arches and niches layered one on top of the other. Napolean was apparently a big",
          "The exterior of this church is picturesque in somewhat unusual red brick gothic. It was busy on Sunday with a wedding in the bright gold-decorated side chapel, followed by a first birthday celebration for a lively little boy (and his doting relatives!)",

          "Lovely place inside, worth a quick peek and free to enter. Adjacent to the much larger Bernadine Church which I found more impressive.",
          "Lots of different bricks. 15th century Gothic church. Napoleon was reportedly so charmed with this church that he wanted to relocate it to France. Definite must see!",
          "Although there are many beautiful churches all over old town this is unique and you should not miss it",
          "Gothic Church! The city has more than 60. This is the most impressive! Located in the old town! It was used by the sovietic army as a fortification",
          "We entered just the chapel, but the interior is worth a visit. It seems to be a huge church but not possible to see the rest.",
          "If you're interested in medieval architecture be sure to visit this church. The interior provides insights into what must be one of the most easterly Gothic churches in the world. Quite small and not as high and impressive as some churches in for instance France. Yet this is it:",
          "A very good architectural design with a great look. A very nice place to visit. It is located in the old town.",
          "If you like churches/architecture, stop by this one. It's in the Old Town area which you most likely will visit anyway:) I'm not very much into looking at buildings/statues etc, but it's a little bit funny how this one looks like a miniature:)",
          "Location in old town close to many other sightseeings. Beautiful church but quite normal, nothing stunning. If you are close to It I recommend to visit but I wouldnt travel A long way just to see it.",
          "I have visited many churches. This one is just an ordinary church to see. Nothing so special as to the architecture inside.",
          "REally worth a visit very majestic and s[pecial, one of my favorite churches in Vilnius. Go there by foot. and enter.",
          "The church is quite a ways from the train station in the nice part of Vilnius. Much of Vilnius is in need of refurbishment. Unfortunately, it appears that a majority of the EU revitalization funds have gone to the Catholic church.",
          "Right in the center of Old Town Vilnius, this church is easy to get to and is near Uzupis, not far from the Amber Museum, and not far from the Palace. It's definitely worth a peek!",
          "St.Anne church- little gothic church,made of very ornate red bricks masonry,amasing outside,but very simply interior.",
          "In vilnius you can find so much churches but St. Anne's is for sure the mos beutiful. You need to try find this church but it is not easy. Walking in the narrow streets of Old Town. But it is so nice building with much gotic elements.",

          "The most beautiful church in Vilnius and maybe in Lithuania. In very good location to reach, other interesting objects very near. The place you must see in Vilnius.",

          "The most intricate medieval structure that has ever been made of bricks as a construction material. Worth visiting? Absolutely",

          "St. Anne's is a beautiful Gothic church in imposing red brick a short stroll from the main pedestrianised thoroughfare of Vilnius Old Town. It is charming inside, really serene and peaceful. It is not as big inside as it looks from without and to be honest, I enjoyed the facade",
          "As with most of the churches in the old town it's a lovely building. Only seen from outside but will be going inside in next couple of days.",
          "A beautiful tiny yet breath taking example of gothic architecture. Legend says, Napoleon wanted to take it on his palm to Paris... love it every time..",

          "Beautiful Church with s monastery nearby. It's hard to imagine how they managed to create a building like this with all the bricks a long time ago.",
          "It was interesting to see this very typical gothic style church slap bang next to a much more Lithuanian style Baroque church. No one knows why there would be 2 churches so close to each other. An interesting story about how Napoleon's army rested their horses in the church",
          "Let's go and see it :) Very nice building in the heart of old town of Vilnius near central garden of Bernardin's , Cathedral square and Gediminas castle.",

          "Magnificient structure indeed but dint have time to step inside the church definitely one of the places to visit in Vilnius",
          "A gothic church in red brick full of spires and turrets. Bit of Hogwarts about it. Napoleon apparently loved it.",
          "St. Anne's church is beautiful and worth-seeing place. Even Napoleon was amused by it's beauty and wished to \"put it on a hand and bring to Paris\". Couple times I couldn't enter because it was locked but when I finally did so it was a disappointing experience. Don't worry if it",
          "Of all of the churches I saw in Vilnius, St Anne's was undoubtedly my favourite. A beautiful brick building! The photo doesn't do it justice. Definitely worth seeing.",

          "This church is over 500 years old, having been built in the late 1490's. The intricate detail and brickwork is amazing to see in person. When I was here there were only a handful of people around. It was just around the corner from my hotel and I had a view of the church",
          "St. Anne's is located in old town Vilnius. The inside is both simple and yet beautifully detailed. It is done in two Gothic styles, Flamboyant and Brick. The outside made of deep red brick adds to its stunning curb appeal. One of the many impressive features, the ceiling is",
          "This place is unique and beautiful. A bit different than the other churches or cathedrals in Vilnius.",
          "This Gothic masterpiece is one of Vilnius symbols. It's present day appearance dates back to late 15 cent, when it replaced the former wooden Church. Before entering it study carefully its facade. That's where its beauty is. It is constructed entirely of bricks, but 33 different",
          "One of most beautiful mature gothic churches in Lithuania. The distinctive red hue and decorativeness of curved lines of the Church of St Anne can be attributed to the thirty-three types of clay brick used to construct it. Most of the structure remains true to its original",
          "This church is the eye-candy of Vilnius Old Town. If you enjoy beautiful architecture, historical design and simply beauty, it's a must-see object. Observe in awe the complex exterior design and admire the picturesque interior - no wonder Napoleon wanted to gift this church to",

          "At around noon, Nun appears and opens the altar completely. It is very ornate and beautiful and truly unique. Get there early and get a seat.",
          "One of the symbols of Vilnius. It is difficult to say which one is the most beautiful churches, since there are so many, and so different! This is one of the most interesting, in my opinion.",
          "Both St. Anne and the Bernardine Church are looking great and have a wonderful location at the exit of the Bernardine park. I visited them at the end of September, when the trees were displaying amazing colours. Inside the Bernardine church I had the chance to attend a heavenly",
          "Rare gothic building in Vilnius. And very beautiful inside. Preserved old paintings on the walls. Usually opened at the daytime, so just do that - come inside))))",
          "It's been a legend that Napoleon was so fond of this church that he wanted to carry it home in his palms. I'm not sure how much of the legend is real but I assure that the beauty of it is breathtaking.",
          "If you come here by hen church of St. Ann was closed, don't get disappointed too much - interior of the church is much, much more modest than the exterior. I'd judge the rate between interior an exterior as 2 to 10.",
          "The outside is quite beautiful with the detail of the windows and brick. The inside was much smaller than I expected and we basically just poked our heads inside to get a quick look as there wasn't much else to do.",
          "Why do you think Napoleon wanted take it to France? When you see it you will now :) Not big but beautiful. And park is at the same place.",

          "Quite an unusual church but well worth checking out. It's a Gothic, red-bricked affair, which apparently Napoleon was taken with when he passed through. Inside there is a lovely altar plus some frescoes and intricate carvings. It's on the outskirts of the Old Town but very close",
          "This is a very well know place to visit not far from center (but better have the right indications on how to get here). Place is not that big but everything is beautiful. Gothic church with very nice interior paintings and architecture. Napoleon (at least I was told so) said",
          "A nice experience for anyone interested in beautiful buildings. The brick architecture with lovely stain glass is worth a trip. Make sure you walk through the artist colony that has it's own constitution!",

          "This church not only has a fabulous fa\u00e7ade but is truly beautiful inside and has an interesting history, as does the whole of \"old town\" Vilnius. I visited with a small group tour and as well and felt that our 30 minutes visit a little too brief.",
          "The amazing small Gothic style catolic church, must see object in Vilnius, not sure that they are open all day time. a litlle bit outside old town but not too far, about 10 minutes by walk, a lot of tourists are visiting this place.",

          "Saint Anne (pronounced Anna in Europe) Church is a prime example of Flamboyant Gothic architecture, as well as Brick Gothic. TripAdvisor uses a photo of Vilnius\u2019s iconic church as its feature photo for Vilnius, along with the adjacent Bernadine Church. Constructed of wood in the",
          "A church on the edge of the old town. Nice to see, tho the outside is the most impressive part of the church. Next to the church is another church. Behind the church is a nice park for a walk.",

          "The most beautiful building in Vilnius. Very delicate and majestic at the same time. Worth to visit!",
          "The church is a beauty. Napoleon said: \" I would like to put it on a palm and bring it to Paris\". I agree with Napoleon, but better to keep it in Vilnius.",
          "St. Anne's Church is interesting church to visit. The building is very special and old. We recommend this attraction.",
          "St. Anne's Church already caught my attention when I was at the belvedere around Gediminas Tower. A solid, tall structure encircled by other churches, a garden and a river, the church reveals some more of its beauty when you visit - while it is not a large church and may even",
          "I was only able to view this Church from the outside as there was a wedding taking place. According to rumour Napoleon though the Church to be so special he wanted to take it home .",
          "It starts with a construction of a wooden house of worship in honour of On a wife of Vytautas the Great. Unlike the other churches in Vilnius. St.Anne's has managed to escape the ravages of time almost unscathed and is the least changed of them all. It is free to the public",
          "enter, just to feel and see something different, the building is unique both inside and outside, a bit from the centre but a 10-min walk only",
          "Do you know, that then Napoleon \"travelled\" trough Lithuania and saw this church, he said \"If I could, I would take it to Paris. That's says something already, right? It's small, cute and quite. If you are looking for time to rest and get back peace to your mind - stay here for",
          "One of the main sights of Vilnius' Old Town, beautiful gothic architecture and colour - the bricks add an interesting touch to it. It was built in the 15th century and the exterior remained almost without any renovations, which is truly fascinating.",
          "This brick built extravaganza is unique, in both its architecture and the building material. The successive invaders of Vilnius, while putting the interior to various uses, found it too attractve to destry. Not much to see inside, the smaller adjacent church has more (don't",

          "One of the best examples of Gothic architecture. Beautiful facade. Chapel built in 16th Century. Napoleon apparently was enthralled with this Church and wanted to take it back to Paris. Well worth a quick visit.",
          "This is a unique church with its spires and arches all made of red brick. You won't see anything like it anywhere, and its super popular with newlywed couples. So stroll by and admire it; it's right on the border between the historic core and the Uz Republic.",
          "The St.Anna church is as the title suggests, a place to escape Vilnius. Take your time to sit in the church benches and just enjoy the silence (that is, if you are lucky not to cross busses of tourist). Later in the day or early in the morning would be a better time to go then.",
          "Remarkably well preserved church given the extensive Communist control. Seemed to provide a place of solitude for a religious community.",
          "Definitely a unique looking catholic church. Great gothic Architecture. Red face brick. The inside of the church wasn't very impressive. Worth visiting and taking a photo.",
          "Very very nice church. It is something different to other churches in Vilnius. It is good to visit near park and Uzupis.",

          "The most beautiful Church from outside in Vilnius. You can touch gothic art, you can feel it :D I wouldn't miss it if I'd be in Vilnius. Sometimes they're having gospel concerts inside, maybe you'll catch one if your lucky. And right beside this beauty stands Bernardines Church,",
          "impressive, amazing, gothic. A lot of architectualy details you can find at exterior of this church. visually it looks like a wet sand building",

          "The church is beautiful even the story runs napoleon loved it when he visited in 1812. It is beautiful . Worth a visit.",

          "We were lucky enough to attend a baptism in one of the side chapels of the big church. A wonderful experience!",
          "A must see church in Vilnius. Recommend only taking a view from the outside because of the beautiful bricks used to build this church. The inside is okay if you have lots of time but there are other churches which are much better",

          "I was in Vilnius for 4 days and finally one day the doors were open (when I came by) so I could see inside this magnificent Gothic church. There were many worshippers inside so being respectful is a must.",
          "Very impressive exterior and some beautiful art on the inside. However, not the most impressive church in Vilnius. Unless you are religious yourself, I wouldn't recommend going on a Sunday (it can feel a bit invasive)",
          "It's a beautiful church at least from the outside. There are so many cathedrals within the old city but this is one of the largest and most photogenic.",
          "We learned that Napoleon used this beautiful gothic cathedral to keep his horses, so the inside is not so beautiful. But the exterior is worth seeing.",
          "This is an easy church to visit in a short amount of time. The story goes that Napoleon wanted to move the church to France due to its beauty. It is lovely and historic but it's not THAT amazing. If you are in the area, it is worth a visit.",
          "A most interesting church with a number of chapels and definitely worth visiting. One of the best of the many in Vilnius.",
          "The inside is a very beautiful interior.. Great art work. The outside is very photogenic. Excellent example of medieval architecture.",
          "Unfortunately, both buildings were closed by the time we got there. (6pm) So go early or you will miss out.",
          "Good looking church, interesting architecture. Peaceful garden behind the church alongside shallow river. Why do humans spend so much money on religious artifacts?",
          "Outer interior is impressive but inner paintings are as impressive or even more. It is recommended to visit during a mission for acoustic impression",
          "Napoleon of France wanted to carry it away on the palm of his hand. Finely tuned gothic marvel. Gem of great civilization Lithuania once was.",
          "Also the churches of St Bernadine and St Anne, a flamboyant Gothic redbrick church with a graphic carved wooden interior and Bohemian painted ceilings. Once occupied by Napoleon\u2019s soldiers as a barracks en-route to Moscow in 1812 and during which he expressed a wish that he",
          "This beautiful Church is right around the corner from our Hotel, and we have visited it twice, and walked by it at least five times. When we turn the corner and glimpse it, we are awe stricken each time. Inside, the Church is quite small. We spoke to one of the Franciscan",
          "The outside is very impressive and all build of bricks. It is of late Gothic design. The inside is also worth a visit.",

        "wiki": "The Bernardine Garden (previously known as Sereiki\u0161k\u0117s Park'), in Lithuanian Bernardin\u0173 sodas, in Polish ogr\u00f3d Bernardy\u0144ski or ogr\u00f3d Bernardyn\u00f3w is a public park in the city of Vilnius, Lithuania. It is located on the right bank of the Vilnia River between the Gediminas Tower and Bernardine Monastery and it covers over 9 hectares. Most of its territory is parkland, divided in the monastery exposition, the botanic exposition and other  recreational territory  including a children's amusement park. It hosts a variety of festivals and exhibitions, including an amateur chess  championship of Ostap Bender.\n\n\n== History of the Bernardine Garden ==\nUntil the 14th century, in the territory of Bernardine garden there was a Lithuanian pagan saint oaks wood. After Christianity the oaks were cut down and in 1469, when the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Casimir IV Jagiellon invited the Bernardine monks to Vilnius, the park was created.  The monks rearranged the territory, set up a botanic exposition and organised a lot of other events.\nIn 1864 the Russian tsar government closed the Bernardine garden, but about twenty years later the townspeople recovered this garden. It was reconstructed according to A. V. Strauss and Jakub Jasi\u0144ski project. But during the World War II, the Bernardine garden was destroyed. In the Soviet Union times it was reconstructed for the second time and named Jaunimo sodas (The Youth Garden).\nIn 2013, the Bernardine garden was reconstructed for the third time. Reconstruction works were done by \u201eVilnius city parks\u201c and  partly funded by the European Union. It is nowadays operational, and is known as one of the attractions in the Vilnius Old Town.\n\n\n== Educational and recreational zones of the Bernardine Garden ==\nThe botanical exposition is a very special part of the park, where plants are sorted by groups and classes. They are planted in two types. The first type is from the lowest to the tallest and the second type is when the tallest plants are in the centre while the smallest ones are at the sides. In this exposition\u2019s center there is a small pool, sacred water plants.\nThe monastery garden exposition was developed with medicinal herbs, potherbs, and edible and tea plants. There is a small fountain in the center of the exposition and a pergola - bower on which a lot of climber plants wind.\nIn the rest territory of the park there are two fountains.  The main fountain, which is situated in the center of Bernardine garden, works all the day at weekends in a warm period of the year. On work days the fountain works only from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. as a magnificent light and music show. Also there is a rockery, a carousel, a playing ground for children, a giant chessboard, and checkers and chess tables. In a warm period of the year one can enjoy different expositions of sculptures. \n\n\n== References ==",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Church of St. Peter and St. Paul (Lithuanian: \u0160v. apa\u0161tal\u0173 Petro ir Povilo ba\u017eny\u010dia, Polish: Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u015bw. Piotra i Paw\u0142a na Antokolu) is a Roman Catholic church located in the Antakalnis neighbourhood of Vilnius, Lithuania. It is the centerpiece of a former monastery complex of the Canons Regular of the Lateran. Its interior has masterful compositions of some 2,000 stucco figures by Giovanni Pietro Perti and ornamentation by Giovanni Maria Galli and is unique in Europe. The church is considered a masterpiece of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Baroque.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe foundation of the first church in this location is unknown. While digging the foundations for the present-day church, workers found a sculpture of an unknown knight. That inspired a legend that the first wooden church was founded by Petras Go\u0161tautas, a legendary ancestor of the Go\u0161tautai family, well before the official conversion of Lithuania to Christianity by Jogaila in 1387. More likely, the church was founded by Wojciech Tabor, Bishop of Vilnius (1492\u20131507). The wooden church burned down in 1594 but was rebuilt in 1609\u201316. In 1625, Bishop Eustachy Wo\u0142\u0142owicz invited Canons Regular of the Lateran. Their new monastery was officially opened in November 1638. Bishop of Samogitia Jerzy Tyszkiewicz gifted a painting of Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy (Lithuanian: \u0160v\u010d. Mergel\u0117 Marija Maloningoji) to the church and the monastery. The painting was brought by Tyszkiewicz from Faenza, Italy around 1641\u201347, and depicts Our Lady of Graces, patron of Faenza. Even though it was not canonically crowned, it was covered in silver riza and attracted votive offerings.\n\nDuring the wars with Russia in 1655\u201361, the monastery was burned down and the church was destroyed. The construction of the new church was commissioned by the Great Lithuanian Hetman and Voivode of Vilnius Micha\u0142 Kazimierz Pac. It is said that Pac was inspired to rebuild the church after a 1662 incident when he hid in its ruins and thus narrowly escaped death from mutinous soldiers who later killed Wincenty Korwin Gosiewski, Field Hetman of Lithuania, and Kazimierz \u017beromski. Before this project, Pac, having made only a couple relatively minor donations to Bernardines in Vilnius and Jesuits in Druskininkai, was not known as a patron of the church or the arts. Pac, who never married, envisioned that the church would become a mausoleum for the Pac family. The construction works started on 29 June 1668 (the day of the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul) under the supervision of Jan Zaor from Krak\u00f3w and finished in 1676 by Giovanni Battista Frediani. Pac brought Italian masters Giovanni Pietro Perti and Giovanni Maria Galli for interior decoration. The works were interrupted by the founder's death in 1682. According to his last wishes, Pac was buried beneath the doorstep of the main entrance with the Latin inscription Hic Jacet Pecator (here lies a sinner) on his tombstone. At the end of the 18th century, lightning hit the church, knocked down a sculpture which fell and fractured the tombstone; the incident inspired many rumors about Pac and his sins. The tombstone is now displayed on the right wall of the main entrance.The church was finished by Pac's brother, Bishop of Samogitia Kazimierz Pac, and was consecrated in 1701, while the final decoration works were completed only in 1704. The construction of the church revitalized Antakalnis and attracted other nobles: Sapiehas who built Sapieha Palace and S\u0142uszkos who built Slushko Palace. The interior of the church changed relatively little since that time. The major change was the loss of the main altar. The wooden altar was moved to the Catholic church in Daugai in 1766. The altar is now dominated by the Farewell of St. Peter and St. Paul, a large painting by Franciszek Smuglewicz, installed there in 1805. The interior was restored by Giovanni Beretti and Nicolae Piano from Milan in 1801\u201304. At the same time, a new pulpit imitating the ship of Saint Peter was installed. In 1864, as reprisal for the failed January Uprising, Mikhail Muravyov-Vilensky closed the monastery and converted its buildings into military barracks. There were plans to turn the church into an Eastern Orthodox church, but they never materialized. In 1901\u201305, the interior was restored again. The church acquired the boat-shaped chandelier and the new pipe organ with two manuals and 23 organ stops. The dome was damaged during World War II bombings, but was rebuilt true to its original design. When in 1956 Vilnius Cathedral was converted into an art museum by Soviet authorities, the silver sarcophagus with sacred relics of Saint Casimir was moved to the St. Peter and St. Paul's Church. The sarcophagus was returned to its place in 1989. Despite religious persecutions in the Soviet Union, extensive interior restoration was carried out in 1976\u201387.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Exterior ===\n\nThe church is located on a small hill near the Neris River and the former main road to Nemen\u010din\u0117. It is part of a monastery complex that occupies approximately 1.5 hectares (3.7 acres). The churchyard is surrounded by a thick 4\u20135 m (13\u201316 ft) high brick wall that has four small octagonal chapels. The churchyard used to have a small cemetery, but it was demolished in the 19th century. The church is a 17th-century basilica with a traditional cross floor plan and a dome with a lantern allowing extra light into its white interior. However, the dome is lowered and is visible only from a distance. The exterior was copied from the parish church of Tar\u0142\u00f3w, built in 1645\u201355 and most likely designed by the same architect Jan Zaor. The facade is of heavy proportions. It is divided by a prominent balcony, freestanding columns (used for the first time in Lithuanian ecclesiastical architecture), windows, and cornices. The central facade is framed by two bell towers that are circular at the bottom and octagonal at the top. Two brass bells, 60 and 37 cm (24 and 15 in) in height, survive from 1668.The double broken pediment has a relief of Mary standing on a cannon, flags, and other military attributes. Below the relief, Latin inscription reads REGINA PACIS FUNDA NOS IN PACE (Queen of Peace, protect us in peace) and reflects the intentions of the founder Pac and is a word play on his last name. Further below is the main portal. Surrounded by two puttos holding papal tiara (symbol of Saint Peter) and a sword (symbol of Saint Paul), there is a large cartouche with Pac's coat of arms Gosdawa. Two terracotta sculptures depicting Saint Augustine (patron saint of Canons Regular of the Lateran) and Stanis\u0142aw Kazimierczyk (Polish member of Canons Regular) were created in 1674. They measure 2.05 metres (6 ft 9 in) in height. There were many more sculptures on the front and back of the church, but they did not survive. The facade was also decorated with a 172 cm \u00d7 237 cm (68 in \u00d7 93 in) painting depicting Virgin of Mercy protecting people from the plague of 1710 in Vilnius. Imagery of Mary holding broken arrows of god's wrath was borrowed from the painting of Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy that hangs inside the church. Created in 1761, it was restored at least five times and lost its original features. After the last restoration in 2000, it was moved inside the church.\n\n\n=== Interior: decor and central nave ===\n\nSt. Peter and St. Paul's is one of the most studied churches in Lithuania. Its interior has over 2,000 different decor elements that creates a stunning atmosphere. The main author of the decor plan is not known. It could be the founder Pac, monks of the Lateran, or Italian artists. No documents survive to explain the ideas behind the decorations, therefore various art historians attempted to find one central theme: Pac's life and Polish\u2013Lithuanian relations, teachings of Saint Augustine, Baroque theater, etc. Art historian Birut\u0117 R\u016bta Vitkauskien\u0117 identified several main themes of the decor: structure of the Church as proclaimed at the Council of Trent with Saint Peter as the founding rock, early Christian martyrs representing Pac's interest in knighthood and ladyship, themes relevant to the Canons Regular of the Lateran, and themes inherited from previous churches (painting of Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy and altar of Five Wounds of Christ). The decor combines a great variety of symbols, from local (patron of Vilnius Saint Christopher) to Italian saints (Fidelis of Como), from specific saints to allegories of virtues. There are many decorative elements \u2013 floral (acanthus, sunflowers, rues, fruits), various objects (military weapons, household tools, liturgical implements, shells, ribbons), figures (puttos, angels, soldiers), fantastical creatures (demons, dragons, centaurs), Pac's coat of arms, masks making various expressions \u2013 but they are individualized, rarely repeating. The architects and sculptors borrowed ideas from other churches in Poland (Saints Peter and Paul Church, Krak\u00f3w, Sigismund's Chapel of Wawel Cathedral) and Italy (St. Peter's Basilica, Church of the Ges\u00f9).The main entrance is flanked by two large sculptures of Saint Christopher carrying baby Jesus and a skeleton (grim reaper with a cloak and a large scythe) standing on crowns and other symbols of power. Saint Christopher is a protector, but death is still awaits everyone equally and Christians should prepare for it. The vestibule also has a scene of Last Judgment with various monsters and demons. The left side of the vestibule has a small room used as baptistery, while the right has a room for wakes. The latter has a scene of Pilate's court that thematically starts the Stations of the Cross. The colorful stations hang in the central nave and lead to the Altar of the Five Wounds of Christ.The central nave is decorated with evenly spaced sculptures of the twelve apostles. It also has a number of torture scenes from the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire. These martyrs include Saint Sebastian, knights Saint George and Martin of Tours, Saint Maurice and the Theban Legion, Fidelis of Como and Victor Maurus. However, they are not immediately visible as they are placed in niches. Therefore, the nave is dominated by plain white walls that contrast with the opulent decorations elsewhere. From the central nave, the entrance to each of the four chapels has two allegorical female figures, representing eight Beatitudes from the Sermon on the Mount and created according to the iconography of Cesare Ripa. Their placement above the entrance arch is very similar to the Basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo. However, they are not depicted in order but rearranged so that they would better reflect the themes of the chapels.\n\n\n=== Interior: chapels and side altars ===\n\nThe church has one central nave. Similar to the Church of the Ges\u00f9 in Rome, the narrow side aisles are turned into interconnecting chapels. There are four chapels: Women's or Queens', Saint Augustine's, Saint Ursula's, and Soldiers' or Knights'. The Queens' chapel was originally dedicated to Saint Petronilla, traditionally identified as daughter of Saint Peter. The chapel has four figures representing women's virtues: piety, generosity, purity, and assiduousness. The figure of generosity presents a stark social contrast between a wealthy lady and a pauper. Some art historians attempted to associate these figures with Queens of Poland. Painting of Saint Monica, mother of Saint Augustine, hangs in the chapel. The ceiling has scenes of executions and torture of early Christian martyrs, including Saint Fausta and Saint Theodora. The Knights' chapel has four figures of soldiers who became early Christian martyrs, including Saint Martinian, who helped Saint Peter to escape prison, and Saint Florian. The chapel also has a scene of Saint Casimir miraculously helping Lithuanians in the Siege of Polotsk and Saint Wenceslaus fighting with his brother Boleslaus the Cruel. This chapel clearly reflects Pac's interests: he dedicated most of his life to military and thought of himself as a knight. The chapel of Saint Ursula has more figures of early martyrs (Saint Apollonia, Saint Barbara, and Saint Catherine of Alexandria) that emphasize purity. The chapel of Saint Augustine emphasizes his teachings on Holy Trinity as undivided unity.The transept has altars of two brotherhoods that were active in the church: Merciful Mother of God and Five Wounds of Christ. These brotherhoods existed before the current church was built and, therefore, the imagery is inherited from the previous church. The western (left) transept displays the painting of Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy and two large Turkish war drums (timpano, 140 cm (55 in) in circumference) that were seized from the Ottomans in the Battle of Khotyn of 11 November 1673 and granted to the church by its founder Micha\u0142 Kazimierz Pac. The transept ceiling has stucco reliefs from the life of Mary (with Visitation at the center) and crucifixion of Jesus. The Rococo pulpit was installed in 1801\u20131804. Carved of wood in a shape of a boat, it is supported by two tritons from the bottom. It is decorated with gilded details, including reliefs of eagle, bull, lion, and angel which symbolize the Four Evangelists.\n\n\n=== Interior: main altar ===\n\nA noticeable feature is the missing main altar, which is known only from a description found in the inventory from 1766. It was carved from dark wood, gilded, and served as the focal center of the otherwise white interior. The altar had two levels. The upper level had a miraculous painting of Saint Peter that was most likely brought from the previous church. It was surrounded by sculptures of the twelve apostles representing the twelve tribes of Israel or the chosen people. The lower lever had a painting of Saint Paul surrounded by sculptures depicting twelve pagan nations representing the world or the converted people. This altar was moved to the Catholic church in Daugai in 1766 and only fragments survive to the present day. With the loss of the altar, imagery of Saint Paul diminished significantly within the church. The altar as such was not replaced. Instead, Kazimierz Jelski sculpted four prophets (Daniel, Jeremiah, Isaiah and Elijah) while Franciszek Smuglewicz painted the large central painting depicting the emotional final parting of Saint Peter and Paul.Four other paintings hang in the choir: another painting by Smuglewicz depicting Archangel Michael, painting of Saint Mary Magdalene of Pazzi, a formal portrait of founder Micha\u0142 Kazimierz Pac, and a painting of crucified Jesus. This painting depicts a solar eclipse symbolizing crucifixion darkness and is said to be Pac's favorite. Parts of Jesus (crown of thorns, four nails, and perizoma) are covered in metal. The apse has four sculptures that stand inside wall niches, including Saint Jacob, John the Baptist, and resurrected Christ.The ceiling of the apse is decorated with three stucco reliefs depicting the conversion of Paul the Apostle, calling of Saint Peter, and handing over of the keys of Heaven and papal tiara to Peter by Christ. This scene emphasizes that Peter and subsequent popes derived their power directly from God and is a strong Counter-Reformation statement. Above them, there is a relief of the Holy Spirit represented as a dove. The ceiling of the choir has a relief of the dinner at Emmaus. Next to it, there is a Latin inscription that reads domus dei aedificata est supra firmam petram (your house is built on firm rock) which echoes with the inscription on the base of the dome.The left corner between the transept and the choir has a sculpture of Jesus known as Jesus of Antakalnis. The sculpture is life-sized (185 cm (73 in)), made of hardwood, dressed in clothes of white silk and purple velvet, and has a wig of natural black hair. A copy of a statue displayed in the Basilica of Jesus de Medinaceli in Madrid, it is the most prominent example of Spanish Baroque in Lithuania. It depicts the scene of Ecce homo: flogged Christ with a crown of thorns facing an angry mob. The sculpture's hands and head were ordered by Jan Kazimierz Sapieha the Younger from Roman artists in 1700. They were attached to a locally made torso and can be rotated. According to an 1804 canonical visitation, there are sacred relics sealed inside the head of the sculpture. The sculpture was displayed in the main altar of the Trinitarian Church built by Sapieha until the church was converted into an Eastern Orthodox church in 1864. At that time it was moved to its present-day location at St. Peter and St. Paul's. The opposite corner has a stucco sculpture of Saint Francis of Assisi made in the first half of the 20th century.\n\n\n=== Interior: dome and ceilings ===\n\nThe dome's pendentives depict the Four Evangelists. The inscription surrounding the base of the dome (Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram edificabo ecclesiam meam et portae inferi non praevale buntadversus eam: You are Peter (rock) and on that rock I shall build my church and gates of hell shall not prevail against it) is from the Confession of Peter and is the same as that of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. Above it, there are sculptures of four Doctors of the Church: Saint Jerome, Saint Augustine (his sculpture can be seen from the entrance), Saint Ambrose, and Pope Gregory I. Still above them there are scores of angels. The composition culminates with God the Father in the center of the dome as if to say that God sees everything. This composition seems inverted since the Evangelists are below the Doctors, but that could be a purposeful statement to emphasize importance of the Church after the Council of Trent. A boat-shaped chandelier made of brass and glass beads hangs from the middle of the dome and reminds that Saint Peter was a fisherman. Made by craftsmen from Liep\u0101ja and installed in 1905, it had eight seven-branch candle holders.The ceiling is decorated with five frescos that cover 14.94 m2 (160.8 sq ft) which are the second largest ceiling frescoes (after the Pa\u017eaislis Monastery) in Lithuania. The three smaller frescoes above the organ form a triptych from Saint Peter's life: healing a cripple, escape from prison, and vision of a sheet with animals. The other two frescoes depict Quo vadis? and Peter's confrontation with Simon Magus. These frescoes are of a rather simple composition, poorly executed, and lack background detail, but the figures are expressive, making complex, dynamic, almost theatrical movements. The authorship of the frescoes is unknown. Vladas Dr\u0117ma attributed them to Martino Altomonte, while Mieczys\u0142aw Skrudlik suggested Michelangelo Palloni. Mindaugas Paknys, using surviving written records, disproved both hypotheses and attributed the frescoes to Johann Gotthard Berchhoff. Two other frescoes by a different author decorate the sacristies. They depict Jesus saving Saint Peter from drowning and a vision of Stanis\u0142aw Kazimierczyk.\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPa\u017eaislis Monastery \u2013 another Baroque masterpiece founded by a member of the Pac family\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n\n== External links ==\nPanoramic tour of the church",

          "Arrived early but obviously a popular site to visit. It's just outside the main town but has to be seen, impressive stucco interiors.",
          "The whole thing is decorated in white plaster figures. Many have a secular slant because the work was paid for by a local wealthy businessman. It was overseen by Italian artisans but done by local workmen.",
          "The all white interior is stunning with detail, one of the most impressive Baroque style churches around. The church is from the 17th century. The hundreds of stuccoed sculptures are just amazing.",
          "Very impressive church inside and outside. The interior is really something else and decorated with hand made plaster sculptures. This church is really a masterpiece of the Baroque architecture. A must see when in Vilnius.",
          "The church appears to be a little run down, but, as with most churches in this part of the world, it is very pretty inside.",
          "An exceptional religious monumental structure. With deep Christian iconic hand made designs. A must see in Vilnius.LT",
          "This is another impressive church in the Old Town Area. It is just as impressive inside as outside, and it is shameful during the communist years these churches were closed and people could not practice Christianity. The communist regime collapsed so maybe they were not better",
          "Seriously, if you like too much of something, this church is a great place to visit. If you're not religious, the meaning can be a bit lost, but the interior is something to see and admire.",
          "Ornate exterior in an imposing location on a slight hill but open the doors and you find a reasonable austere place of worship.",
          "This is one of 40 churches that the Russians left available for worship during the occupation. The interior is heavily decorated with hand made plaster sculptures, mainly of soldiers. Worth a visit.",
          "The interior of this church i amazing. I could sit and spectate all day. There was a baptism in the church during our visit whichmade it even more spectactacular. Definitely worth your time.",
          "This church is a little bit long from centre. It is a masterpiece of barroque architecture. I do not like barroque but this church is impressive",
          "great building and interior can get crowded, but worth while looking around inside great photos to be had",
          "Another historic place with religious value. Anothdr cant miss site when visiting. If not religious then go for the history and architecture.",
          "After walking three hours at Vilnius Old town and visit so many churches I could remember my tour guide told me that no one can day he visited Vilnius if he did not visit Church of St. Peter and St. Paul. We visited this church in afternoon. From outside it was not that special.",
          "Beautiful architecture on the outside, very close to the Vilnius Townhall. Very central in the oldtown of Vilnius",
          "St Peter & Paul\u2019s Church is one of the main landmarks of Vilnius and it was visited by the Pope. Worth a visit to see the all white Baroque style of the interior. A Classical Cathedral style with a new flair. These pictures give a brief intro into the feel of the inside of the",
          "A must do is you are in Vilnius. A little outside the center but a very short taxi ride. Outside is covered in pictures of the pope visiting and the inside, as said , is very impressive. It was pretty busy when I went which shows it\u2019s importance as a place to see.",
          "There are 2000 sculptures on the inside of the church. Once you enter through the main doors, you can see a baby on the left handside. The whole church is telling the story of his life and it ends with a reaper, that is awaiting for all of us, right from the main entrance.",
          "Enjoyed seeing these places we walked everywhere to visit sites. Lots & lots of walking. Take good walking shoes with you",
          "First place of pagan love goddess Milda.Nice interior ,make with LOVE.Look for detals of all sculpture..LOVE for god or for people?Answer is in you heart...",
          "Pity that it's pretty far away from the old town, we took a Taxify to get there and it was perfect. Pity also that they were doing some work but I guess March is not really the best time to visit, they'll probably get everything read before summer. But totally worth a visit!!!",
          "I have been to many churches, basilicas and cathedrals but generally a lot are not memorable or particularly stand out, this one did however, i have never been to a church with so many statues carved into the roof and walls. truly amazing",
          "As a lover of baroque architecture, this church did not disappoint. Make sure you visit the interior to see the 2,000 plus stucco figurines from over 300 years.",
          "Take a slow stroll from Cathedral Square to the Antakalnis district of Vilnius, and see the incredible 2000+ stuccos of this former monastery. Photos of a visit from Pope John-Paul in 1993 are proudly displayed at the entrance. Beautiful",
          "Nice beautiful architecture with sculptures all over the walls and ceilings. Men have to remove head gears when entering this building. Get a guide to share the story. Free to enter.",
          "Wonderfully insane interior with highly intricate work that must have taken some time and expertise to complete.",
          "Frescoes and ornate Baroque from the 17th century and although war has destroyed the structure and or parts of the church over the years, the last church stands in its unique beauty. We visited a number of churches in the Baltics and St. Peter and Paul was one of the best.",
          "This is out alittle from the middle of the old town, but worth the effort to find it. It is a christian church with beautiful carved statues on all of the walls telling the various bible stories.",
          "This building inside is superb and well worth a slow walk round to absorb the workmanship that has gone into all the statues. Worth donating a euro for it\u2019s upkeep.",
          "The exterior of this church stands out for its architecture. Reminiscent of Italianate design, Sts Peter and Paul has high towers, is sandy yellow and is trimmed in white; while maroon tile roofing completes the picture. As striking as its exterior is, it's the interior that",
          "Beautiful art of work, full white in color inside, everyday lots of tourist visit this people if you really visit vilnius don't miss this church to visit,",
          "The church is not in the old town centre so you may have to take a trolleybus there. I asked a priest if tehre were toilets and he said no. After having seen so many churches and cathedrals, this was basically \"just another one\"",
          "The interior of this church is amazing. Over 200 sculptures on the walls and ceilings depicting scenes from the Bible. This church was not taken over by the Soviets, so it is original.",
          "This church was built very beautiful looking, inside is very beautiful as well, I took many pictures inside",
          "Although it\u2019s a little further than most of other churches and monasteries that are usually around the famous old city center, this church is a must visit for people who like religious tourism and similar landmarks but also for those who wish to see and admire baroque",
          "Same religion, many architectural designs both exterior and interior. Cannot decide what is most inspiring as long as you realize that churches are built to worship.",
          "The church is located a little further from the city center. Inside it looks really impressive, but from the outside it needs a reanovation.",
          "This is truly one of the major architectural highlights of Vilnius. The interior of the church will take your breath away. You could spend hours observing and analyzing everything that you see, and the all white interior is also something else. The church can easily be reached",
          "I think this is a must-see - a truly amazing building. Especially liked the hanging ship sculpture. Also be aware that there is a small gift shop located down a short path just outside - this is worth visiting if you are interested in a wide variety of religious gifts and items",
          "From the outside this is quite a magnificent building. Inside it is covered in lots of stucco work and painted white. There is a neat glass work chandelier of a boat. Worth a visit!",
          "The Peter and Paul's Church is not so far from the city center of Vilnius so it is easy to reach via trolleybuses - two stops away from the station near the bridge from the city center. From the outside it doesn't look like a big deal but once inside you are astonished by the",
          "Not in the middle of the city, but certainly worth a detour. Amazing interior designed by an Italian architect but constructed with local craftsmen over several years. The only color used is white but the forms are diverse and with beautiful details!",
          "Just lovely inside with all the sculptures on this church all in white. Lovely place around it too..",
          "06 July, 2017. I was walking around the Old Town in some gorgeous weather, when I decided to visit one of the most beautiful baroque churches in Vilnius. The place is a pleasant walk from the Old Town: it is a straight path from the Cathedral Square (where I had come in), along",
          "This church is very beautiful and impressive on its building and architecture. It is located near the town hall square so you won\u2019t miss it. The warm colour gives it a very pleasant feel.",
          "This church is about 1.5 miles outside of the center of the city, but it is definitely worth the short bus or taxi ride. Trolleys and buses stop almost across the street from the church. The church is very intricate inside and has a really impact sculptures and paintings.",
          "St. Peter and St. Paul's Church is a Roman Catholic church located in the Antakalnis neighborhood of Vilnius, According to legend, the first church located in the outskirts of Vilnius at Antakanis was built in the 14th century on the site of the Temple of Milda, the Baltic",
          "Located a little outside the city centre, but a pleasant enough and not too demanding walk (or an easy street car ride). Impressive structure from the outside, and some interesting features inside, including a large glass ship (chandelier?) suspended from the ceiling.",
          "We happened upon this church late Friday morning and there were 3 weddings semicolon one finishing, one starting, and one waiting. It was great fun to see. The church is a bit tired and worn; they are requesting donations for restoration. With all the beautiful sculptures a",
          "If you like white on white stucco baroque decoration do go. However, having been in so many beautiful churches I wouldn't rate this one as an outstanding one. Specially as it is a little bit far from Center Vilnius.",
          "It is a very impressively decorated church, although it isn\u2019t imposing from the outside. It has highly decorated plaster ceilings throughout the church and an impressive chandelier shaped like a ship.",
          "Looks really impressive. Lots of beautiful sculptures which create a pathetic atmospheare. Worth seeing if you like rich religious ornamentation.",
          "This church is considered a masterpiece of Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth baroque. There are over 2000 figures in stucco. Every surface is sculpted in white. It is a popular attraction so ask your guide about timing to avoid the crowds and to have enough time to take it all",
          "Vilnius is not short of churches and you could visit lots within the old town. That said St. Peter and Paul is worth a visit. Unlike others it sits a bit off the road, so you can take in the view and get some photos without worrying about the traffic. Admission is free but the",
          "Very beautiful church with lots of decorative elements inside. Has very good acustic, I have played there with an ensemble, Fibich's Poem and Bach's Air sounds heavenly there...",
          "In old town, open most hours. Beautiful church with great history. Nice, free diversion that will lift your spirits.",
          "My wife and I recently visited this great Baroque church while in Vilnius. The interior made this a \u2018must see\u2019 site. It contains over 2,000 stucco figurines created by Italian sculptor Pieter Perti. Well worth a visit when in Vilnius!",
          "Baroque church with extensive white decoration inside (not the usual overwhelming gold...). It deserves the long walk from the town center.",
          "A very beautiful and gorgeous church is located not in the very center of the city. It's a shame, but there is a need for facade reanovation.",
          "This is undoubtedly the most beautiful baroque church in Lithuania. Richness of its d\u00e9cor in combination of uninterrupted pure whiteness of sculptures and intricate stucco carvings is unusual and very impressive. Every part of the church tells its history through the",
          "This is one of the most beautiful churches I have ever seen! The interior is painted in shades of white. Very ornate, including a crystal sculpture titled: \"Peter's Boat\". A MUST SEE !!",
          "This is probably the most beautiful Church in Vilnius and well worth a visit if you have the time, the white stuccos are stunning, but it's a little out of the old town and if comparing to some of the other iconic churches in Europe (St Peter's Basilica, St Pauls, Westminster",
          "Not the most spectacular exterior, but the interior is a Baroque extravaganza that is reminiscent of Bernini cathedrals in Rome. There is also a gorgeous chandelier in the form of a ship that must be seen during a visit to Vilnius. Be sure to look for the coin box that turns on",
          "While this church may look completely plain on the outside, it is unique and stunning on the inside - large amount of decor is white. It is well worth the visit even to people who wouldn't be that interested in churches otherwise. Outside there's a small shop where you can get",
          "This is a gem beautifully restored from years of communist desecration and vulgar repurposement. One of many gorgeous churches in Vilnius",
          "This in my opinion is the most beautiful church in the city. It's about a half and hour walk up the hill from the city center but you must visit this place. On the way back you can go through the forest to the hill of crosses and it's well worth the time and effort. Photography",
          "Situated outside of the town center this church is definitely worth a visit - we were lucky to arrive at the start of Sunday mass and could attend part of it even if the church was crowded !",
          "I been in many cathedral in Vilnius and I must say this is one of my favourite. Very quite and sacred. Design and architecture inside was amazing.",
          "We have been in most of the world's great cathedrals and churches but we were absolutely amazed by the superb interior of this church. Totally unexpected and world class. Takes a lot of time to absorb and it is better if you have a guide to point out the salient features of",
          "The facade may appear familiar but once inside you are astounded with the shear beauty of the intricate carvings and statues, and grand roof. A short 15 minute walk from cathedral square. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.",
          "Walked here by the river but there are trams/buses to the Church. Very busy with coach tours so go early or late. Stunning stuccoes. Make sure you see the swan chandelier lit up.",
          "You have to go a bit away from the center for this (not for away, just a few stops) and it might not make in impression at first sight, but the interior is absolutely amazing and serene.",
          "This is great , an architecture is amazing.Unfortunately I was not able to see this church fully as it was a mass and immediately after this the priest started locking the door.",
          "Extravagant decor which tops most of the other buildings in Vilnius. Especially found the ceiling intense and beautiful",
          "Bit out of the old town, but well worth a visit, it is very highly decorated with statues and stucco inside.",
          "As we approached, my initial thoughts were this church has seen better days; it needs a good coat of paint. Walking in though, I was blown away. It is definitely one of the most ornate churches I have seen in 75 countries that is not dripping in gold ornamentation. For a tiny",
          "The outside is nothing special but the inside includes a huge number of plaster figures which are very impressive. There is also an unusual maritime-themed chandelier.",
          "this is beautiful but just lots of photo and painting. you can enjoy if you love the gold look easy to get to",
          "This church is a bit outside the old town but it is a nice walk along the river. It\u2019s the most beautiful church in Vilnius if you ask me. Absolutely worth a visit.",
          "Visit this church, but try to get a guide to explain the significance of the elaborate ceiling art. It is lovely to look at, but it is even more fascinating when one really understands the meaning.",
          "You can see the afrescos, a lot, in this church! Interesting for the catholics! Here in Vilnius there are many churchs, but this one is the best!",
          "One of the most unique and exquisitely beautiful church interiors, not only in Vilnius, but of many places.The architecture is wonderful and that ship made of intertwined metal above the front of the altar is fantastic.",
          "Take a few minutes to stroll over here and check it out. Even if you only spend 5 minutes here it's really something special. There's a donation box at the front if you want to take some photos, but take care not to be noisy as there will be worshipers there.",
          "The Church was practically empty when I visited, which meant I could wander around with ease. When you go there, notice all the nooks and crannies at the back and side of the building; you will get to see the stucco work up close. A real treasure!",
          "A nice short walk along the river from the town centre. Doesn't look particularly special from the outside but the architecture on the inside was stunning!",
          "While located a little out of the way (only a short walk) it's certainly worth a visit. The church is large and imposing and contains a very impressive interior with some interesting features and details.",
          "Stunning church! The outstanding architecture made me speechless, it made me feel like overwhelmed by the beauty of Art. Definitely is worth the visit!",
          "Most beautiful carvings I have ever seen in a church! The entire ceiling and all the walls are covered. Entrance is free, but you must pay for photos.",

          "I've seen many churches around Europe and to be honest didn't expect this one to be as impressive as it was. Definitely worth visiting, the interior is amazing",
          "Very nice ; one of many churches in the city - mainly Catholic and Orthodox. Well worth a short visit",
          "We are well travelled but this church looks like an elaborate ice-cream or icing sugar cake. It is superb, clean. It may be a little out of the way but jump the No2 trolleybus. You will not be disappointed.",
          "We stopped here during the bus tour. Inside there was a lady sitting and she gave us a leaflet in English to read. The church is beautiful and the pulpit is wonderful. It is quiet and serene inside and there is a statue of St. Francis with amazing features.",
          "The interior of this church is simply stunning. While the outside of the church is pretty too, it is nothing in comparison with all the sculptures inside. A must-see!",
          "I managed to spend a few minutes in here as my Vilnius bus tour stoped here. (Note only one of the tours stops long enough to go in). Otherwise it's a bit out of the way ... Beautiful inside with statues and paintings everywhere.",

          "It is little bit out of the center of the city, but it is worth visiting. It is a Baroque masterpiece, with beautiful Neoclassical designs inside. If you like to visit churches, this one you don't want to miss.",
          "A not to miss place when visiting Vilnius and very engaging. Upscale shopping is easily accessible from the square. Fine dining is also avail with close proximity to the square KFC is just opposite the square and a 24/7 Macdonald is just a 2 /3 min walk on an upscale shopping",
          "Impressive Baroque jewel, with interior decorated by Italian masters. A must-see for any fan of the style. Contains 13 chapels, all decorated with sculptures from floor to ceiling. Highly recommended to visit with a guide or someone who knows the content of each chapel, although",
          "I grow up in the contemporary part of church ensemble (hospital) and played in the church yard and the bank of the river Neris. St. Paul and Peter church was built on the hilly sacral place of pagan religion and absorbed the strength and mistic of the surrounding. It still",
          "Although the church is a little out of the centre, it's definitely worth the short walk. While it's not as colourful as some Italian churches, I don't think I've ever seen so much detailed carving. Nearly everywhere is covered with gorgeous , intricate friezes & statues. There",
          "A very beautiful city with lots to see. A must are all the churchs. The streets are nice and clean. Take a tour to Tokia ( if I spelt correctly)",
          "The interior of this church is a MUST SEE. From the outside the church looks nice from a distance & worn from nearby. BUT, go inside & the detail is a marvel, all in an ivory shade. If the lights are off, walk down the aisle & to the right of the altar area is a meter, 2euros",
          "The outside of the church might be not so amazing. But the inside is a whole another talk. The architecture of inside the church is just amazing. One of the most beautiful churches even in the whole Europe.",
          "If you see only one church this one is pretty spectacular. Go earlier when the sun is shining. At 3:30pm I could still make out the stunning ceiling but it would have very during the day.",
          "Do not get apprehensive by seeing the exterior of the church. It is truly stunning from inside. The workmanship & intricacy of the work inside is truly outstanding. Interesting aspects like the crystal ship chandelier, the scull murals near the entrance ceiling etc makes it that",
          "From out side it\u2019s seem just ordinary Baroque church in some Balkan city but when we entered this place, we just overwhelmed with the structure and the sculptures. The Baroque style of architecture in its finest. Some are still colorful like in many Baroque church in south",
          "This church is beautiful, a must see. It\u2019s out of old town but very walkable - maybe 15 minutes from old town. The details are amazing, it\u2019s all white and just spectacular.",
          "I don't think Ive been into many other churches that have been quite so over the top baroque. Not an undecorated inch left. No wonder it took 30 years to build. Quite surprising and glad we found it.",
          "The carvings and statues inside the church are very ornate, and somehow survived the Soviet rule when Lithuania was part of the Soviet Union.",
          "A bit of a walk out of the centre of town but lovely church. A wedding was going on while we were there. It has a beautiful ceiling and is very attractive inside",
          "On the outside this looks like a fairly plain and unassuming church and consequently I didn't have many expectations for when I got inside. But what an amazing interior this church has. Simply breathtaking to see such beauty, intricate detail and stucco work throughout. A",
          "Vilnius is full of churches, many of them having elaborate Baroque interiors of coloured marbles, statues, reliefs but this Church if St Peter and St Paul surprises with its all white interior decoration. True, the stucco reliefs, mouldings, column capitals are all there but",
          "I am fascinated by old churches for their architecture and history, not for religious reasons. This one is particularly ornate and opulent, a bit over the top but definitely worth a visit. The boat chandelier is superb",
          "go to this quite and nice church in Antakalnis near the rever Neris, you will be able to walk along the river and enjoy this nice place",
          "the Church outside does not say the giant meringue cake you'll see inside, it's huge and all white with a central boat-shaped lamp. You have to see it, it is very interesting.",
          "Just one of the churches we visited, everywhere your eye will come across a church, to visit them all would a great deal more time than we had.",
          "I was on the city bus tour and we were able to get off at this church for 15 minutes. What I hadn't realized is that it was Sunday morning. Church services happen Sunday morning. In churches. And this one IS still operating as a church. So I felt super awkward walking around the",
          "My friend does not miss an old church and this was on the tour. This church has lovely sculptures, frescos, and paintings. Hand carved woodwork abounds",
          "The interior art work is quite unusual and needs time to fully take it all in. The sculptures are unique and exquisite.",
          "Excellent Baroque/Roccoco Architecture. I like the ancient skin drum with the sign in English saying \" Do Not Touch\". I guess it was meant for us Americans since we much touch everything. I like the nearby restaurant with excellent \" Zeppelin \" dumplings and mushroom gravy.",
          "You have to visit inside this church to see its real beauty. The sculptures and artwork takes your breathe away",
          "The interior of this church is amazing, the carvings are just beautiful. Look for the sailing ship with the glass or crystal sails hanging from the ceiling.",
          "This church seems nice but not extraordinary when you first glimpse it on the outside but then you walk inside and are knocked off your feet! It is a brilliantly white Baroque explosion of stucco figures done between 1675 and 1704 by Italian sculptors - putti, angels, saints,",
          "Was very impressed by this church and the ornate plaster art within. It appears the artists-designers left no inch of wall or ceiling bare. Impressive detail in all spaces of this cathedral.",
          "One of the best examples of barroc. Over two thousands of sculptures make the interior beatiful. Try to find a sculpture of a devil - really rare in Catholic church.",
          "On the outside this church looks just nice, no big deal. Need to go inside, and o holy caw. It is the jaw dropping experience!!!! to see the thousand and hundreds of amazing ornaments with so many details. It is all in one tone ~ the white. Definitively, one of the most",
          "I was brought to this church on a day tour, and was really surprised how different it was. The interior\u2019s over the top decorations were all done in white plaster. I have never seen a church like this anywhere before. There were skeletons, a big cauldron with three people being",
          "Quite the showy church, which was financed by Vilnius' wealthy. Artwork, windows, relics are all better than average. A bit out of town.",
          "After wandering thru the Bernadine Gardens, I walked up to see this church. There was a wedding going on so I didn't go in, but it was another beautiful church!",
          "This church stands high in the memories of the Polish people, who visit it in large numbers as a kind of pilgrimage // since Vilnius once was called Wilna..interior is full of statues, I would recommend a guide to make you understand the importance of this church",

          "Absolutely gorgeous inside. But way too many other tourists. The viking ship chandelier was very surprising.",
          "This is one of the most beautiful churches I have seen in Lithuania. But you have to go inside to see the beauty! The difference of outside and inside is SO much!",
          "With Sv. Apastalu Petro ir Povilo Baznycia being a bit remote location with no eye-catching facade, one might wonder whether to skip it or not. Well, skipping it would be a huge mistake. Even people that are no particular baroque fans will enjoy it in my opinion - the interiors",
          "If you like you cathedrals baroque, visit this one. It is full, fuller, fullest. More than 2.000 faces in there.",
          "I've seen many churches and I am not so thrilled about it anymore. But this particular church has a fantastic decoration and art inside. You can spend a lot of time just looking at the work. Very nice indeed !",
          "Inside it is perhaps over the top but the stucco fleshy cherubs, ceiling mouldings and stained glass windows are truly amazing. It's just a little outside the centre but so worth a visit",
          "Out of the numerous churches I've visited this has definitely the most rock sculptures ever. Especially the ceiling is worth a longer relaxed visit.",
          "Easy to find and well worth a look inside very ornate church and one of many in vilnius be careful not to be all churched out by the end of your trip .",
          "The church appearance is not very outstanding but the inner decoration was fine and grand. On the date we visited, there was a couple getting married. Worth to take a look while you are in LTU.",
          "a beautiful church with a great deal of plaster and sculpture work and a viking ship hanging from the ceiling. we visited on the way to the cemetery",
          "Don't be misled by the plain outside. Step inside and you'll be treated to a decorative overload! One of the most highly decorated churches we have ever visited. Go and visit!",
          "Visited this church with a large group ,there are an amazing number of figures individually hand molded by artists I have never seen so many statues and figures in the one building before . It is a very popular stop for tour buses and can get quite crowded this is one of kind in",
          "Beautiful, artistic stucco sculptures molded by fingers covered almost every surface of the church interior. While crowded, it was still worth the effort to visit.",
          "Given the number of church choices this building stood out for its beautiful stucco work. A joy to visit",
          "Really enjoyed visiting this church and seeing all of the splendid decorations on the interior. It's definitely worth stopping by for a visit.",
          "The lacy details of this architecture took my breath away. I am not a religious person but this one shouldn't be missed.",
          "The inside of the church is amazing: thousands stucco statues with a lot of details. The church is located outside of the Old Town but it costs about $2.50 on uber to get there. On the way back you can walk to the Tree Crosses.",
          "Will be interesting for those who are interested in architecture especially barrocco period. Church build at peak of Lithuanian power by one of the richest noble families.",
          "Definitely one of the most beautiful, if not the most beautiful church in Vilnius. The exterior is similar to many other, but the numerous amount of sculptures the interior has makes the visit necessary.",
          "A bit outside the old city but walkable or take the bus. Plasterwork is incredible. Worth the trip..",
          "This church has such a beautiful internal decor. Totally white. Instead of common gold colors inside you will see white sculptures and decorations, white organ on the entrance wall. Can't find words to describe how beautiful it is. Advice: if you travel by car, there are some",
          "Lots of cities, plenty of churches. You can certainly get blanked out by the NADC (Not Another Damn Church) effect, though of course some, many in fact, are just so uniquely special, the love and architecture awe-inspiring, like this one here in Vilnius. St. Peter and Pauls,",
          "The interior of this church is a white confection of stucco decoration, quite light and airy. Aside from the fun of wandering around looking at the lively figures, we enjoyed the large crystal bead ship hung in the middle of the nave.",
          "This church looks outside nice, but not anything very special. But as you step inside you will be amazed of the brightness and all the great figures, over 2000, made on the walls and ceiling. Great and very much worth of going inside and having a silent moment.",
          "There's a saying, that it is better one time to see than 100 times to hear. And it perfectly matches talking about St. Peter and Paul's Church. Though I am not very interested in architecture and looking from the outside seems nothing special, but it was amazingly interesting to",
          "I remember my first visiting of this perfect Catholic Church.I was a child then but my impression was so big, and I decided to come to this Church again. I walk from Maironio street by feet, and walking was nice, under green trees... Oh, this MIRACLE of St.Peter and Paul",
          "I love architecture and this place definitely was worth the long walk to get there. You can take bus number 2 for one euro and it will take you right there try to get off the bus after the Tree Line Road before the roundabout. As I entered the Beautiful Church I was astounded to",
          "Outside of the Old Town area, east of Gedimas Hill and just south of the River, is this church. Doesn't look like much from the outside. Inside are over 2000 baroque stuccoes created by Italian sculptors between 1675 and 1704. There are stucco sculptures everywhere.",
          "Inside architecture it is truly breathtaking. It is not in central Vilnius but worth visiting, I think it is in a list of the most beautiful catholic churches in the world.",
          "The interior of this church is magnificent , it includes demons, skeletons and serpents as well as angels and everyday faces. You should not miss this unique experience",

          "Definitely worth the walk to see this exquisite church! You will not be sorry! The ceilings and walls are breathtaking!",
          "This is a hidden pearl in the outskirts of Vilnius. If you're interested in rococo and baroque architecture be sure to visit. The exterior is beautiful, and there are lots of interesting pieces on view inside the church. However, it is the magnificent stucco with thousands of",
          "You will be surprised by the 2.000 sculptures incorporated into its interior decoration, a true must see, but not a walking distance from old town, taxi would cost arround 2.5-3 euro (2017), or public transport station at 40 meters.",
          "The church doesn't look special until you step inside and you can enjoy stunning architecture and this unique place",
          "This church looks similar to many others in the City but step inside and you will be blown away by the most incredible plasterwork we have ever seen. Totally stunning. Take the open top bus (hop on hop off) and you can spend as long as you wish here.",
          "Interesting area both from touristic and cultural points of view, generally speaking more Western European than Russian in terms of habits, history, traditions. Local people are very friendly, proud of their country and willing to promote it",
          "While not as easy to get to as other churches in Vilnius, this one had some amazing architectural details.",
          "Best to visit NOT on a Sunday, which we did; but even, the sculptures inside are the best I've ever seen in their multitudes. You don't need a guide or guidebook to marvel at the art this church contains. It's a little out of the way (behind the 3 cross Hill), but effort should",
          "Very beautiful and spiritual place.One of the 10 most beautiful churches in Europe. Magnificent interior with beautiful chapels.",
          "Worth a visit if you are in Vilnius! It is not bthe best church in the Baltic but bstill it is impressive!",
          "The Church is impressive from the outside, however its white detailed interior will make you say WOW. It is very impressive",
          "White amazing church with a crystal ship as a lamp. As I remember everybody can put the coin and see how this lamp looks when it shines. This church is one of the most beautiful in Vilnius. Also would like to mention one interesting thing that here you can find \"scythe of death\"",

          "simply stunning piece of architecture... Having grown up in Vilnius this place was a discovery for me and my friends :) Definitely worth a visit :)",

          "Worth visiting if you have free time in Vilnius. There are many sculptures inside and this makes this church special.It was included in the list of the most beautiful curches in the world. Exterior looks simple but inside it is stunning",
          "The wonder of this church is its ceiling. Absolutely stunning plaster work, never seen anything better",
          "This church must be seen from the inside. It has lots of sculptures, frescoes and reliefs, paintings. When You're inside - try to find a sculpture of a skeleton (death reaper), it's quite exclusive. Also chandelier in a form of a ship is worth an attention.",
          "Not very impressive outside, but really beautiful inside. Might be problems with parking near to the church.",
          "Beautiful baroque interior, definitely worth to leave the old city to see this one. Combines very well with cemetery visit. Ps you can skip the restaurant across the street :)",
          "While this church is about 1/2 hour walk from the old town, it is definitely worthwhile a visit. It is completely different to the other churches in the old town. The Stuka work is fantastic. Take a seat and look around.",
          "In the city that has many this an outstanding example of a Baroque Church.Plenty of paintings, sculptures and statues.",
          "It is the most beautiful church in Vilnius. The amount of sculptures is incredible and you want to sit there and just look at those wonderful scenes. I felt there like in \"frozen theatre\". Everything felt so real and almost alive. I love this church and always visiting when I am",
          "With the exterior done in stunning white Baroque style, this is a must see in Vilnius. With its double towers it is a commanding sight. This is a Roman Catholic Church consecrated in 1701. Funded by Michael Kazimierz at his request he is buried at the threshold. The inside is",
          "The church is so beautiful inside. It really is a masterpiece of baroque. It is near the river beside the old town easy to reach.",
          "Quite simple from outside, this is a real masterpiece inside. You can spend there many hours, but you will not see everything. So many scupltures! 2 italian architects worked on the interior, so you can see the difference between left and right side. Very unusual chandelier.",
          "This Church is out of city center, and you should take a trolleybus to reach it, but I recommend reaching it on foot via Uzupis (autonomous artistic self proclaimed part of town). The Church facade is simple Baroque, but still beautiful and in my opinion should be renovated. It",
          "You can spend hours here. So many sculptures - quite exceptional if you think about a church. Amazing chandelier - shape of a ship. Rich history.",
          "While not located in the old town, but nearby, this church is so beautiful. The inside of the church is just amazing.",

          "Lovely church, very ornate and they do let you take pictures.Only ask for contributions , no admission charge",
          "According to our guide you haven\u2019t been to Vilnius unless you have seen this church. And I make him right in that, really beautiful church. That is a must for those that like churches, or even if you are just so so interested",
          "This church is a must see, no doubt. If you love details, thoroughness and space - this is the place for you.",
          "This church is worth walking to but the outside is a little run down , paint flaking etc. Inside there was a Sunday mass service going on so we got to hear a little of the service. It was quite a busy mass service.",
          "You can take a bus, or walk around 30 min from the center of the city. You won't be disappointed, since this church is really beautiful! The inside will amaze you!",
          "A visit to this beautiful church is an absolute must. Wonderful stucco moulding statues and devils appearing in the moulding reminding us all that the devil is everywhere even in this beautiful church. There is a crystal boat that floats above to remind us that Peter was a",
          "Does not much change since 1980s, when I was taken here for the first time. But the interior is really nice (especially in hot summer days, when it's cool inside). Check the chandelier in the shape of a ship. The church is a perfect example of Lithuanian baroque.",
          "1) wonderful stucco molding; 2) beautiful architecture; 3) interior represents era; 4) do not refill water source and toilet; 5) small parking spaces; 6) easy to come from the center on foot or bicycle (not far away); 7) is always a lot of tourists; 8) If in chirch wedding or",
          "A visit to this church is a must. I was on a guided tour and I was in awe when I first entered the church",
          "This church does not look huge from the outside but it feels magnificent inside. As most structures in this side of Europe, the church was built centuries ago, mid 1600s. The impressive altar has a wooden statue of Jesus & on the ceiling hangs a sculpture of a boat,",
          "We walked here from our hotel which was a pleasant walk. There were a lot of buses waiting outside so I knew we would be fighting crowds. The church interior is beautiful and white with many sculptures. I loved the viking ship chandelier hanging in the center of the church.",

          "This magnificent Cathedral is stunning! The baroque style is different to anything we have seen before as it is all white,absolutely a must see!",
          "An unusual and jaw dropping interior that took the artisans 7 years to complete. I could have spent an hour just wandering. The suspended boat in honor of St. Peter is quite the sight. Take lots of pictures.",
          "Believe what is said; outside not much to look at, but inside a whole new world opens up. Mind blowing. Well worth a visit, not in the middle of town, but worth the trouble.",
          "We visited on a Sunday morning between services. Our guide gave us the interesting history of the church. I felt awkward invading the sanctity of the church on a Sunday for sightseeing.",

          "When our tour guide told us we were en route to the Wedding Cake Church, I thought I\u2019d misunderstood. A church where a wedding was being held? The interior confirms what she meant. The walls and ceilings appeared to be sculpted of white wedding cake icing, comprised for more",
          "It is necessary to visit with the guide and hear the whole story about the origin and the meaning of this amazing beauty inside.",
          "The outside of this building is nice but the inside is unbelievable all the way to the ceiling. It is free to tour inside. You can get a brochure if you leave a donation.",

          "The best example of late baroque in Vilnius, amazing white interior, not sure that the church is open all the time and it is a little far from the city centre and old town. Anyway must see object.",
          "I know that when you travel in Europe it is easy to get an overdose of church visits. This church is really worth the visit. It is a baroque style but almost all in white. It was very impressive and I've seen a lot of cathedrals.",

          "This church is baroque style and very beutiful. Some local of churches are distinguished Italy Mannerist style. Personally exterior did not impress me. But I really liked all the small details in interior. In fact when you go to the inside I said to myself woow .. something",
          "According to legend this church was built on the site of a Pagan temple. In 1668 Mykolas Kazimierzs Pacas, the Hetman of the grand Duchy of Lithuania and the wojewode of Vilnius began the construction of a new church in Antakalnis. It is said that he expressed his gratitude to",
          "Sadly, my visit was on a Sunday morning, so could go no further than the doorway but the chandelier over the main aisle was in the form of a filigree Noah's Ark. Fantastic.",
          "You really need a guide to explain the ornamentation of this completely over-the-top Baroque extravaganza. Look for the ubiqutous presence of the Devil, even at the alter, a reminder that going to church won't keep you from temptation or the results of sucumbing to it.",
          "Thousands of statues adorn the stark white interior of this cathedral. This is a far walk from the historic core, but a quick taxi ride will take you here.",
          "Don't miss this church. The interior is lovely and very colorful. There are a lot of churches here, but this is a favorite",
          "The most stunning interior of a Baroque Church I have ever seen. Bit of a walk from the city centre but well-worth it: the best thing in Vilnius.",
          "I went on a saturday, wedding and baptism days, which are interesting to see. The outside looks like a normal church and not really much that would attract many tourists. The inside, however, is whole other story!! It is the most beautiful church I have ever been to in my life.",
          "It was a half an hour walk from the city center to get there, but it was worth doing so. This beautiful baroque church is one of the most beautiful buildings in Vilnius. Very impressive.",
          "I have to admit I've seen enough baroque churches to last me a lifetime. This church which was completed in 1701, however, is very different. The entire church is white which makes the \"smallish\" paintings on the ceiling pop. While a white church may sound boring, it is",

          "This church has some much to see that you can be seating for hours and don't finish every single detail that it has. It's worth to come and really seat for at least 20 minutes to enjoy it inside. I do recommend that either come with a guide who can explain you all about it or",
          "I tire of too many churches and mosques (despite the great art works in many of them) - but this place was well worth visiting. The St Peter's boat chandelier was lovely and the range of statues was extensive and unique. Something totally different. Recommended.",
          "Consecrated in 1701, this is a very stunning church with all the stucco figures by Giovanni Pietro Perti and ornamentation by Giovanni Maria Galli. Very bright and white. The dome and ceilings are marvelous and don't miss the Danse Macabre stucco or the tombstone of Micha\u0142",

          "I am a church lover, and when it comes to churches I am picky. But this church I can really recommend. The wall imbeded statues and the interior of this church is magical. You will be surprised. We went here with a guide on a city tour, which was good, because there is a lot of",
          "Beautiful church,so well looked after. But like us too many tourist at the same time,very crowded with coach groups all seem to turn up together! Still got some great photos inside.",
          "You won't regret visiting the church. It's a bit farther away form the city centre but it is really worthwhile visiting. More than 2 000 stucco decorations by Giovanni Pietro Peretti (Perti) are absolutely gorgeous.",

          "We were very lucky as we have entered this church 15 minutes before closing. Please check opening hours. It seems it is opened from 9 to 18:30. There are a few Polish masses so please check exactly at what time. St. Peter and St. Paul's Church ( Polish: Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u015bw. Piotra i",
          "Walking through the Old Town you go fro one Church to another to admire from the outside. You dont have to go in to admire the different architecture of each",
          "I walked here before I went to the hill of 3 crosses just to have a quick look , once inside I was amazed the interior is stunning so much decoration I was actually lost for words and sat for over 30 mins just taking it all in. A MUST",
          "There really are so many churches through Europe that you can easily get \"churched out\". I only write about those that are pretty special. The Church of St Peter and St Paul easily fits into this 'special' category. It stuck I my mind after a visit to Vilnius several years ago",
          "Must go inside and appreciate to luciuos interior and sanctual art, feel the wibe that is not really anywhere in any other places of god",
          "One could admire all the carvings and adornments for a long time here. Every square inch is filled with decoration, very frufru. But, it all comes together in beauty. The first impression is one of extreme overload. But, as one slowly admires piece by piece one keeps seeing new",

          "This church was a bit of a trek to get to from the train station area. I paid for a taxi which still took a while. Be aware that at certain times there is mass so you won't be able to visit and explore. My visit was cut short due to a sermon in Polish which was annoying when",

          "Vilnius has many, many churches, this (larger) one is really worth a visit. However, it is a bit out of the way: a 2 km walk from the cathedral square. Beware of the beggars surrounding the church. It's the only church in Vilnius where they did accost me.",

          "This church isn't very central but it's not a far walk from the centre and in my opinion it is very much worth a visit! From the outside if looks like any other church but inside the decor is magnificent! There are many churches to be visited in Vilnius but I place this one at",
          "Like every amazing attraction, this church appears to be nonchalantly average, but on the INSIDE--SURPRISE! The church's interior is completely decorated on the inside with intricate baroque flourishes, including some shocking images (a merman? an elephant? not sure where those",

          "If you've just visited the three crosses, you can easily catch this church on the way back to the Old Town. That's what I did, and it was an unexpected bonus. Looks good on the outside, but the inside is better; it has lots of reliefs, and sculptures and stuff.",
          "Lithuania is a religious country and Sts. Peter and Paul is tangible evidence of that fact. There are many churches in Vilnius and many of them will repay the visitor's time with visual evidence of local piety. Sts. Peter and Paul, although a bit off the main axis of tourist",
          "The church is an absolute treasure house of gold baroque decorations and silver work. Make a point of seeing the side chapels. St Peter was the 'fisher of men' - don't miss the silver sailing ship that floats high above the centre aisle. This, after the Cathedral, is a 'must",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "U\u017eupis (Yiddish: \u05d6\u05d0\u05e8\u05e2\u05d8\u05e9\u05e2\u200e, Belarusian: \u0417\u0430\u0440\u044d\u0447\u0447\u0430, Russian: \u0417\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0447\u044c\u0435, Polish: Zarzecze) is a neighbourhood in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, largely located in Vilnius' old town, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. U\u017eupis means \"beyond the river\" or \"the other side of the river\" in the Lithuanian language and refers to the Vilnia River; the name Vilnius was derived from the Vilnia. The district has been popular with artists for some time, and has been compared to Montmartre in Paris and to Freetown Christiania in Copenhagen, due to its bohemian and laissez-faire atmosphere. On April 1, 1998, the district declared itself an independent republic (The Republic of U\u017eupis).\n\n\n== Geography ==\nU\u017eupis is quite small and isolated, being only about 148 acres (60 ha) in size; it has around 7,000 inhabitants, nearly 1,000 of which are artists.  On one side it is separated from the Old Town by the Vilnia River, on the second there are steep hills, and on the third side it borders on an industrial area built under Soviet rule.  The first bridges across the river were built in the 16th century, at which time the district's inhabitants were mostly Jewish.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe district contains the Bernardine Cemetery, one of the oldest cemeteries in the city. Most of the district's Jewish population were killed during the Holocaust, and later the old Jewish Cemetery uphill would be destroyed by the Soviets. The houses left abandoned were later occupied by marginal elements of society, mainly the homeless and prostitutes. Until Lithuania's declaration of independence in 1990, it was one of the most neglected areas in the city, containing many run-down houses, many without utilities.  The district has been a common haunt of artists and bohemians since Soviet times, and even today many young artists are squatting in abandoned buildings near the Vilnia River. \n\n\n== The Republic of U\u017eupis ==\n\nIn 1998, the residents of the area declared the Republic of U\u017eupis, along with its own flag, unofficial currency, president, cabinet of ministers, a constitution written by Romas Lileikis and Tomas \u010cepaitis, an anthem, and an army of approximately 11 men. The army has since been retired. The residents of the self-declared republic celebrate this independence annually on U\u017eupis Day, which falls on April 1. Artistic endeavours are the main preoccupation of the Republic; the President of the Republic of U\u017eupis, Romas Lileikis, is himself a poet, a musician, and a film director.\nThe Republic has granted honorary citizenship to several notable individuals, including the 14th Dalai Lama, who first visited the Republic in 2013, and later returned to plant a tree in the Republic's \"Tibet Square\".\nArt\u016bras Zuokas, a former mayor of Vilnius, lives in U\u017eupis. U\u017eupis does not house internet-cafes, kiosks, shopping malls, or governmental institutions (except U\u017eupian), and there is no embassy to Lithuania.\nIt is unclear whether the statehood of the Republic, recognised by no government, is intended to be serious, tongue-in-cheek, or a combination of both.  The decision to place U\u017eupis Day on April 1 (April Fools' Day) may not be coincidental, emphasising the importance of humor over \"serious\" political decisions. The flag of the Republic features the palm of a hand on a white background. The colour of the palm emblem changes seasonally, in the sequence blue (Winter), green (Spring), yellow (Summer), and red (Autumn).\n\n\n=== Ambassadors of U\u017eupis ===\n\nThe U\u017eupis Ministry of Foreign Affairs has appointed more than 500 ambassadors worldwide. The ambassadors have the task to build bridges between people. Some ambassadors represent the republic and its constitution in a certain state or geographic region while others share the republic's spirit in various realms of life like the ambassador among humming birds or the ambassador for whistling in the streets. The Embassy of the Republic of U\u017eupis to Munich builds bridges between arts and AI technology to make artificial intelligence more accessible to society, more ethical and more innovative. Well-known ambassadors are e.g. the experimental filmmaker Jonas Mekas, the art critic Konstyantyn Doroshenko and the experience designer Dr. Nelly Ben Hayoun. Every year the ambassadors meet for their world conference in U\u017eupis on the day before national day celebrations on April 1st.\n\n\n=== Constitution of U\u017eupis ===\n\nCopies of the 38 articles of the Republic's constitution and 3 mottos - \"Don't Fight\", \"Don't Win\", \"Don't Surrender\" - in 23 languages, can be found affixed to a wall in Paupio street in the area. Sanskrit and Hindi versions of the constitution were added on 25th May 2017.\nSome of these articles would be unremarkable in a constitution; for instance, Article 5 simply reads \"Man has the right to individuality.\".  Others are more idiosyncratic; a typical example can be found in Articles 1 (\"People have the right to live by the River Vilnel\u0117, while the River Vilnel\u0117 has the right to flow past people.\"), 12 (\"A dog has the right to be a dog.\") and 37 (\"People have the right to have no rights.\"), each of which makes an unusual apportionment of rights. \nThere are a number of paired articles, such as Articles 16 (\"People have the right to be happy.\") and 17 (\"People have the right to be unhappy.\") which declare people's right to either do or not do something, according to their desire.\nMinister of Foreign Affairs Thomas Chepaitis, Ambassador H. E. Max Haarich, AI-Expert Alex Waldmann and humanoid Roboy formulated an additional article for the Munich Embassy: \"Any artificial intelligence has the right to believe in a good will of humanity.\" This makes the U\u017eupian constitution the world's first constitution to mention artificial intelligence. In September 2018 the constitution was blessed by Pope Francesco during his visit in Vilnius.\n\n\n== Angel of U\u017eupis ==\n\nOn April 1, 2002, a statue of an angel blowing a trumpet was unveiled in the main square. The idea was developed from a desire to erect an angel in memory of animator and caricaturist Zenonas \u0160teinys. It became a symbol of the revival U\u017eupis. The funds were raised by selling miniature copies of the sculpture. The sculptor, Romas Vil\u010diauskas, is also the creator of the U\u017eupis Mermaid.Previously, a temporary sculpture of an egg stood in its place.  After being replaced by the larger statue of Gabriel, the egg was sold at an auction for 10,200 litas and now stands on Pylimo street.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nNotable people who have resided in U\u017eupis include:\n\nFelix Dzerzhinsky, also known as Iron Felix\u2014 Soviet Bolshevik revolutionary and secret police founder\nThe painter and composer Mikalojus Konstantinas \u010ciurlionis\nPolish romantic-comic poet Konstanty Ildefons Ga\u0142czy\u0144ski lived here in 1934-36\nJurgis Kun\u010dinas, author of 2 novels about U\u017eupis, and translator from German\nArt\u016bras Zuokas, former Vilnius mayor\n\n\n== In creative works ==\nThe Republic of U\u017eupis, a 2009 novel by the South Korean author Hailji, chronicles the journey of an Asian man named Hal visiting U\u017eupis to inter the ashes of his father, believing the \"Republic\" to be his ancestral homeland.\nU\u017eupis was the topic of a 2015 piece of music by The Mighty Sieben, featuring the three mottos, \"Don't Fight\", \"Don't Win\", \"Don't Surrender\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nConnolly, Kate (January 29, 2000). \"They tore down Lenin's statue - and raised one to Frank Zappa\".

          "Look around as you explore! It's easy to miss things like the mermaid. Perhaps the Angel should have sound effects?",
          "This is an interesting artistic community with hidden treasures wherever you look and a constitution that reflects how the people feel. This is a must visit when in Vilnius.",
          "Famous Bohemian area with its particular angel\u2019s statue and offers a joyful to walk around with its small galleries and different interesting store and the prominent cemetery that looks ancient to me.",
          "Interesting place, definitely worth a visit. Something interesting to see in every corner, weird art in weird places. I\u2019d love to visit Uzupis in summer, it probably isn\u2019t at its best in the beginning of December.",
          "U\u017eupis is a neighbourhood in Vilnius, largely located in Vilnius' old town a UNESCO World Heritage Site. U\u017eupis means \"beyond the river\" or \"the other side of the river\" in the Lithuanian language and refers to the Vilnia River; the name Vilnius was derived from the Vilnia. The",
          "I was a little disappointed with Uzupis. I guess I had a different picture in my mind. It is a shabby Boho area. I didn't see anything that interesting about it.",
          "They were putting up the Xmas tree when we were there. The area is a bit shabby and there was not much art work around. Maybe it has a better vibe in the summer,",
          "Love to walk here! When I cross the bridge, one of three or four- I feel the difference. This district has it\u2019s own soul. Those small shops, cafes, constitution of Uzupis (must read), Angel, art galleries.. If you like pizza- freshly made with jamon or burata- go to U\u017eupio",
          "We visited this during our free walking tour. We wouldn't have done this otherwise. It's an arty area with some unusual things to see. Worth a visit.",
          "The statue of the angel is a symbol of freedom as I understand. It was a must thing to see while visiting Vilnius. However the walk up to the monument has some nice art work; which was more interesting I felt. 3 stars for the angel and the 4th star is for the",
          "Interesting place to visit a Republic within a Country. Spunka bar opposite the Angel Statue is well worth a visit thou only small.",
          "A very special neighborhood in a beautiful area next to a tributary of Vilnelle very close to the Old Town. In the square stands out the statue with the bronze angel and the \"Constitution of Ouzup\"",

          "U\u017eupis, self-declared as a separate republic, is a quaint and Bohemian area with architectural beauty, boutique shops, restaurants and bars. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site and well worth a wander around whilst visiting Lithuania\u2019s capital.",
          "We decided to take a walk around the old town and then outside to try and see more of Vilnius. We chose to walk from the old town to U\u017eupis, before heading on to the hill of three crosses and then the KGB museum. The U\u017eupis area is captivating and definitely a great location to",
          "Well worth spending a couple of hours in this small Nigerian district just outside the old town. A nice mix of art studios, cafes, bars and sites such as the angel monument provide a relaxed, easily walkable excursion. Highlights include Spunka bar and the cafe next door plus",
          "Worth a visit to this 'independent' state within Vilnius which has become a haven for artists. A pleasant place to wander around.",
          "If you are interested on history, then you should read/ study about this place before visiting. Our main interest was photography so it's a bit different. It's a small town (or republic?) with lots of potential for architecture and street photography.",

          "Having read about Uzupis before going to Vilnius I was expecting a little more. Maybe we missed the good bit but apart from finding a lovely cafe bar by a bridge over the river it was unmemorable.",
          "A colleague show us Uzupis, a lot of artistic moments in one open place. All around you, close to the river Vilnia, in the park on the street...a special feeling like you are in another city.",
          "This is a lovely area to walk around with some nice inside and outside cafes. To see a very interesting architectural mix from c1870 to the present, walk on up the hill to visit the quieter Gedimnas Hill rather than the Hill of the 3 Crosses. After about 300m take the left fork",
          "We seartched Uzupis for the famous bronze cat, but never saw so mich as a whisker. we did finf an unusual bronze pig on wheels at the foot of the angel monument. We found a fabulous chocolate shop, the angels wings, the soldiers overcoat and some very bright wall paintings, but",
          "Uzupis is located within the Lithuanian capital and is one of the smallest republics in the world, covering less than 1 sq km. It has its own government, constitution, anthem, and currency. Meaning \u2018beyond the river\u2019 in Lithuanian, Uzupis is separated from the rest of the city",
          "I love Uzupis. It's definitely one of my favourite places in Lithuania: can't wait to be back there again. It's been my second time there and I still adore it, its story is simply fantastic and I would really love to be back on April, 1st!",
          "We went on a walking tour of Vilnius and it included Uzupis. We loved the concept of a free city with its own constitution. It essentially is founded on the idea that people should be free to be happy, but not hurt others in the process.",
          "This is an interesting place, it's a country but not official. It has its own constitution which is unique and humorous. It's right next to old town Vilnius. Make it part of you old town hiking tour.",
          "Not as artsy as I expected. Also, a lot of renovation going on and it seems like this is becoming area for highenders. It made it a nice walk, but I wouldn't say it was all that special.",
          "An independant 'country' within Vilnius with the bridge as the border crossing. We saw the little mermaid staue and the swinging seat under the bridge but you really had to go looking for something to latch onto. It is quirky around the river (pianos in it and piles of stones)",

          "This place is amazing and I couldn\u2019t recommend it more. The micro nation of uzupis is easily one of the most fascinating places I\u2019ve ever been, the art, the people and the atmosphere are just something else. Their parliament is a pub, they have ambassadors for crazy things like",
          "Uzupis was interesting, but nothing too exciting. I honestly expected it to be more busy and have more to do based on the reviews from others. Allow 20 minutes to walk around, but not much more?",
          "When we visited Christiania in Copenhagen I found it quite hostile but in contrast Uzupis was charming and bohemian. There was a lot of street art to marvel at, lots of interesting statues and monuments and one of my favourite things was the constitution, which dictates that in",
          "U\u017eupis district is a very interesting place to visit. It is situated in the Old Town part of Vilnius. This bohemian district has a lot to offer. Cafes and restaurants, shops, hair salon/barber, dental clinics, art galleries and so on. Among interesting areas to visit include",
          "This part of the city is claiming independence. It\u2019s all a bit of a joke but houses some serious points about looking after fellow man and being happy. Check it out as part of the walking tour to understand how it works. If you do yourself you will miss the point.",
          "We stumbled upon this \u201crepublic\u201d in the middle of Vilnius. It was interesting and had some pretty sites, notable the angel statue. We enjoyed a coffee and ice cream by the stream.",
          "The most beautiful district in Vilnius where you can sence arts and bohema. You can visit tiny shops and caffes, or just walk around observing the life of the artists, painters and musicians. You can also sneak through small streets into old buildings\u2019 yards to feel the ancient",
          "Definitely worth checking out Uzupis if for nothing more than it's chilledness. Walk around the streets and take in the ambience and stop by one of the cafe's to chill out and watch the world go by.",
          "Uzupis used to be a rundown area of the city, inhabited by criminals and socially undesirables. Students moving into the area changed that and for fun they established an independent republic. It's not really an independent republic, that was just part of the fun. It's best",
          "An interesting part of the city, worth a visit for a few hours. Nice atmosphere around the river too. The character of the neighborhood is a good idea but maybe it's overrated. Vilnius is full of nice places to visit, so nothing too special in Uzupis, go check it for a couple of",
          "It was fun walking down the cobbled streets and along the river where unusual pieces of art are scattered. Most of them are very unconventional. The pace is easy",
          "Uzo, aka Uzupis is a UNESCO World Heritage Site neighborhood. It means beyond the river and perhaps they really meant to name it that because there is a body of water, Vilnia River, that you cross from Old Town to get here. The district emphasizes the display of artists\u2019",
          "It is one of those places with their roots more in fantasy than reality, but this does not detract from the fact that in U\u017eupis you get nice vibes just from walking around on an ordinary day. Well worth a visit.",
          "This is just a short walk out of old town and is just fascinating. I'd recommend a free walking tour, as the history of it is explained very well. It's not much to see, on its own, but makes for a laugh and some fun, when explained by a local. It houses some great art and some",
          "U\u017eupis constitution board, strange book store, Angel statute, six hills (Bekesh hill, Hill of three crosses, Table hill, Mound hill, Hill of Gediminas grave and Altana hill) and Valley of songs.",
          "A quiet area with most shops closed in the afternoon. We visited the Constitution and the Angel. As it became a tourist attraction, the only thing we can do was sitting down with a coffee.",
          "Nice area, good czlire project, however starts to be a litte bit pricy, for its hipster reputation :-)",
          "... do not miss this funky part of Vilnius! Full of quirky corners, artistic hot spots, and the walls of art and their very own constitution! If you\u2019re visiting on April 1, even better!",
          "Interesting place along a small river, full of young people and art studios, nice but a bit far from the romantic reviews we found. Anyway, nice.",
          "the nice thing about this place is that it's really unique and different. you will see many \"different\" things during your visit and walking around. I loved the place, the art work, and specially the constitution which is funny and insightful. I recommend to have a walking tour",
          "Great experience visiting a republic within the city of Vilnius. Get your passport stamped whilst you're there.",
          "Very interesting and entertaining; they have their own constitution; monument to the wine \"keeper\", and one of the oldest textile shops. I was told they have a lot of artesians, etc., in the area, but regrettably I was visiting on St John's Day and I believe most places were",
          "It is a place like Monmartr in Paris-for relaxed folks,musicians and artists. Narrow streets with nice pubs and restaurants, Vilnele river winding around and extremely lelaxed atmosphere. Big constructions and refurbishments are going on now, but within 3 years it will become",
          "It's full of quirky art and lots of places to explore. We visited this area twice. First time was part of the free walking tour- which meant we had the background of why and how this place was created.",
          "The several hours we spent in the Uzupis Republic is a highlight of our two day visit to Vilnius. Walking the streets made us feel less like tourists and more like ordinary folks, an impression that was reinforced when we settled into the excellent Snekutis Pub for a hearty",
          "Based on the description we anticipated seeing many shops and galleries but there really weren't any. The small consolation was that the local beer at One for All restaurant was the coldest and best tasting we had our entire vacation.",
          "You just need an hour or so to walk through this area of Vilnius, just outside Old Town. Check out the artwork along the river and take a stroll through the streets. You can even bring your passport and have it \u201cstamped\u201d in the gift shop!",
          "Funky, artistic, humorous, Bohemian, cute place for a stroll along the river. Definitely worth a couple of hours, but don't go too far out of your way.",
          "A lovely little country full of artistry and humor where, on April 1, the town fountain flows with beer instead of water. Be sure to get a postcard with their passport stamp, to gaze upon the backpacker Jesus (as they say, he was the first real backpacker), and to put your",
          "Just love the whole idea of a republic. The constitution is very clever, the town hall location. They must have had great fun thinking it all through",
          "This place is just perfect for spending some time - cuisine, nice views, good atmosphere. As a local I really like to spend my time here.",
          "Uzupis is thought by some to be a Republic! It is very usual old place - well worth a visit Unfortunately, we go to see our dentist!",
          "I was rather disappointed with this area but i must admit i visited well before lunch and not much was happening here",
          "A nice area of the city to wander around, similar in ethos to the Christiana community in Copenhagen.",
          "District of artists. A lot of narrow art gallery, beer pubs, barbieries or hidden places. Really worth a visit",
          "You will love Uzupis with its own constitution and self-declared republic. Plenty of shops, bars, and cafes as well as a variety of restaurants . Find the mermaid statue. Relax and have a beer by the river. A fun place to chill.",

          "Uzupis can NOT be missed! this area has an artsy, bohemian vibe and is a lot of fun. From pianos along the riverbanks to their own constitution, Uzupis is a must see!",
          "The Republic of Uzupio (which literally means \"across the bridge\" declared independence from Lithuania on April 1, 1997. It has its own president (a former mayor of Vilnius), flag, constitution, an army of 11 men, and an official passport stamp (which you can get at the",

          "This part of Vilnius ( a self proclaimed republic) is definitely a little different and claims to be the Bohemian and Art district with its own 41 point constitution that can be read around the area in various languages. Among the points that make it different is the right to",
          "What is not to like here. Check out the constitution and the many bars and cafes. Plus the architecture. A part of Vilnius you must visit.",

          "Very quaint, best to go with a tour guide who can point things out and explain everything - or do some homework first. Worth it.",
          "Had a lovely stroll through this part of Vilnius. There were some lovely little cafes and bars along the river to have a coffee or a bite to eat. The architecture in the area was stunning and a lot of it was in its original state. A particular area to visit was the wall with all",
          "Walking in the Republic of Uzupis is a very good activity that enables you to discover a very cool and vibrant neighborhood full of artists and places to hang out. There are very cool stories behind this place and the un-seriousness it gives itself. If you can enjoy a walking",
          "If you first are in the old city, have a beer in Uzupis. Its a strange Hipster place, and its cool to have been there, and seen it. I would not spend a whole day here. A quick walk and a beer was enough.",
          "Such a cute area. Plenty of small cafes and bars along the river. My favourite was the one with the broken pianos and books nailed to trees. Definitely worth a wander one afternoon",
          "Its just a tiny area like a village with some cute shops and very good restaurants but the history is odd, yet interesting too. Very friendly people there!",
          "When I heard about this place from the staff in my hostel, i was pretty amazed. Even though this neighbourhood is part of Vilnius, it has it's own constitution written in 23 languages. I was very happy to see that out of 23 languages, Sanskrit and Hindi was also among them. If",
          "This neighborhood of Vilnius is a bohemian area with some artworks, a nice statue in the main square, and constitution plates of Uzupis Republic in one of the main streets. To walk near the river is nice.",
          "Uzupis is a small district within Vilnius that is next to the River, years ago, they declared their independency, elected their own president and created a beautiful written constitution. You don't need your passport or any border crossing checking to visit Uzupis though. Uzupis",
          "Uzupis is one suburb of Vilnius which is really atmospheric and different from the rest of the city due to its artificial nature. Too many pubs, wine bars as local restaurants to try. Don\u2019t forget to see and read the wall with the rules of Uzupis! Last but not least drink a beer",
          "This artistic, creative part of town is pleasantly surprising. The place has some interesting street art, some cozy cafes and just a lot to explore and enjoy. A walk around the neighbourhood is definitely one of the more enjoyable things to do in Vilnius.",

It was a joke but becomes a tourist attraction. It has its own constitution and \u201corganization\u201d. It\u2019s national day is April 1st. There",

          "No visit to Vilnius would be complete without a quick tour of Uzupis. With it's own constitution and interesting street art and piano in the river, it's an eclectic mix that is a magnet for all artistic visitors. We were lucky enough to happen upon an open air pottery firing in",
          "lovely and very original place to visit it feels like more should be said by me but i think the best way is for the masses just to visit and see the beauty",
          "Fascinating place when you consider the history and WHY this republic was formed. I sat with a beer in the place the \u2018artists\u2019 formed the constitution. I also got a Uzupis euro note so I could buy a beer each April 1st. Lovely sentiments here. A must do......",
          "Great place to see and realize how unique is Vilnius. Graphic land scape charismatic people with character surrounded by the river. Just walk through , in and out. And don't forget to smile!",
          "Went here a couple of times saw lots around this area, went in a fantastic bar restaurant too food was lovely and a nice surprise once inside. Well worth the walk as you would miss so much if you don't walk",
          "Although this place claims to be an independent state, it's just a trendy district with a plaque showing its constitution written in different languages, some of which is quite funny. It's nice enough to have a walk around in, but if you're expecting a radically different",

          "My trip to Vilnius was short, but Uzipis was a place i definitely wanted to visit. I went on a walking tour and it took us through Uzipis where our guide explained some of the history. I recommend coming here on the tour and perhaps returning for lunch or an afternoon walk.",

          "Uzupis is a part of Vilnius city where usually artist live, so paintings on the walls, some statues by and over the river can be discovered. You should definitely visit this place, because it shows different face of Vilnius. A lot of time ago it was a part where lithuanian jews",
          "Totally worth a visit. It's something you wouldn't expect but really makes the difference in your Vilnius visit. There are also many cafes and restaurants nearby. The constituon is super fun too!",
          "Uzupio is just a neighborhood of Vilnius but has some fun with it. A \"constitution\" that made me laugh, some art that struck me as whimsical (like the mermaid), and some funny stories about how they started it. I actually went twice in the two days I had in Vilnius. My",

          "I was expecting a very different feel to the rest of the city here, but didn't really experience it. Other than an alleyway with art posted either side, it didn't seem much different to the rest of the city. Perhaps we somehow missed the truly arty bits, though.",
          "We visited in November and it was very quiet with not much going on, so we were a bit disappointed but then again it was the time of year I think. I would like to return in Summer when I am sure there will be more happening.",
          "Bars and restaurants and art galleries and weird things, oh my! Loved the people, the food and the atmosphere.",
          "Attended the city tour and gotta say it was the best decision. Probably would have never get to know about the existence of Uzupis and the cool story behind it. Loved the wall with manifests in almost every language. Definitely a place to see!",

          "A novel concept, this place has a distinct community vibe (the kids play area is decorated with bunting). Great street art, plenty of galleries, good restaurants, cafes and bars. Be sure to keep your eyes open, go down every alley, look up and back, and don\u2019t rush!",
          "Locals told us in old times it was not really plasent plase. It was getto where a lot of alkoholiks and tramps lived. But now it's kind a touristic plase. It's like republic with it's own constitution - area with the gallery's and local business. Nice one but expensive.",
          "Very nice place to visit, on a short trip from vilnius of a 20min walk, great street art & lots of coffee shops & resteraunts",
          "Not what we expected from the hype of the brochures. Very limited arty places. Only 1 pottery workshop found with a very limited display of artefacts for sale.",

          "Uzupis is a must-see when you come to Vilnius, pay attention to all the small details and the creative spirit there.",
          "Interesting and amusing, well worth a stroll around the streets and cafes. Call in and get your passport stamped with the official republic visa. Read the constitution and observe arts on the walls. Would recommend a free walking tour to obtain more information on the area",
          "somewhat oversold even though you will find the freedom declaration in many languages including mine - Danish.",
          "This \"Autonomous Republic\" is a must see when in Vilnius. One would fall in love with its bohemian aura and atmosphere.",
          "I was lucky to have a friend from Vilnius to show me this place. It's a unique artists' village sort of, where you can enjoy their performance (when I was there, they had a music and poetry performance), as well as the modern art installation. It's a must see!",
          "Not far from Vilnius, literally minutes away...walked there with the walking tour! Lots of interesting bits to see!",
          "A nice place with many restaurants and a good atmosphere, very sentral if on is fond of visiting churches. A back alley with legalize grafitti.",
          "Quirky place that definitely a visit when in Vilnius. Read the the \"federation\" quirky laws for good entertainment and of course, do look out also for the famous cat - Polonius in the vicinity . Do get a stamp in your passport at the information centre. Or if you choose not to",
          "Wonderful place to visit. Firstly go on a free tour to learn about the Republic of Uzupis, it really is a great story. You can then wander around, in and out of the artists studios and get to read their constitution in your own language. Great story that should put a smile on",
          "This is a must-visit even if you are not interested in art. The place is amazing. Sculptures, murals, street exhibitions, the Constitution on the wall, and even an ability to get an Uzupis custom stamp in your passport - there are many experiences for everyone. They also have a",
          "Loved it. Literally, every place here is a gem in itself. Right from the bridge it covers you with this artistic vibe. Uzupis, may we meet again!",
          "Very cozy area but I must admit I didn\u00b4t take enough time to explore it. Explore numerous art-galleries, small courtyards and street art. Me and my family were here during a saturday afternoon and many places we wanted to see or visit were closed. I think you\u00b4re more lucky if",
          "Very authentic. Different philology of living. Good restaurants. You should go there. GO THERE and enjoy the nice places all around.",
          "A very lovely place in Vilnius, they call it \"a republic in a republic\". I really enjoyed the wall with the constitution written in many languages and the magical place near the river with a lot of pianos.",

          "This is a separate \u201crepublic\u201d and a lot is made of it. I thought the \u201cbohemian\u201d bit was a tad overplayed and it was not really that special. I did get my passport stamped, however. Down at the riverside are a few cafes and bars and I did have a quiet beer there! It is worth a",
          "This is a completely separate part of Vilnius described as a republic! Lots of artists and bohemian types of people inhabit this area - certainly different if you decide to have a walk around!",
          "You can't even imagine how this district will suprise you and how many amazing photos you will take. Don't forget to check Uzupio Constitution and follow its rules after coming back home.",

          "Read in many places that this was a neat quirky little town but in all earnest it was no where near as quirky as we thought it would be! There is a section that has a few things to see, mostly beaten up pianos but certainly it\u2019s not worth going out of your way to see or find it!",
          "Cute story and lots to see. Very artistic part of town where several art installations are and I believe a great event on April 1 when it was created \ud83d\ude04",
          "We actually stayed at an air bnb within Uzupis. A quirky little area with its own fascinating history. The wall of declarations is a must see as is the shop where you can stamp your passport. A nice selection of restaurants as well are worth a visit.",
          "When my work colleagues heard that I was planning to make a visit to Vilnius one of them told me all about his own visit from the time he spent living in Finland. He informed me that he had stayed in a run down area across the river which had at its heart a large statue of an",
          "To have such a concept in an ex Soviet bloc country is great. The whole locality is so different from rest of the city. Its an arts enclave. From the top of the hill, about 700 m from the Angel statue, and past a few steps, you get an awesome view of the city. Our taxi driver",
          "The Republic of Uzupsis is, on the face of it, a cute idea. We visited, on a cold August.The angel statue, sits in the centre of a nicely proportioned square. An artistic and nice neighbourhood. Visit hippie Jesus with backpack, the Constitution and be inspired by its message of",
          "Do not go looking for Christiania, as it is not here. It is a small relaxed area just across the bridge. The most Bohemian thing we saw was a man having a bath in the river and washing his hair and clothes in the river. Worth a stroll. The constitution does have its strong",
          "I found this by accident after getting lost in the park behind it. Lots of art and places to eat and drink. Feels very much \u201coutside the centre\u201d but is only about a 10 mins walk from Old Town.",
          "The Republic of Uzupsis is, on the face of it, a cute idea. Perhaps visting on April 1, when apparently they have festivals going on, and will stamp your passport might be more of an experience. When we visited, on a hot August Thursday, looking for something to eat, the places",
          "Great how artists reclaimed a once run down part of town and turned it into one of the most tranquil and nice neighbourhoods in about 20 years. Get your Uzupis visa! Visit hippie Jesus with backpack, the Barliament, the Constitution and be inspired by its message of humanity.",
          "We've found this place quite unexpectedly and couldn't understand what is that, but then we saw strange pictures and figures and even a set of laws of Uzupis. Nice place for visiting not only for artists or writers, but for everyone.",
          "If you have the opportunity to stay in this area- do that!! Otherwise, a visit is a must. Coolest area of Vilnius with a lot of art, caf\u00e9s and beautiful buildings by a river!",
          "Nothing special or really interesting. No shops or big markets for tourists and only ohne really good restaurant in the heart of U\u017eupis.",
          "Well, Uzupis is one of the fastest changing districts in Vilnius. I\u2019ve seen through its metamorphosis from a drunkard and vagabond-infested area into the truly bohemian Uzupis republic and now it is fast turning into a posh dwelling area with very high housing prices. It has",

          "A small neighborhood near the Old Town, it's a great place to spend an afternoon, sipping coffee and enjoying the sound of the stream nearby. On April 1, 1997 the area declared it's independence as the Republic of Uzupis (okay, think a minute). Although not recognized by",
          "A very cool artsy area in a beautiful riverside setting. Definitely worth at least a couple of hours. Be sure to pick up a copy of the Uzupis Constitution. I am going to frame it and adopt it for my home.",
          "After seeing Christiania in Danmark I am sure that Uzupis is a poor reproduction and the creator was highly influenced by Christiania. Some of the sentences in the constitution are ridiculous. According to me this part of Vilnus was the most boring, even though we took a quided",

          "Just wander around the charming streets and enjoy the free spirited \" independence\" of this self proclaimed independent slice of Vilnius. Chuckle at the constitution displayed in various languages.",
          "Worth to see. Cumulated in a small area many strange things(piano, horse, washing mashine and more) good opportunity to make a nice photo.",
          "It was an okay experience but I\u2019m not really impressed. It\u2019s funny that it is a republic and sort of recognized by the politicians.",
          "Vilnuis in particular and Lithuania in general to my mind are to pre-occupied of \"doing the right things\", but in this area of the town it is a completely different picture as people there show a bit of irony",
          "Uzupis is a declared independent republic within Vilnius. No doubt those involved take it seriously. Whatever your stance though, this is a 'hippy' enclave which we found interesting to wander around",
          "I really enjoyed snapping photos here and walking around. Uzupis has its own constitution, which I bought a copy of because I liked it so much. I also had lunch there before heading to the artillery bastion.",
          "Nothing Special there. Some Shops but thats it. i would Not recommend going there. You wont miss something",

          "A very arty place, lots of art shops. Walls have various writing and pics on, political, drug legalisation, conservation, etc. It was interesting to visit and the locals are very friendly. Worth a visit",

          "This is a funky, artistic neighborhood within the city of Vilnius that has declared its independence. They have their own currency which you can purchase, but not use, and a passport stamp. It is really only one or two streets long with a few side streets with some shops and",
          "Surprised that the area seemed like just another suburb of the city, having visited other \"independent nations/cities\" within a city limit. Stopped at several shops/restaurants each with their own character, but could have been in a number of cities worldwide.",
          "A quaint place in Vilnius. Just make sure to follow the laws. The place is probably much better in the summer than November. But worth a visit.",
          "Went to Uzupis twice - once alone and once with a free walking tour of the old town. It's a super interesting artistic place. Definitely remember to check out the constitution they have on the walls :)",
          "A short walk from Old Town, the quirky, artistic neighborhood of Uzupis is worth visiting, even if you're not there on April 1st when really comes alive as its own \"republic\" for a day. There are nice cafes and shops and galleries ... and a somewhat tongue-in-cheek",
          "The Republic of Uzupis comes alive on 1 April, strangely enough only for 1 day. You need a passport to gain entry on that day and they have a President and a constitution with some rather odd conditions. From memory 1 I think was about the cat not having to obey its master.",
          "A short stroll east of the old town and across the river you will find Uzupis. Some nice well kept buildings and square plus a few decent restaurants. Here you will also find the profound details of their sensible constitution in multiple languages which is a good reminder to",

          "Artistic quirky area - bordered by a river on 3 sides - with lots of art on display from wonderful statues to grafitti. Lots of bars and restaurants - nice area to wander around.",
          "Go there and fall in love. Many have before you and the vibe is unmistakable. Also good places to eat, drink and hang out.",
          "This is a great part of the city to relax and unwind. There are some great bars and resteraunts situated there. It is only a short walk to get there from the hustle and bustle of the Old Town",

          "Uzupis used to be an artists neighborhood, and a place where prostitutes lived. There was murals on many buildings and freedom was ever present. That was a long time ago. Uzupis of today is a wholly gentrified neighborhood where upper class Lithuanians and foreigners live. I",
          "Just over a lovely bridge on a peaceful river a very art based area. Such a lovely peaceful area were there is lots of art sculptures around the riverbanks and also in the river. It is a must see when in Vilnius.",
          "Have a wander around the art district and see the abandoned pianos . Apparently this area is always changing . Have a look at the swing hanging from the bridge , have a go if you are bold enough",
          "The aims of this community are all good. It's a nice place to visit and see the various art pieces. Water tap in middle of square provded useful refill. There a a few restaurants and bars which looked busy for those wanting to stop",
          "Lots of different things to see here, cafes, arts, random things.. worth a walk around and exploring to see what you can find of interest",
          "Nice place to walk. Some interesting houses, street art, relaxed people. I liked the swing under the bridge.",
          "What to say about the Town of Uzupis \u2013 one has to visit the place to understand the place. The place has more cats than people. I just loved the place and its vibe, a visit-again place.",
          "We have been there last year and went there by free tour guide. She explain us lots of thing about Uzupis. Uzupis is a country since 10 year they have own rules and their rules were mentioned on the wall entrance of the country. You may find lots of good coffes inside this cute",
          "I only had about 20 min to walk through the area. Crazy place to take tonnes of photographs. Everything you see is a piece of art or someone's artistic expression. I wish I had some more time to explore.",
          "I admit it I went for the passport stamp ! And yes I got one Great photo opportunities on both sides of the bridge There are some nice bars, restaurants and cafes all in a very short walk. It is up hill be warned. We got some great souvenirs including mock up currency",
          "Uzupis is told to be an independened state. If you are searching, you will find the consitution at a wall - in your own language! And the currency - 1 UZ is always excact the value of half a liter beer! A lot of people are comparing MontMatre with Uzipio. Not bad! The angel is",
          "Enjoyed the story walk thru this artsy Little town in a city. Must read their constitution. Creative and amusing!",
          "I visited this place just briefly, having a really nice sit down with pizza, beer and ice cream at a restaurant and enjoyed people watching.",
          "I had never heard of this bohemian state. It has its own constitution, money, president, cabinet and navy (really?). The area is a collection of unique galleries and shops. I was enjoyable to stroll the galleries. Also, you can get your passport stamped here to prove you",
          "A really quirky part of town. Spend time by the river and make sure you remember your passport so you can get it stamped.",
          "It\u2019s not often I get to drink in the corridors of power whilst watching people on a swing under a bridge. Welcome to Uzupis. Don\u2019t forget to smile when you enter.",
          "If you're in Vilnius you have to visit Uzupis! It's unexpected in every way. The artistry, funky stores, coffee shops and art galleries are not to be missed. Sit on the swing under the bridge near the mermaid, play a piano in the river, and of course, have your passport stamped!",
          "Funny, different, sometimes a bit strange but very likable - that\u2019s U\u017eupis, Vilnius\u2019 art district. There you can see a statue of the world\u2019s oldest backpacker (Jesus), a UFO hovering above the small river and many, many pianos standing around among various other (seemingly)",
          "Forgot how cool this little arts community is when it\u2019s 20 set of rules and laws that love dogs and cats and freedom and buy some cool artwork here like all cool places around the world it\u2019s been gentrified and a lot of hipsters are moving in",
          "Entering a new republic over a bridge so exciting! Discover art, history, places to eat and get your passport stamped too!",
          "Liked the series of constitutions on the wall plaques. Seemed to include all countries from around Europe.",
          "It\u2019s an artist area. Funky little bars & restaurants. It\u2019s right on the River which has walking paths Along it. They even have their own Constitution \ud83d\ude00. The area is being discovered & old buildings are being Renovated & new ones being built",
          "We stayed at a hostel within walking distance of here and went here everyday. Beautiful bridges with locks of love and waterways. Read the constitution, really make you smile.",
          "Very little here really fits the description of \u201calternative\u201d, and the comparison with Christiania in Copenhagen seems far-fetched. Just a picturesque part of the old town.",
          "What a quirky interesting place. Be sure to check out the constitution. Found a local bar that resembled an allotment shed from the outside that had the largest list of real ale/beers and the most delicious local food.",
          "We had a nice walking through the neighborhood of Uzupis. A lot of galleries, shop boutiques, cafes and funny stuff. Atmosphere is quite relaxing here.",
          "Uzupis means other side of the river and is a self-governed, independent \"bohemian\" area of Vilnius which we stumbled upon it quite by accident whilst exploring the old town. Its very unusual and a nice area to wander round and sit and have a beer or spot of lunch.",

          "06 July, 2018. While walking through the Old Town of Vilnius, I came across the funky artists' colony of Uzupis, approached on one side via the bridge, which shone with the locks attached to the sides. The entrance part has a mermaid on the walls. The entire place has an arty",
          "Great place to visit, really nice atmosphere of fun and creativity. Particularly like the constitution and the pianos around the town.",
          "Loads of cool artwork and a fun history. Particularly liked the piano in the stream. Would highly recommend a visit if you are in Vilnius!",
          "We had a fantastic day wandering the streets. Once you cross the river into Uzupis you feel the calm seep in. Everything is relaxed and friendly and there are lovely boutique places to eat and drink alongside an artisan community. There\u2019s also an art trail including a graveyard",
          "Amazing little place in Vilnius.. small streets .. amazing art around the banks of the river surrounding the area... awesome stories of how it was formed and who governs it... their constitution is awesome and plastered on a wall in over 20 languages which is fantastic so",
          "What a fun place to go! We visited here as part of the \u201cVilnius Free Tour.\u201d Loved the founding principles of this place. Make sure to visit the wall with the constitution. And also the various art galleries. Don\u2019t miss it!",
          "We visited the 1st of April, which is this recesists' republic's anniversary. There was a ceremony of rolling Easter eggs and a concert, but it started after 6 pm, up to this time, almost everything was closed. In a cold and rainy day a bit depresive. However, this small part of",
          "We went to Uzupis as part of our walking tour and it was pretty cool. Great for taking a few photos and having a wander round. Doesn\u2019t have an edgy or dangerous feel like some of the arty centres in Europe as it\u2019s already become a popular area, but definitely worth a visit while",
          "A great place to visit, with a unique history all of its own. From the quirky constitution to the various forms of artistic impression. It's got a great feel and is only a short walk from the Old Town.",
          "We were just exploring when by happenstance we came by the Republic of Uzupis, how lucky were we. It is like a commune with weird artworks, a piano in the river, a zebra, it has its own constitution. Fascinating, quirky, went on a tour with a guide which was free, even have",
          "Seriously fun and imaginative place! Really enjoyed the creative energy and the history of the place.",
          "That was my first time here, and I liked this plase very much! So many galleries in one place, so many exhibitions and installations in one place. Everybody who likes art has to visit Uzupis.",

          "You should try to look in all the nooks and crannies of this area, as there is a lot to see that you may not notice at first. Many cafes and restaurants too (best cappuccino caf\u00e9 1) post office, street art. Worth spending a few hours!",
          "Walked into Uzupis from Vilnius across a small bridge with lots of padlocks on. Saw wall with Uzupis Constitution on in many languages. Overall view of the place is that is tired and needs work. Found lovely cafe and very nice restaurant. We went to cemetery and gerdamius",

          "Old, artsy & quirky neighbourhood. Locals say it used to be more special back in the days, but still worth a visit if you like grafitti, art & beer!",
          "Visiting Uzupis is a must do, either as part of the excellent Free Walking Tour or as short visit by yourself. Cross the bridge and enter this random republic which in many ways reminded me of the fun and values of the UK Monster Raving Looney Party. The swing under the",

          "Even for a seasonal traveller like me, sometimes you find things so unusual that almost defy logic. The Uzupis is a self-proclaimed republic by a group of artists and bohemians delimited by the river, within the city of Vilnius. There is a manifest and an identity within the",

          "As a shopping street it is average, matching th size of the city. But it leads to the Cathedral, Palace of the Great Dukes and the National Museum - not to be missed.",
          "Had no real expectations and had just heard a little about the place and compared it in my head to Christiania in Copenhagen. Not at all that interesting and lively. Maybe because of winter. Some nice artworks and fun stuff but nothing you can\u2019t miss.",

          "We really enjoyed walking through U\u017eupis and looking at all the art and graffiti. Really interesting place and worth a visit. When we visited Vilnius we found this place had the best pubs, coffee and restaurants!",
          "From the tour guide we heard about the history of the place, so went on a separate visit. Maybe the problem was that it was after the sunset, but there was nothing much to see or experience with regards to old times. Yes, maybe it was like Christiania in Kopenhagen, but that was",
          "I heard a lot about this place before the trip to Vilnius. I decided to go there one morning. The place was not big. It was quiet, well, I was there quite early in the morning on a weekend. I did have a chance to \"escape\" from the Vilnius old town crowds. It has some beautiful",

          "Great place to walk around an area that has been transformed from a 'no go' area into a Bohemian art venue. Lots of little passages to explore. Pay a visit to the remains of the Jewish cemetery but don't expect the signs to get you there. One sign on the Main Street points",

          "No galleries open on Monday not much to see other than the sign on the bridge, the constitution wall and the occasional flag with the Republics unique open hand symbol. Nevertheless a short 15 minute walk to say you have been to this quirky \"independent\" state is probably just",
          "This area declared itself as independent from the rest of Vilnius on April 1st 2000, during a meeting at a local pub later to become the official Barliment of Uzupis. It is a short walk over the bridge from the old town",
          "This is a clever way to get tourists to visit this part of Old Town Vilnius. Make sure to see the Constitution of the Uzupis Republic posted in many, many languages. Also get a photo of the Republic's cute flag. There are numerous coffee shops and restaurants in the Republic.",
          "You should know back ground history about Uzupis then it will be more interesting to visit there. There are many art works. Around there you can get visa stamps at restaurants and shops if you like. This is kind of joke though.",
          "Special zone within Vilnius definitely worth the visit. Learned about it after going with a free walking tour and I went again myself another day.",
          "A quirky attraction in an otherwise historical old city. The constitution is written in many languages on the wall. Some cool shops and galleries here, as well as some nice architecture.",
          "Worth a stroll though this quirky artists enclave with a very interesting past. Questionable how serious this independent community really is at making a political statement, none the less it is fun to see the art work, the constitution and the shops and restaurants.",
          "I stumbled across this fabulous 'Independent Republic' by chance while wandering the streets looking for nothing inparticular. One of the first things to be seen is the Constittion Wall where you can read the Uzhupis Constitution in every language under the sun. The area has a",
          "This part of the city is more of an idea than a physical manifestation of something. By declaring the \u201crepublic\u201d, the constituents are just having fun and helping you decide what is important in life. The quirky constitution is written in many languages and is an entertaining",
          "When my friend and I found out about that in within the city of Vilnius there was another republic we thought about San Marino (yes, we are Italians) only to find out that Uzupis is nothing like it! It is the friendliest tiny place we visited. You can find their very own",
          "Visited as part of the old town free tour - for Australians (and perhaps others) was really reminded of Nimbin :) Worth a look",
          "There is a least one good restaurant here in this kind of hippie district with some funky art. If you come then come to poke around and peek through. Wander/flaneur. There is some very nice graffiti down by the river, and in some ruins off one of the side streets. Worth a",
          "No idea why anyone would visit this part of Vilnius. Nothing to see that you can't see in the rest of the city. Glad we didn't have to walk miles to see it. Pretty river surrounded by trees with padlock bridges...thats it",
          "It may be that it was not at its most typical best on a Sunday morning with a marathon being run in town but with a write-up along the lines of 'the Montmartre of Vilnius ' it was a sad let down. OK there are art galleries, closed at the time, but no other sign of anything",
          "Uzupis is a self-styled \"independent republic\" adjacent to the old town. It has a wall with its \"constitution\" in numerous languages and has some artists residing there",
          "You enter though a bridge with hundres of pad locks proving love. If you are interested in art there are sculptures and paintings on the other side of the bridge. The bronze scupture of the maremaid is very nice. Smaller than the one in Copenhagen but anyhow. Look for the",
          "town in the town - this is what I would say since I live away and seen many cities and countries around the globe.. This place has its own charm, places and even people :) come and see!",
          "Very strange area seems to be a throwback to hippy era of the sixties. Small and compact and can be viewed in an afternoon",
          "It's not a waste of time as there are some nice pubs and there are are some interesting shops with different items from the normal souvenir stuff. Glad I went.",
          "The unofficial Republic of Uzupis in Vilnius is such a fun area. It reminds me a little bit of Greenwich Village in NYC with it's whimsical spirit and artsy feel. It's easy going and the restaurants and bars and delicious. A river runs along the edge of the area and that is",
          "This independent Republic raises a whole political debate, social philosophy etc. The constitution is written in many languages on the wall for all to read. Simple basic rights that you take granted, however the recent history of Lithuania shows we should not. Great visit.",
          "Self proclaimed republic would mean a full democracy and I loved the signs entering the territory of U\u017eupio Republic and leaving it, but that is about all you can see. Quite neglected area, with its constitution in many languages on the wall and pro-marijuana slogans are not",
          "Part of the town over the river Vilnies. Close to the city centre (10 min walk). Lot of bars, small shops and artistic instalations. Hard to find a parking place. If here do not miss to visit the Three crosses monument - nice view on Vilnius.",
          "Highly recommended to visit. There are some things to see. Reasonable prices in restaurants, quiet streets, but a lot of cars.",
          "The Republic of Uzupis is just over the river in the Old Town. We found a great little cafe for coffee and crepes. Most of the art galleries were still closed as it was mid- morning, but looked interesting. There were quirky little cafes and shops.",
          "We walked over after reading in the travel guide. There are a number of places to eat or take coffee along with a number of nice shops. The story is quite humorous.",
          "lot of graffitis, weird stuff, hipster bars and cool architecture the focus of this place is the river and vast collection of lockers with bridge.",
          "The Uzupis Res publika is a lovely place with a great atmosphere in the area. It atracts crazy, always creative people, artists and the others alike. There are small cosy caffes to be foun, swing uder the bridge, funny people on the street, happy people on the street. Worth",
          "Very cool and artistic place with lots of interesting art work, shops and cafes. A must see when you're in Vilnius!",
          "A must-see quirky neighborhood in Vilnius, well strictly speaking it is a separate republic (if you recognise their declaration of independence). Nice setting on the river, some good cafes and art shops. If you found my review helpful, I'd appreciate your vote.",
          "The area needs a few more cafes, restaurants and funky shops (through the Hemp Shop near the Angel Statue is an auspicious start) to make it truly Hipster, but Uzupis is still great fun, and a Must Visit when in Vilnius. Comprising only a few streets, it is easily toured. Good",
          "Nice place to visit, great concept. I loved the Constitution Wall, the mermaid, the swing over the river and some of the art. After Christiania and Reeferbahm, this seems like a slightly more upscale \"Free zone\". I did enjoy sitting by the river with a beer and a Zeppelin!",
          "Uzupis is where the artists lived that made Lithuania famous: for its bronze statues now in Guggenheim and its jewelry and ceramics. You will find it still charming though increasingly for the tourists and well-to-do Lithuanians. It was more authentic 20 years ago when the",

          "Well, Uzupis will definitely find its amateurs - especially on a lovely day, when one is tired and would love just to sit and drink a coffee. But comparing it to Montmartre is a bit discrediting, given there is a lack of critical mass of arts in this \"republic of artists\" and",
          "The staff was helpful, our double room was pretty and so was the hostel on its own. Only problem was the showers in the morning - no hot water, so if you want to shower get up early before the campers do.",
          "A bit of a tourist trap nowadays. Funny. One to visit yourself and have your own opinion on what it really is today.",
          "There are many whimsical sculptures and artworks to discover in this \"republic\". Amusing and light hearted.",
          "Place, should be seen, (more for curiosity) you suppose to find a place like Montmatre, Soho or Christiania in Copenaghen. Place for photographer. Buildings ruined but with graffiti. Who first \"founded\" it was sure not for having tourists around. Funny they have their own",
          "So I have heard of U\u017eupis many of times. When I got the chance to go to Vilnius I made sure this was on the itinerary. It's basically a hipster city. Although it's a neighborhood of Vilnius, it declared itself it's own republic, has its own flag, it's own constitution (which",

          "I really enjoy Uzupio. As a tourist you need to visit and have a look around. As a local still a great place for a walk, lunch/dinner, coffee or a beer.",
          "Uzupis is a self declared independent republic, it's quite a quaint little part of Vilnius and is well worth visiting for a few hours. There are a few monuments and buildings to explore. The only downside was the lack of a souvenir shop to pick up something to remember our trip",
          "Went here in a walking tour so it was good to hear the history however I thought it was rather silly. Considering it's a neighbourhood for artists, I saw very few artist shops but there was some art pieces by the river. There was also few cafes, restaurants and shops. The",
          "When I learned that Vilnius had a Freetown, I expected something like Copenhagen's Christiania. Uzupis is much more commercial and doesn't really have a Freetown feeling to it.",
          "A statue is in the center of UZ as well as a constitution in numerous languages to tell you of the free spirits found in this area. Plenty of restaurants and easy to walk to downtown.",

          "Ideally one must visit this place on 1st April (their 'independence day') but even if not on that day it sure is a must visit! As story goes they have their own constitution president ministers even currency on April 1 which is used to exchange for beers! Apart from their little",
          "I generally like places of alternative culture, so I was interested in seeing Uzupis. The history of the place is quite interesting, you can walk around a bit and it feels a bit alternative. However it is very small, and there is nothing much happening. Mostly empty streets,",
          "This area has an interesting story to it, but I couldn't make out what I was meant to see. There was a gallery that was closed (the people outside didn't know why), a nice statue, some odd street art and a Tibetan souvenir store. Maybe it's lost its uniqueness.",
          "The artists area of Vilnius. Worth a visit to see the constitution. You may even meet the president of this republic in the parliament building which is really a cafe",
          "Our expectations were high by the descriptions. However, when we walked around we were disappointed by the lack of atmosphere.",
          "An interesting walk through a small suburb. Many tourists came to photograph-not read- Uzupis 'constitution.'",
          "a fine tour of unusual things, art and etos! and herr katt the barber! you have to see the constitution wall and all the translations.",
          "Uzupis used to be a small \"Uzupis Republic\" several decades ago, and it was a Utopia. It is really small but you can see the sign of the country, different sculptures, constitutions, and all kinds of small surprise. I would recommend to stay here for half an hour since it is",
          "The cafe restaurant by the first bridge crossing over is not on TripAdvisor, nor the Hemp shop up the street from the angel. Highly recommended. See the street with art round the corner from the cafe going to the Incubator Studios by the river. This is a REPUBLIC. Complete with",
          "The small self-proclaimed Republic of U\u017eupis is one of the oldest neighborhood in Vilnius, separated from the Old Town by the Vilnia River, that has been popular for some time, due to its quirk atmosphere. Until 1990, it was one of the most neglected areas in the city. In 2002,",
          "There's literally nothing that would make this area exceptional in any way. Don't waste your time and spend it in the old town.",
          "This area was recommended by my travel book and also the in-flight magazine on the flight here. I wasn't sure what to expect but was looking forward to see this area. I reached the bridge with all the locks (and the mermaid statue underneath) there was a swing on it and a cool",
          "This is a definitely place with a difference as it does not resemble the Vilnus baroque Old Town, or busy Neo-classical Giedyminas Ave. This before the IIWW district of middle class, then in communist time turned into ruins and underclass home now is being intensively restored.",
          "A small free-republic well humored close to the vilnia river, A place for literature and music to wander and have a beer in a sunny day.",
          "If you like Trastevere in Rome you'd probably like U\u017eupis. Meaning is the same - another side of the river. Very close to the official \"Old Town\" but has different spirit. Area is getting trendly and slowly but surely losing its authentity. Hurry up!",
          "Supposed to be full of artist places but was not impressed. Had a nice lunch at one of the cafes and enjoyed reading the constitution wall.",
          "The people tongue 'n cheek have seceded from Lithuania and formed their own country. Their list of laws is a riot and it's fun to wander around and check out the area. It's full of artists and quaint shops.",
          "This neighbourhood, a supposed bohemian or artist's quarter, has historic buildings, many of them in a comparatively run-down state. There are also some attractive timber houses with gardens full of flowers up at the Bernadine cemetery end. Overall, there are only a few lively",
          "I've been to a few free states and Uzupis is the best I've seen. Very fun and a safe place to walk around in the evening on your own. Everyone is friendly and more than happy to help you. There is alot of street art installations.",
          "Such a hip and chic place, full of bars an galleries. I recommend to read a little bit about this \"republic\", very interesting. :)",
          "...which is just as well since it is one of the rules of the \"republic\". I visited on one of the free city tours which began on the steps of the Town Hall. Uzupis was a highlight of the tour, though Vilnius Old Town was itself intriguing. The free walks always reveal hidden gems",
          "I was quite excited to visit, I loved the idea, it took me a while to find but I see other things as I walk around. in my mind I had hoped to find local artists with original works to enjoy perusing and hopefully buy some pieces. Maybe it was because I was there in April, but",
          "If you have the time then walk over to read the constitution. There are a few cafes etc but otherwise nothing much going on.",
          "Do not miss this crazy quarter, own constitution, a dog is a dog a cat a cat who is not obliged to like people...huh. Stroll around and read the republic's history. Amazing.",
          "Not to be taken seriously. Some nice artwork. Swinging seat on the bridge over the river. Be sure to take a look at the Uzupis constitution written in about 25 different languages on separate plaques on the wall.",
          "We stumbled into this village but walked through quickly the first day. We returned the following day to enjoy the public artwork. Found a vintage store that had some items we were looking for. Very organic community. Could gave spend more time along the river enjoying a snack",
          "Uzupis was a great little place. I went with my partner, a few little bars. Went in to one and asked for Lithuanian beer and he gave me a taster of the 6 beers on tap so I could choose.",
          "Small region with own constitution and rules, own architecture. The streets are narrow, some cafes are there.",
          "Uzupis Republic is a very peculiar place in Vilnius that is totally worth checking out either by the place itself, or just to enjoy a drink by the river.",
          "It was my second time in Vilnius. The first time I did a regular tour! And didn't visit this place! Don't miss! A lot of funny histories!",
          "Close to Vilnius Old Town you'll find Uzupis neighbourhood. Now on its way to be gentrified it's highlight is its art. Artists have provided some interesting pieces especially along the riverbank north Uzupio tiltas (main bridge). These sculptures and artefacts are more",
          "It is a country within a city, with its own laws, parlament (or barlament), jistory, flag, constitution, vibe and energy...",

          "We wandered around here on the Bank Holiday Monday morning and nothing seemed to be going on, just one shop and a caf\u00e9 open that we could see. No sense of the lively bohemian quarter we were expecting.",
          "It was so relaxing walking in the streets of Uzupis. And that Constitution, you should see it. Sometimes there is concerts near the river.",
          "Not much to see here during daytime, except for the angel statue and infantile Uzupis Constitution. Many buildings are extremely run-down.",
          "Its worth a visit to wander in the streets of Uzuopis. Some of the building are really weared down, but other are beautifully restored. When we visited there was very few tourists. Remember to check the small bridges, one of them have a \"hidden\" mermaid.",
          "Uzupis is probably the Lithuanian equivalent to Christiana in Copenhagen (without the drugs!!) in that it is a self proclaimed autonomous republic, although more for bohemians and free thinkers. Uzupis is much cleaner, upmarket and makes for a pleasant wander around. The",
          "It's just fun to roam around this place while in Vilnius. Nothing so special but worth to visit. It's different than the rest area in the city.",
          "Not impressed at all ... those that compare this to Christiana in Copenhagen surly never has been there...",
          "If you are looking for something like Christiantown near Copenhagen, then skip Uzupis. I rarely leave 3 star reviews but this area was definitely underwhelming. There was no interesting artwork that I could see. The cute little cafe was worth a stop.",
          "People who live in Uzupis are lucky indeed. Located next to the Old Town in Vilnius, separated by little bridges, Uzupis is its own Republic. Its Republic Day is on April 1st each year with outdoor concerts and celebrations going long into the night. Uzupis is full of cobble",
          "Great central area for walks, chic shabby architecture, authentic craft shops, and cozy cafes! Tiny but nice :)",
          "A small walk from Cathedral square. Nice place for a stroll and a meal especially in the summertime.",
          "The artist's area is indeed odd and filled with great restaurants., bars and statues; but we would have missed most if it's meaning if we had not been on a walking tour. There is a VERY cool version of the chain pub Snekutis which here is a beer shack that is worth stopping in",
          "Walking over the bridge from St Anne's church to the republic was like crossing into another world. Narrow street lead you to The mirrored constitutions written in almost every conceivable language. I found a tiny little bookstore with a resident ginger cat. Lots of good finds",
          "Visiting this wonderful place was the highlight our free walking tour. With her happy nature our guide Vytaute was the perfect ambassador to show us around the republc. On entering we all met the first rule of smiling, for the duration of our visit, we loved reading the",
          "Well, we walked round and round this place and we're still none the wiser! Felt like a ghost town, nothing to see here!",
          "The idea behind it is nice and interesting. Its history too. But it's been partly gentrified (lots of cars), many galleries were closed, many buildings needed urgent repair. Probably during a summer weekend it's much more interesting.",
          "Short visiting of ART REPUBLIC OF U\u017dUPIS was very nice. We came there with one aime: to find an address of relatives of my schoolmate Ludmila. Unfortunately, this family left U\u017eupis. So we walked around some small streets there, got our dinner in perfect cafe and decided to",
          "We visited Uzupis and really loved it. It's anarea of Vilnius next to the old town, but with a boho and alternative vibe. You can read the 'constitution' in different languages on the walls, which include things like 'the right to cry' and 'the right to be dog'. Good for a",
          "Definitely interesting to visit. You can even get a stamp on your passport at the \"Barliament\" just as you enter. The Constitution was the best part - we thought that was great and funny!",
          "Well maybe Greenwich Village in the old days. A mix of shops, restaurants, bars interesting architecture. A short walk from Old Town. Stroll around and people watch, Have a drink. Walk along the river.",
          "So, this is the district of Vilnius where I live myself. I enjoy this special area that is interesting both from historical and cultural points. So this is highly recommended to visit the place of old town, to check even every yard, to cross small bridges, to enjoy small art",
          "Well worth the wander, if only for the witty constitution in numerous languages on a wall. Unfortunately none of the cafes or other plac es we wanted to visit were open in February, but we loved the street art and the ubiquitous prayer flags.",
          "This is the place where most artist ( painters, sculptures ect ) lives. It stands out from the rest of the city and you can make some good deals here. They have a wall with their constitution written on in many different languages, this is fun to see. Had a nice evening here in",
          "The story behind Uzupis is really fun and interesting and it's a lovely area to visit. There are loads of wired and wonderful pieces of artwork dotted about the place which adds to the interest. There are some nice little bakeries, restaurants and bars here. I'd like to be",
          "uz got to here to see the hippiness of the area , , delightfull restaurants and bars in the area worth a visit .",
          "We stayed in this neighbourhood for its quirk value, to be honest. It's a cute spot, lots of great street art and some excellent little cafes. Take some time to go through the art galleries and shops in the backstreets.... I found some awesome clothes and interesting souvenirs.",
          "as if there were cities in the country separately.Admired streets really something intriguing.Realy you should visit this place.",
          "Our guided walk took us here and I'm so glad it did as I don't think we'd have come otherwise and that would have been a mistake. I love how the Constitution of this free state is based on beer and the \"barliament\". Well worth looking around and I only wish I could come on",
          "A funny place to visit. Although part of Vilnius, people in Uzupis consider themselves a \"nation\". They have their own Constitution and Parlament (called \"BARlament\"). They do not the hushing around of big places nor moody people. While there one must smile, walk slowly and be",

          "I walked around Uzupis in February and it was pretty dead. A lot of the places were closed. I saw the Constitution which was pretty cool, but couldn't get my passport stamped which was very disappointing. Highlight of the visit was Snekutis, see separate review, which was",
          "While walking the free walking tour, we arrived in Uzupis. Its great to see that this small town is build from and for the people! Loved the backpackers statue! The atmosphere was great and it was funny to read the constitution in different languages",
          "Had read a bit about this area & thought it worth a look as it sounded interesting & unusual. Most of the descriptions we'd read described the area as 'bohemian'. Didn't really see much evidence of that but maybe we missed what others have seen / experienced? We walked up the",
          "Obligatory to visit. To find on the wall and read the most open Constitution in the world. To spend time in one of several nice cafes (terrace on Vilnele river in summer and autumn). To cross all 7 bridges of U\u017eupis, which is much more Vilnius' Trastevere (because literally-",
          "It is a highly overrated place in town. Maybe because it was on 31 of Decembre but there was not much going on. When you walk further uphill there are some old wooden houses but also very ugly buildings.",

          "Artists, musicians, actors (all kind of local \"bohema\") used to live here. Later they even decided to call \"A Republic of Uzupis\" (Republic of the place on the other river side, or smth like that). They even have their own rules: eg. Dog has a right t be a dog :) You can see",
          "The uniqueness will lure you in and the cafes will win you over. Definitely very different than similar neighborhoods in other Euro cities",
          "Uzupis is a self proclaimed autonomous artists and bohemian part of town. It's across the Vilnia river, with many galleries, street art, cafes and restaurants. It was a neglected part of town during the Soviet era, so when freed again it was a cheap place to live, inhabited",

          "From reading about this area in the tourist guides I felt I had to go to see it. Its unusual in many ways but much smaller than I had imagined. Not worth going to Vilnius to see it but if you're there anyway..... why not!",
          "My favourite district around the city. It is so unique, and the whole philosophy behind the Uzupis Republic is simply awesome : charming, lively, alternative and so colourful.",

          "Interesting place declared independent by the local art community with its own constitution and president Lovely walk with lots of art and ateliers of local artists. Worth the visit.",
          "We visited only a bit of this independent republic within Vilnius and found wire-made underwear hanging and a hairdresser named Herr Katt, i think that says it all. It is colourful and artistic and lovely altogether.",
          "Wanted to check out this area after visiting Kristiana in Copenhagen last year. Different vibe but still cool and hip area. Our guide told us that its a very expensive area to live in. Lots of artists. Right along the river and was beautiful in October with the leaves",
          "It appears to compare itself to Christiania in Denmark but its nothing like it. It's more of an upcoming arts area. I definitely see some potential.",
          "Visit Uzupis for a different experience in Vilnius. Really fun to read this \"independent\" states constitution written on one of the walls in multiple languages. Perfect for people who like art and a calm atmosphere.",

          "museum is primitive- a lot of stuff from ikea, ali or ebay... in a such a nice place with such a nice interier this museum seems like a school project. And price for a ticket is almost like in Glasgow science center-but the level of museums like 2 and 10. Hope it will be better",

The staff is very friendly and easy going; they help",
          "We had this on our 'to do' list, but it really isn;t necessary, unless you have the extra time. It is extremely small and not that fascinating. There are much bigger and better ones scattered throughout the world. While there are some photo opportunities that play with",
          "This place was great The staff were amazing in fact I\u2019m a man in my 50s and this was the best customer service I have ever received in the world The 3 young ladies who engaged with us were fantastic",

          "We\u2019ve been to the one in Zagreb and Warsaw so thought we\u2019d pop in to this one! It\u2019s great that each one has featured some new and different items so it makes it more interesting. The staff were very helpful and spoke English. Student rates are available.",
          "Plenty of cool things to explore and see. Could be more things to really get your moneys worth. The staff walks around to assist and explain things, however sometimes they startled us when they popped up behind our backs to explain. In general a good experience",
          "Stumbled upon the museum quite randomly and had a great time. The staff was really pleasant and I was accompanied throughout my whole time there. The majority of exhibitions were great, including some that were really breathtaking.",
          "The kind of thing I've never really gone for before, but it was a lot of fun and the staff were really good at explaining where we needed to be to make the most of our pictures. We basically had the place to ourselves as well, which added to the experience.",
          "I stopped by illusion museum and did not regret it! I was alone and wondered how I could make some photos but, when you go there alone they offer you to guide them through the museum, which is awesome. Thanks Greta for the tour! I recommend this place.",

          "It's a good way to spend a couple of hours but it was a little bit expensive when compared to the prices in the city. A little cheaper (\u20ac7?) would have given it another star.",
          "Spent a few hours in this museum and had a great time. The guides were helpful in explaining the science behind the illusions. They also took the time to take fun pictures and give us some suggestions on where to eat authentic Lithuanian food.",
          "Magical! I cannot imagine ANYBODY not being enthralled by this. Don\u2019t miss it!!!!! I was there alone and the staff were right with me whenever an interesting detail needed to be pointed out or an amazing photo made with myself as the strange and wonderful subject",
          "It can be funny but it\u2019s very small, 11\u20ac ! It should be 4-5\u20ac maximum. Doesn\u2019t worth the price. Some experience are very cheesy.",

          "Several amazing illusions. I still haven't figured out how all of them work. The staff is very helpful and eager to help.",
          "I don't know why they call this a museum. It's more like playground for the whole family. Of course there is also planty of information of illusions, but the main thing is still learning by doing. That's why it's a good place to visit for classes. There's a small shop where you",
          "Very interesting place to visit,staff so friendly and willing to explain the illusions.Marta was my guide and definitely recommended it.",

          "The illusions were fun, but I think we spent more time taking photos with the \"big chair\" and the \"upside-down-room\" than anything else. I think it would be a great activity with kids / teens, it was alright + for a group of 10.30 year olds. We had fun though - I would recommend",
          "I was by myself but the girls that worked there were happy to walk around with me, and take pictures when needed. The illusions themselves were better than I had seen in similar places.",
          "Really enjoyed this museum. It's a very hands-on experience and you get really involved. Love all the cool illusions. Many small side-rooms you may not even realize are there, so make sure to really explore this place. The Staff was very nice and you can tell they like their",

          "7 of us visited this museum, thinking we would be there for about 10 minutes. We were there for almost 2 hours. What a great place which was made better by the staff who took so much time in explaining things. Well worth a visit.",
          "Went here on a cold day and it was just a bit of a laugh really. The staff are so helpful in explaining what each illusion means and they demonstrate with you how it works. They took all the photos we asked and told you where to stand for the illusion to be captured on camera.",
          "Nice place to visit, but there was not That much to see and experience. Good for a short visit, maybe could be a bit cheaper? It is now 11e per adult. Staff was very friendly and helpful!",
          "Kids friendly but just as fun for adults (we didn't have any kids with us). Interactive activities. Educational staff that was very helpful. The LED-show was amazing.",

          "It's a lovely small museum, and the building it is in is half the charm. It might present a problem for people with mobility problems, as there is a steep flight of stairs and no elevator. Very pleasant staff, and some interesting exhibits.",

          "This museum is a collection of optical illusions, most of which are interactive, and it's fun for all ages. There are upside-down rooms in which you can take entertaining photos, along with some smaller, fascinating props that will really mess with your head. It is, however,",

          "The museum was alright, though I think the entrance is a bit pricey at \u20ac9 (especially considering the prices at other local museums). The best part of the museum was definitely the friendly staff. The girls were super nice and really made my visit a lot of fun.",
          "We really enjoyed this quirky museum and were very well instructed in the art of illusion by the young and friendly staff who all went out of their way to welcome us. The exhibits are enchanting and we were even able to attend a free light show in the evening. An excellent place",

          "Well worth an hour or two. Not a big place but lots of weird and strange illusions. The staff are really helpful without being intrusive. The place has a funky laid back feel - certainly not the normal museum atmosphere. Its situated in the old town so very close to most of the",
          "Our trip to the museum of illusions exceeded our expectations by a long way. Every station offered a unique and mind boggling experience like no other. The most impressive part however was the staff who made perfect our experience. Justina, Ruta and Saula were extremely",
          "Very good service and friendly staff, not extraordinary, but worth the money. Been to a lot less interesting exibitions.",
          "Was recommended this by someone we know who had visited. \u20ac11 initially seemed a bit pricey, but it really isnt, and is worth it. The Museum is compact but perfectly formed, with lots to see and do. Helpful staff who explain the Illusions if needed and offer to take photos of you",
          "Visited this small museum near the town hall and at first glance it seemed rather an amateurish set up. We were also not sure whether the 11 Euro entrance would be worth it _ it certainly was! After descending the stairs we were directed by a very pleasant young attendant to the",
          "What a fun way to spend a cold, rainy day! And I learned lots too! The staff are amazing and will step in to not only take photos for you, but provide ideas on how to get amazing optical illusion photos! It isn't a huge space, but still takes a good 90 minutes to go through.",
          "If it wasn\u2019t for the staff, we wouldn\u2019t take amazing pictures ! Right next to our hotel, the museum is definitely worth visiting!",

          "This is a bit like Finnish \"Heureka\" type place, where you can learn by doing (and touching). We were all so enthusiastic here, spent easily 1,5 hours. Staff were kind and they patiently gave us further information as much as we asked. Warmly recommend the place to everybody,",

          "We visited here with our 2 year old on a cold December day. It\u2019s a brilliant museum, lots of fun activities, but it is small given the 10 Euro entry. The staff, mostly young, are an absolute credit to the museum taking the time to explain the illusions or take photos. It\u2019s",
          "Simple exhibition with number of illusion. However nothing super impressive as for 10eur per head. Crowdy.",

          "This is really a nice surprise. I went in and there a lot of optical illusions, but the real big pro is the incredible friendly staff. I went in alone, and a member of the staff guided me through the exposition. Some are known, some are new but especially the backstories make it",
          "This place is fantastic value for money. We only went in for half an hour and ended up in the for nearly 2 hours. The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable and helped us to engage with the exhibits. Also, make sure you grab a free map at the end for some great advice and",

          "Naturally, saying \"best museum ever\" requires some parameters. I have been to the great museums such as the British Museum, the Met, the Louvre, the Hermitage, etc. I have been to quirky museums such as the Miniversum in Budapest and the Mutter Museum in Philadelphia. All wither",
          "Really enjoyed walking around this museum. Lots of fun illusions to interact with. Was shown around by Marek who was excellent in explaining about the illusions and how they worked. There is also a light show later in the night which you can come back and watch with your ticket",

          "This is something a little different from most other attractions, and is good fun for a couple of hours for the whole family. It's situated near old town, and shouldn't be confused with the other illusion museum nearer to the cathedral. Entry cost was \u20ac10 for any person over 7",

          "The illusions were great, and some really did mess with your eyes and head, however this musrum is very expensive compared to others in Vilnius. It was not worth the \u20ac10 entry fee. Maybe \u20ac6 would be nearer the mark. The staff were lovely and took photos of us in the different",
          "This was our very first museum of illusions and we really enjoyed it! Maybe a little on a small side, but definitely recommend it. Our 4y old daughter enjoyed it so much as well. Super friendly staff, as soon as we walked in they explained how the museum works + offered to walk",
          "We have been to a couple of illusion museums around the world, and this one was slightly more disjointed and small compared to the others, but still worth a visit if it's your first illusion museum (if it isnt, it's \u20ac10 and not really worth it)",
          "This is one of those places where you learn that you can't always trust what you think that you are seeing! It's full of fascinating illusions and visual tricks, many of which are set up so that you can take photos to surprise your friends and relatives back home. The staff",
          "Awesome place, mind blowing exhibition with things that will crack your brain and show how easy to manipulate they are. Unfortunately it's not exactly buggy friendly so my wife and I had to be carrying up and down some stairs, but that was a minor issue. Super friendly",

          "We were there with our teenage son and we all had a great time! We found out how some of the illusions really work. It was a very educational hour. One can spend more an one hour, take pictures, there are always employees ready to help and explain and take pictures for others.",
          "Went here with three friends and we really enjoyed it. You have to interact to get the most out of it though, if you're not the sort of person who enjoys taking photos or being tactile maybe not the museum for you. There is a light show at 7pm which was very entertaining too.",
          "A very fun museum if you like optical illusions. Apart from the classics, such as the pictures of faces who seem to be following you, you will find other gems. My 12 year old daughter said it was the best museum she's ever been and my 9 year old son said it was the second best",
          "This was not my first museum of illusions, so I've got something to compare with. Of course, it's not a Copernicus Science Centre in Warsaw, but for 10eur you'd expect something more. The space is quite limited. There are some decent ideas and illusions there, but very few. The",
          "We had so much fun in this museum, and took so many cool pictures. The service is amazing. The only downside is that it\u2019s very few rooms to take pictures in. It costs 10\u20ac to Get in.",
          "The museum isn't so big but the guide was very kind. She explained to us all the attractions of the museum, one by one. At the end she told us that we could come back at 19:00 without paying extra cost for the \"light exhibition\". The show was very unusual and interesting and",

          "The price is a lil high for the things inside, the staff is very kind and helpful. You will get some fun and see interesting stuff.",
          "We spent almost two hours having fun with all kinds of illusions. Good for the curious mind, kids and adults alike",
          "Cute little museum with lots of really interesting illusions to keep you amused for an hour. The staff are a real credit to the place I\u2019d recommended you utilise them - its a fun interactive place, a bit pricey at \u20ac10 but it must cost a bit to maintain and as a one off its ok.",
          "Very interesting exhibition, ticket comes with a personal tour guide, complete with explanations and fun pictures taken of you. It\u2019s not very big, I guess I must have stayed for one hour, but it was fun.",
          "We had so much fun here. Learnt so much, had so much fun playing and posing - and even went away arguing hours later about mirrors and perspective (in a good way!). But the amazing staff really brought it to life - from showing us the best place to pose for photos, to pointing",

          "The museum may be small, but it's unbelievable how much fun and information it gives you. Before going i was a bit skeptical and my friend convinced me to go. After spending only first 5 minutes there, I knew it was a good choice. We had so much fun and the people working at the",
          "What a great place to spend a few hours. Some fantastic photo opportunities, very helpful and friendly staff and even a free bonus light show. Whole place was much bigger than expected. Don't miss it.",

          "An amazing museum. The staff at the museum continually reveal the concepts and offer to take your pictures at many of the displays. Great place and they are open later in the evening than most museums.",
          "Really interesting illusions to investigate and tremendous fun. A party of school children arrived as we were about to leave and they were thoroughly enjoying themselves. I am a pensioner and my enjoyment equalled theirs!!!",
          "I had read positive reviews about this place before we visited, but had never thought it would be so much fun! We were planning to spend an hour there, but ended up spending two hours!! Our four year old son also enjoyed the museum and their special light show. The museum has",

          "Visited this place on a recent city break and was not disappointed. Real friendly staff and my guide around the museum was excellent, putting a \"forgiener\" at ease and very knowledgeable and funny. I was also very lucky in that there was a \"show\" later on that day and my ticket",
          "We went here as we had seen recommendations. We weren\u2019t disappointed and had a funny and interesting afternoon. It\u2019s not a big museum so it will only take an hour unless the place is crowded.",
          "This museum is one of the \"must-see\" atractions in Vilnius. Definitelly recommend to everyone - individuals, couples, families, school trips etc. A lot of interesting stuff and very helpful and nice service.",
          "For 10\u20ac per person we were a bit skeptical in trying this museum. But it turns out that it was a lot of fun. Very interesting and the staff (I remember one of them was R\u016bta) were really nice and helpful, explaining the illusions to us and helping taking pictures. I don't know if",

          "I had read about this before our trip and decided we would visit if we had time. I am so pleased we did. The staff were great and explained all the different illusions and were willing to take photos of us both together. If you have a few hours to spare pop in here it is",
          "Definitely a fun experience. I\u2019ve been to all kinds of museums and this was unique. Hands on, interactive, and fun thrown in on top of it. Staff was young but did an excellent job of engaging and explaining things. Very professional.",
          "The museum is a surprise! You learn many new things and the staff is really friendly and helpfull! A must go in Vilnius!",
          "At \u20ac10 entry I was a little dubois about visiting but the friends really wanted to. It was such fun!! Very interactive, lovely guides to explain things and lots of photo opportunites. Very glad we went and 1 hour was perfect time to spend here.",
          "I read the reviews before coming here so I had a lot of anticipation. This place was as good as I thought it would be and better. Runa showed me every exhibit and she was wonderful and humored me by taking a lot of photos for me. Older kids would love coming here. It\u2019s a brain",
          "It is a very interesting museum with a lot of funny experiments which can provide amazing photos. The staff is very nice and they explain every illusion to you. Big thank you to Svajune (part of the staff) for the amazing experience and her amazing and relax mood :)",
          "One of the highlights of my visit to Vilnius as it was completely unexpected. Full of fun and unexpected illusions of many different kinds - some are fun optical illusions, others are more like what you would see in a science museum, but it's the variety that keeps it",
          "We stopped by here to escape the rain during our trip to Vilnius. My husband and I enjoyed it we took a few photos to add to the collection too. Kids would love it - educational and fun at the same time.",
          "This museum is about many types of illusions. We enjoyed much from each and every one of them. The staff is very friendly explaining and demonstrating many stuff. Our 6y kid was also very excited from the \"miracles\". Top recommendation while visiting in Vilnius.",
          "Visiting this museum was a pleasant and interesting experience. The staff is very friendly. The museum is not very big, but you can spend 2 h there experiencing illusions (10euros). They also have cute things that you can buy ...as souvenirs.",
          "We were randomly walking in the city when we found this mueum. A perfect occasion to create a very striking memory of the day. 10 euros for a wonderful moment inside the museum. We stayed almost 1 hour and were like kids discovering a huge playground ! We've been also invited to",
          "we had a good time visiting but it's a bit expensive for Lithuania and for the size of the museum. Also, we would have liked to visit without an employee explaining every single artefact..",
          "Thank you very much for great evening. I had only half hour to enjoy it but with help of really nice and kind guide it was the best spende half hour in Vilnius - I can totally recommend!",
          "Went to the museum without any expectations and was so delighted to find out it was so worth it! I was welcomed by Marek that guided me through the whole place so patiently, with humor and great conversation skills. Had a lot of fun! Thanks a lot!",
          "If you travel to Vilnius and not visit the museum of Illusions, you have definitely missed something really big. The premises is in a two story building and each parts is dedicated to a certain type of Illusions and mind tricks. As you enter, you are give a personal guide who",
          "I was impressed that there are so many interesting things in a museum. The best thing was that the museum has wonderful staff. I am very grateful to the guide Juste, who told me everything and explained the mysteries of illusions. The next time, I will come with the pupils.",
          "Really enjoyed the museum seeing all the different types of illusions with a personal guide to explain the key points. Well worth the visit for adults or children.",
          "It' a funny place. Not the biggest place, but what they have is good. We spent an hour there, and that seemed fine. Entry fee is \u20ac10, 7 or 8 would be a more reasonable price. But a nice place if you have some time to kill. Lot of funny photo opportunities :-)",
          "Rainy Easter Sunday. Late flight home. Wanted to go to another attraction close ti this. The other one was not open. Absolutely wonderful experience. So many nice illusions. Some of them might be familiar to you if you are born early enough. I highly recommend to visit.",
          "It was a good fun for a cold rainy day and we strongly appreciated that it's open even on Easter Monday. However, it's not very large and not everything is really entertaining. But your kids would enjoy.",
          "A fairly small museum and one that could be done in an hour or less, but still a fun little diversion and something worth checking out - particularly if you have children. Friendly staff are on hand to take photos and talk about exhibits which was a nice touch.",
          "A must see museum. I really liked it and you can also learn some things out of it. I would really like to again so i can just have more photos with friends and stuff like that...",
          "Although the most expensive place at 10 Euro each, it was well worth it. We spent about 1.5 hours at the museum, and had a lot of fun and laughter. Helpful staff who show you how to use the exhibits when you're not sure.",
          "Certainly not your everyday museum! Friendly employees, great exhibit, great place to take pictures (and make fun memories); the employees even help with museum tours and the museum has light shows at certain hours. And the location and opening hours are convenient as well so",
          "Trick your eyes and your brain with some fun experiments! You can trick your eyes, your hands, your ears with some fun interactive experiments. The place is very central and easy to access. The guides are really nice and helpful, they will explain you the mind tricks if ask and",
          "We enjoyed couple of hours of goofing around and exploring different illusions. Great place to make funny pictures with the kids. This was the best sight for today. Thank you!",
          "This is a MUST if you visit Vilnius. The staff are very friendly, they explain all the illusions so that you get the full experience, they will take photos for you. I believe they are what makes the experience.",
          "Had a great time at the museum. Not badly priced and the staff are super helpful. My friends and I had a lot of laughs and took some great photos. Would highly recommend an hour or two here.",
          "Such a fun museum with a big collection of mind-blowing illusions and creatively designed spaces for cool pictures! You get to learn how those illusions are created often based on physical theories. The staff is super awesome. Not only were they willing to explain everything",
          "A fun and interesting experience that shows how easy it is to fool the mind and how the tricks are made. The visit was made especially enjoyable by the cheerful and helpful museum staff. A special thanks to Ruta for the exciting tour.",
          "A glorious mixture of new and old optical illusions, well displayed and with a high proportion of interactive elements. Children should love it and parents will find themselves jostling to have a go themselves. The only downside is that I imagine the museum will be very busy",
          "Very fun visit, great time for friends and family. We saw new things that mess around with your mind. Definetly a must visit. Employees were willing to show us around and explain the things.",
          "Just couldn't resist not to write review about perfectly spended time here! Entertaining, really interesting, we left with smiles on our faces. And big part played excellent team that works here-nice people, who took care about every detail. Absolutely recommend!!",
          "Nice and interesting science museum ..fun and educational... the guide was very informative and helpful",
          "It was cold and snowy. We were killing time. The staff were attentive and enthusiastic. It was 10 euros each to get in which was steep (cheaper to get a taxi to the airport!). We took some great pics and enjoyed the tricks our eyes played on us.",
          "This museum has received great reviews on tripadvisor. So my expectations were quite high. But it absolutely delivered! When I was there it was not that many people there, so I got the luxury of having a guide accompany me through the whole museum. Her guiding was great and it",
          "*staff friendly, welcoming & helpful *very interesting and mind boggling *suitable for children and adults Loved it! No negatives",
          "Nice little museum with a number of interesting and fun illusions to marvel at. The staff are great and very helpful always on hand to take a photo or explain an illusion. Some very nice photo opportunities are to be had here.",
          "On a cold day it\u00b4s a clever idea to warm up a bit and wander around in the Museum of Illusions, really friendly staff, and perfect way to play a little. And for ppl traveling with kids don\u00b4t skip it.",
          "I went there only because I had a few hours before going to the airport and it was too cold outside. I didn't expect much, and I was wrong! If you are curious and attentive, you can have lots of fun there, and also learn new things. Even adults. The staff is great! I was",
          "Excellent. Justina explained everything really well and made the whole tour extremely enjoyable. Great fun and have some awesome photos as memory. Thanks and well done!",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit here. The staff were lovely - helpful and interested in telling us about the exhibits. The price was worth it for us but probably expensive for a family.",
          "At the beginig I was worry about to pay 9\u20ac for a small museum. But It was totally worth it. Super SUPER interactive... And the people that work here are super nice. Al principio me preocupaba pagar 9\u20ac por un museo peque\u00f1o. Pero ha merecido mucho la pena. Es Super interactivo y",
          "The illusions where really good and smart. The people there are really nice and fun. The puzzles are fun and a great place to go visit.",
          "Had a great time here and the staff were always on hand to advise and take pictures, with recommendations of the best places to sit or stand. 20 euros for two people msy sound expensive but when its -4 outside the warmth of the place certainly takes the chill away. Could do with",
          "Even visiting before 7pm to see the somewhat disappointing light show we only managed an hour in this very small \u201cmuseum\u201d At \u20ac10 each with no kids discount or family ticket it was expensive too However it is also unique, the staff are very friendly and you can\u2019t fail to get",
          "The museum is the right place to go if you have 1-2h to spare in the city. The illusions are pretty cool and the guides actually take a lot of time to show and explain everything. Definitely a recommendation to visit!",
          "This is a great place to see! Full of interesting and fun illusions which make your mind boggle! There is also a chance to take loads of photos of stuff which is also great. Well worth the money. Staff was super friendly and helpful, would highly recommend to anyone visiting",
          "Took me by surprise that Vilnius had a museum for illusions but it was a really delightful way to spend a couple hours. Marek, one of their guides showed myself and a girl from Belgium around explaining all the illusions and art. Highly recommend for anyone visiting Vilnius!",
          "It was really nice, definitely pay a visit if you\u2019re in town. Staff was very friendly and eager to help and explain. This museum certainly is the most memorable thing about our trip in Vilnius.",
          "Museum isn't really a good description of this place it's more of an interactive fun zone. It's a bit pricy at 10 Euros but we thought it was well worth it and had loads of fun there. A good place to go on a cold or wet day for kids or adults",
          "An excellent collection of exhibits with a good supply of helpful staff to help you make the most of them . At \u20ac10 I suppose it might be on the high side price wise but we had plenty of chuckles and \"cor thats interesting\" moments to merit it",
          "The museum itself isn't huge but does contain a lot. I couldn't decide between 4 or 5 stars but opted for the latter purely based on how helpful the staff were. They were there to offer assistance, weren't too pushy and helped explain some of the illusions. The museum is great",
          "The staff are extremely friendly and really helpful, explaining each exhibit and offering to take photos for you on each 'hands on' exhibit. There were plenty of mind boggling illusions which were really interesting to play with. Children over the age of 8 would love it as",
          "This museum was average at best. Not really something for me but I guess if your into that stuff it could be the museum for you",
          "I am not really big fan of museums but this one was really unique and fun! The staff is very friendly and funny, I enjoyed a lot!",
          "Actually, the price is too high, 10\u20ac for approx 40min. It should be 5 or less. and some of elements were not so interesting, ok, for kids its ok!",
          "Simple fun, shows you alot of cool illusions and very welcoming workers. You can stay there as long as you want to but it can also take you one hour or a little less to go through everything.",
          "It is a nice place to go alone, with friends or as a family. You will enjoy optical illusions and children will learn something new. It is not expensive, 10 Eur per ticket and children under 7 years-old enter for free. There are guides to explain tricks for you. They are",
          "One word: terrific! A really cool interactive museum where you become part of the installations. As designer I should suggest you all to drop in and enjoy all the fantastic illusions, starting fron optical ones to multisensorials. We had a great time and lots of cool",
          "Best time spent in Vilnius! Two hours of fun! The staff was polite and friendly We also went to the live show at 19.00, it was unusual, interesting and since it was \u201cfree\u201d (free with the museum ticket) I really recommend it!",
          "A warm and enthusiastic welcome awaited us at this museum where you are encouraged to take photos and immerse yourself in the interactive displays. Great fun on a chilly Vilnius day.",
          "The illusions are nice and there are opportunities to take funny pictures. Moreover the people are young and very helpful. Though, this is short, the price is not really justified, and most of the illusions are well known.",
          "Stupendo, 2 ore incredibili, luogo incantevole, pulitissimo, personale che ti aiuta a capire e fare le foto, cos\u00ec soddisfatti che volevamo lasciare la mancia ma non \u00e8 stata accettata!!! Andateci, vi divertirete! Amazing! 2 amazing hours, nice place, clean, personnel very kind",

          "This was sooo good! We had a great time, we laughed alot and were amazed by some of the illusions! Brilliant fun.",
          "The pictures left by the other visitors were attractive enough, so this place was added to our agenda during our visit to Vilnius. We spent there more than hour and we enjoyed almost every moment of it. It was funny (just look at the pictures) but also quite educational, if you",
          "We had really great 40minutes there. Why not longer ? Because museum is really small. It's nice experience if you're going for the first time, but for second time I wouldn't go. They don't have a lot of illusions expositions and price is too high for such a small place. But as",
          "Great staff, very helpful, explained every exposition without event having to ask for it. Great experience for adults and kids, we went with our 8-year old daughter.",

          "Fun place if you like to take funny pictures. Helpful staff offering to take pictures of you. Some of the illusions are not jaw dropping. Some are pretty cool. Mostly I recommend doing this place if you have children. Without children it was overpriced.",
          "This was our first stop when we started looking around Lithuania and we all really enjoyed it! Loved the amount of photo opportunities and different things to look at. All staff were lovely and helpful. Definitely one of the highlights of our trip, I'd definitely go back again!",
          "This museum is fun & provides fun photo opportunities. May not be a fun place for solo travellers.These snaps will always bring a smile to you .. whenever you see them ... The best time to go there is when its raining ... one of the best way to spend an hour or 2 indoors in",
          "Located in the Old City it is a wonderful place to relax, to view the reality and yourself in it from another, unexpected, amazing point of view. Some exhibits are like a puzzle.",
          "The museum is great for bad weather or when you have children with you. The effects are not very exciting, but funny. The price of 10\u20ac for the entrance is too much.",
          "Place you definately have to go, if you're going in Vilnius. Great location! The staff is stunning! They're very welcoming 'nd fun. Love this place and the staff. Enjoy !!!",

          "Fun illusions. This was a cool place to take pictures! I got a student discount, but i would still have liked the price to be not as high as it was. We went there quite late, which i think was a good idea, because it was not crowded, and the people there showed and explained to",
          "Optical, physical illusions, light shows on weekdays, good staff and cosy interior. All the ingredients needed for a fun experience. Small gift shop too. If your in Vilnius its a must visit place.",

          "Everything in this museum is a delight and great fun. Ilona was our guide to show us how the exhibits worked and she was excellent. A great sense of humour and very happy to take our photos whenever we asked. We would definitely recommend this museum for a fun couple of hours!",
          "Escaping from the rain i entered the building and was greeted by the friendly staff of the M.O.L, inside a young lady called RUTA showed me the direction to start from and was very kind in explaining to me the exhibits and taking photo`s for me. I had never been to a museum",
          "Great place to visit. For ten euro you get a good solid hours worth of enjoyment with some really fun and quirky attractions. A great place to visit on a rainy afternoon.",

          "I had read about this museum and wanted to ensure that we got to visit. The individual exhibits of the museum are interactive and the staff more than willing to help demonstrate. You could see that they all were proud of the museum .",
          "Popped in here for half an hour or so. The staff are attentive, taking time to explain things and helping to take photos etc. Some of the \u2018exhibits\u2019 are fairly run of the mill, however some are very interesting and offer the chance to take some creative photos. Slightly",
          "I have been to many of these all around the world. This one is great and the staff is friendly. We went on a rainy day and it was not too crowded which made it very enjoyable. It is small in size though! Ask for help with the pictures as you walk around. Great memory in my new",
          "Incredible fun , Great illusions , must see ! For me it was the best time I had visiting Vilnius. You can film and take photos free of charge. The guide is absolutely amazing with great detail to each piece and great fun as well ! Thank you for a great time !",

          "Vilnil was great fun. For the modest price of 10 Euro you can spend as long as you want in the Museum, if staff is available, which usually is the case, a free guided tour is included. The staff were welcoming, great and friendly. A must see if in Vilnius!!!! Illusions are",
          "Short but very interesting. Visual auditory and tactile illusions. Bring your camera there is the possibility of some fun photos!",

          "A very interesting Museum which the kids will enjoy, although good for all ages. Staff were very willing to show/demonstrate the exhibits and take photos. Price a little steep by LT standards.",
          "It's good fun for everyone. I went there with my family, which included people age 0-70. Everyone had good fun there. It takes about 1h to see everything there. Good place to take pictures. Children will really like it. The only problem is that it doesn't have a car park",
          "Really fun museum for all ages, each sight is interesting or is a mind game. The only problem is the VR handset looked fun but they only seemed to have one and obviously everyone wanted to have a go and I didn't want to wait around for so long.",
          "We went with our daughter, she is 7. It is really interesting museum for children and adults too. Staff is friendly and helpful- they made pictures of us and explained if we had questions. There is a back to USSR room with the carpet on the wall, lol))) Definitely worth visiting",
          "Quite nice place to visit for 1,5-2 hours. Best time to visit is just when it opens. If there is too many visitors at the same time inside it\u00b4s hard to get good photos. Welcoming, helpful and polite staff. Highly recommended.",
          "This was a very unique experience and a nice change for the kids after seeing so many cathedrals and art museums in Europe. The staff here is very welcoming and friendly, especially with children. It is quite pricey, but because it is so unique, it was worth the price after",
          "I visited last Wednesday as I had a few hours before my friends arrived in the City. As I was alone, Dovile who was working that afternoon took me around on a guided tour (at no extra cost), and took the time to discuss the illusions with me. As many of the illusions require",

          "Great place to visit with friends or even alone. I had a staff member (Dovela I think it was her name) explaining me everything and even took pic of me. There was also a lights show. Very good vibe. You can print 2 pics of your visit and take them home for free. Entrance was",

          "Well we had no idea what to expect with this place , however it proved to be one of the best places we visted! If you love art, illusions or being optically confused this place is for you! The staff are great and are really knowledgeable and allowed a group of 6 idiotic",
          "After running out of places to go in Vilnius, I stopped in here for a solid 60+ minutes. I must say, it is quite entertaining. They do a \"light show\" twice a day, so try and time your visit around when that is happening - the light show is nothing crazy, perhaps better for the",
          "Our kids found the place - and persuaded us to go. And we spent 1\u00bd fun hours at the exhibition. The staff is helpful, open and friendly.",
          "Daughters (9 and 13) were excited. Lots of photos taken, and one thought in your head - the world is not like we see it...If you travel with children, it is the place to visit. Stuff very friendly. We happened to be there in the morning hours - a few visitors, all attention to",
          "Very friendly staff that's very attentive but the place is a bit over-priced (10\u20ac/person) considering how small it was. The place encourages taking pictures and sharing them on Instagram. Good for both, small and older people. :)",
          "Loads of interesting expositions, opportunity to shoot some crazy pictures. The staff was amazingly friendly and I even got a guided tour because I visited the place alone:) Thumbs up all the way!",
          "Great place for families, friends. They have \"Light Show\" which is nice and locals will recognize the songs they play while performing. There is always nice staff and interesting illusions.",
          "We recently visited on a short break to Vilnius and discovered this. Had a fantastic visit, staff were so helpful and the interactive illusions are so much fun. So much to do and take photos of. Definitely worth a visit when you're there!!",
          "I was a bit surprised at the 10 Euro price, but we had a good time for 90 minutes, and it was well worth it. Bear in mind we went at the end of the day (it closes at 9.00) and there were not a lot of people there. What made it worthwhile is that helpers (all of them young, and",
          "Was a lot of fun and definitely worth a visit. We stumbled upon it and thoroughly enjoyed it! Some of the exhibits you just want to do again and again. We were lucky enough to have a go in the virtu reality room. My heart is still beating and the adrenaline still flowing. The",

          "I went to this museum by myself and i have to say i had a great time there, especially my tour guide Marija was wonderful and very friendly and we had a great time seeing all the exhibitions. We laughed and she even helped me take photos. If illusions blow your mind like they",

          "Visited with a friend and had a great time. Staff could not have been any friendlier or more helpful",
          "Do NOT go in the morning as there are hoards of excited kids. It is open until 21.00. Well worth the E10 entrance. You get a personal guide who explains in good English all the hands on optical illusions. I was most appreciative because I dealt in optical toys and persistence of",

          "The museum seems to be entertaining for children, but most of adults will find it dull. There are not so many exhibits and some of them are not worthwhile. All in all, not a bad place to visit with children if you do not have anything better to do. In our case it was Monday",
          "I visited the place on my own and was offered a personal tour. Though I have seen many similar things in other countries, this was a very good collection and pedagogically built up. Many good photo options. The girl showing me round was very kind in offering her time and spoke",

          "Quite pricey (10 Euros each) but they only charged for the adults (we had kids 8 and 3) It does include a guide to take each individual group round. Kids really loved it - a well spent couple of hours.",

          "While I was visiting the museum, one of the staff, Antanas, came to me and started to guide me around, explaining every exhibit detailedly, which has really impressed me. It's a new museum of not even one-year history, but the exhibits are really interesting and there are daily",
          "We totally recommend this place. We had the luck to have Maria as our museum guide. She took a lot of time to explain everything and also made really nice pictures of us. Thank you so much Maria. There was also a really good light show and many things to experience. Have a look",
          "The fact that these guys are newly established and have already made it to #6 of 207 things to do in Vilnius speaks volumes. I came here today as a solo traveller and was overwhelmed by the welcome I received. A member of staff gave me a one on one tour of the whole museum, and",

          "I accidentally came across to this museum, which is still not popular as it deserves. The very friendly stuff explained that locals think it's expensive, but I think It deserves 10\u20ac for the entry. Even it looks bit childish, I had amazing time there (I'm in mid 30's). Try to go",

          "If compare to other this kind of museum what youcan find in Tartu, Estonia or Amstersan this is really misarable. Very poor exposition, museum is small. Entrance is very expansive,11 Euro. Museum more looks like a collection of chinese funny souveniours what you also can buy at the entrance. Really, fail.",

You can see everything in one hour or two depending on your pace. I finished my visit with an amazing light show.",

Saul\u00e8 was a girl that was taking me on a tour through the museum and what a charming personality. You could see that she loves her job. This place is also a must see if you're in Vilnius. Highly recommended!",

          "For me the best thing to do in Vilnius. Displays really interesting, staff extremely keen and helpful in expressing and demonstrating exhibits.",
          "Its cool but do not expect too much. With vilius cart discount right ok from pricing and very kind and helpful staff.",
          "Well made. Have a lot things to watch.",
          "Not bad, but meh. Slightly expensive. I wish there was more printed explications of the exhibits. You'll see some fun stuff, but it's not as good as a camera obscura for example.",
          "Super fun, not so much in terms of exposition but The People there are Great and always helpful",

          "If you fed up with common museums and want to see a little bit interesting and interactive exhibition, let's go to Illusions museum in Vilnius. It costs 11\u20ac and unlike what Google says, it is open through the whole week from 10h to 20h (except if there is big rain outside,which cause flood in the museum :) ). It worths the price.",
          "Amazing museum where you can interact with exhibits, take photos and videos. Friendly personnel will guide you through the exhibition and explain the \"magic\" behind the exhibits.",
          "Double thumbs up!",

          "There are some interesting items in the permanent exhibition. In the temporary exhibition you can have a lot of amusement with all those useless things. Just I believe they have overestimated that place. The ticket prices are 11\u20ac for the \u2026",
          "Really fun place.",
          "This museum was awesome. The customer service was great as well. They have staff who will explain the illusions and give you ideas for what to do.

          "Great exposition of illusions of all kinds. Almost everything is touchable or interactive. The staff around in this museum is nice and always helpful to take a picture of you beside a optical illusion. We spend about an hour there and did not regret the rather expensive 10 Euro.",

          "Opened in 2016, the interactive museum will have you questioning what you\u2019re seeing. It features nearly 70 exhibits demonstrating optical illusions, 3-D art, virtual reality, and installations that challenge the senses. Here, images bend \u2026",
          "One of my favourite museums so far. Nice illusions and moreover, very nice and friendly staff that shows you how the illusions work and what are the best positions to take a picture. The price is totally worth it considering you are shown around by a personal guide.",

          "Great museum!! Liked it a lot!!",
          "Nice to spend a half an hour. A little on the pricey side for what it has to offer (10 euros). I was expecting something similar to Copernicus Science Centre in Warsaw instead of a supertiny 'museum'. The staff was nice overall. One of them was a bit shocked that we actually knew 'the science' behind the exhibits. All in all it was fun.",
          "One of the best experiences we had in Vilnius. We came here after we had visited the illusions museum in Riga, and the one in Vilnius is even better. Staff were very friendly and explained some exhibitions very intrestingly. This museum is a must visit!",

          "The illusion museum was quite enjoyable, but quite expensive, especially in comparison with other museum I've been to in Vilnius",
          "Worth to spend time there even if you are alone (in that case there is a guided tour for free) the museum takes about 1-1.5h and cost 10 euro. You also get some nice pictures opportunities in the bedroom room. Fun for the children as well as the adults. Would go back anytime.",

          "Interesting for one visit, but way, way overpriced for what you get.",
          "One of the most beautiful museum in Vilnius. 10\u20ac was a bit high for us but they made a discount and we entered for 5\u20ac! But still you should see the museum and working staff were cheerful and helpful",
          "It was to big for me and not enough of chineeeesepeople. As atrue illusionist it was simply hocus pocus and bogus",
          "Fun museum to visit in Vilnius!",
          "Doesn't worth that much, government of this country just scamming tourists",
          "This is a great place for kids \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Very interesting little place in the heart of Vilnius. The staff were great and this interactive museum is entertaining and informative. \nIt's only a small place but they pack a lot in and everything, unlike some British museums is there to \u2026",
          "Staff very friendly and ready to explain each experience",
          "The museum was quite interesting, but price a bit to high considering it's size and the amount of time you spend there (30 minutes). There were some interesting ilusions, but most of them were mostly for children. Was interesting, but not too great for adults.",
          "A small but interesting museum.",
          "OMG What a cool place to visit! The best of all is that I got the chance to have a personalised tour, so I had enough time on each piece, like savouring delicious dish after dish on a restaurant. Ruta & girls do an amazing job making sure \u2026",
          "Amazing staff and beautiful illusions",

          "Interesting combination of playfulness and science. Very helpful staff that keeps an eye on you and explains things while you look like you're struggling with the concept. Very good alternative if you've been tired of all historical and \u2026",
          "Great for all ages. Give 2 hours and bring your imagination. Staff is adorable.",
          "A nice collection of illusions for enjoyment. The staffs are very helpful and eager to make your trip there memorable and enjoyable.

          "Fantastic museum staff very helpful and an amazing attraction",
          "Amazing place",
          "Great fun, and the people showing you around are happy and knowledgeable. We went quite early, just after opening, so it was quiet and we could use any of the exhibits without waiting.",
          "This is a very exciting and interesting experience, they have great and unusual illusions as well as some interesting physics tricks. However some of the attractions could use some more elaboration or historical location and the admission price is rather high for how much you actually get for it.",
          "Great illusions!",
          "Regardless of your age, this is one of the most entertaining museums you could visit! We were anticipating spending about half an hour in there but it turned into more like 3 hours, and we thoroughly enjoyed the varied exhibits.",
          "We had a lot of fun. My advice for the 5th star: lots illusions are quite famous and well know, more new things could be presented.",
          "Bit short, but great exhibition.",
          "Interesting place but pretty expensive entry fees compared to other attractions in Vilnius and their price/value relation.",

          "Very intresting",
          "Fun place; even though it was the most expensive thing we did, well worth it!",

          "We had a blast here, however, if you are in a group that cannot have fun with whatever, this small museum will probably not give you what you want. My group, however, who could find amusement in a rock by the side of the road loved this like nothing else",
          "Very interesting and wonderful place to visit. One of the most interesting places in the city center. Very pleasant, that all stuff speak Russian. \nAlso we got an additional VR tour and city map from very reliable museum stuff. \n\nYou can find lots of breaking mind thing here!\n\nI liked this place very much \ud83d\ude42",

          "The museum is pretty fun for kids and parents. There are a lot of photo opportunities and chances to be silly and creative. It isn't very big and won't take more than an hour to see and do everything. Free photo print outs at the end make the admission price (10\u20ac each) a little easier to swallow.",
          "Not so big, but a lot of fun. Did it with two friends. Easy to find",

          "I expected very little but it was truly an intriguing enjoyable experience",
          "Very small. Interesting but not enough for the 8 euro per person. It's one movie with the history of Lithuanian about 10-15min  and 6 glasses VR. That's all.",

          "Not just for kids!\nSome elements blew our mind :-)\nVery friendly and helpful staff.",
          "Was a phenomenal experience. Photos don't do any of the fascinating illusions justice. Guides are very knowledgeable and helpful.",
          "A little bit too pricy, but totally fun place to spend your 2 hours in the Oldtown with your friends. I don't recommend to go there just by yourself, because there is many things that you should do together.",

          "We traveled from Vilnius Old City on a bus to visit the site of the 1991 Lithuanian fight for freedom against the Soviets. Make sure you view the photos of the 13 killed and of the events of January 13, 1991. You will need to pay to enter the elevator which takes you to the",
          "Panaroma view is OK, a lot of soviet buildings around, nothing really surprising. Just to go up and down for adult 6eur. Restoraunt in top flour is quite expensive, but interesting part is that it/tables moves around so you could see whole city. It screams for renovation and on",
          "Fantastic view over beautiful Vilnius! Worth a visit during Summer. Restaurant is okay, but the view is just incredible. Highly recommended! :)",
          "I recommend to go there half an hour before the sunset.The view was fantastic. Service could be better, we had to wait a long time for the orders. Food was ok.",
          "We were unlucky in our visiting of TVTower, because March,9 was cloudy and foggy day. No any photos:-( But lunch on 19 floor was nice, and we bought some nice souvenirs too... No problem, next time sky will be clean, I hope:-)",
          "The Vilnius T.V. tower affords the absolute best panoramic view of Vilnius tha tit is possible to get. Once you ascend the lift there is a revolving restaurant and bar so you can watch and let the city turn slowly by as you look out the window. it is over 1000 feet high!On my",
          "Very good views over city etc. Revolving restaurant which serves good food sit there as long as you wish no hassle. A number 16 trolley bus will take you to the Televizijos Bokstas bus stop, then a 5 min walk following the signs to tv tower.",
          "I am glad this was included in our tour, in recent time this was attacked by Russians in tanks and many people died. It was a powerful reminder of what Lithuania and its amazing people have gone through over the ages. Its all over Lithuania, the struggle this county went through",
          "There is a good view of Vilnius from the restaurant of the tower. The bizarre thing is that you have to pay 6 euros for the lift to get to the restaurant. Food in there restaurant is far from great, but edible if you are very hungry and not too health conscious. Service is",
          "Visited in winter, so the whole of Lithuania was white, very nice to see from such a height. Just \u20ac6 to enter the tower and stay for as long as you wish. We stayed just under an hour and got to see all points of view within this timescale. Great perspective, beautiful views",
          "Beats me why this is on the list of attractions in Vilnius. Yes it's a tower but that's literally all there is to it. Pick someplace else.",
          "Though it was a cloudy day and on a sunny day experience and view have to even more better this is a good option if you have couple of hours in Vilnius and you want to something unusual. Restaurant in the tower was quite shady but that was not the point, mots probably I",
          "If you visit Vilnius you cannot fail to see the TV tower. Its role in the freedom of Lithuania is important and there is a small exhibition tucked around the corner from the payment desk. Take a moment to find it and learn what standing up for freedom means. You will need to get",

          "Transport We caught the No. 16 Trolley Bus from the Near the Train Station (Stotis) to stop Televizijos Bokstas. The journey was between 20-25 mins. It cost \u20ac1 per person, one way. From the bus stop there is a 5-10 walk following the sign posts through the housing estate.",
          "We spent 2/3 hours up at the top of the tower and it was fantastic for approx 6 euros Waiter service at your table and the food and drink was still reasonably priced. We would definitely recommend",
          "Nice views of Vilnius and the surroundings. A bit high prices in the restaurant. But all in all a great experience. The tower shows a bit of Lithuanias history too.",
          "There is not a lot to do in Vilnius so take a taxi and go out for about 7 km to take a view of Vilnius from 165 m high. We loved to sit and relax, use the WiFi and look outside the turning tower for 6 euro entrance and 2 euro for a latte, loved it.",
          "Not the most important place to visit in Vilnius. There is a restaurant and view point there. You can view the city with out ordering anything. However you need a waiter or another member of stuff to order lift.",
          "The TV tower should be at the bottom of your list and under two conditions: First, if you've visited everything else Vilnius has to offer in downtown area Second, if the skies are clear. We actually didn't climb it, just drove by. It is far away from city center, so you'll see",
          "Bit of a strange one. Miles from the centre of town (about 4 or 5) so isn't easy to get to. A taxi on an app will get you there for about 4 Euros though, so not the end of the world. However, on the viewing platform, it is just a bar/restaurant. If you are not eating or",
          "The TV Tower is a great place to spend time thit friends in Vilnius. Very nice especially at night. Delicious food, greet service. It's is very inexpensive compared to similar tourist attractions in other cities (we paid around 4 EUR per adult + 16 EUR food). Still, I believe",
          "This place is really amazing to view the entire city view. Restaurant in the top of the tower is pretty good nice to have food or drinks.",
          "If you are coming to Vilnius you have to visit this tower. Especially on a sunny day (or a day with not so many clouds) you have the perfect view. I think in 1 our you can see a 360 view of Vilnius. I didn't eat there, because of bad reviews of other people, but only the view",
          "A great place to see Vilnius city from the top. The inside is constantly turning, so in an hour or so you get to see the 360 degrees. Entrance fee is 6 Eur.",

          "At the roof top there is restaurant only. No places for sightseeing, just tables. So it comes out you pay 6\u20ac just for restaurant visit. View is great, just no space to enjoy it. At restaurant food is under restaurant level. Better take some drink or light dessert. Do not risk",
          "Nice view over the entire region. Restaurant is not interesting. The place is historic and played an important role in the 1991 liberation from Soviet.",
          "Visiting the TV tower fitted in with our other activities that day (tank museum, parliament, KGB), all linked with the events of January 1991. It is a short taxi ride (taxis are cheap by the way) from the centre, and offers great views of the city and even neighbouring",

          "If you are interested in a good meal and good service this is not a good place to go to. If you just want to eat in a place with a fantastic view then I can recommend this restaurant. Lack of service is my main problem. We ordered two salads, but was served totally different",
          "A little out of the way but definetely worth a visit. e Only had drinks and deserts which were ok. We spent 1 hour in a booth on the rotating floor which gave us a 360 degree view of vilnius and surrounds. Also of interest is a picture tribute to the 13 decreased. It's on the",
          "It is an old Soviet style tower, still one of the highest in Europe. It is a bit ugly, made of concrete, but great view of the city and the surrounding. If you sit, it will take 45 minutes to see all directions, since it is a revolving tower. There is a cafeteria and restaurant",
          "My boyfriend proposed me in this place, so personally for me this place full of memories. You can have dinner for a acceptable rate and enjoy the view",

          "Out of the city , amazing view of Vilnius and the surrounding area but nothing else... The restaurant only seemed to be serving drinks and was rather tired looking .",
          "Amazing view from the top of the tower. Nice bar and reasonable prices. The Memorial in front of the tower is very touching.",
          "We enjoyed the view on a sunny afternoon. Not as much to see as from the tv-tower on Alexanderplatz in Berlin, but still an experience not to be left out on the first visit in Vilnius.",
          "In my opinion, the TV Tower is near the top of the list of \"must-see\" sights in Vilnius. Some reviewers have mentioned, for example, that it is hard to get to, is over-priced or has mediocre food and service - and to a degree all of these are true. It is not within walking",
          "We visited the TV Tower as a group and it was a great experience. The views are fabulous but the food was very basic. The vegan starter was covered in mayonnaise so I couldn't eat it and the main course arrived covered in a creamy sauce and had to go back and was replaced by",
          "Vilnius TV Tower is a 326.5 m (1,071 ft) tower and the tallest structure in Lithuania. The observation deck located at 165 m (541 ft) from the ground houses the cafe (with not very welcoming staff and low quality, expensive food), however it offers a picturesque view of the city",
          "TV tower is the attraction you must visit if you want to experience Vilnius in full. Entrance fee is 6 euro for an adult. The staff asks you to check-in your coats and large purses/backpacks by admission desk. >1 ride up to 19th floor on the elevator: beware of the ears popping.",
          "Unfortunately it is located far away from the old town but worth visiting. The restaurant - the part of building that you are going to sightsee the city - is poor. Music is played by the radio, sounds are not accurate for the expected atmosphere. For me food was too expensive",
          "We arrived late in the evening, close to 9 PM, but were still able to go up to the top and enjoy a drink and an ice cream in the revolving restaurant with the amazing view. We also found the historical account of events at the TV tower around 1991 very interesting. Best to get",

          "This is probably the best place to enjoy panoramic views of Vilnius - however, that is pretty much all there is to it. The history of the place is an important part of Lithuania's fight for independence, but the memorial itself is not necessarily worth seeing (meaning that you",
          "I would only recommend this place if you had time to kill in Vilnius and done everything else. It's quite away out of the city and we got an uber taxi there. the windows aren't that clean so you can't really see that clearly. You pay 6 euros to get in and then feel like you have",
          "I wanted to see it because of its history and the views, but I was disappointed. It is not easy to get there (about 7 km from the old town) and the TV tower history is not well displayed. The visit to the tower is a commercial operation: one has to pay 6\u20ac to take the elevator to",

          "Views of Vilnius city is the only one, what is really very good in this TV Tower. Meal and service in restaurant is below average, but sitting around the table you will make full turn around and get full city view. Recommended for all spectacular view lovers.",
          "Fantastic view of the city! Very low price and fast elevator. Good cafe with excellent service with a smile on the viewpoint. Rotating viewpoint with tabels and chairs organized like an restaurant. Very good and relaxing experiment! Museum on ground floor.",
          "I was reluctant to go because it was my last day and I was walking around with my gym bag but they have lockers on the first floor and a place for your jacket. It was a little chilly but nice when i got to the restaurant. It was snowy so I didn't get to see much of the city",
          "This place offers an outstanding view of Vilnius and is also a museum. Prices of tickets are worth it. There is a restaurant on the top, also not cheap but it is rotating 360 degrees so you can see everything while eating :) If you want to spend less money, you can only visit it",
          "This landmark is like a symbol of Lithuanian independence. TV tower has great museum and restaurant. Must visit!",

          "This is an attraction in several ways. The tower was ready 30 Dec 1980, and has historical interest. On the 13th of January 1991 the TV-tower was in the center of history when Lithuania, as the first state in the Sovjet union, went out of the union. At the same day 14",

          "Wow, amazing. The price to be honest I was expecting to cost more than we paid, so that was good. Lift taken us so high was raelly fast and when we were there, wow stunning views of Vilnius. Restaurant a bit expensive. Ordered some snacks and they were really nicelly displayed.",
          "The TV tower in Vilnius offers a breathtaking view over Vilnius as well its surroundings... I visited it on a very sunny day with clear skies and I could see everything as far as kilometres! Wasn't patient enough for the whole ~50 mins rotation of the tower but if you are having",

          "Recommend to go there in the evening for a sundowner. The restaurant is not very special but its definetely enough for a view beers. The view is amazing over the landscape but you will not see much from the Old City. Anyway the landscape with the river is very beautiful and",

          "The place is not bad at all, you get to very top of the tower and get to sit in a spinning restaurant getting the whole panoramic view of the city. The view isnt impressive since the tower is not in the city center but rather outside, so dont expect to see red roof tops of the",

          "The TV tower is a bit out of the way if you are just visiting for the weekend, but it is well worth a visit. Not only does it have the best view in town, but it also played an important role in the uprising against communist rule in 1991. Have dinner in the rotating restaurant",

The seats are revolving around the tower so in 50 mins or so you have the whole view. Take a trolley bus from town number 1 (1\u20ac a ride) and get off",

          "This attraction is quite expensive if compared to other for free or almost for free attractions of the city, but the sight from above will make you forget the money for the ticket! It would be perfect if it were closer to city centre!",
          "TV Tover itself in nothing too special. But it has a restaurant on top which is turning - with splendid views over Vilnius! It makes a full turn in 55 minutes. You can see all Vilnius - and it's certainly worth a visit if you have more then few days in Vilnius. The entrance",

          "Once your on the tower, you get lovely sights of Vilnius. This is the place to be if you want to discover Vilnius. A good thing is that the tower has a platform which moves 360 degrees in about an hour. The visit to the top and the restaurant are quite pricy by Lithuanian",
          "The view was stunning and apple pie with basil ice cream was awesome good! Servis have to be little bit improved. When we asked waiter about free wi-fi, he answered that he never heard question like that before and he have no idea about that! He wasnt helpfull and inerested to",

          "Once you get past the idea of going up in a tall tower built during the Soviet era, with their \"great\" quality control, all is good. The food was excellent and not that pricey for this kind of location. The view was good. However, it was the historic part of the visit that",
          "Because of the events of January 1991, the TV Tower is a special place in Vilnius. The memorial to those who died here is very moving. The revolving restaurant is very good and the service excellent. Highly recommended.",
          "The tower is easy to reach by Trolley bus from Vilnius train station (take the bus from the stop opposite the station, not the stop right outside the doors). Aside from the usual great view and revolving restaurant often associated with these towers, this one has a special draw",

          "You can see Vilnius from it, but old town is rather far. It interesting to get to tower, cause you see not popular districts of city. There is a restaurant on the tower. You can see great firework from tower at 31st of December! See weather forecast before going to it! There",
          "It's so high you feel you sit in the plane :) they will actually advice you to come on a different day if its a foggy day as you wouldn't be able to enjoy the view much. It was a great experience stepping out in the restaurant after quick ride up and to glance first time outside",
          "Gorgeous both during the night and during the day, however make sure it is not foggy. There is a restaurant in the head of the tower where you can grab a meal of cup of hot chocolate and take a seat. Restaurant is designed to spin and your table will make a 360 in approximately",
          "My first visit to the Tower was in 2005. I am honored to be in the Country of brave and fearless people. This is Tiananmen Square Victorious! I wish more people knew the history of Lithuania. If you are a movie buff, check out \"The Other Dream Team\".",
          "After you get to the top via mega fast lift you can sit anywhere next to the windows and you get a revolving view of the city within about 45 minutes. The food is great with a good selection. But the view and location is brilliant. Don't miss this if you go to Vilnius",
          "for those who want to do bungee jumping, you can jump from this 120 m top tower and experience free fall till 60 m. Good view of the city from there , but a little expenisve as compared to lithuania experience",

          "Easy to access by car- good signage and free 2 hour parking. It was lunch time so we opted for the set menu that gives you a bit of a discount on the ticket for the elevator up. The panoramic ariel view of Vilnius is fantastic and gives a great perspective of the city. Fun for",
          "It's cost about 5-6 eur to get up into the tower, but it's worthy - most in the evening or in the night ( be sure about working hours), and when weather is clear - no clouds, no smog. On the top of tower there is a cosy indoor restaurant, where you can sit, drink tee and enjoy",
          "Fantastic view over Vilnius city from a rotating restaurant (192 m up in the sky). Important landmark for the Lithuanian people from a historic perspective and definitely worth a visit. Reasonable prices in the restaurant.",
          "I was very interested the history of the museum. The cafe at the top of the museum needs refurbishment as he looks like an 80's american diner. I did not sample the food but I have been told it's not fantastic. The view of Vilnius is beautiful",
          "The view is brilliant, the tower is revolving, but don't eat there. The food is less than medium. A drink is all you need to enjoy the view.",

          "Its pretty much the same as every other TV tower that you can get in, so you get whet you expect really! Gave some brilliant views of the city, so worth a visit! Cost 21 Litas to get in. Staff were friendly, and we had a few drinks and some food at the top. That was really good!",
          "We visited in the last week of January. Unfortunately it was closed for upgrades or similar, and nothing is on their web site stating this. Hopefully next time we are in Vilnius we can return as our son tells us the view of Vilnius is very good, giving a different aspect to",

          "Revolving bar at the top of this tower is very basic, but it's all about the view. There is a museum documenting the historic events that happened here in the Soviet days, but it closes early. It's worth the trip to the other side of town for this amazing view!",
          "Take the number 2 bus (about \u00a31 fare) from the old town, make sure you get off at the right stop as it is easy to get off early as you think you are closer than you are to the mast. You have to wait for the lift operator to take you up and down. The views are spectacular from",

          "The TV tower is a symbol of the independence of Lithuania. You can go up and have a fantastic tour of Vilnius and neighborhood by sitting , having a coffee and eating (not the best restaurant of the town for sure) but you don t have to move as the place is moving itself slowly",

          "Probably not worth the trek or trip away from Old Town. While theviews are extensive, they are quite lacking character. The restaurant itself that rotates 360 degrees is worth just a drink for a ride of an hour.",

He is commonly referred to in Hebrew as ha-Gaon he-Chasid mi-Vilna, \"the pious genius from Vilnius\".Through his annotations and emendations of Talmudic and other texts, he became one of the most familiar and influential figures in rabbinic study since the Middle Ages, counted by many among the sages known as the Acharonim, and ranked by some with the even more revered Rishonim of the Middle Ages. Large groups of people, including many yeshivas, uphold the set of Jewish customs and rites (minhag), the \"minhag ha-Gra\", which is named for him, and which is also considered by many to be the prevailing Ashkenazi minhag in Jerusalem.\nBorn in Sielec in the Brest Litovsk Voivodeship (today Sialiec, Belarus), the Gaon displayed extraordinary talent while still a child. By the time he was twenty years old, rabbis were submitting their most difficult halakhic problems to him for legal rulings. He was a prolific author, writing such works as glosses on the Babylonian Talmud and Shulchan Aruch known as Bi'urei ha-Gra (\"Elaborations by the Gra\"), a running commentary on the Mishnah, Shenoth Eliyahu (\"The Years of Elijah\"), and insights on the Pentateuch entitled Adereth Eliyahu (\"The Cloak of Elijah\"), published by his son.  Various Kabbalistic works have commentaries in his name, and he wrote commentaries on the Proverbs and other books of the Tanakh later on in his life.  None of his manuscripts were published in his lifetime.\nWhen Hasidic Judaism became influential in his native town, the Vilna Gaon joined the \"opposers\" or Misnagdim, rabbis and heads of the Polish communities, to curb Hasidic influence. In 1777, one of the first excommunications against the nascent Hasidic movement was launched in Vilna.\nHe encouraged his students to study natural sciences, and even translated geometry books to Yiddish and Hebrew.\n\n\n== Youth and education ==\nLegend has it that by the age of four he had committed the Tanakh to memory. At the age of seven he was taught Talmud by Moses Margalit, rabbi of K\u0117dainiai and the author of a commentary to the Jerusalem Talmud, entitled Pnei Moshe (\"The Face of Moses\"). The young Eliyahu was said to have already known several of the Talmudic tractates by heart. He is known for having possessed an eidetic memory. By eight, he was studying astronomy during his free time. From the age of ten he continued his studies without the aid of a teacher due to his knowledge already surpassing all his teachers, and by the age of eleven he had committed the entire Talmud to memory.\nWhen he reached a more mature age, Elijah decided to go into \"exile\" and he wandered in various parts of Europe including Poland and Germany, as was the custom of the pious of the time. By the time he was twenty years old, rabbis were submitting their most difficult halakhic problems to him. Scholars, Jewish and non-Jewish, sought his insights into mathematics and astronomy. He returned to his native city in 1748, having by then acquired considerable renown.\n\n\n== Methods of study ==\nThe Gaon applied to the Talmud and rabbinic literature proper philological methods. He made an attempt toward a critical examination of the text; thus, very often with a single reference to a parallel passage, or with a textual emendation, he overthrew tenuous decisions made by his rabbinic predecessors.\nHe devoted much time to the study of the Torah and Hebrew grammar, and was knowledgeable in the secular sciences, enriching the latter by his original contributions. His pupils and friends had to pursue the same plain and simple methods of study that he followed. He also exhorted them not to neglect the secular sciences, maintaining that Judaism could only gain by their studying them. The Gaon was also attracted to the study of Kabbalah; his controversy with Hasidic Judaism thus stems not from a rejection of mysticism per se, but from a profoundly different understanding of its teachings, in particular regarding its relationship to halakha and the Ashkenazic minhag.\nThe Vilna Gaon was modest; he declined to accept the office of rabbi, though it was often offered to him on the most flattering terms. In his later years he also refused to give approbations, though this was the privilege of great rabbis; he thought too humbly of himself to assume such authority. He led a retiring life, only lecturing from time to time to a few chosen pupils.\nIn 1755, when the Gaon was thirty-five, Rabbi Jonathan Eybesch\u00fctz, then sixty-five years old, applied to him for an examination of and decision concerning his amulets, which were a subject of discord between himself and Rabbi Jacob Emden. The Vilna Gaon, in a letter to Eybesch\u00fctz, stated his support of Eybeschutz but that he did not believe that words coming from a stranger like himself, who had not even the advantage of old age, would be of any weight with the contending parties. Already at that age, however, the Gaon was considered the greatest of the generation, despite the many older Torah luminaries alive at the time.\n\n\n== Antagonism to Hasidism ==\n\nWhen Hasidic Judaism became influential in Vilna, the Vilna Gaon, joining the rabbis and heads of the Polish communities, took steps to check the Hasidic influence. In 1777 one of the first excommunications by the Misnagdim was launched in Vilna against the Hasidim, while a letter was also addressed to all of the large communities, exhorting them to deal with the Hasidim following the example of Vilna, and to watch them until they had recanted. The letter was acted upon by several communities; and in Brody, during the trade fair, the cherem (ban of excommunication) was pronounced against the Hasidim.\nIn 1781, when the Hasidim renewed their proselytizing work under the leadership of their Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi (the \"Ba'al Ha'tanya\"), the Gaon excommunicated them again, declaring them to be heretics with whom no pious Jew might intermarry. However, the excommunications did not stop the tide of Hasidism.\n\n\n== Other work ==\nExcept for the conflict with the Hasidim, the Vilna Gaon almost never took part in public affairs and, so far as is known, did not preside over any school in Vilna. He was satisfied with lecturing in his bet ha-midrash to a few chosen pupils, whom he initiated into his methods. He taught them Hebrew grammar, Hebrew Bible, and Mishna, subjects that were largely neglected by the Talmudists of that time. He was especially anxious to introduce them to the study of midrash literature, and the Minor Treatises of the Talmud, which were very little known by the scholars of his time.\nHe laid special stress on the study of the Jerusalem Talmud, which had been almost entirely neglected for centuries. As the Mishna in Tractate Peah (1:1) states: \"The study of Torah is equal to all of the  mitzvos\", and being convinced that the study of the Torah is the very life of Judaism, and that this study must be conducted in a scientific and not in a merely scholastic manner, the Gaon encouraged his chief pupil, Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin, to found a yeshiva (rabbinic academy) in which rabbinic literature should be taught. Rabbi Chaim Volozhin opened the Volozhin yeshiva in 1803, a few years after the Gaon's death, and revolutionized Torah study, with resulting impact on all of Orthodox Jewry.\n\n\n== Asceticism ==\n\nThe Vilna Gaon led an ascetic life. He interpreted literally the words of the Jewish sages, that the Torah can be acquired only by abandoning all pleasures and by cheerfully accepting suffering. He was revered by his countrymen as a saint due to his ascetic practices, being called by some of his contemporaries \"the Hasid\". While he was an opponent to the Hasidic movement, the term itself means \"pious person\" and is used here without reference to the movement.\nThe Gaon once started on a trip to the Land of Israel, but for unknown reasons did not get beyond Germany. (In the early nineteenth century, three groups of his students, known as Perushim, did manage the trip, settling mostly in Safed and Jerusalem). While at K\u00f6nigsberg he wrote to his family a famous letter that was published under the title Alim li-Terufah, Minsk, 1836.\n\n\n== Works ==\nThe Vilna Gaon was a copious annotator; there is hardly an ancient Hebrew book of any importance to which he did not provide marginal glosses and notes, or write a brief commentary, which were mostly dictated to his pupils. (Many maintain that it was his disciples who recorded his comments, if not his editorial notes.) However, nothing of his was published in his lifetime. The \"Gra\" was very precise in the wording of his commentaries, because he maintained that he was obligated by Torah Law that only the \"Torah shebichtav\" (the written law) is permitted to be written down - the rest of \"Torah sheb'al peh\" (oral law) cannot be, unless circumstances require. (This further supports the view that it was his disciples who wrote his comments.) So the Vilna Gaon abided by this view of law by reducing his extensive explanations that are largely inscrutable to any but advanced talmudists. Glosses on the Babylonian Talmud and Shulchan Aruch are known as Bi'urei ha-Gra (\"Elaborations by the Gra\"). His running commentary on the Mishnah is titled Shenoth Eliyahu (\"The Years of Elijah\"). Various Kabbalistic works have commentaries in his name. His insights on the Pentateuch are titled Adereth Eliyahu (\"The Splendor of Elijah\"). Commentaries on the Proverbs and other books of the Tanakh were written later on in his life.\nHe also wrote on mathematics, being well versed in the works of Euclid and encouraging his pupil Rabbi Baruch of Shklov to translate the great mathematician's works into Hebrew. A mathematical work titled Ayil Meshulash (\"A Ram in Three Parts\", a reference to Abraham's \"Covenant Between the Parts\" in Genesis 15:9) is generally attributed to him.\n\n\n== Influence ==\n\nHe was one of the most influential rabbinic authorities since the Middle Ages, and\u2014although he is properly an Acharon\u2014he is held by many authorities after him as belonging to the Rishonim (rabbinic authorities of the Middle Ages).\nHis main student Rabbi Chaim Volozhin, founded the first yeshiva in his home town of Volozhin, Belarus. The results of this move is claimed to have revolutionized Torah study, by departing from the centuries of 'informal' study. Youth and scholars would congregate in local synagogues and study freely, although it was customary to migrate to towns possessing great scholars as the local rabbi. The Volozhin Yeshivah created a formal structure of study, by providing qualified faculty, meals, and accommodation. The results of this process are currently the norm in Orthodox Jewry.\nSomewhat ironically, viewed from a traditional light, the leaders of the Haskalah movement used the study methods of the Vilna Gaon to gain adherents to their movement. Maskilim valued and adapted his emphasis on peshat over pilpul, his engagement with and mastery of Hebrew grammar and Bible, and his interest in textual criticism of rabbinic texts, further developing the philosophy of their movement.\nAs for the Vilna Gaon's own community, in accordance with the Vilna Gaon's wishes, three groups of his disciples and their families, numbering over 500, made aliyah to the Land of Israel between 1808 and 1812. This immigration was one of the first modern Jewish migrations to Palestine, although Hasidic immigration was already active in the 1780s (even by the rebbes themselves, such as the elderly Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk). The disciples of the Vilna Gaon, known as Perushim due to how they isolated themselves from worldly concerns to study Torah, originally settled in Safed because the Muslim authorities in Jerusalem prevented Ashkenazi Jews from settling there. However, after numerous devastating calamities in the region, including plague and earthquake, most of the disciples moved to Jerusalem. Their arrival in Jerusalem, which for over 100 years had been mainly Sephardi, revived the presence of Ashkenazi Jewry in Jerusalem, and resulted in a dominance of the customs of the Vilna Gaon.\nThe impact of the Perushim is still apparent today in the religious practices of the Israeli Jewish community, even among non-Ashkenazim. For example, the institution of the priestly blessing by the Kohanim known as duchaning during the weekdays (rather than only during festivals, as practiced in the Diaspora), and the accepted time for the onset of Shabbat in Jerusalem and other cities can both be traced to the custom of the Vilna Gaon.  However, the teachings and traditions of the Vilna Gaon have been passed down most directly to the Litvaks in Israel.  The Perushim also set up several Kollels, founded the Jerusalem neighborhood of Mea Shearim, and were instrumental in rebuilding the Yehudah HeChassid Synagogue (also known as the Hurba Synagogue, or \"The Ruins\"), which had lain in ruins for 140 years.\nThere is a statue of the Vilna Gaon and a street named after him in Vilnius, the place of both his birth and his death. Lithuania's parliament declared 2020 as the year of the Vilna Gaon and Lithuanian Jewish History.The Vilna Gaon's brother Avraham authored the revered work \"Maalot Hatorah\". His son Abraham was also a scholar of note.\n\n\n== Death ==\nThe Vilna Gaon died in 1797, aged 77, and was subsequently buried in the \u0160nipi\u0161k\u0117s cemetery in Vilnius, now in \u017dirm\u016bnai elderate. The cemetery was closed by the Tsarist Russian authorities in 1831 and partly built over.\n\n\n== Gravesite ==\nIn the 1950s, Soviet authorities planned to build a stadium and concert hall on the site. They allowed the remains of the Vilna Gaon to be removed and re-interred at the new cemetery.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHasidim and Misnagdim\nLithuanian Jews\nMisnagdim\nPerushim\nVilna Gaon Jewish State Museum\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nEtkes, Immanuel, et al.

          "The cathedral dominates the square it is in and is architecturally superb inside and out.The cathedral is all in white,just like the bell tower and is very much worth a visit. Entry is free to the cathedral.A crypt tour is available,which I purchased with my girlfriend,which was",
          "The Cathedral with the Tower are an amazing place. They resemble the Pisa cathedral and its Tower. Both of them worth the visit and shouldn't be skipped.",
          "Vilnius has a less \"coordinated\" OLD Town but it boasts more and better cathedrals. This is one of them which is on the fringe of the OLD Town.",
          "This cathedral is in heat of Vilnius. Cathedral is open all day for all visitors. You can\u2019t miss this cathedral when you become in Vilnius",
          "Fantastic Cathedral with impressive statues, paintings, imperial-like exterior and crypt chambers. Easily one of the standout experiences of our time in Vilnius.",
          "An impressive architecture, great for taking pictures thanks to the empty space around it. The interior is quite simple but there is a very beautiful chapel, the Chapel of Saint Casimir, that really must be visited.",
          "It\u2019s lovely to see how well preserved the cathedral is. It\u2019s wasn\u2019t crowded so we could look around freely and take photos without disturbance.",
          "This is the major landmark in old town Vilnius. There are 20+ churches in old town Vilnius, this is perhaps, by far the most famous and popular. It still hosts regular service on Sundays. There is a catacomb underneath, you will need to pay to enter during its opening hours.",
          "Not as pompose as cathedrals can be or as we are used to, but outside facades are great. Inside not as reach as in general, but I prefer it like that. But really crowded.",
          "Quite stunning from the outside but rather plain and functional inside. Definitely worth a visit and a climb up the bell tower is recommended",
          "Very Huge fill with people situated in the Square i like the visit there very nice hotel and statues",
          "There is no way you'll miss it, since it's the most visited attraction in Vilnius. The Cathedral itself is huge and very impressive. You can pay a couple of euros to enter and climb the bell tower, but I would recommend climbing the nearby Castle Hill or The Hill of Three",
          "Quite a pretty spot and worthy of a photo or two - different angles give you better vistas - if you\u2019re in the area it\u2019s worth a visit Don\u2019t forget the magic tile between the tower and the cathedral to spin three tones and make a wish !",
          "We enjoyed the spacious interior with its many details and art work. A quiet place to reflect, pray or simply appreciate the majesty of the cathedral.",
          "A very photogenic church at the heart of the Old Town. The interior is immaculate and well worth seeing and exploring. It is very pretty and important to the city. It was consecrated again after the Soviets had used it as an Art Gallery. There is a great deal of information",
          "A very nice cathedral in old town. The cathedral looks lovely from outside and is equally beautiful from inside. We only spent a few minutes there but the place is very nice. You can sit outside the cathedral, near tower on a nice sunny day.",
          "The main church in Vilnius situated in the central square, very close to Gediminas Tower and Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania.",
          "We visited this splendid and imposing white neo-classical Cathedral ( walked around also) and it's Bell tower leisurely. We learnt from the guide book that this wooden Cathedral was built in 1377-88 and rebuilt many times since then. This is most popular site for visitors and",
          "This is a stunning church, make sure you are reasonably covered if you wish to go in as we were not allowed in for showing our knees.",
          "At the \u201cbottom\u201d of Old Town. Public square with impressive architecture, culture and history. Easy walking access from most Vilnius Old Town lodging.",
          "If you are in the Old Town I would highly suggest a visit here. Plenty of opportunity for beautiful photos both in the cathedral or in the square.",
          "We did venture inside the cathedral as well and it was just as beautifully ornate inside as out. There was lots of rich looking marble, gold detailing and elaborate paintings so I'd certainly recommend the time to go inside as well.",
          "The Vilnius Cathedral is the first place that a tourist must visit in Vilnius. The Cathedral\u00b4s facade is majestic with gigantic columns and wonderful sculptures/figures on its huge walls. The tower adds to the drama. Upon our visit few days ago, we witnessed a wedding ceremony",
          "A \u201cmust see\u201d cathedral in the very heart of Vilnius. Beautiful from inside out. The main city ceremonies are held here. Despite of being huge it is still a very cosy place to calm down and free your mind! The Cathedral Square next to it is a popular meeting point and a place for",
          "It's not a typical meeting point. With the big chair in the center of it and all the surrounding buildings, this square is a must see and photo.",
          "The cathedral is placed in an excellent square. Despite the size everything was clean and tidy. You can rest there and understand the vibe of the city.",
          "The neoclassical fa\u00e7ade is impressive, but inside, in my opinion, the cathedral is rather bland. It's one of the must visit sites in Vilnius simply because its the city's main cathedral. However, there are several far more impressive church interiors to be seen.",
          "I am not a fan of the neoclassic style, and that leaves me a little cold towards a church that, otherwise, has a great many stories to tell, from its early foundations and the Gothic predecessors that succumbed to fire in earlier centuries.",
          "This is a massive Cathedral so plan to spend sometime walking around outside and inside. There are a few special chapels inside and the exterior is pristine. Along with he bell tower & palaces the whole site is impressive.",
          "Really nice church and Bell tower on main square close to Old Town. Good place to start getting to know Vilnius.",
          "Well it's big. Among European cathedrals, this one seemed a little garish to me from the outside. However the interior was spectacular. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "My hotel was right across this cathedral and I fell in love with it. This cathedral is so beautiful and its history made it even more beautiful. This cathedral is not only a city landmark but people actually go here to hear the mass.",
          "We chanced upon a tour in English. It was very informative as we were just coming from Krakow, Poland and visited the Wawel Hill. The guide talked abt the union of the two countries. We visited the royal tombs underneath. Well spent 50 min!",
          "Our tour bus from Riga dropped me off here so i got a good introduction to Vilnius seeing the cathedral in the spacious square. The sculptures on the roof were well worth looking at and the various statues around the building.",
          "Our friends got married here on Saturday and we couldnt have asked for a more beautiful service. The venue is stunning and all stuff were brilliant. Thank you for making the day so special!",
          "\u0130f you have time to make city tour you need to see this Kathedral. It has great status outside building and the inside is also needs to be seen.",
          "There\u2019s a decent sized square around the cathedral itself, sometimes has special events on. The parking immediately around the square is awfully expensive, something to be wary of. The building is beautiful and a true monument of Vilnius, definitely recommend going to see it",
          "Large square and beautiful huge building. Couple of buildings and things to see here, including the bell tower. Nice to sit and eat an ice cream from up the road.",
          "The biggest and most impressive of Vilnius' 48 churches. A big space with a distinctly Holy atmosphere. Small shop. Well worth paying the extra to go up the bell tower or down into the crypt. Exterior lovely in the evening sunshine. Not to be missed.",
          "This is in the main square and has an information centre nearby. It looks more like the White House with its splendid columns",
          "The cathedral and bell tower are a must see in Vilnius - situated together on an elegant square. Great photo opportunities especially on a blue sky day with the beautiful white buildings against the sky.",
          "this central monument with its large dimensions and wide plaza is easily recognised and show biblical figures on his walls and historic statues of local ducs. a good stop on the hop and off read buses",
          "The large square was impressive, clean and orderly although sometime back it was used for markets and fairs.The Cathedral dates back to the late 18th century and was built on the site of an earlier 1387 wooden cathedral. From 1950 , the Soviets used the cathedral as a",
          "First built as a Christian on the site of a pagan temple in 1251 Today it largely dates from the late 18th century, closed by the Soviets in 1950 and reconsecrated i 1989",
          "Its external architecture reminds me of Rome's Colosseum. The huge white pillars dwarfed me. It housed the relics of St. Casimir, Lithuania's Patron Saint. It is officially name as Basilica of St. Stanislaus & St. Vladislaus. No visit to Vilnius without visiting this cathedral !",
          "This Cathedral is all about being sober, both from the exterior which has nothing spectacular and looks more or less like a walled Greek temple than a Cathedral... as well as from the inside that looks more like a library than an actual Cathedral. This all changes when you get",
          "More imposing from the outside than the inside, it is situated in a huge square. Wonderful external architecture, it is a natural centre to the city.",
          "A typical Catholic cathedral built and restored on classical lines. Architecturally, the tower outside is particularly interesting. There is a crypt visit but tours in English are held on certain days at 4.00pm. You have to book in advance but there are no details on how to do",
          "In the square there is a palce, a belfry and the cathedral. There is a crypta that could be visited in soem moments of the day Do not forget the chapel of San Casimiro (three hands icon)",
          "Uncrowded, free and impressive. Napoleon used this cathedral as a barracks for his troops on route to Moscow and the soviets used it as an art gallery. Now back in use for its intended purpose.",
          "A very worthwhile place to visit; a bright interior, simply fashioned but with one or two very ornate corners. A must when in Vilnius.",
          "The Cathedral is located in the centre of the Old Town and is both a focal point and highlight of the city. The Cathedral and its adjacent bell tower are impressive and provide excellent photo opportunities, especially at sunset. The Cathedral is free to enter and is calm place",
          "On my visit to Vilnius I visited the Cathedral and it was a memorable place and beautiful inside and outside.",
          "This is a huge bright white cathedral which really stands out. There is a huge paved area beside it and at night it\u2019s full of children and families hanging out.",
          "I was visiting the Cathedral during my visit to Vilnius this month. The place is awsome with splendid architecture. Approach is easy too as its situated at the center of the city.",
          "This is a memorable place to visit especially for people who believe in miracle, there is a \u201cmiracle spot\u201d outside the cathedral where you can make a wish by rolling clockwise 3times on the spot without stepping out and \u201cyour wish will be granted\u201d",
          "The amazing thing about this cathedral is that it has survived 700 years of assault from one side or another. Restored again after independence in 1989 it us once again a jewel in the crown of Vilnius. Surrounded by sn impressive plaza which was buzzing with activity - kids and",
          "I thought the bell tower next to the. Cathedral was mote interesting while you cannot deny the size and scale. Inside was rather disappointing with no real wow factor.",
          "A vast building which has survived the years of misuse. Beautifully calm & peaceful and lovely to see it being used by the local people after so many years of oppression",
          "its a very big church with large pillars by the entrance, the interior is quiet as amazing as the exterior. the massive bell tower is right beside the beautiful church.",
          "This Cathedral is really impressive! Look for the lucky tile, Stebuklas between cathedral and the belfry! Make a wish, turn around yourself for 3 times and your wish (probably) will come true!",
          "The enterance is free of charge, the building is quite nice both from outside and inside. Also, right between the bell tower and church enterance there is one lucky tile, stat has a word \"miracle\" writen on it (in lithuanian STEB\u016aKLAS). People who find that can make a wish, step",
          "Outside is more impressive than inside. Hence why so many take photos, especially if you catch the sun light glistening on the white pillars. Very impressive place and I recommend a visit. Easy to find and good place to start a walking tour of old town. Or great place to",
          "The cathedral is easy to access and the outside a great meeting spot and people watching, but the interior while tranquil was not as magnificent as one may expect. Instead it\u2019s the church tower located on the outside that grips ones attention and imagination. A unique piece to",
          "Old basilika is so unique and breathtaking. Monumental building, with separate tower in front. Especially magical at night.",
          "Rebuilt in the Neoclassical style at the end of the 18th century it still features some earlier parts such as the Baroque chapel of St Casimir built by an Italian architect under Sigismund III Vasa's rule. It also features an unusual sight outside of Italy, the bell tower",
          "It's a great Cathedral and the square is a perfect spot for a selfie. The Cathedral itself is amazing and is not just a monument. It's a piece of art.",
          "Beautiful cathedral with a fascinating history. Can\u2019t miss this when you visit Vilnius. Amazing architecture and views from the bell tower (that you need to pay to go up)",
          "The Cathedral has a very impressive portico, but the interior is dull and rather plain. No wonder the Soviets planned to use it as a garage for truck repairs in 1950! However, the high alter is quite stunning - a piece in gold and silver. The best bit though, is the quite",
          "The view of the Cathedral is astonishing, outside AND inside. Make sure you get to do a guided trip to the crypt as well, as this contains a LOT of information!",
          "HAD TO WRITE MY ARTICLE LIKE THIS AS THERE WAS NO LISTING FOR CHRISTMAS MARKET----my comments DO NOT relate to the actual Cathedral 1 STAR---extremely disappointing. The market was quite heavily advertised, and on the internet it looked fantastic--but what an absolute let down.",
          "It rained during our visit so we were not able to spend much time here. However, on the plus side, it meant we were able to spend more time inside the church and take in the entire square.",
          "The Cathedral Basilica of St Stanislaus and St Ladislaus is the most prominent site in Vilnius. A peaceful and serene place but why so dark inside? The alcoves were not lit so difficult to fully appreciate the statues & paintings. Its a pity we missed the free Crypt Tour.",
          "Lovely to sit and contemplate and listen to the organist in the afternoon, close to the main street and squares",
          "The Cathedral has been rebuiltbmany times over the years due to war and occupation and it has been restored beautifully. The Square it stands in is open and offers a safe and peaceful space.",
          "The church is connected to lithuanian history. Placed in the center, actually at the end of the main street so you will get there easily.",
          "This Cathedral is free to enter which is unusual. The problem for us was that it was so dark. The side chapels were lit but the rest was in darkness and there were some interesting sculptures and works of art the ceiling from what we could see looked magnificent. I suppose it",
          "Great city all places easily accessible and within easy walking distance, great architecture, plenty of shops, resteraunts, coffee shops",
          "This place is one of the most unique places in Vilnius. It is like a face of this city. You have to visit this church. Btw - you can go inside for free! Do it!",
          "There was a service in progress on our visit . We were allowed to walk around the perimeter in silence and still could see all the interior. The building is reminiscent of St Peters in Rome with some fine frescoes and paintings.",
          "Very beautiful inside with a spectacular side chapel inside to the right. Magnificent gates into this side chapel. Dignified atmosphere with several visitors praying quietly. Nice to sit for a few minutes.",
          "Just in the middle of main square it is difficult to miss. In winter the illuminated tree ceremony is bringing everyone in front of the Cathedral.",
          "This is easy to find as it is at the end of the street that runs from the Gates of Dawn to this square. It had recently been freshly painted for the visit by the Pope. It is filled with history, but the main part of the church is rather plain. Go to the side chapel to the",
          "This is a very stunning cathedral. I am not particularly religious but I did appreciate its presence, both inside & out!",
          "Very beautiful church. Nice place to exempel pray and there is a LOT of space witch makes it spacies and not crowdy.",
          "This chuch is a fasinating construction, worth a visit, i went there sunday when there was a mass and full house, interesting experience. Make sure to dress apropriate, I do not recommend taking Pictures when mass is occuring.",
          "Quite plain inside but such a wonderful building to visit. Even better if you can visit during a service which is very atmospheric.",
          "This church is the oldest & very famous because it is the main church of Vilnius, which you will see in all the news paper & massages & adds around world when you see the name of Lithuania, when you come to vilnius 100% you will get to see this church if you don;t get to see",
          "The size, quality and quality paintings in the cathedral are nothing short of remarkable. How they protected them during the war and then the occupation is a tribute to Lithuanian determination. You certainly don't need to be a religious person ( I'm not) to appreciate the",
          "In the centre of Vilnious there is this beautiful cathedral.With the tower in front,the tower castle up to the hill and the parks around to join walks day and night.",
          "While not the same as what you will find in Southern Europe, this cathedral has an understated charm of its own. A perfect place for some contemplation. And a marvel that is has survived such a tumultuous history. It fits perfectly in the center of Vilnius. Do not miss the",
          "The inside of the church is nice, but not as dramatic as other churches in Vilnius. Book for a Crypt tour, which is done a few times a day and you must purchase in advance. This one hour tour is amazing!",
          "Although it's an amazing building from the outside I think it's a little bit plain inside compared to others I've been in ? Still worth the visit though!",
          "Very large and impressive building with huge pillars, inside not as interesting as others but still worth a visit plus being on the main square it also looks stunning at night when all lit up.",
          "A must visit. You can also go down to the \"catacombs\" which is great place to learn some history as well.",
          "We liked the stylish neoclassical building. It is worthy to walk around, make a wish on a tile in front of the main entrance, and admire the interior.",
          "An impressive building in the center of Vilnius attracting tourists. Those who wish can drop into the underground chambers and look around there.",
          "The broad surrounding square and the long row of tall white columns are impressive,although the instead is quite austere.",
          "Nice stop just to walk around the grounds and interior of the church. They were preparing for the Pope's visit so there was some cleaning and restoration being done on the outside. Therefore we did not get the full optical effect of the exterior.",
          "The cathedral and bell tower are very imposing from the outside. Inside, I was disappointed to find that St Cashmir's Chapel was closed for renovations during my visit (in July, may have reopened since). But I could peer at the chapel through the bars in the gate and it was",
          "This is a very large area where slot of tours start and a lot of interesting information about history. A definite must when visiting.",
          "Always the symbol of the city of Vilnius. A Cathedral that during our visit was about to host Pope Francis on his visit to the Baltic countries. The bell tower is detached from the main body and this is rather unusual, but the glance is spectacular!",
          "This cathedral is a must see when in Vilnius! It's the most important cathedral for Lithuania's Catholic population and the Chapel of St Kazimir is very impressive.",
          "It is a huge and imposing cathedral. The interior decorations are monumental and very impressive. And the chapel of Saint Casimir is breathtaking with the murals and the sculptures. If you are in Vilnius, then I would definitely recommend a visit here",
          "The cathedral imposes itself on a open area in the city center. Used as storage room under soviet occupation it has been restored to its original glory. Sometimes the underground area can be visited where you can see the foundations of the original Gothic building.",
          "We were lucky enough to wander into a wedding going on in this cathedral. It was nice to just sit quietly at the back and absorb the atmosphere.",
          "Monumental and breathtaking cathedral. White, clean walls don't distract you and lead straight to amazing chapel of Saint Casimir.",
          "This is a beautiful place in Vilnius but it is far more beautiful and impressive on the outside than it was on the inside. The inside was nice was we expected more. Be sure to find the tile marker between the cathedral and the tower outside and read the story behind it, very",
          "This is definitely my favorite place in town. The place invites you for just sit somewhere and stay for several minutes relaxing and enjoying the view, people passing by, practicing sports, kids playing around. Just grab a coffee and enjoy.",
          "Very nice place to grab a coffee and enjoy the people watching. Square was clean and the cathedral was beautiful",
          "This is a Vilnius landmark for sure, which sits at one end of the Old Town just as it meets the new at Gediminas Avenue. I was expecting more perhaps on the inside than was promised, being used to the older style Churches both at home and on the wider continent of Europe, but",
          "Amazing church with a great and long history, from the start through very hard periods for Lithuania. It is worth a visit for sure.",
          "If you are visiting Vilnius \u2014 this place is a must see. It is not only surrounded by great architecture but has loads of history to it. Plus it is just 5 minutes walk to Gedemino Tower. I would say that if you\u2019ve been to Vilnius and didn\u2019t visit this place \u2014- you haven\u2019t been",
          "A wonderful monument, the main part of the church is excellent, but the final chapel on the far right hand side is astonishing, and should not be missed.",
          "Vilnius Cathedral, located in the medieval part of the city, is the main Catholic Church of Lithuania .. It is dedicated to Saint Stanislaus and Saint Ladislas and has a chapel dedicated to Saint Casimir which is a place of pilgrimage of all the country and surrounding",
          "The cathedral is a lovely catholic cathedral, however it is maybe not as impressive as some of the baroque churches in Vilnius, Poland or Czechia. When we were there the exterior was being renovated for the visit of the Pope, so it had a lot of scaffolding up, but we could still",
          "The cathedral is still being restored and it is interesting to compare the areas that have been completed with those that are in progress. Do look in on St Casimir\u2019s chapel and note the lovely candlesticks with feet.",
          "Vilnius Cathedral (or if full the Cathedral Basilica of St Stanislaus and St Ladislaus of Vilnius) lords it over Cathedral Square. On our visit, the Classical Facade was festooned with scaffolding!. The Grand Dukes of Lithuania were crowned here, and their remains are buied",
          "First of all, I\u2019m not christian but was very nice to visit and it was really impressed. As usual, sunday was full of local and tourist. Right next to bell tower and located close to old town",
          "We recently visited this Cathedral while visiting Vilnius. The outside of the cathedral was being prepped for a visit by the Pope on 22-23 Sept 2018 so scaffolding was in front of the building. The interior was very spectacular. The bell tower just outside the front of the",
          "First day in vilnius, walking the town. Very cool and old school town. There is alot in walking distance to do and see. Get out and see all you can #porkmafia",
          "The church is very beautiful as it is being readied for Pope Francis' soon visit. I did not get to take the crypt tour which was only offered once, later in the day. I think I would have liked to taken that and I would plan accordingly if time allows.",
          "It is not exactly the regular architecture I would imagine for a cathedral, but it is quite stunning. The interior is simple, but memorable, the art is beautiful and on top of it all, my visit was accompanied by organ music. It's definitely worth checking out. No entrance fee",
          "Amazing catedra with a great story. I recommend to buy a excursion to undegrounds of Cathedral, tickets are cheap, especially if you also buy tickets to belfry Tower. Both will be cheaper and really worth attencion. Reccomend!",
          "This cathedral sits set back on the square and stands out. Incredibly beautiful baroque masterpiece. The bell tower is separate and makes it very unique",
          "Do not expect the richness in decor of central and Southern European churches. However, it is rich with history and the stark decor has its own charm and appeal. A must visit.",
          "The cathedral occupies the prime location in Vilnius, unsurprisingly. Its exterior is very classical and un-church-like. The interior is resplendent but, for me, not particularly exciting. Other visitors may feel differently",
          "The cathedral itself is beautiful, but its treasure is its crypt. Take the tour and see the Royal Mausoleum, see what the archaeologists have discovered, and see the original floor of the church.",
          "1st time visitor, killing some time, wondered over to have a closer look, I am not particularly interested in religious buildings, but this was not only impressive, fully in use, the art work inside was breathtaking",
          "This building is huge! Really, it's gigantic. You will be amazed at the sight of it, definitely worth a visit.",
          "Absolutely stunning Cathedral on the outside and beautiful inside, the square in which it sits is a great place to relax and close to a very nice park, a short walk from the river and for most people the entrance to the Old Town and it's many attractions, it was the first place",
          "This building is stunning, looks more like a museum or government building from the outside and the detached bell tower is unusual. I like that it is fronted by a big open plaza.The inside is well worth looking at, excellent sculptures and pictures",
          "This \"arch\"cathedral is a must see in Vilnius. The outside alone is impressive with beautiful columns and sculptures. Inside, in addition to the beautiful main altar it contains numerous chapels along the outside of the main hall including St. Casimir's at the front right which",
          "It's in the centre of the old city so easy to find and no entrance fee to get in. Ot the most impressive interior in comparison to the grand exterior. Photography is allowed inside. It's an active church so recommended to wear appropriately. If you have time to kill in Vilnius",
          "The cathedral is interesting as it has been rebuilt many times and therefore looks very modern . This is also the only cathedral which does not have the bell tower on top but at the side .",
          "A centre point of any tour of old town right beside the Bell tower which you can go up to view things and. Again a demonstation of the power of the church.",
          "A truly beautiful church with a light , airy feel. Magnificent sculptures and paintings and tomorrow we do a tour of the crypts under the church which holds the last resting place of some of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania.",
          "I have visited Vilnius for couple of days. This was one of the great places I have been, very nice and clean city. Definitely recommend it to anyone who travel alone or family and friends. can't wait to go back again.",
          "Our first day in Vilnius we visited the Cathedral. I was impressed with the structure, painting and history of the building. I came back to hear the organ recital. It was only 20 minutes and enjoyable. The whole area around the Cathedral is well worth walking round.",
          "An impressive cathedral that dominates the northern end of the Old City of Vilnius on the equally impressive Cathedral Square. The architecture mixes classical and baroque, with the St. Casimir Chapel (on the right, near the front of the church) being the most impressive part",
          "The Neo Classical style is good but the King's Chapel at the side rear of the Cathedral was locked/blocked when the refurbishment happened and fortunately missed out on a neo classical face lift. Makes this Cathedral different. Still impressive.",
          "Impressive large stark white building resembles a museum more that a cathedral. Inside the roof is grand with fine slight decoration, and you will find silver statues, marble carvings and frescoes. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.",
          "This is a pretty cathedral. The building outside is beautifully decorated. We only spent about 10 minutes here as not much to do once walked around inside.",
          "The place is nice, a good spot to take a couple pictures, behind it there are some restaurants and a touristic street.",
          "Lovely grand structure very impressive building inside and out. Free entry but you have to pay to visit the clock tower next to it.",
          "Very beauty cathedral, I think just Vilnius has cathedral like this, no countries have something like Vilnius cathedral. It also has a huge cathedral square. I should visit our cathedral in winter time, because in winter in cathedral square you can see Vilnius Christmas tree.",
          "While at the Cathedral, make sure to pay the 2 Euros to light up the church for 5 minutes- it makes a huge difference so you can see The White on white adornments and statues. Candles can be purchased for 50 cents as you enter. Do not miss the side altars.",
          "Very beautiful building. Very close to Gediminas tower. Very big square in front of the building. Also a park when you can have relax after visiting Old Town.",
          "The cathedral has become a major tourist attraction but it is so centrally located in the old town that I would say it\u2019s definitely worth a visit. They also offer crypt tours if interested",
          "Found it lovely on the outside a lot of detail of the saints all the way around cathedral but found the inside to be less inspiring and fairly plain. Definitely a newish build.",
          "Mass had just let out as we were arriving, so we only had about 15 minutes before the caretaker started locking the doors and prompting us to leave by the side door. The interior is not overwhelmingly decorated, which makes it more appealing. The organ is magnificently",
          "The organist was playing really strong powerful music while I was there. You can get a few nice photographs out of the visit.",
          "This cathedral is in daily use. It is so beautiful, particularly the small chapel of St Casimir in the corner. A guide showed us the crypts under the cathedral and I was prepared to be bored. This was fascinating hour visit. The stories of the royalty buried there, what they\u2019ve",
          "This is another great church. beautiful in side lots of painting and gold.. it is a land mark . good to visit",
          "Very beautiful cathedral in the absolute centre of the city. Outside is a large and beautiful square.",
          "Wonderful open light airy easy access right in one of the main square. You can easily hop over to whole town from this place",
          "The Cathedral and the Bell Tower along with the Cathedral Square together are a Photographers Delight Cathedral is beautiful in the inside as well as the Outside",
          "In the heart of the City a must visit. Did not get chance to do the crypt but if visiting again would try to add this.",
          "The most important building in Vilnius. Classical and actually very beautiful. Go inside, take some time to realy enjoy it. If you have spare time, buy tickets to go downstairs to see dungeons. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude09",
          "Very big cathedral, located at downtown. All the ways in Vilnius take you there! Easy to visit! Nothing special! From outside it is more impressive!!",
          "Huge building, very clean and extremely cold!! For those who pray is a nice church to go without cruel scenes such as typical Catholic churches!!",
          "I think that the cathedral is one of the most beautiful buildings in Vilna. I visited at night (just being outside) and I recommend it for sure!",
          "You should visit this cathedral. It has a long history very imortant for the inhabitants of Vilnius.",
          "Roman Catholic Cathedral is the highlight of the square. If you are looking for a bit of peace in addition to history, it is ideal to visit it in the morning.",
          "The Cathedral itself is impressive, with its strong neo classical design. The interior has a newness about it which is a reminder to the changing fortunes of the building in the last century. It is nice to spend some time outside too, as there is always people milling about!",
          "The cathedral is a modern rebuild, but is still very impressive brilliant white building. The outside is probably more impressive than the inside, but its still worth a visit.",
          "Very impressive building. The \"newest version\" of the cathedral, was built in the end of 18th century. Keeps a lot of secrets of Vilnius and gives possibility to discover part of it. The organ is also the masterpiece! If you're visiting the church during mess, you can listen",
          "Is of some think you have to visit in Vilnius... vilnius is too small town that you have not many things to see but this is one of the must",
          "The cathedral represents the centre of the Catholic faith in Lithuania and you can't miss it as it's one of Vilnius' most imposing buildings. it is also the resting place of the country's patron saint, St. Casimir. Constructed in 1783, the cathedral underwent a period of",
          "Authentic and with its soul. If you are in Vilnius - it is a must place you have to see. It is located in the heart of Vilnius so you'll find it easily.",
          "We went in 4 times during our stay in Vilnius. Very peaceful Cathedral. Busy with people for the Easter week. Take a tour of the crypts if you can - very interesting.",
          "Definitely worth having a look at. This big cathedral is beautiful on the outside as well as the inside. Entry is free.",
          "More attractive Outlook. It's a church, more or less the same as any other in the kind. As it's sort of landmark and it's free, no harm to visit once.",
          "The cathedral is very impressive from the outside and the inside is also magnificent with all those works of art.",
          "The cathedral looks very impressive form the outside but I found the inside a little disappointing. There is not a great deal to see, inside, although there is a small art gallery and St Casimir chapel. Around the outside of the cathedral there are lots of statues and sculptures",
          "The church isn't particularly interesting but the crypt tour is excellent. You learn the history of those buried below the cathedral and about the rebuilding.",
          "Didn't think this was the Cathedral we were advised to visit it looked more like a museum from the outside rather than a Cathedral. Once inside it was clearly a place of worship, it is quite beautiful so glad we went in.",
          "I went for Mass at the Vilnius Cathedral. It is a spectacular place of worship. The building was full for the 17:30 service, with standing room only available. Still, many worshipers joined throughout the entire time. I would encourage anyone to stop here.",
          "Lovely building, was fortunate enough to be there during St Casimirs weekend event with a lovely event into the late evening which anyone can appreciate",
          "The cathedral is a very impressive building in a great location. It's just at the bottom of pilles Street and a great place to start a walk around the old town.",
          "The cathedral is set in an open area ,opposite the old bell tower , the building offers a variety of different architecture",
          "The Cathedral is a big, huge, building which stand up fierce in the open square in the center area of Vilnius. It is not so old (in particular if compared to others church there) but sounds to be one of the main city attraction and building. It is a very \"minimalist\" and made of",
          "The St Casmier Chapel was beautiful. The rest was plain. Its worth a visit and free to enter so you have nothing to loose. Lots of art inside the main hall and lovely sculptures outside.",
          "Suppose to be a big attraction but nothing great inside compared to other churches in Vilnius. Exterior was great and got a long history.",
          "The current Vilnius Cathedral dates to 1783, but earlier churches on this site go back to 1400s. Survived Soviet occupation as an art gallery. The base of the Bell Tower was part of the original city wall. Bricks in the square show an outline of the wall's original location.",
          "Nice cathedral, not fancy and an interesting outside bell tower! Price rather expensive to climb up 4.5euros (for which you can dine in a restaurant here!). Try to get the combined ticket with the crypt (7\u20ac for both). Unfortunately the tours in English are only on Tuesday",
          "As a none believer this place carried nil spiritual impact for me but as a building it\u2019s worth stepping out of the cold and having a little wander around (for free) for a few minutes",
          "Looks more like a place but still has interesting interior. Free - worth getting a guide to get the details.",
          "its HUGE! so beautiful. the inside looks amazing and if you walk around the outside there are so many different statues acting our scenes.",
          "Make no mistake, this is a sacred place, a fully functioning Catholic Church. Its not as grand as some in the west, but well worth a visit. I read that it was only restored as a holy place in 1989 or thereabouts, before that when the Russians occupied, it was used as a warehouse",
          "Always visit religious places of worship anywhere in the World. I pray for World peace and the return of Middlesbrough FC to their rightful place in the Premiership. Have to say I was not wowed but in some ways was impressed by the understated nature of the Cathedral. Perhaps",
          "Visited on a day of worship, it was magical to hear the choir singing witht eh christmas decs still up.",
          "Every time I go there I light a candle. It is my tradition when I need to recharge my calmness. It helps",
          "This very large and rather sober cathedral has historical significance and it has been reconstructed several times. A good stop in your visit to Vilnius city centre",
          "I missed the usual stained glass windows of European cathedrals. The interior feels strangely remote. Some interesting art to be found.",
          "Rather new (200 years +) and not so embellished. Good organ (there are midday free concerts). Put attention to unusual and beautiful modern icons at the entrance",
          "A very nice place to visit and to meet new people ;) I would recommend to go up to a tower as-well, enjoyed it!",
          "We visited during the height of the Christmas market period and the place was lovely, especially with the most beautiful Christmas Tree in Europe. Lots of Christmas stalls set up for decorative and souvenier items, and local cuisine, mulled wine and coffee and chocolate drinks.",
          "A very beautiful cathedral in the heart of Vilnius next to the Xmas markets! We enjoyed looking inside some of it was breath taking! I\u2019d recommend a visit",
          "Beautiful architecture representing the most precious of places. This is a must see place for religious and non-religious people alike.",
          "One of the main sights in Vilnius, huge building and equally as impressive inside. centrally located in town nearby lots of other interesting and nice sights",
          "06 July, 2017. I had set out to explore the Old Town of Vilnius on foot, and high on my agenda was one of the most locatable images of Vilnius, simply known as the `Cathedral'. This place cannot be missed: though I had started my walk from the Gates of Dawn, I sent past the",
          "If you are visiting Vilnius, this is a place you must visit. It's big, glorious and great to photograph.",
          "Worth to get in and see. Really pretty both on the inside as on the outside. I entered during a church mass and was beautiful to watch",
          "Stunning on the outside, take a little time to go inside (free entry) for an oasis of calm in the city. The separate bell tower to the cathedral (admission fee applies) is well worth a visit for both the internal story and views from the top.",
          "The cathedral was only 400 metres from our hotel and sits at the end of the main road in the city centre. We first saw this at night and it looked stunning lit up. We went the following day to look again and it was then you could see the poor facade of the building; paint and",
          "It was located in the middle of the city, within walking distance from my hotel. The look was stunningly elegant. The lighting was good supporting the strong building.",
          "We attended a Lithuanian mass in the cathedral which is a lovely modern building with nice architecture. The plaza outside is open and airy and close to the main shopping area.",
          "When I visited Vilnius, I was really surprised to find such a massive Cathedral. The architecture and the materials used is typically to Catholic structures seen by the Mediterranean. The Cathedral leaves one breathless, it has the aura of something, a presence of greater power.",
          "A magnificent work of art both inside as well as on the outside. I wish I had had more time to admire the interior, as it is a home to many interesting paintings and sculptures. Hope to come back one day and spend more time there.",
          "White cathedral in Classical style of architecture just like a signature of this beautiful small balkan city. In the interior the style little bit in to Gothic but the Classical Roman church style is more dominating the structure. The Noah arks relief of the entrance and three",
          "Centrally situated and dominating the surrounding square. Rather austere interior. Worth quick visit but not really one of the highlights.",
          "Worth visit. Nice from outside and breathtaking from inside. Very well repaired building. Nice to have those monuments here.",
          "Amazing cathedral! So huge next to a tower and enormous plaza. Free of charge! Just walking around at outside there are sculptures of prists. Inside the church, high ceilings and paints. Impressive all over. Walking distance from old town and main shopping avenue.",
          "Vilnius Lithuania is also known as \"the city of churches\". The Vilnius Cathedral is the symbol of the city. I liked the design and the simple white color. It is quite unique with beautiful sculptures..",
          "A must see in Vilnius. Astonishing interior. When looking from the outside it doesn't look fantastic, but it is! Highly recommendable.",
          "Church dominating the area. Short visit inside is worth your time for its grandness even if few pieces of art to see.",
          "The cathedral is situated next to the former royal palace and used to have a connection between the two. The afternoon we were there there seemed to be continuous services taking place so entry to the cathedral was impossible and a great disappointment",
          "It is like visit card- face of Vilnius. Worth picture from outside, but inside nothing special. Sometimes on Sundays they have free cost concerts (sacred music afternoon).",
          "This is a very large cathedral which looks quite impressive from the outside but not that fantastic inside",
          "The Vilnius cathedral is very nice. Compared to most cathedrals, its beauty is in its simplicity- huge on the inside, it does not bombard the senses with so many icons, flags, statuary. Once inside, you sense the grandness of God.",
          "It is pretty from the outside, but really breathtaking on the inside. Be sure to look up! Also, make sure to look for the tile on the square outside markin the end of the \"Baltic Way\", the 675 km human chain of 2 million people formed in 1989 to protest Soviet occupation.",
          "I really nice place to visit when you're a tourist in Vilnius. Old relegious buildings like this cathedral are always so impressive.",
          "You must see the inside and the side altars in particular. Free to enter of course. Give yourself at least 30 minutes to take it in.",
          "This cathedral has a central location near the river and Old Town. It is situated in large square, and looks more like a palace or castle than a cathedral. It is interesting to wander about inside, as the side chapels are quite full of art and history,",
          "So rare to see a Christian cathedral built in the ancient Greek (that is, pagan) style. Still, it works -- the architecture is lofty and dignified. On the outside are sculptures of Biblical scenes. the interior has several ornate side-chapels worthy of exploration.",
          "Beautiful cathedral, huge imposing statues outside, an easy find for any tourist in the old town it's right in the main square",
          "This is the main Cathedral of Vilnius and main post card. So take your time to go inside and walk around the parks nearby.",

          "Big, clean and beautiful Cathedral of Vilnius, in the city centre - suggested to visit and to walk around it.",
          "A big cathedral right in the center of Vilnius oldtown that you can't miss. The main hall inside the cathedral is quite simple. But do visit the smaller sections on the side, as these rooms have great & detailed works that are just simply wonderful (and drastically different",
          "The front of the cathedral is dominated by large sculptures of apostles and Greek-style pillars. The main church is also interesting, but especially the little chapel towards the rear of the building",
          "This was our 4th visit to Vilnius and I always visit the Cathedral. Its beautiful inside and out. There is a plaque commemorating the visit and service said here by Pope John Paul 2 - the first Catholic pope to visit Vilnius. Look out as well for Miracle tile outside the main",
          "The locals feel very special about this place. It is a place of reverence and should be treated as such, as a place for prayer.",
          "It was a rainy day and we strolling to the tower, but found that it has been closed and go back to the square where found Cathedral. We came in, sat and filled so peaceful, so relaxed in this big monumental place that we wouldn't wanted to leave.",
          "Beautiful large cathedral set in a square with bell clock tower. Very impressive and great for a photo or two",
          "While exploring the city with my family it started pouring rain. We headed into the cathedral and enjoyed discovering the art and displays. Wish I could have stayed longer, but my four year old could only use her quiet voice for so long.",
          "It is presumed that the site of Vilnius Cathedral presumed to be originally built in 1251 is on a location of a pre-Christian times Baltic Pagan God Perkunas .The present Church structure was completed in 1783 and is of the Neoclassical style.The Coronation of the Grand Dukes",
          "The external views of the Cathedral are stunning especially in the sunlight with blue skies overhead. Inside the lofty white simplicity is beautiful and then contrasted with the rich dark ornate colours of St Casimir chapel. The history of this ancient meeting place originally",
          "A magnificent building, but not overly impressive inside. However worth a look if you come by the square.",
          "This magnificent building is very obvious and very difficult to avoid if you are in Vilnius. I recommend stopping by this place as the sheer size of it is impressive. I just spent a few minutes inside looking up and wandering about. The atmosphere is quiet and I recommend that",
          "This Cathedral is on the crossroad btw old town and the \"broadway\". Beautiful landmark, go inside not just pass, please",
          "Quite unlike any catholic cathedral I've ever visited but still worth a look. Lots of lovely artwork, huge ceilings, some lovely side altars and the Chapel of St casmir. Quiet place to sit and reflect",
          "This cathedral is absolutely enormous and has many interesting statues and other art work both on the outside and inside. It's hard to miss this place when you're visiting Vilnius.",

          "Wonderfull place you must visit in Vilnius. Very good atmosphere inside and outside, specifi good karma everywhere.",
          "Clearly lovingly maintained and actively used, the Cathedral look more like a Greek a Temple of Athena from the outside. Inside there are chapels, artwork, stained glass windows and many candles burning. Really a special spot. Be sure to visit the Chapel of St. Casimir.",
          "When I look back at our tour aside from the beauty and the grandeur of the place I think of babies in strollers. For sure the beauty is in the details and in the small side chapels. But also in the fact that is easily accessible by strollers. In many instances the churches have",
          "A surprising, majestic exterior (what is definitely an advantage) - and generally worthwhile square the Arkikatedra Bazilika is located in. I definitely have mixed feelings regarding the interiors. One can find some interesting detail for sure (I'd advise concentrating your",

          "Looking at the present Cathedral it is difficult to believe that this is one of the oldest worship places in the country, especially when counting the pagan shrine which existed in the same place before the first Romanic/Gothic Cathedral was built in the 13th century. The",
          "Beautiful building in the heart of Vilnius. Architectural gem with a classic Catholic church inside. Enjoy the walk and make sure you take some lovely photos !",
          "The cathedral is monumental on the outside and beautifully designed on the inside. Little bit different from other cathedrals because of a lot unique paintings and white walls",
          "The White Cathedral flanked by its towering detached belfry strikes an imposing figure in Vilnius. The interior is fairly austere save for the ornate Chapel dedicated to Saint Casimir (decorated in late XVIIth century). One of the landmarks of the city.",
          "Beautiful cathedral be sure to walk and see the side chapels as they are much more ornate. We learned a lot by taking the crypt tower and was worth our time. The guide was a historian and excellent! Buy tickets at the bell tower and only offered on certain days.",
          "One of the most iconic places in the city, and close to many of the other most popular sights. Inside they sell candles for lighting, and outside there is some kind of \u201cspecial tile\u201d in the pavement, where you can make a wish. If you like that sort of thing \u2013 or have children",
          "I just loved this place. All of the buildings are completely right and the huge expanse of ground around the cathedral just sets it off beautifully. I could have sat here for hours just watching. Do not miss this part of the old town whatever you do.",

          "The area around the cathedral, square, tower and palace as well as the Gediminas Castle which overlooks them all is a must see, a couple of hours wandering and finding out about some of the history is a great way to spend your time before checking out the shops along Gedimino Pl",

          "Cathedral Square is hard to miss now that they have added the three statues back onto the top of the cathedral (in 1995) and opened the bell tower for viewing adventures. In addition to the iconic cathedral, there is the statue of Gediminas and his horse (installed in 1996).",
          "A beautiful cathedral easy to find across from the Irish embassy. The bell tower is fantastic and the interior of the building stunning. Candles can be bought for 15 cents in shop inside Cathedral on the left.",
          "Our exceptionally good Vilnius Walking Tour guide explained the history of this cathedral, which is markedly more interesting than it looks today. Regularly damaged/destroyed over the years, remodelled in the 19th C in neo- Classical style, \"de-churched' by Communists under USSR",
          "a building that looks like a museum on the outside and also a lot like the town hall. spacious and airy, we visited the day before the beatification of a lithuanian archbishop, so there were a large number of pilgrims.",
          "I was impressed by the size, the situation (lots of space to get a good view of it), and the homogeneity of the building. Purely neo-classical, it looks like a modernized version of a Greek temple. Inside, it had the feeling of an art gallery, though some of the side chapels had",
          "The cathedral is very centrally located with large square alongside where locals come to meet and chat. Inside cathedral is as you would expect quite allowing thinking and reflection. Beautifully decorated. If you get chance take time to listen to the organ music being played",
          "The outside promises a great inside. However, the inside is rather dull. While in Vilnius, you might as well visit it.",
          "Standing in the square looking at this impressive cathedral with the sun shining directly on the facade you have almost to shade your eyes it is so bright .The bell tower itself is a magnificent structure and has been added to over the years seemingly at one time it was part of",
          "It is great to visit Vilnius Cathedral any time of the day, it is absolutely impressive. There are with many chapels, paintings, scuptures and cavings inside. Pope John Paul II visited this Cathedral in 1993 too. Amazing organ, you can find the schedule at the gate. Too bad",

          "St Stanislaus and St Vladislav is the main Roman Catholic Cathedral of Lithuania. Located in Vilnius Old Town, it's the centre of Catholic spiritual life in the country. Coronations took place here and, inside its crypts and catacombs are buried many famous and nobles people",
          "If you come on a Sunday, you will be treated to lovely choral music during the well-attended service. The interior is huge white and neo-classic. The Cazimir chapel has some unusual baroque frescoes that fly out of their designated frames.",
          "Unlike some other reviewers, I actually thought that the interior was lovely and tastefully done. If you are tired of the really ornate Orthodox cathedrals, this could be a nice change of pace. St. Casimir's chapel is a must see.",
          "good for a short visit, the place has a very interesting history, especially after the war, generally does not look like a standard Cathedral",
          "This cathedral is worth a visit but it's nice nearly as impressive as other cathedrals elsewhere. In a very large open square area just north of Old Town with the Palace of the Grand Dukes right behind it.",
          "This cathedral is a landmark for the city. I found the external part, especially the front, very interesting. Internally, it is very simple when compared with typical churches or cathedrals in cities all around central and western Europe. The area around is very interesting,",
          "The cathedral steeped in history. Beautiful architecture and well worth a tour round. Be sure not to miss the little church areas within the catherdral and maybe tour the crypt.",
          "Far less ornate than I am accustomed to so strolled around for 10 minutes and was done. Free to enter.",
          "One of the least interesting if most uninteresting cathedrals in Europe. This neoclassical building was rebuilt and little remains of the past. Scant historical value. The building just doesn't have any character or sense of place.",
          "Do not expect too much on historical and architecture values, you would have a wonderful time chilling with your accompanies. Remember to see underground chapels, bell tower, Stebuklas: the miracle stone",
          "When my heart is filled With everything, when I need some silent space, when I need to pray, when I want to overcome my fear.When I want to rest my eyes on somthing beautyful. Amacing building and area in Vilnius.",
          "A beautiful building reminiscent of classical temples the cathedral is best viewed by night. It's highlight is the facade, and Chapel of St Casimir on the far right inside the cathedral. The rococo chapel is not to be missed. Would recommend reading up on what the chapel",

          "Beautiful and unique neoclassical, late 18th century church built on the foundations of earlier cathedrals dating back to the 13th century. Wonderful light inside and very accessible.",
          "Not just a tourist attraction, the Cathedral and the square around it are a busy part of Vilnius. Plan an hour or two to visit and linger outside, specially if there's a concert or event during your visit. Not too different from lots of other roman catholic cathedral's around",
          "Would recommend - stumbled in there on \u00e1 walk in the old town and this is one of the most beautiful churches i've seen.",
          "It's one of a kind but nothing special about this Basilica. However it's still worth to visit while you're in Vilnius. All churches can't be the same when it comes to architectural design.",
          "Arkikatedra Bazilika is situated in the centre of Vilnius. It's one of the main attractions, built as pagan temple, latter converted to Catholic Church, nearby you can find small park where at certan place you can produce echo from your voice (must true, ask local for the certan",

          "A gorgeous square featuring an impressive belfry and beautiful cathedral buildings. The plaza has beautiful tile and one very special tile hidden between the main structures!",

          "Possibly the most famous building in Vilnius Old Town. It is very impressive from the outside. Its Tower sightly resembles the leaning tower of Pisa. The Tower itself is worth a walk up. The interior isn't as impressive as the St Peter & St Paul's church but it is still nice all",

          "a great place to see, quiet and lovely. Had a nice time there walking around, thinking, praying and enjoyed every minute",

          "We been down the cathedal where you can see the criptas ans the sarcofagh of the dukes. The guide was very nice and lots of stories! It took an hour and cost 4.5 euros. I recommend to see it at least once if you are interested in lithuanian history.",

          "The cathedral is very nice, both on the outside and the inside. Nice statues and it's nicely lit up in the evening. Inside no photos, but we chose to buy two very inexpensive candles and light them for passed family members. Beside the cathedral is the clock tower, also nice,",

          "The cathedral itself is impressive, as expected, but what really makes it is the crypt. Built originally on a pagan site, the hour tour through the crypt with a guide,who was enthusiastic and knowledgeable, taught me a lot about Lithuanian history as well as the history of the",

          "This cathedral is the nicest looking building in vilnius. It has been refurbished on the outside (pavement and building) Inside is very pretty and what you would expect from a cathedral.",
          "We visited and the outside of the Cathedral indeed has that wow factor. The inside however is dark and other than the ceiling it rather plain. Small windows large paintings hung on the walls. Interesting place.",
          "It reminds me of the one in Helsinki. Quite different from what we are used to. Inside it is not that special.",
          "Different to most cathedrals. More modern but with one older chapel which is just beautifully decorated.",
          "For the first date or for the next one-the best place. You are waiting near the clock , like always :)",
          "Located in the city centre. Nicely located on a big square. A big cathedral, most impressive on the outside. But a must see in Vilnius",

          "From the outside it looks spectacular especially next to the other local buildings and inside it is Interesting. Small chapels around the edges with their own altars paintings ornate ceilings. Sculptures. The crypt has tours I think at 4pm unfortunately we were later so it was",
          "A beautiful cathedral. Take some time to stop and admire both the outside and especially the inside.",
          "A very beautiful interior with lovely ceiling paintings. Surprisingly no admission fee and no sign of any donation boxes. Religious or not, well worth checking out.",
          "This square is very grand and lively. You will find the statue of the founder of Vilnius here. The view from the ruined tower on the top gives a magnificent view of the city centre. It is a must-see and the walking is not tough even though it looks a bit high.",
          "During my holiday in Lithuania last month i went to visit this interesting Cathedral which is huge, it is has extraordinary architecture and i also took the crypts excursion, it has really some interesting history this cathedral! This Cathedral is one of the main highlights in",

          "This is in the book '1,001 buildings you must see before you die' so it was a must-see for me. We climbed the bell tower first (separate from the main building), for great views over the city. We then entered the cathedral itself which in Communist times was converted to a",
          "The Roman Catholic cathedral of Vilnius is a modern building, built in neoclassic style. The inside is that a modern church, but there are many others in town which are much more interesting to visit. St Kasimir, the only Lithuanian saint, has his tomb there in one of the side",

          "A very beautiful Cathedral with a long and interesting history. Well worth a visit drinking in the quite solitude. The Chapel of St Casimir at the back to the left is very impressive. The black marble and silver statutes gives it a very different look. Take your time visiting.",

          "If you approach the Old Town of Vilnius from the Gediminas Avenue, the first thing you will see is the Cathedral with its belfry. It is a huge building, and its size is emphasized by the empty area that surrounds the Cathedral. However, size is the main quality of the Bazilika,",
          "I was part of a wedding here and was impressed. It was in one of the side chapels and is quite a site. Very ornate room and the details of the ceilings should not be missed. I was thrilled to be able to be more that a tourist here and the setting is quite elegant. Very",
          "This is an impressive church from the outside and also inside. We saw it from up in the Bell tower that provided great views. This is one of the best churches in Vilnius. It is also one end of the human chain that linked across the Baltic Nations protesting Soviet Rule that lead",

          "worth a quick visit even if you have little or no interest in churches, if you have the time and interest its easy to spend an hour or so looking around or saying a few prayers.",
          "I liked the simplicity of the cathedral from outside on the large, empty square, emphasized by the white colour. It looked majestic. Didn't have the chance to go inside.",
          "Neo-Classical design as opposed the the Baroque found in most of the major in Vilnous. Don't miss the chapel to the right of the altar, containing the sarcophagus of St. Casimir. The messenger from Rome confirming his sainthood went missing, and 150 years later the coffin was",

          "Cathedral is a place you will newer miss. Does not really matter what are you doing in Vilnius - you will at least pass it once. Cathedral is not a museum - it is a working church - so keep it in mind, when you are going to visit it.",

          "Situated in the heart of the city, in the middle of cathedral square, a beautiful and quiet stop off is a must when visiting this capital city. Visit in the daytime, but also at night to see the stunning white building all lit up. There are lots of works of art to admire when",
          "The cathedral construction dates back to the advent of Christianity in Lithuania. It went through several phases since its construction in the 13th century and re-construction over the centuries. Its current shape dates back to the 18th century. The white colour, even in its",

        "wiki": "Vilnius (Lithuanian pronunciation: [\u02c8v\u02b2\u026al\u02b2n\u02b2\u028as] (listen), see also other names) is the capital of Lithuania and its largest city, with a population of 580,020 as of 2020. The population of Vilnius's functional urban area, which stretches beyond the city limits, is estimated at 697,691 (as of 2017), while according to the Vilnius territorial health insurance fund, there were 728,032 permanent inhabitants as of December 2019 in Vilnius city and Vilnius district municipalities combined. Vilnius is in southeastern Lithuania and is the second-largest city in the Baltic states. It is the seat of Lithuania's national government and the Vilnius District Municipality.\nVilnius is classified as a Gamma global city according to GaWC studies, and is known for the architecture in its Old Town, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994. Before World War II, Vilnius was one of the largest Jewish centres in Europe. Its Jewish influence has led to its nickname \"the Jerusalem of Lithuania\". Napoleon called it \"the Jerusalem of the North\" as he was passing through in 1812. In 2009, Vilnius was the European Capital of Culture, together with Linz, Austria.\n\n\n== Etymology and other names ==\nThe name of the city originates from the Vilnia River, from the Lithuanian for surge. The city has also had many derivative spellings in various languages throughout its history: Vilna was once common in English. The most notable non-Lithuanian names for the city include Polish: Wilno, Belarusian: \u0412i\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044f (Vilnya), German: Wilna, Latvian: Vi\u013c\u0146a, Russian: \u0412\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430 (Vilna), Ukrainian: \u0412\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e (Vilno), Yiddish: \u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05dc\u05e0\u05e2\u200e (Vilne). A Russian name from the time of the Russian Empire was \u0412\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430 (Vilna), although \u0412\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044e\u0441 (Vilnyus) is now used. The names Wilno, Wilna and Vilna were also used in older English, German, French and Italian language publications when the city was one of the capitals of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and an important city in the Second Polish Republic. The name Vilna is still used in Finnish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Hebrew. Wilna is still used in German, along with Vilnius.\n\nThe neighborhoods of Vilnius also have names in other languages, which represent the languages spoken by various ethnic groups in the area.\nAccording to legend, Grand Duke Gediminas (c. 1275\u20131341) was hunting in the sacred forest near the Valley of \u0160ventaragis, near where Vilnia River flows into the Neris River. Tired after the successful hunt of a wisent, the Grand Duke settled in for the night. He fell soundly asleep and dreamed of a huge Iron Wolf standing on top a hill and howling as strong and loud as a hundred wolves. Upon awakening, the Duke asked the krivis (pagan priest) Lizdeika to interpret the dream. The priest told him, \"What is destined for the ruler and the State of Lithuania, is thus: the Iron Wolf represents a castle and a city which will be established by you on this site. This city will be the capital of the Lithuanian lands and the dwelling of their rulers, and the glory of their deeds shall echo throughout the world.\" Therefore, Gediminas, obeying the will of the gods, built the city, and gave it the name Vilnius, from the Vilnia River.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history and Grand Duchy of Lithuania ===\n\nHistorian Romas Bat\u016bra identifies the city with Voruta, one of the castles of Mindaugas, crowned in 1253 as King of Lithuania. During the reign of Grand Dukes Butvydas and Vytenis a city started to emerge from a trading settlement and the first Franciscan Catholic church was built.Vilnius is a historic and a present-day capital of Lithuania. Archeological findings indicate that this city was the capital of Lithuanian kingdom and later remained the capital of Lithuanian Grand Duchy continuously. Also later when Lithuania formed a dual confederation with Poland, Vilnius remained the capital of Lithuania.The city was first mentioned in written sources in 1323 as Vilna, when the Letters of Grand Duke Gediminas were sent to German cities inviting Germans (including German Jews) to settle in the capital city, as well as to Pope John XXII. These letters contain the first unambiguous reference to Vilnius as the capital; Old Trakai Castle had been the earlier seat of the court of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\n\nThe location of Vilnius offered practical advantages: it lay in the Lithuanian heartland at the confluence of two navigable rivers, surrounded by forests and wetlands that were difficult to penetrate. The duchy was continuously invaded by the Teutonic Knights. The future King of England Henry IV (then Henry Bolingbroke) spent a full year of 1390 supporting the unsuccessful siege of Vilnius by Teutonic Knights with his 300 fellow knights. During this campaign he bought captured Lithuanian women and children and took them back to K\u00f6nigsberg to be converted. King Henry's second expedition to Lithuania in 1392 illustrates the financial benefits to the Order of these guest crusaders. His small army consisted of over 100 men, including longbow archers and six minstrels, at a total cost to the Lancastrian purse of \u00a34,360. Despite the efforts of Bolingbroke and his English crusaders, two years of attacks on Vilnius proved fruitless.Vilnius was the flourishing capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the residence of the Grand Duke. Gediminas expanded the Grand Duchy through warfare along with strategic alliances and marriages. At its height it covered the territory of modern-day Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Transnistria, and portions of modern-day Poland and Russia. His grandchildren Vytautas the Great and Jogaila, however, fought civil wars. During the Lithuanian Civil War of 1389\u20131392, Vytautas besieged and razed the city in an attempt to wrest control from Jogaila. The two Gediminids cousins later settled their differences; after a series of treaties culminating in the 1569 Union of Lublin, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth was formed. The rulers of this federation held either or both of two titles: Grand Duke of Lithuania or King of Poland. In 1387, Jogaila acting as a Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o, granted Magdeburg rights to the city.\n\n\n=== Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth ===\n\nThe city underwent a period of expansion. The Vilnius city walls were built for protection between 1503 and 1522, comprising nine city gates and three towers, and Sigismund August moved his court there in 1544.\nIts growth was due in part to the establishment of Alma Academia et Universitas Vilnensis Societatis Iesu by the Polish King and Grand Duke of Lithuania Stefan Bathory in 1579. The university soon developed into one of the most important scientific and cultural centres of the region and the most notable scientific centre of the Commonwealth.During its rapid development, the city was open to migrants from the territories of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, Grand Duchy and further. A variety of languages were spoken: Polish, German, Yiddish, Ruthenian, Lithuanian, Russian, Old Church Slavonic, Latin, Hebrew, and Turkic languages; the city was compared to Babylon. Each group made its unique contribution to the life of the city, and crafts, trade, and science prospered.\nThe 17th century brought a number of setbacks. The Commonwealth was involved in a series of wars, collectively known as The Deluge. During the Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667), Vilnius was occupied by Russian forces; it was pillaged and burned, and its population was massacred. During the Great Northern War it was looted by the Swedish army. An outbreak of bubonic plague in 1710 killed about 35,000 residents; devastating fires occurred in 1715, 1737, 1741, 1748, and 1749. The city's growth lost its momentum for many years, but even despite this fact, at the end of the 18th century and before the Napoleon wars, Vilnius, with 56,000 inhabitants, entered the Russian Empire as its 3rd largest city.\n\n\n=== In the Russian Empire ===\n\nThe fortunes of the Commonwealth declined during the 18th century. Three partitions took place, dividing its territory among the Russian Empire, the Habsburg Empire, and the Kingdom of Prussia. Forces led by Jakub Jasi\u0144ski expelled Russians from Vilnius during the uprising in 1794. Although, after the third partition of April 1795, Vilnius was annexed by the Russian Empire and became the capital of the Vilna Governorate. During Russian rule, the city walls were destroyed, and by 1805 only the Gate of Dawn remained. In 1812, the city was taken by Napoleon on his push towards Moscow, and again during the disastrous retreat. The Grande Arm\u00e9e was welcomed in Vilnius. Thousands of soldiers died in the city during the eventual retreat; the mass graves were uncovered in 2002. Inhabitants expected Tsar Alexander I to grant them autonomy in response to Napoleon's promises to restore the Commonwealth, but Vilnius did not become autonomous, neither by itself nor as a part of Congress Poland.\n\nFollowing the November uprising in 1831, Vilnius University was closed and Russian repressions halted the further development of the city. Civil unrest in 1861 was suppressed by the Imperial Russian Army.During the January uprising in 1863, heavy fighting occurred within the city, but was brutally pacified by Mikhail Muravyov, nicknamed The Hangman by the population because of the number of executions he organized. After the uprising, all civil liberties were withdrawn, and use of the Polish and Lithuanian languages was banned. Vilnius had a vibrant Jewish population: according to Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 154,500, Jews constituted 64,000 (approximately 40%). During the early 20th century, the Lithuanian-speaking population of Vilnius constituted only a small minority, with Polish, Yiddish, and Russian speakers comprising the majority of the city's population.On 4\u20135 December 1905, the Great Seimas of Vilnius was held in the current Lithuanian National Philharmonic Society building with over 2000 participants. It was the first modern national congress in Lithuania. The assembly made the decision to demand wide political autonomy within the Russian Empire and achieve this by peaceful means. It is considered an important step towards the Act of Independence of Lithuania, adopted on 16 February 1918 by the Council of Lithuania, as the Seimas laid the groundwork for the establishment of an independent Lithuanian state.\n\n\n=== In Poland ===\n\nDuring World War I, Vilnius and the rest of Lithuania was occupied by the German Army from 1915 until 1918. The Act of Independence of Lithuania, declaring Lithuanian independence from any affiliation to any other nation, was issued in the city on 16 February 1918 with Vilnius as its capital. At the end of 1918 Soviet Russia invaded Lithuania with massive forces, and the Lithuanian Army withdrew from Vilnius to the center of the country in order to form a defense line. The German Army withdrew together with a Lithuanian government. Thus the city was briefly controlled by Polish self-defence units, to protect the city from the invaders, who were driven out by advancing Soviet forces. Vilnius changed hands again during the Polish\u2013Soviet War and the Lithuanian Wars of Independence: it was taken by the Polish Army, only to fall to Soviet forces again. Shortly after its defeat in the 1920 Battle of Warsaw, the retreating Red Army, in order to delay the Polish advance, ceded the city to Lithuania after signing the Soviet\u2013Lithuanian Peace Treaty on 12 July 1920.\n\nThe League of Nations became involved in the subsequent Lithuanian self defense from Poland after it attacked Lithuanian army positions in the south west part of Lithuania. The League brokered the ceasefire called the Suwa\u0142ki Agreement on 7 October 1920. Lithuanians believed that it stopped a Polish aggression. Although neither Vilnius or the surrounding region was explicitly addressed in the agreement, numerous historians have described the agreement as allotting Vilnius to Lithuania. On 9 October 1920, the Polish Army surreptitiously, under General Lucjan \u017beligowski, seized Vilnius during an operation known as \u017beligowski's Mutiny. The city and its surroundings were designated as a separate state, called the Republic of Central Lithuania. On 20 February 1922 after the highly contested election in Central Lithuania, the entire area was annexed by Poland, with the city becoming the capital of the Wilno Voivodship (Wilno being the name of Vilnius in Polish). Kaunas then became the temporary capital of Lithuania. Lithuania vigorously contested the Polish annexation of Vilnius, and refused diplomatic relations with Poland. The predominant languages of the city were still Polish and, to a lesser extent, Yiddish. The Lithuanian-speaking population at the time was a small minority, at about 6% of the city's population according even to contemporary Lithuanian sources. The Council of Ambassadors and the international community (with the exception of Lithuania) recognized Polish sovereignty over Vilnius Region in 1923.Vilnius University was reopened in 1919 under the name of Stefan Batory University. By 1931, the city had 195,000 inhabitants, making it the fifth largest city in Poland with varied industries, such as Elektrit, a factory that produced radio receivers.\nNazi Germany had invited Lithuania to join the Invasion of Poland and retake the historical capital Vilnius by force; however, President Antanas Smetona and most of the Lithuanian politicians declined this offer because they had doubts about Adolf Hitler's eventual victory and were outraged by the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania. Instead, they supported the neutrality policy and after being encouraged by the French and British diplomats \u2013 Lithuania had adopted the Neutrality Act, which was supported by all the political forces.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nWorld War II began with the German invasion of Poland in September 1939. The secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact had partitioned Lithuania and Poland into German and Soviet spheres of interest. On 19 September 1939, Vilnius was seized by the Soviet Union (which invaded Poland on 17 September). The Soviets repressed the local population and devastated city, moving values and factories to the USSR territory, including the major Polish radio factory Elektrit, along with a part of its labour force, to Minsk in Belarus SSR. The Soviets and Lithuania concluded a mutual assistance treaty on 10 October 1939, with which the Lithuanian government accepted the presence of Soviet military bases in various parts of the country. On 28 October 1939, the Red Army withdrew from the city to its suburbs (to Naujoji Vilnia) and Vilnius was given over to Lithuania. A Lithuanian Army parade took place on 29 October 1939 through the city centre. The Lithuanians immediately attempted to Lithuanize the city, for example by Lithuanizing Polish schools.Just after the beginning of the World War II, on 2 September 1939, the Lithuanian Consulate was opened in Vilnius. The consulate was the first in the world to grant Visas For Life for the Jews and also saved many Polish war refugees.The whole of Lithuania was annexed by the Soviet Union on 3 August 1940 following a June ultimatum from the Soviets demanding, among other things, that unspecified numbers of Red Army soldiers be allowed to enter the country for the purpose of helping to form a more pro-Soviet government. After the ultimatum was issued and Lithuania further occupied, a Soviet government was installed with Vilnius as the capital of the newly created Lithuanian SSR. Between 20,000 and 30,000 of the city's inhabitants were subsequently arrested by the NKVD and sent to gulags in the far eastern areas of the Soviet Union.\n\nOn 22 June 1941, the Germans launched Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union, while at the same time Lithuanians began the anti-Soviet June Uprising, organized by the Lithuanian Activist Front. Lithuanians proclaimed independence and organized the Provisional Government of Lithuania. This government quickly self-disbanded. Nazis captured Vilnius on 24 June 1941. Lithuania became part of the Reichskommissariat Ostland, German civil administration. Two ghettos were set up in the old town centre for the large Jewish population \u2013 the smaller one of which was \"liquidated\" by October. The larger ghetto lasted until 1943, though its population was regularly deported in roundups known as \"Aktionen\". A forced labour camp (Kailis) was also set up behind the Vilnius Town Hall as a factory to produce winter clothing for the Wehrmacht and another one later for vehicle repair (HKP 562) on 47 & 49 Suba\u010diaus Street. A failed ghetto uprising on 1 September 1943 organized by the Fareinigte Partizaner Organizacje (the United Partisan Organization, the first Jewish partisan unit in German-occupied Europe), was followed by the final destruction of the ghetto. During the Holocaust, about 95% of the 265,000-strong Jewish population of Lithuania was murdered by the German units and Lithuanian Nazi collaborators, many of them in Paneriai, about 10 km (6.2 mi) west of the old town centre (see the Ponary massacre).\nIn 1944, after the Nazis suffered losses in the Eastern Front and the Red Army was approaching, the Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force (LTDF) was established under the command of general Povilas Plechavi\u010dius. The LTDF mission was to defend the country within its borders against the Red Army and the Soviet partisans. On 1 April 1944, the LTDF battalions entered Vilnius and confronted the Armia Krajowa (AK), which attempted to capture the city before the Soviets (see Operation Ostra Brama). The AK tried to negotiate a non-aggression pact with Plechavi\u010dius, but the Lithuanian side demanded the Poles to abandon the Vilnius Region or subordinate themselves to Lithuanians. The 19 500 men LTDF disbanded itself after refusing to transcend the Lithuanian border and to aid the Nazis in the Eastern Front. Many of the former LTDF members later formed the core of the Lithuanian partisans (e.g., Jonas \u017demaitis).\n\n\n=== In the Lithuanian SSR (Soviet Union) ===\n\nIn July 1944, Vilnius was captured from the Germans by the Soviet Army (see Vilnius Offensive) and the town was once again incorporated into the Soviet Union as the capital of the Lithuanian SSR. The NKVD began repressions against the leaders of the Armia Krajowa and Lithuanians.The war had irreversibly altered the town \u2013 most of the predominantly Polish and Jewish population had been repatriated and exterminated respectively, during and after the German occupation. Some members of the intelligentsia and partisan members hiding in the forest were now targeted and deported to Siberia after the war. The majority of the remaining population was compelled to move to Communist Poland by 1946, and Sovietization began in earnest.\nFrom the late 1940s on Vilnius began to grow again, following an influx of Lithuanians, Poles and Belarusians from neighbouring regions within Lithuania as well as neighbouring region of Grodno and from other more remote areas of the Soviet Union (particularly Russia, Belarus and Ukraine). On the previously rural outskirts as well as in the very vicinity of the Old town (industrial zones in Paupys, Marku\u010diai, Naujamiestis), industrial areas were designed and large Soviet plants were built, following a program of industrialization.\nIn November 1980 the number of inhabitants of Vilnius exceeded 500,000. Because of shortage of housing for a growing population of the city, large scale Microdistricts (so-called sleeping districts) were built in the elderates of Antakalnis, \u017dirm\u016bnai, Lazdynai, Karolini\u0161k\u0117s, Vir\u0161uli\u0161k\u0117s, Baltupiai, Justini\u0161k\u0117s, Pa\u0161ilai\u010diai, Fabijoni\u0161k\u0117s and on a smaller scale in other parts of Vilnius. These were connected with the central part as well as with industrial areas via expressway-like streets (so-called fast traffic streets) and by public transport, noticeably extensive network of trolleybuses (from 1956).\n\n\n=== Independent Lithuania ===\n\nOn 11 March 1990, the Supreme Council of the Lithuanian SSR announced its secession from the Soviet Union and intention to restore an independent Republic of Lithuania. As a result of these declarations, on 9 January 1991, the Soviet Union sent in troops. This culminated in the 13 January attack on the State Radio and Television Building and the Vilnius TV Tower, killing at least fourteen civilians and seriously injuring 700 more. The Soviet Union finally recognised Lithuanian independence in September 1991. The current Constitution, as did the earlier Lithuanian Constitution of 1922, mentions that \"the capital of the State of Lithuania shall be the city of Vilnius, the long-standing historical capital of Lithuania\".\n\nVilnius has been rapidly transforming, emerging as a modern European city. The majority of its historical buildings during the last 25 years had been renovated, and a business and commercial area is being developed into the New City Centre, that is expected to become the city's main administrative and business district on the north side of the Neris river. This area includes modern residential and retail space, with the municipality building and the 148.3-metre (487 ft) Europa Tower as its most prominent buildings. The construction of Swedbank's headquarters is symbolic of the importance of Scandinavian banks in Vilnius. The building complex Vilnius Business Harbour was built in 2008, and one of its towers is now the 6th tallest building in Lithuania. More buildings are scheduled for construction in the area.\nMore than 75,000 new flats were built between 1995 and 2018 (including almost 50,000 new flats between 2003 and 2018), making Vilnius an absolute leader in construction sector in the Baltics of the last two decades. On average, 298,000-square-metre (3,210,000 sq ft) or 3,246 flats are built each year. In 2015, there were 225,871 units in Multi-family residentials and 20,578 flats in single-family or duplex apartment houses, the share of such housing increasing from 6.9% in 2006 to 8.3% in 2015.Vilnius was selected as a 2009 European Capital of Culture, along with Linz, the capital of Upper Austria. Its 2009 New Year's Eve celebration, marking the event, featured a light show said to be \"visible from outer space\". In preparation, the historical centre of the city was restored, and its main monuments were renovated.The global economic crisis led to a drop in tourism which prevented many of the projects from reaching their planned extent, and allegations of corruption and incompetence were made against the organisers, while tax increases for cultural activity led to public protests and the general economic conditions sparked riots. In 2015 Remigijus \u0160ima\u0161ius became the first directly elected mayor of the city.On 28\u201329 November 2013, Vilnius hosted the Eastern Partnership Summit in the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania. Many European presidents, prime ministers and other high-ranking officials participated in the event. On 29 November 2013, Georgia and Moldova signed association and free trade agreements with the European Union. Previously, Ukraine and Armenia were also expected to sign the agreements but postponed the decision, sparking large protests in Ukraine.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nVilnius is situated in south-eastern Lithuania (54\u00b041\u2032N 25\u00b017\u2032E) at the confluence of the Vilnia and Neris Rivers.\nMultiple countries claims that the Geographical Centre of Europe is located in their territories, however the only location with recognition in the Guinness Book of World Records is located near Vilnius. After a re-estimation of the boundaries of the continent of Europe in 1989, Jean-George Affholder, a scientist at the Institut G\u00e9ographique National (French National Geographic Institute) determined that the geographic centre of Europe is located at 54\u00b054\u2032N 25\u00b019\u2032E. The method used for calculating this point was that of the centre of gravity of the geometrical figure of Europe. This point is located in Lithuania, near the village of Girija (26 kilometres from Vilnius). A monument, composed by the sculptor Gediminas Jok\u016bbonis and consisting of a column of white granite surmounted by a crown of stars, was erected at the location in 2004.Vilnius lies 312 km (194 mi) from the Baltic Sea and Klaip\u0117da, the chief Lithuanian seaport. Vilnius is connected by highways to other major Lithuanian cities, such as Kaunas (102 km or 63 mi away), \u0160iauliai (214 km or 133 mi away) and Panev\u0117\u017eys (135 km or 84 mi away).\nThe current area of Vilnius is 402 square kilometres (155 sq mi). Buildings occupy 29.1% of the city; green spaces occupy 68.8%; and waters occupy 2.1%.\n\n\n=== Nature reserves ===\nVilnius has eight protected nature reserves: Vok\u0117s Sensl\u0117nio Slopes Geomorphological Reserve, Auk\u0161tagiris Geomorphological Reserve, Valakupi\u0173 Klonio Geomorphological Reserve, Ver\u017euva Hydrographic Reserve, Vok\u0117 Hydrographic Reserve, Cedronas Upstream Landscape Reserve, Tapeliai Landscape Reserve, \u0160e\u0161kin\u0117 Slopes Geomorphological Reserve.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThe climate of Vilnius is humid continental (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfb). Temperature records have been kept since 1777. The average annual temperature is 6.7 \u00b0C (44 \u00b0F); in January the average temperature is \u22124.3 \u00b0C (24 \u00b0F), in July it is 18.1 \u00b0C (65 \u00b0F). The average precipitation is about 682 millimetres (26.85 in) per year. Average annual temperatures in the city have increased significantly during the last 30 years, a change which the Lithuanian Hydrometeorological Service attributes to global warming induced by human activities.Summer days are pleasantly warm and sometimes hot, especially in July and August, with temperatures above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) throughout the day during periodic heat waves. Night-life in Vilnius is in full swing at this time of year, and outdoor bars, restaurants and caf\u00e9s become very popular during the daytime.\nWinters can be very cold, with temperatures rarely reaching above freezing \u2013 temperatures below \u221225 \u00b0C (\u221213 \u00b0F) are not unheard-of in January and February. Vilnius's rivers freeze over in particularly cold winters, and the lakes surrounding the city are almost always permanently frozen during this time of year. A popular pastime is ice-fishing.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Painting and sculpture ===\n\nFor centuries, Vilnius as a capital city was an art centre of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and has attracted artists from all across Europe. The oldest works of art which remained from the early Gothic period (14th century) are paintings dedicated to churches and liturgy (e.g., frescoes in the Crypts of Vilnius Cathedral, decorated hymns books). Walls paintings from the 16th centuries were also discovered in Vilnius (e.g., painting of the Church of St. Francis and St. Bernard vaults or in the Church of Saint Nicholas). Gothic wooden, mostly polychrome sculptures were used to decorate the altars of the churches of Vilnius. Some Gothic seals from the 14\u201315th centuries remained till the nowadays (K\u0119stutis, Vytautas the Great, Sigismund II Augustus).In the early 16th century, the Renaissance sculptures appeared, which were mostly created by Italian sculptors: Bernardinus Zanobi da Gianotti, Giovani Cini, Giovanni Maria Padovano. In the Renaissance period, portrait tombstones and medals were highly valued (e.g., marle tomb of Albertas Go\u0161tautas, 1548, by B. Z. da Gianotti, tomb of Povilas Al\u0161\u0117ni\u0161kis, 1555, by G. Cini, both located in the Vilnius Cathedral). The works of Italian sculptors are characterized by a naturalistic treatment of forms, precise proportions, tectonicity, a realistic representation of the deceased. The local sculptors took over only the iconographic scheme of the Renaissance tomb; their works (e.g., tomb of Lew Sapieha, ca. 1633, at Church of St. Michael) are characterized by conditionality of forms, stylization. During this period local and Western European painters created religious, mythologic compositions, portraits, which were intertwined with late Gothic and Baroque features. Illustrated prayer books illustrations and miniatures have survived.The Baroque period which began in the late 16th century was exceptional for Vilnius as wall painting blossomed in the city. Most of the palaces and churches were decorated with frescoes characterized by bright colors, sophisticated angles and dramatism style. Also during this period the secular painting spread \u2013 representational, imaginative, epitaph portraits, scenes of battles, politically important events. It is characterized by detailed realistic style. This period sculptures dominated in the sacred architecture (tombstones with sculptural portraits, exterior and interior decorative sculptures), made of wood, marble and stucco. Italian sculptors (e.g., G. P. Perti, G. M. Galli, A. S. Capone) were exceptionally important in the 17th century Grand Duchy's sculptures development and were invited there by the Lithuanian nobility. Their works are characterized by the features of mature baroque: expressiveness of forms, sensuality, atectonic composition (e.g., sculptural decor of the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul). The local sculptors emphasized the decorative features of the baroque, and the expressiveness and emotionality of the baroque was less characteristic in their works.\n\nAt the late 18th and 19th centuries, the Lithuanian painting was largely influenced by the Vilnius Art School which introduced manifestations of Classicism art and later of Romanticism art. The painters had internships abroad, mainly in Italy. Painting of allegorical, mythological compositions, landscapes, portraits of representatives of various circles of society was begun; historical themes prevailed. The most famous Classicism painters from this time are Pranci\u0161kus Smuglevi\u010dius, Jan Rustem, Juozapas Ole\u0161kevi\u010dius, Danielius Kondratavi\u010dius, Juozapas Pe\u0161ka, Vincentas Smakauskas. While the Romanticism art is characterized by Jan Rustem, Jonas Damelis, Vincentas Dmachauskas, Kanutas Ruseckas works. After the closure of Vilnius University in 1832, the artistic direction formed by the representatives of the Vilnius Art School influenced the further development of Lithuanian art.Development of art in the first half of the 20th century was promoted by activities and exhibitions of the Lithuanian Art Society, established in 1907 by Petras Rim\u0161a, Antanas \u017dmuidzinavi\u010dius, Antanas Jaro\u0161evi\u010dius, and Vilnius Art Society, established in 1908. This period is characterized by Jonas \u0160ileika, Justinas Vieno\u017einskis, Jonas Mackevi\u010dius, Vytautas Kairi\u016bk\u0161tis, Vytautas Pranas Bi\u010di\u016bnas works. They continued the traditions of Western European styles (symbolism, realism, art nouveau) and followed the modernism art directions. Although, after the World War II the method of socialist realism was introduced \u2013 propaganda paintings, compositions of historical, household genre, still lifes, landscapes, portraits and sculptures.The most notable late 20th and 21st centuries Vilnian painters are \u017dygimantas Augustinas, Egl\u0117 Ridikait\u0117, Egl\u0117 Gineityt\u0117, Patricija Jurk\u0161aityt\u0117, Jurga Barilait\u0117, Solomonas Teitelbaumas.\n\nMany prominent art galleries are located in Vilnius. Lithuania's largest art collection is housed in the Lithuanian Art Museum. One branch of it, the Vilnius Picture Gallery in the Old Town, houses a collection of Lithuanian art from the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century. On the other side of the Neris, the National Art Gallery holds a permanent exhibition on Lithuanian 20th-century art, as well as numerous exhibitions on modern art. The Contemporary Art Centre is the largest venue for contemporary art in the Baltic States, with an exhibition space of 2400 square meters. The Centre is a non-collection based institution committed to developing a broad range of international and Lithuanian exhibition projects as well as presenting a wide range of public programmes including lectures, seminars, performances, film and video screenings, and live new music events. On 10 November 2007, the Jonas Mekas Visual Arts Center was opened by avant-garde filmmaker Jonas Mekas with its premiere exhibition entitled The Avant-Garde: From Futurism to Fluxus. In 2018, the MO Museum was opened and is a personal initiative of Lithuanian scientists and philanthropists Danguol\u0117 and Viktoras Butkus. Its collection of 5000 modern and contemporary pieces contains major Lithuanian artworks from the 1950s to this day.The U\u017eupis district near the Old Town, which used to be one of the more run-down districts of Vilnius during the Soviet era, is home to a movement of bohemian artists, who operate numerous art galleries and workshops. U\u017eupis declared itself an independent republic on April Fool's Day in 1997. In the main square, the statue of an angel blowing a trumpet stands as a symbol of artistic freedom.\nIn 1995, the world's first bronze cast of Frank Zappa was installed in the Naujamiestis district with the permission of the government. The Frank Zappa sculpture confirmed the newly found freedom of expression and marked the beginning of a new era for Lithuanian society.\nIn 2015, the project of Vilnius Talking Statues was realized. Currently, 18 statues around Vilnius interact with visitors in multiple languages by a simple telephone call to a smartphone.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nAbout 1520, Francysk Skaryna, who is the author of the first Ruthenian Bible, established a printing house in Vilnius \u2013 the first in Eastern Europe. In 1522, he prepared and published the first printed book of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, titled the Little Traveller's Book (Ruthenian language: \u041c\u0430\u043b\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0436\u043a\u0430). In 1525 he printed the Acts and Epistles of the Apostles (the Apostle).The Vilnius Academy Press was established in 1575 by the Lithuanian noble Miko\u0142aj Krzysztof \"the Orphan\" Radziwi\u0142\u0142 as the printing house of the Vilnius Academy. He delegated the management of the printing house to the Jesuits. In May 1576, it published its first book Pro Sacratissima Eucharistia contra haeresim Zwinglianam by Piotr Skarga. The Vilnius Academy Press situation was exceptional because its activities were funded by the secular society, the Lithuanian nobility and the Church. In 1805, J\u00f3zef Zawadzki bought the Vilnius Academy Press and founded the J\u00f3zef Zawadzki printing shop which continuously worked till 1939 and published books in multiple languages. The first poetry book of Adam Mickiewicz was published there in 1822.\n\nOne of the creators of Lithuanian writing, Mikalojus Dauk\u0161a, translated and published the Catechism by Spanish Jesuit theologist Jacobo Ledesma in 1595 \u2013 this was the first printed Lithuanian language book in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He also translated and published the Jakub Wujek's Postilla Catholica in 1599 (both in Vilnius).\n\nMany famous writers were born, lived in Vilnius or are alumnus of the Vilnius University (e.g., Konstantinas Sirvydas, Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski, Antoni Gorecki, J\u00f3zef Ignacy Kraszewski, Antoni Edward Odyniec, Micha\u0142 J\u00f3zef R\u00f6mer, Adam Mickiewicz, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Syrokomla, J\u00f3zef Mackiewicz, Romain Gary, Juliusz S\u0142owacki, Simonas Daukantas, Mykolas Bir\u017ei\u0161ka, Kazys Brad\u016bnas, Nobel prize-winner Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, Jurga Ivanauskait\u0117).The first consideration of the First Statute of Lithuania took place in 1522 at the Seimas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in Vilnius. The Statute of Lithuania has been drafted under the guidance of Grand Chancellor of Lithuania Albertas Go\u0161tautas and in accordance with the courts' jurisprudence formed by customary law, Heads of State legislation on certain matters and by the provisions of the canon law and Roman law regulations. It is the first official codification of this kind of secular law in Europe.Lithuanian nationalist Albertas Go\u0161tautas actively supported the Lithuanian language usage in the Lithuanian literature and protected Lithuanian authors, including Abraomas Kulvietis and Michael the Lithuanian, who criticised the usage of Ruthenian language and called Ruthenians as the Muscovian spies in his book De moribus tartarorum, lituanorum et moscorum.Since the 16th century, the Lithuanian Metrica was kept at the Lower Castle and safeguarded by the State Chancellor. Due to the deterioration of the books, the State Grand Chancellor, Lew Sapieha, ordered the volumes of the Metrica to be recopied in 1594. The recopying process continued until 1607. The newly recopied books were inventoried, rechecked, and transferred to a separate building in Vilnius, with the older books remaining in the Castle of Vilnius. According to the 1983 data, 665 books have remained till the nowadays and their microfilms are preserved at the Lithuanian State Historical Archives in Vilnius.Over 200 tiles and commemorative plaques to writers, who have lived and worked in Vilnius, and foreign authors, who have shared a connection with Vilnius and Lithuania, adorn walls on Literat\u0173 Street (Lithuanian: Literat\u0173 gatv\u0117) in the Old Town, presenting a broad overview of the history of Lithuanian literature.The Institute of Lithuanian Literature and Folklore and the Lithuanian Writers' Union are located in Vilnius.The biggest book fair in Baltic states is annually held in Vilnius at LITEXPO, the Baltic's biggest exhibition centre.\n\n\n=== Cinema ===\n\nThe very first public film session in Vilnius was held in the Botanical Garden (now Bernardinai Garden) in the summer of 1897. It is notable that such an event was held in Vilnius soon after the very first film sessions in the world by Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re, who held it in Paris in 1895. Vilnius film session also showed the Lumi\u00e8re brothers documentary movies. Firstly shown movies were educational and were filmed in exotic locations (e.g., India, Africa) and introduced different cultures to Vilnians, who enjoyed the movies because very few were able to visit such far places. Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s' movie A Trip to the Moon was first shown in the non-stationary Luki\u0161k\u0117s Square movie theater in 1902 and was the first feature film shown in Vilnius.\n\nFirst stationary movie theater in Vilnius was opened in 1905 and was called Iliuzija (English: Illusion) and was located in Did\u017eioji Street 60. First movie theaters reminded theatres buildings and had boxes with more expensive tickets. Also, because there was no sound in the first movies, the sessions had a live orchestral or musicians performances. On stage, cinema screening was sometimes mixed with theatrical performances, illusion shows.On 4 June 1924, Vilnius Magistrate established a popular 1,200-seat movie theater in the city hall, which in Polish was called Miejski kinematograf (English: City Movie Theater). The purpose of this cinema was to provide cultural education for students and adults. The popularity of this cinema is evidenced by the numbers of viewers in 1926: 502 261 tickets were sold, 24 242 tickets were given free to boarding children, 778 to Vilnius guests and 8385 to soldiers. In 1939, the Lithuanian authorities renamed it to Milda. In 1940, the last city government handed over the premises to the People's Commissariat of Education, which established a Lithuanian National Philharmonic Society there.In 1965, the most modern movie theater in Lithuania called Lietuva was opened in Vilnius, which annually had over 1.84 million visitors and profit of over 1 million Soviet rubles. After the reconstruction, it had one of the largest screens in Europe (200 square metres). Though, it was closed in 2002, demolished in 2017 and the MO Museum was built instead of it.Vilnius Film Festival Kino Pavasaris is the biggest and most important cinema event in Lithuania with international guests and thousands of visitors.Lithuanian Film Centre (Lithuanian: Lietuvos kino centras), which main task is to promote the development and competitiveness of the Lithuanian film industry, headquarters are in Vilnius.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nIt is well known, that musicians were presented at Ducal court in Vilnius as early as the 14th century as various historical sources mention. In the 16th century Vilnius for some time in their lives was a hometown of composer Wac\u0142aw of Szamotu\u0142y, lutenist virtuoso B\u00e1lint Bakfark, composer Jan Brant. The first textbook of music in Lithuania \u2013 The Art and Practice of Music (Latin: Ars et praxis musica) was issued in Vilnius by \u017dygimantas Liauksminas in 1667.Italian artists organized the first opera in Lithuania on 4 September 1636 at the Palace of the Grand Dukes by the order of Grand Duke W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa. Currently, operas are staged at the Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre and also by independent troupe Vilnius City Opera.The Lithuanian National Philharmonic Society is the largest and oldest state owned concert organization in Lithuania, whose main activity is to organise and coordinate live concerts, diverse classical/classical contemporary/jazz music events and tours throughout Lithuania and abroad. The Lithuanian State Symphony Orchestra, founded by Gintaras Rinkevi\u010dius, every year builds up a wide-ranging repertoire, introduces exceptional programs, and invites young talent to perform along with recognized soloists.\n\nIn Lithuania, choral music is very important. Vilnius is the only city with three choirs laureates (Brevis, Jauna Muzika and Chamber Choir of the Conservatoire) at the European Grand Prix for Choral Singing. There is a long-standing tradition of the Dain\u0173 \u0161vent\u0117 (Lithuanian Song and Dance Festival). Since 1990, the festival has been organised every four years and summons roughly 30,000 singers and folk dancers of various professional levels and age groups from across the country in Vingis Park. In 2008, Lithuanian Song and Dance Festival together with its Latvian and Estonian versions was inscribed as UNESCO Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.\n\nJazz scene was active even during the years of Soviet occupation. The real breakthrough would occur in 1970\u201371 with the coming together of the Ganelin/Tarasov/Chekasin trio, the alleged instigators of the Vilnius Jazz School. Most known annual event of jazz in the city is the Vilnius Jazz Festival.\nGatv\u0117s muzikos diena (Street Music Day) gathers musicians of various genres annually in the streets of Vilnius.Vilnius is the birthplace of many prominent music personalities: singers (e.g., Mariana Korvelyt\u0117 \u2013 Moravskien\u0117, Paulina Rivoli, Danielius Dolskis, Vytautas Kernagis, Algirdas Kau\u0161p\u0117das, Andrius Mamontovas, Nomeda Kazlaus, Asmik Grigorian), composers (e.g., C\u00e9sar Cui, Felix Yaniewicz, Maximilian Steinberg, Vytautas Mi\u0161kinis, Onut\u0117 Narbutait\u0117), conductors (e.g., Mirga Gra\u017einyt\u0117-Tyla), musicians (e.g., Antoni Radziwi\u0142\u0142, Jascha Heifetz, Clara Rockmore, Romas Lileikis).\nVilnius was a hometown of such 18th century composers as Micha\u0142 Kazimierz Ogi\u0144ski, Johann David Holland (colleague of C. Bach), Maciej Radziwi\u0142\u0142, Micha\u0142 Kleofas Ogi\u0144ski. 19th century Vilnius was famous for such European scale performers as singer Kristina Gerhardi Frank \u2013 a close friend of Mozart and Haydn (performed the main part at the premiere of The Creation by the latter), guitarist-virtuoso Marek Konrad Soko\u0142owski, recognized as the best guitarist in Europe in the mid-19th century, composer Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko \u2013 \"the father of Polish national opera\". The wealthiest woman in the early 19th century Vilnius was singer Maria de Neri. In the early 20th century, Vilnius was a hometown of Mikalojus Konstantinas \u010ciurlionis. Musicians of late 20th and early 21st centuries include Vyacheslav Ganelin, Petras Vy\u0161niauskas, Petras Geniu\u0161as, M\u016bza Rubackyt\u0117, Alanas Cho\u0161nau, Marijonas Mikutavi\u010dius.\nLithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre is headquartered in Gediminas Avenue and also has its department at the Slushko Palace in Antakalnis. Many accomplished singers lectured at the Academy, including internationally famous tenors Kipras Petrauskas and Virgilijus Noreika.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nLithuanian Grand Dukes' entertainment at the castle, ruler's visits abroad and the honorable guests' arrival meetings etiquette had theatrical elements already since the 14th century (e.g., musicians' chapels of Gediminas and W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o). During the period of Sigismund III Vasa's residence in Vilnius (first half of the 17th century), English professional drama actors' troupes played in the royal manor. In 1635, W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa established a professional opera theatre in the Lower Castle, where dramma per musica genre productions were performed with operas' librettos being written by Italian Virgilio Puccitelli. The performances were characterized by fundamental, luxurious scenography.In 16\u201318th centuries there was a Jesuit's School Theatre in Lithuania. In 1570, the first performance was shown in Vilnius (comedy Hercules by S. Tucci). Baroque aesthetics prevailed in the Jesuit's School Theatre, but it also had Middle Ages retrospectives, Renaissance elements, Rococo motifs, and served an educational function. The performances were played in Latin, however elements of the Lithuanian language were also included in intermediates and prologues, and some of the works were Lithuanian themed (e.g., plays dedicated to Algirdas, Mindaugas, Vytautas and other rulers of Lithuania).In 1785, Wojciech Bogus\u0142awski established the city's first public theatre Vilnius City Theatre. The theatre was initially located in the Oskierka Palace, but later moved to the Radziwi\u0142\u0142 Palace and the Vilnius Town Hall. Until 1845 the plays were performed in Polish, from 1845 in Polish and Russian and from 1864 only in Russian. After the ban on the Lithuanian language was lifted, the plays were also performed in Lithuanian. The theatre ceased to exist in 1914.\n\nDuring the interwar, then part of Poland, Vilnius was famous for the most modern in the region experimental Reduta troupe and institute, led by Juliusz Osterwa. In Vilnius and the Vilnius Region, the performances by the Vilnius Lithuanian Stage Amateur Company (Lithuanian: Vilniaus lietuvi\u0173 scenos m\u0117g\u0117j\u0173 kuopa), established in 1930 (later it was renamed to Vilnius' Lithuanian Theatre; professional theatre Vaidila), were shown. In 1945, it was merged to the Lithuanian National Drama Theatre.After the USSR occupation of Lithuania in 1940, theatre became one of the means of disseminating the Soviet ideology and censorship of repertoires was introduced. The performances incorporated the principles of socialist realism and a number of revolutionary plays were staged by the Russian authors. A Repertory Commission was established under the Ministry of Culture to direct theatres, control their repertoires, grant permissions to perform or ban performances. Socialist realism was the only recognized direction.After the restoration of independence of Lithuania, theatre changed cardinally and sought to recreate a broken dialogue with spectators. Vilnius City Opera, an independent opera theatre in Vilnius, blends classical with contemporary art. While the Lithuanian National Drama Theatre, State Small Theatre of Vilnius, State Youth Theatre and a number of private theatre companies, including OKT / Vilnius City Theatre, An\u017eelika Cholina Dance Theatre and others, show classical, modern and Lithuanian playwriting directed by world-known Lithuanian and foreign directors. There also is a Russian language theatre Russian Drama Theatre of Lithuania.\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\nAs a historically multicultural capital, many languages statuses changed over the centuries in the history of Vilnius. The predominant language of public life in medieval Lithuania was Lithuanian language. It was spoken by people living in the ethnopolitical center of the state \u2013 ethnic Lithuania, including the ruler's manor and the most prominent Lithuanian nobility. However, the Lithuanian language had no literary traditions and was not used in writing, except for the most important religious texts (e.g., the Lord's and the Hail Mary prayers). Although, the importance of the spoken Lithuanian language remained for centuries because it is known that even Vytautas the Great himself knew and spoke in the Lithuanian language with W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o, whose son Casimir IV Jagiellon also spoke in the Lithuanian language.Ruthenian language was used in Lithuania and its capital Vilnius due to the incorporation of the Kievan Rus' lands. In colloquial form, these dialects formed the basis of the Ukrainian and Byelorussian languages in the 19th century. The written form of the Ruthenian language formed from the interaction of the ancient Slavic language with the local elements of the Ruthenian language. Such a Ruthenian language became the main language of the Chancery of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 14th and 15th centuries and maintained its dominant position until the middle of the 17th century.Latin and Polish languages were also widely used in the Chancery of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In the second part of the 17th century, the Polish language ousted the Ruthenian language from the written sources and the Lithuanian language from most areas of the public life. The first state documents in the Lithuanian language appeared in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania only at the very end of its existence (e.g., Constitution of 3 May 1791 and the Great Sejm Lithuanian manuscripts, Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising Lithuanian notes).Minorities (e.g., Lithuanian Jews, Lipka Tatars, Crimean Karaites) were under guardianship of the Grand Duke of Lithuania, but their languages were only used among themselves and never gained a significant role. The 2nd and 3rd Statutes of Lithuania consolidated Lithuanian Jews status as non-Christian and \"common human\" (non-noble).According to the 14th article of the modern Constitution of Lithuania, the Lithuanian language is the only official language in the state. Therefore, all the official procedures in Vilnius must be proceeded in the Lithuanian language, however the interpreter assistance is guaranteed by the state in some cases.Lithuanians speak on average of 2.7 languages, and 97.3% of the population speaks at least one foreign language.\n\n\n=== Fashion ===\n\nIt is known that the Vilnians enjoyed to expensively dress up already since the Middle Ages. According to historian Antanas \u010caplinskas, even the merchants and craftsmen wives were wearing multiple rings decorated with gemstones (e.g., with ruby and fourteen diamonds). Those who did not dress up and did not followed the fashion trends were even ridiculed (e.g., for wearing sheepskins, for not wearing luxurious belts, gloves, or for not using handkerchiefs). Property inventories of 16th\u201317th centuries often mention expensive clothing, such as long, wide-sleeved jackets of precious materials, known as kontusz, and \u017cupans decorated with lynx's or other animal fur, also kontush belts. Special attention was paid to the buttons as in the list of one nobleman's property \u010caplinskas found 12 buttons with pearls and corals, about 100 large buttons with diamonds, plum-shaped buttons decorated with enamel, as well as buttons made from brilliants, emeralds. Delias and dolmans were also popular among the townspeople and nobles.Wealthy townspeople, decorated with luxurious clothing, raised envy of the Lithuanian nobility, therefore the nobles began demanding to adopt laws limiting the clothing of the townspeople. For the first time such restrictions were recorded in the Statute of Lithuania of 1588, according to which the townspeople were allowed to wear only two rings (one of them was the seal) while the Jews were forbidden to adorn with gold chains and brooches (though, the Jewish women had more rights). Even wider restrictions were put in place by the Sejm of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth which adopted the Act of Thrift in 1613, according to which the non-noble townspeople were forbidden to appear in public places dressed in expensive furs (violators of the law were fined and the clothes were given to the complainants). The wealthy townspeople were not satisfied with such limitations, therefore a subscription fee was introduced later which removed all limitations.The clothing trends changed in the late 18th century when almost all men already had shaved beards, short-haired hairstyles and began to wear trendy, blue, green or black tailcoats with open-fronts and waistcoats matched with white or yellowish trousers, while the 18th century women's clothing fashion had almost no differences from the Western European fashion trends. In the early 20th century the clothes were already in line with the Western European fashion trends, and in 1961 clothing designers studies were launched in the State Art Institute of Lithuania, also in the same year the Vilnius Model House was established which created and popularized unique and industrial apparel and footwear models, made clothing presentations.Mados infekcija (English: Fashion Infection) was launched in 1999 and currently is the biggest Lithuanian fashion show, held every spring in Vilnius. Prominent Lithuanian clothing designer Juozas Statkevi\u010dius usually organizes his collections presentations in Vilnius.\n\n\n=== Holidays and festivals ===\n\nAs a result of centuries long Catholic traditions in Vilnius and Lithuania, the Catholic holidays (e.g., Christmas, Easter, Saint John's Eve) are widely celebrated and employees have a days off.Every year on 16 February (day of the Act of Independence of Lithuania) and on 11 March (day of the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania) festive events are organized in Vilnius with official ceremonies conducted by the heads of state and the holy masses of the Lithuanian Catholic Church in the Vilnius Cathedral. While in the evening of 12 January bonfires are ignited to mark the bloody January Events.Saint Casimir's Fair (Lithuanian: Kaziuko mug\u0117) is held annually for hundreds of years in city's markets and streets on the Sunday nearest to 4 March (Feast of St. Casimir), the anniversary of Saint Casimir's death. It attracts tens of thousands of visitors and many Lithuanian and foreign craftsmen. Easter palms (Lithuanian: Verbos) are one of the most recognizable symbols of the fair.Capital's Days (Lithuanian: Sostin\u0117s dienos) is the biggest festival of music and culture held in the city annually for three days (from 30 August to 1 September).Although it is not a national holiday, the Vilnia River is dyed green every year for Saint Patrick's Day.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\n\n=== City government ===\n\nBefore the Magdeburg rights were granted to Vilnius in 1378, the city was overseen by the ruler's vicegerents. Later these duties were granted to a magistrate or a City Council, subordinate only to the ruler himself. During wars, when the city was in a danger, the city was led by a Voivode of Vilnius. The magisterial authority was headquartered at the Vilnius Town Hall.\n\nVilnius Magistrate was responsible for the city economy, was collecting taxes, taking care of the city treasury, was accumulating stocks of grain in order to avoid residents starvation in case of famine or wars. He also acted as a notary in transactions, testaments and as a judge during the city residents conflicts that involved new buildings constructions and reconstructions. His other function was taking care of the city craftsmen. From the beginning, statutes of workshops were approved by the ruler himself. Later, Sigismund II Augustus granted this privilege to the city magistrates in 1552. Since the 1522 privilege by Sigismund I the Old, Vilnius Magistrates had the responsibility to protect the city and its resident's tranquility by having 24 armed guards. During war times, the night watch was performed by three jurisdictions \u2013 magistrate, bishop and castle men.Chief City Administrator was vaitas (a Grand Duke of Lithuania vicegerent in the city). Most of them were beginning their careers in the magistracy before obtaining such a position. All vaitai were Catholics. Vaitas was chairing during the City Council meetings. His competence also included criminal cases and he had the right to impose a death penalty. At first, he examined the cases alone, however since the 16th century two suolininkai also examined important cases (if the lawsuit was over 10 groschen) together with the vaitas. In the 16th century, Vilnius City Council consisted of 12 burgomasters and 24 councilors (half of them were Catholics, the other half were orthodoxes). There were no direct elections to the City Council and members to the council were chosen by the wealthy townspeople, merchants, workshops seniors. Burgomasters were being chosen until their deaths. In case of death, another member of the council was being chosen of the same religion. In 1536, Sigismund I the Old signed a privilege which regulated the magistracy formation principles that prohibited to choose close relatives to the council and all the new taxes, obligations and regulations required the prior agreement of the townspeople.Under the Russian Empire control, the City Council was replaced with City Duma. After the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, Vilnius became a republican subordinate city. Current Vilnius City Municipal Council was established in 1990.\n\n\n=== Municipal council of the city ===\n\nVilnius City Municipality is one of 60 municipalities of Lithuania and includes the nearby town of Grigi\u0161k\u0117s, three villages, and some rural areas. The town of Grigi\u0161k\u0117s was separated from the Trakai District Municipality and attached to the Vilnius City Municipality in 2000.\nA 51-member council is elected to four-year terms; the candidates are nominated by registered political parties. As of the 2011 elections, independent candidates also were permitted. The last election was held in March 2019. The results are:\n\nPublic Election Committee \"R. \u0160ima\u0161ius Team \"For Vilnius, which we are proud of\" \u2013 17 seats\nA. Zuokas and Vilnius Citizens Coalition \"Happy Vilnius\" \u2013 10 seats\nHomeland Union \u2013 Lithuanian Christian Democrats \u2013 9 seats\nThe coalition of the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania and Russians Alliance \"Christian Families Alliance\" \u2013 6 seats\nLabour Party \u2013 5 seats\nLithuanian Farmers and Greens Union \u2013 3 seats\n\n\n=== Mayors ===\n\nBefore 2015, mayors were appointed by the council. Starting with the elections in 2015, the mayors are elected directly by the residents. Remigijus \u0160ima\u0161ius became the first directly elected mayor of the city.\n\n1990 \u2013 Ar\u016bnas Grumadas (the president of council)\n1993 \u2013 Valentinas \u0160apalas (the president of council)\n1995 \u2013 Alis Vid\u016bnas\n1997 - Algirdas \u010ciu\u010delis\n1997 \u2013 Rolandas Paksas\n1999 \u2013 Juozas Imbrasas\n2000 \u2013 Rolandas Paksas (second time)\n2001 \u2013 Art\u016bras Zuokas\n2003 \u2013 Gediminas Pavir\u017eis\n2003 \u2013 Art\u016bras Zuokas (second time)\n2007 \u2013 Juozas Imbrasas (second time)\n2009 \u2013 Vilius Navickas\n2010 \u2013 Raimundas Alekna\n2011 \u2013 Art\u016bras Zuokas (third time)\n2015 \u2013 Remigijus \u0160ima\u0161ius\n2019 \u2013 Remigijus \u0160ima\u0161ius (second time)\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nElderships, a statewide administrative division, function as municipal districts. The 21 elderships are based on neighbourhoods:\n\nVerkiai \u2013 includes Baltupiai, Jeruzal\u0117, Santari\u0161k\u0117s, Balsiai, Visoriai\nAntakalnis \u2013 includes Valakampiai, Turni\u0161k\u0117s, Dvar\u010dionys\nPa\u0161ilai\u010diai \u2013 includes Tarand\u0117\nFabijoni\u0161k\u0117s \u2013 includes Bajorai\nPilait\u0117\nJustini\u0161k\u0117s\nVir\u0161uli\u0161k\u0117s\n\u0160e\u0161kin\u0117\n\u0160nipi\u0161k\u0117s\n\u017dirm\u016bnai \u2013 includes \u0160iaur\u0117s miestelis\nKarolini\u0161k\u0117s\n\u017dv\u0117rynas\nGrigi\u0161k\u0117s \u2013 a separate town\nLazdynai\nVilkp\u0117d\u0117 \u2013 includes Vingis Park\nNaujamiestis \u2013 includes bus and train stations\nSenamiestis (Old Town) \u2013 includes U\u017eupis\nNaujoji Vilnia \u2013 includes Pavilnys, P\u016b\u010dkoriai\nPaneriai \u2013 includes Trak\u0173 Vok\u0117, Gari\u016bnai\nNaujininkai \u2013 includes Kirtimai, Salininkai, Vilnius International Airport\nRasos \u2013 includes Belmontas, Marku\u010diai\n\n\n=== District municipality ===\n\nVilnius District Municipality (Lithuanian: Vilniaus rajono savivaldyb\u0117) is one of the largest municipalities in Lithuania. It occupies 2129 square kilometres and has 23 civil parishes. There are 1163 villages and 5 towns (Nemen\u010din\u0117, Bezdonys, Mai\u0161iagala, Mick\u016bnai and \u0160umskas) in the district. Vilnius district surrounds the Lithuania's capital and has developed public, business rural infrastructure and offers high standard of living with clean environment. Vilnius district borders with the Republic of Belarus and neighbours with \u0160ven\u010dionys, Moletai, \u0160irvintos, Elektr\u0117nai, Trakai and \u0160al\u010dininkai districts.Vilnius district has a multinational population, of which 52% are Poles, 33% are Lithuanians and the rest of 16% are Russians, Belarusians and other nationalities residents (e.g., Ukrainians, Tatars, Jews). Currently, Vilnius district has over 100,000 residents. Most of the population (95%) live in villages and 5% live in towns.Vilnius district has the highest terrains of Lithuania \u2013 Auk\u0161tojas, Juozapin\u0117 and Kruopin\u0117 Hills, which are raised over 290 metres above sea level and are considered very high in the country's flatlands.Palm Sunday is widely celebrated in the district and the unique and colorful Vilnius Easter palms (verbos) are made there from dried flowers and herbs. The tradition of making Vilnius palms is dated to the times of St. Casimir, who is a patron saint of Lithuania and Lithuanian youth.Medininkai Castle, Liubavas Manor mill and Bareiki\u0161k\u0117s Manor are the most famous historical landmarks of the district.Vilnius Voivodeship from 1769 surrounded a completely independent microstate Republic of Paulava, known for its Age of Enlightenment values, with its own president, peasants parliament, army and laws.As a result of its large Polish population, Vilnius District Municipality Council mostly consists from members of the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania. Lithuanian Pole Marija Rekst is a long-term mayor of the district.\n\n\n=== National government ===\n\nAs the capital of Lithuania, Vilnius is the seat of Lithuania's national government. For the executive, the two chief officers of Lithuania have their offices in Vilnius. The President of the Republic of Lithuania resides at the Presidential Palace in Daukanto Square, while the Prime Minister's seat is at the Government of Lithuania office in the Gediminas Avenue. According to the Law of the President of the Republic of Lithuania, the President of the Republic has a residence in Vilnius that is currently located in Turni\u0161k\u0117s district near Neris river. Prime Minister also has a right to a residence in Turni\u0161k\u0117s district during term in office. Government ministries are located in various parts of the city; many are located in the Vilnius Old Town.Historically, the Seimas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania mostly gathered in Vilnius. The present-day Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania is also located in Vilnius and meets at the Seimas Palace in Gediminas Avenue.Lithuania's highest courts are located in Vilnius. The Supreme Court of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Auk\u0161\u010diausiasis Teismas), the highest court in the judicial order, which reviews criminal and civil cases, is located in the Gyn\u0117j\u0173 Street, while the Supreme Administrative Court of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos vyriausiasis administracinis teismas), which acts as the highest court in the administrative order, judging litigation against public bodies, is located in the \u017dygimant\u0173 Street. The Constitutional Court of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Respublikos Konstitucinis Teismas), an advisory body with ultimate authority on the constitutionality of laws meets in the Constitutional Court's Palace in Gediminas Avenue.The Lithuanian Tribunal, the highest appeal court for the nobility of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, was established by Stephen B\u00e1thory, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland, in 1581. It was located in Vilnius till 1795.\n\n\n=== Special services ===\n\nThe security of Vilnius is mainly the responsibility of the Vilniaus apskrities vyriausiasis policijos komisariatas, the highest police office in the city, and local police offices. Its main responsibilities are ensuring public order and public safety, disclosure and investigation of criminal offenses and traffic safety supervision. In 2016, there were 1500 police officers in Vilnius. Vie\u0161ojo saugumo tarnyba prie Vidaus reikal\u0173 ministerijos is responsible for the prompt restoration of public order in extreme and special situations and ensure proper protection of important state objects and escorted subjects.Vilniaus apskrities prie\u0161gaisrin\u0117 gelb\u0117jimo valdyba is the primary governing body of the Vilnius' firefighters forces. In the first 9 months of 2018, there were 1287 fire incidents in the city of Vilnius, during which 6 people died and 16 were traumatized.Vilniaus greitosios medicinos pagalbos stotis is responsible for emergency medical services in the city and can be contacted directly by calling a short number 033. It is one of the oldest emergency medical services institution in Eastern Europe and was established already in 1902. Large part of this institution doctors and other personnel were awarded with medals for their assistance to victims during the January Events in 1991.Major number for contacting all the special services in Vilnius (and other regions of Lithuania) is 112.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Urbanism and architecture ===\n\nThe Old Town of Vilnius is the historical centre of Vilnius, about 3.6 km2 (1.4 sq mi) in size. Its history begins from the Neolithic period. During it, the glacial hills were intermittently occupied and a wooden castle, at the confluence of the Neris and Vilnia rivers, was built around 1000 AD to fortify Gedimino Hill. The settlement developed into a town in the 13th century, when the pagan Baltic people were invaded by the Westerners during the Lithuanian Crusade. Around 1323, when the first written sources about Vilnia occurred, it was the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which was formed from various cultures and nationalities residents. At this time, it only had some brick structures. By the 15th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania had become one of the most powerful and the largest country in Europe with its territory stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea (mostly, present-day Belarus, Ukraine and Russia lands). The historic centre consists of three castles territories (Upper, Lower and Curved) and the area that was previously encircled by a Wall of Vilnius. Its plan is mostly circular with its center in the original castle site. The streets pattern is medieval and has small, narrow streets, however large squares were also developed in later periods. Pilies Street, the main artery, links the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania with Vilnius Town Hall. Other streets meander through the palaces of feudal lords and landlords, churches, shops and craftsmen's workrooms.\nThe historic buildings are in Gothic (e.g., Church of St. Anne), Renaissance (e.g., Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania), Baroque (e.g., Church of St. Peter and St. Paul with over 2,000 stucco figures interior, Vilnius University's main campus, which features 13 courtyards framed by 15th century buildings and splashed with 300-year-old frescoes, and the Church of St. Johns) and Classical styles (e.g., Vilnius Cathedral, Vilnius Town Hall, \u0160uazeliai Palace, Verkiai Palace) with splendid exteriors and interiors. The variety of preserved churches and former palaces of the Lithuanian nobility especially constitutes the Vilnius multicultural heritage.As a capital of the massive state, Lithuanians shaped the development of its outstanding capital together with other nations. Vilnius development was influenced by the West and East ideologies. Christianity dominated in Lithuania since the Christianization of Lithuania in 1387, however Orthodoxy of the state's eastern residents and the growing importance of Judaism led to exemplary material manifestations of these religious communities (e.g., Orthodox Cathedral of the Theotokos, Great Synagogue of Vilna).\n\nVarious disasters resulted in reconstructions of the Vilnius buildings in the School of Vilnius Baroque style, which later left an imprint in the whole Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Talented artists (e.g., Matteo Castelli, Pietro Perti) from the present-day Canton of Ticino were particularly preferred by the Grand Duke of Lithuania and local nobility, and developed many famous objects in the city (e.g., Chapel of Saint Casimir). Lithuanian Laurynas Gucevi\u010dius left a huge mark in the Classical style architecture of Vilnius.During the Soviet occupation decades of Lithuania, microdistricts were built in the elderates of \u0160e\u0161kin\u0117, \u017dirm\u016bnai, Justini\u0161k\u0117s, Fabijoni\u0161k\u0117s. Most of the buildings from this period had a distinct grey color, straight lines design and poor quality monolith constructions.Vilnius Old Town was inscribed to the list of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1994. The inscribed property has an extension of 352 ha. Vilnius Historic Centre is particularly noted for maintaining the medieval streets pattern without any significant gaps. However, some places were damaged during Lithuania's occupations and wars, including the Cathedral Square that covers the foundations of the Royal Palace \u2013  demolished after the 3rd partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, a square in the east from the Church of All Saints where the Convent of the Barefoot Carmelites previously stood alongside a Vice-Chancellor Stefan Pac's established Baroque Church of St. Joseph the Betrothed, both demolished by the tsar's order. Great Synagogue and part of the buildings in the Vokie\u010di\u0173 Street (German: Deutsche Gasse) were demolished after the World War II.Vilnius occupies an area of 397 square kilometers, of which only one fifth is developed and the remainder is green belt and water. For this reason, Vilnius is often referred to as one of the 'greenest' capital cities in Europe.\n\n\n=== Crypts ===\nThe crypts of Vilnius Cathedral are a place where prominent figures of Lithuania and the Church are buried. At the Royal Mausoleum Grand Duke Alexander Jagiellon, Queen Elizabeth of Austria, Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142, heart of the Grand Duke W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa are buried. These crypts also have one of the oldest frescos in Lithuania, painted in the late 14th or early 15th century, and dating to the times of the Christianization of Lithuania.\n\n\n=== Housing ===\n\nVilnius Old Town (Lithuanian: Vilniaus senamiestis) with idyllic medieval stone paved streets and U\u017eupis offers one of the most prestigious housing in Vilnius. Many old town apartment buildings there offers direct views to the iconic churches or the biggest landmarks of the city (e.g., especially desired Gediminas Tower), enclosed inner courtyards, high ceilings, attics, non-standard layouts and luxurious historic interiors. Most expensive flats in these neighbourhoods may cost millions of euros and are accessible only to the wealthiest residents of the city. However, such problems as traffic jams, expensive car parking spaces, air pollution, high costs of maintenance, limitations for reconstructions repels rich Vilnians from living in these neighbourhoods, who often buy or build private houses in more distant parts of Vilnius (Balsiai, Bajorai, Pavilnys, Kaln\u0117nai, Pilait\u0117 and others) or nearby areas of the Vilnius District Municipality. About 21,000 residents live in the old town and 7,000 in U\u017eupis.\n\nValakampiai and Turni\u0161k\u0117s are the city's most prestigious places with private houses quarters as plots there are sufficiently large, surrounded with the greenery, pines forests and are easily accessible from the city centre. Generally, exceptionally wealthy residents and heads of the state (e.g., presidents) live there and most of the larger private houses costs millions of euros. Part of the \u017dv\u0117rynas neighbourhood also offers luxurious private houses with plots close to the Vingis Park, but it also has the Soviet-era apartment buildings, poor condition wooden houses, higher number of residents (~12,200).Neighbourhoods around the old town (Antakalnis, \u017dirm\u016bnai, Naujamiestis, \u017dv\u0117rynas) offer a wide variety prices flats, decent amount of greenery suitable for walks, bicycle roads and therefore are the most popular among the middle class residents. Wealthier communities are living in a new construction apartments or renovated Soviet-era apartments. Government of Lithuania strongly supports the renovation process and compensates 30% or more of the cost. However, poorer inhabitants and low income pensioners are often stopping the process adding to overall regionalistic policies of the politicians.More distant neighbourhoods (e.g., Lazdynai, Karolini\u0161k\u0117s, Vir\u0161uli\u0161k\u0117s, \u0160e\u0161kin\u0117, Justini\u0161k\u0117s, Pa\u0161ilai\u010diai, Fabijoni\u0161k\u0117s, Naujininkai) are offering significantly cheaper flats. Their biggest disadvantages together with a more difficult communication with the city centre are mostly not renovated Soviet-era high-rise buildings, worn out surroundings, large traffic jams on the streets connecting with the city centre during the rush hours and a constant lack of car parking spaces near older apartments.\u0160nipi\u0161k\u0117s eldership has received a significant amount of investment during the 2010s. The area was first mentioned in the Vilnius' historical documents in 1536 when the Grand Duke Sigismund I the Old ordered Ulrich Hosius to build a wooden bridge over the Neris river. Soon around the bridge, a suburb began to develop. In the 16th a palace dedicated to the Muscovites and Tatars messengers built by the magistrate of Vilnius to the north of \u0160nipi\u0161k\u0117s, as during their visits, they acted noisily and the townspeople did not want them around. In the 18th century, a Jesuit's Church of St. Raphael the Archangel and monastery as well as solid palaces of the rich and multi-story brick houses of ordinary townspeople were built in \u0160nipi\u0161k\u0117s. On the other hand, the outskirts of this suburb were inhabited by the craftsmen: the glass-makers, brick-makers, pottery-makers. Smoking pipe factory, sawmills and even a tiny candy factory emerged. A small part of the territory (8 ha) of \u0160nipi\u0161k\u0117s west of the Kalvarij\u0173 market, called Skansenas, occupied mostly by poor condition wooden houses, emerged in the late 19th century. Surprisingly, it survived to this day and is now still underdeveloped territory, protected by the state. Next to it, then-luxurious quarter of bankers \u2013 Piromontas was built in the 1890s, is architectural heritage too.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the \u0160nipi\u0161k\u0117s area was named the new city center: the first city pedestrian zone organized and before the 1990 a number of buildings, including the largest shopping center in what was then Lithuanian SSR, the highest and the largest hotel, planetarium, museum of Revolution, Pioneer's Palace as well as number of ministries of the Lithuanian SSR were built. However, the broader territory of \u0160nipi\u0161k\u0117s, stretching to the north of what is now Konstitucijos Avenue, remained mainly underdeveloped until the early 2000s when the new Vilnius city municipality building was built in the area, that inspired transformation of the surroundings: the new Europa square formed with a new shopping center \"Europa\", 33-story \"Europa\" business tower and 27-story \"Europa\" apartment building. Former Museum of Revolution was reconstructed to the National Art Gallery in the late 2000s. Since then skyscrapers and expensive commercial offices are being built constantly in the area. Currently, it already has almost 0.5 million square meters of real estate. A Japanese garden will be completed in the area till 2020.In 2019, average price for 1 m2 of flat was around 2,000 euros and around 1,200 euros for 1 m2 of a private house in Vilnius, while the rent prices were ~10 \u20ac/m2 (for flats) and ~8 \u20ac/m2 (for private houses) respectively. According to the economists, number of transactions and housing affordability index has reached record highs in 2019 because of the significant rise in Vilnius residents incomes and slowing of the flats prices rising. Despite that, according to a research one fourth of the 26\u201335 years old inhabitants are still living in their parents or relatives owned homes, which is the highest number in the Baltic states, however it is likely that large part of these young people are simply saving for their own homes or the initial contribution because statistics traditionally shows that Lithuanians purchases their homes with less borrowed funds than Latvians or Estonians.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nVilnius has thousands of years of demographics history as in the eldership of Vilkp\u0117d\u0117 the remains of the Magdalenian culture settlement were found, which are dated to around 10,000 years BC. In the first 1,000 years AD there were large settlements in Kair\u0117nai, P\u016b\u010dkoriai and Naujoji Vilnia. The most densely populated area was the confluence of the Neris and Vilnia Rivers, which also had fortified homesteads. Later Vilnius was part of the Kingdom of Lithuania territory, however King Mindaugas did not constantly inhabited in it, despite building the first Catholic Church in Lithuania there on the occasion of his coronation. The city began to develop in the late 13th century, during the reign of Grand Dukes Butvydas and Vytenis.Major growth of Vilnius as the centre and capital of the medieval state is attributed to the 14th century reign of Grand Duke Gediminas whose sent letters to the Western Europe invited knights, merchants, doctors, craftspeople and others to come to the Grand Duchy to practice their trades and faith without restriction. Although, the growth of Vilnius was limited at the time due to the brutal Teutonic Order attacks (e.g., during their assault in 1390 around 14,000 Vilnians were killed) and the Lithuanian Civil War (1389\u20131392).Vilnius developed as a multicultural city. In the 14th century sources it is mentioned that Vilnius consists of the Great (Lithuanian) city and Ruthenians city. Until the 16th century the city was mostly inhabited by Lithuanians and Ruthenians, however the German merchants, artisans, Jews (since the 14th century; later had their qahal till 1845) and the Tartars (since 1397) also settled down in Vilnius. In the 16th\u201317th centuries, during Reformation and Counter-Reformation, the Polonophone population began to grow \u2013 by the middle of the 17th century most writings were in Polish due to the Polonisation (before the 16th century the number was only around 5%).The city prospered during the Golden Age by being one of the main cities of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and residence of the Lithuanian nobility. However, the city was severely devastated by fire in 1610. After the Battle of Vilnius in 1655 the city came under Russian control (1655\u20131661). Next, after the Great Northern War, the Swedish Empire controlled the city from 1702\u20131709. This occupation ended during the  Great Northern War plague outbreak in 1709. It took the city more than 50 years to recover.\n\nAccording to the first population census of the Commonwealth in 1790, the Vilnius Voivodeship (without the Grodno County) had a population of 718,571 residents, while the Vilnius County had 105,896 residents (the whole Grand Duchy after the Second Partition had a population of 1,333,493 then). Shortly after, the city population decreased to just 17,500 residents in 1796 due to the fierce battles of the Vilnius uprising in 1794, which was the last attempt to save the Grand Duchy's capital from falling under the complete Russian control. Though, after the rebels defeat, Vilnius was incorporated into the Russian Empire and was its third largest city in the beginning of the 19th century. After a few decades of the Russian despotism, Vilnius demographics were once again affected by the November Uprising in 1830 and the January Uprising in 1863, during which rebels attempts were made to restore the statehood. According to the Russian Empire Census of 1897, Vilnius had 154,532 residents and later grown to 205,300 residents in 1909, while the Vilna Governorate had 1,561,713 residents in 1897.During World War I thousands of Vilnians were forced to flee, were killed or were taken to the forced labor camps; consequently the city had only 128,500 residents in 1919 (totally, present-day Lithuania territory lost around 1 million residents). Vilnius recovered during the interwar period and had 209,442 residents in 1939, but due to the World War II the number fell to 110,000 in 1944.Vilnius again grew in population by being capital of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (according to the 1989 census, it had 576,747 residents). Despite the fact that almost whole Lithuania suffered from a large emigration after the restoration of independence in 1990, the number of residents in Vilnius remained almost unchanged (542,287 in 2001) and began to steadily grow every year since 2006 to 580,020 residents (as of 1 January 2020).\n\n\n=== Historic ethnic makeup ===\n\nAround 1000 years AD, the confluence of the Neris and Vilnia Rivers was densely populated by the Striped Ceramics culture, which had a half a hectare fortified settlement on the Gediminas' Hill. This culture tribes were common throughout present-day Lithuania, east of the \u0160ventoji River and in the western part of Belarus. The direct descendants of this culture are believed to be a Baltic tribe \u2013 the Auk\u0161taitians (English: Highlanders). According to a prominent researcher of Vilnius history Antanas \u010caplinskas, who researched the surnames of Vilnius residents in the archive documents of the city, the oldest surviving surnames of Vilnius residents are undoubtedly Lithuanian.Later, following the invitation of Grand Duke Gediminas, merchants and craftsmen began to move to Vilnius from the cities of the German Hanseatic League, France, Italy and Spain, and replaced the Lithuanian surnames with the German, Polish, and Russian surnames. In the late 14th century, during the reign of Grand Duke Algirdas, Vilnius already had a Ruthenian quarter (Latin: Civitas Ruthenica) in the present-day Latako and Rus\u0173 Streets, as the trade relations between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Ruthenian principalities were quite well developed, therefore quite a few Ruthenian merchants lived there and the Ruthenian nobles had their residences in the quarter. The variety of nations in Vilnius was further increased by Grand Duke Vytautas the Great, who introduced Jews, Tatars, Crimean Karaites. After a few hundred years, the number of locals in Vilnius was smaller than the number of newcomers. Though, according to the analysis of the tax registers of 1572, Lithuania proper had 850,000 residents, of which 680,000 (80%) were Lithuanians. The word about the Lithuanian language spread wide as even the Byzantine Greek historian Laonikos Chalkokondyles knew that the Lithuanians have their own distinct language.Since the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth times, the Polish culture began to penetrate the city rapidly and soon the Polish language prevailed in the city, even the Magistrate documents were written in Polish until the November Uprising in 1831. After living for a while in Vilnius, foreign merchants and artisans quickly assimilated and were Polonized. Majority of the Lithuanian nobles were also Polonized and spoke the Polish language, however they never considered themselves Poles and the Union of Lublin was only signed during the second attempt in 1569, with the agreement that both states will be sovereign entities within the Commonwealth and the forbidment for the Poles from the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland to buy land in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Their opinion did not changed within the union and was confirmed again in the Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations in 1791.\n\nOver the centuries, the composition of the population of Vilnius even more changed for the benefit of non-Lithuanians. According to historian Vytautas Merkys, the city lost a great deal of its old population during the brutal rampages of the Swedish and Russian armies in the 17th and 18th centuries, and they were replaced by the newcomers, however the Lithuanians also constantly inhabited in Vilnius. According to the Russian Empire Census of 1897, only 2.1% (3200 residents) identified themselves as Lithuanian-speakers, while the Poles (30.8%; 47,600 residents) and the Jews (40.0%;  61,800 residents) were the largest ethnic groups of the city. Though, according to the Parish censuses of 1857\u20131858, the Lithuanians population remained significant in the Vilna Governorate and, according to different authors, was between 23.6% and 50.0% (210,273\u2013418,880 residents). Among the nobility class in Vilnius during the census of 1897, there were 5,301 (46.3%) local nobles and 6,403 (54.7%) newcomers, of these 24.1% noble newcomers came from Vilna Governorate territories, while the rest newcomers nobles came to Vilnius from Grodno Governorate, Minsk Governorate, Vitebsk Governorate, Kovno Governorate, Vistula Land and other regions.Ethnic Lithuanians numbers in the city of Vilnius reached record lows in 1931 (1600 residents \u2013 0.8%, while the Poles accounted for 65.9% \u2013 128,600 residents) following the 1922 annexation of Vilnius Region by Poland and the Lithuanians retreat from the region to the temporary capital Kaunas. Though, following the Soviet\u2013Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty in 1939, Lithuania recovered the Vilnius Region and made efforts to Lithuanize Vilnius by the introduction of Lithuanian laws. Prime Minister Antanas Merkys once said that it was intended \"to make everybody think like Lithuanians. First of all, it was and still is necessary to comb out the foreign element from the Vilnius Region\". The Lithuanian Government put into force a law according to which \"who on July 12, 1920 (...) were regarded as Lithuanian nationals, and on October 27, 1939 were resident in the territory became Lithuanian nationals\" (this definition of citizenship was used to dismiss a large number of Polish civil servants and ~150,000 Poles were later repatriated from the Lithuanian SSR). Almost the whole Lithuanian Jews population was exterminated during the Nazis organized Holocaust in 1941. After the World War II, the Lithuanians numbers in the city started recovering (e.g., there already were 79,363 Lithuanians in 1959, who accounted for 33.6% of all residents in the city), however the Lithuanization ideas were mostly replaced with the Sovietization of the population after the rigged election to the People's Seimas in 1940. Following the restoration of independence in 1990, the Lithuanians population in the city continued to grow and according to the 2011 Lithuanian census already reached 63.2% (337,000 residents).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nVilnius is the major economic centre of Lithuania. GDP per capita (nominal) in Vilnius county was \u20ac23,400 ($47,969, in Purchasing power parity, 2015 constant USD) in 2018, making it the wealthiest region in Lithuania and second wealthiest region in Baltic states.\nThe budget of Vilnius reached $720 million in 2018. The average monthly net salary in Vilnius (as of 2019-Q3) city municipality reached \u20ac941 (~$2,000 in PPP) as of 2019 (average gross salary in Vilnius was \u20ac1503.)Since 2010, employment and unemployment indicators have continuously been improving in Lithuania. Employment reached a record high of 77.5% in the third quarter of 2018 while unemployment was 6.3% in the fourth quarter, a rate last observed in 2008. Nevertheless, this has to be seen in the context of a shrinking working age population. The activity rate reached 82% in 2017. Vilnius and Kaunas counties offer better labour market opportunities than other counties, and this drives the internal interregional migration. However, in other regions employment opportunities remain scarce. Unemployment rates remained persistently high in the least developed regions (14.9% in Utena County as compared to 4.8% in Vilnius County). Other key labour market indicators have improved, returning to pre-crisis levels. Long-term unemployment fell to 2.1% in the third quarter of 2018 (EU average: 2.9%). Youth unemployment (13.3%) and the rate of young people not in employment, education or training (NEET, at 9.1%) were below the EU average in 2017.\n\nOverall, the share of the population at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE) has decreased since Lithuania joined the EU in 2004. However, it remains among the highest in the EU (29.6% in 2017, compared to 22.4% in the EU). The risk of poverty or social exclusion in rural areas is nearly double that of urban areas, which corresponds to the gap in the unemployment rate between cities and rural areas (4.5% versus 11% in 2017). In particular the metropolitan areas of Vilnius and Kaunas, where significant economic activity is centred, drive a significant gap between AROPE rates in urban and rural areas. In 2017, the AROPE rate in rural areas was 37.2%, compared to 19.9% in cities.Over the past 15 years, Lithuania has experienced the fastest convergence in the EU, but the benefits of economic growth are uneven across regions. Disparities among Lithuania's regions have steadily grown in this period. While GDP per capita reached nearly 110% of the EU average in the capital region of Vilnius, it is only between 42% and 77% in other regions. The country's rapid convergence is mainly fuelled by two regions \u2013 the capital region of Vilnius and Kaunas County \u2013 producing 42% and 20% of the national GDP, respectively. In 2014\u20132016 these regions grew on average by 4.6% (Vilnius) and 3.3% (Kaunas), while the other regions, which have a higher share of rural areas, stagnated or were in recession.The supply of new housing in Vilnius and its suburbs, the country's biggest real estate market, has reached post-crisis highs and the stock of unsold apartments in the three largest cities has started to increase since the\nbeginning of 2017. The demand for housing is still strong, fuelled by rapidly rising wages, benign financial conditions and positive expectations. In the first half of 2018, the number of monthly transactions was the highest since the 2007\u20132008 peak.

In 1934, the first Divine Mercy image was painted by Eugeniusz Kazimirowski under the supervision of Faustina Kowalska and it presently hangs in the Divine Mercy Sanctuary in Vilnius. A feast of the Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament is held in the shrine 24 hours per day. The House of St. Faustina where she previously lived is located in V.

          "It's a small museum, a bit tricky to find...we wondered whether it was that way on purpose. It tells the holocaust story with a high caliber exhibit that is simple but excellent. The short film and exhibits are good. This is a must see, in my opinion, because the holocaust was",

          "The museum isn't in a large grand building, but in a small green house. This makes the exhibits more attention grabbing, as you end up reading everything. I found one of the most moving pieces in the very first room, where a large document on the wall shows a logbook detailing",

        "wiki": "The following is a list of rulers over Lithuania (grand dukes, a king and presidents), the heads of authority over historical Lithuanian territory. The timeline includes Lithuania as a sovereign entity or legitimately part of a greater sovereign entity, as well as Lithuania under control or occupation of an outside authority (i.e. Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic). The incumbents and office-holders are listed by names most commonly used in English language. Where appropriate, the alternatives in Lithuanian, Ruthenian (later Belarusian) and Polish are included.\nThe state of Lithuania was formed in the 1230s: when threatened by the Livonian Order in the north and the Teutonic Knights in the west, the Baltic tribes united under the leadership of Mindaugas. He became the only crowned king of Lithuania. His state became known as the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. After Grand Duke Jogaila became also king of Poland in 1386, the two states became more closely connected, and from 1440 both were ruled by a common ruler. In 1569 the Union of Lublin was signed and a new entity\u2014the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth\u2014emerged. The commonwealth was partitioned in 1795 and Lithuania became part of the Russian Empire until 16 February 1918. The Council of Lithuania was able to establish the country's sovereignty only in 1919, after the end of World War I. The first republic of Lithuania existed until 1940, when it was occupied by the Soviet Union. During the Soviet-German War, Lithuania was occupied by Nazi Germany. In 1944, as Germany was losing the war, Russia re-occupied Lithuania and established the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. On 11 March 1990, Lithuania became the first Soviet republic to declare independence. The restored Republic of Lithuania is a democratic republic, a member of both the European Union and NATO.\n\n\n== Grand Duchy of Lithuania (1236\u20131569) ==\n\nTitle: Grand Duke (Lithuanian: didysis kunigaik\u0161tis; Belarusian: vialiki knia\u017a; Polish: wielki ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119) except for Mindaugas, who became king of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos karalius).\n\n\n=== House of Mindaugas (1236\u20131268) ===\nDates are approximate because of scant written sources.\n\n\n=== Monomakhovichi (1268\u20131269) ===\n\n\n=== House of Mindaugas (1269\u20131285) ===\n\n\n=== House of Gediminas (1285\u20131440) ===\nSome dates are approximate.\n\n\n=== House of Jagiellon (1440\u20131569) ===\nThe act of personal union with Poland was signed as early as 1385; however, the continuous line of common rulers of the two countries started only with Casimir IV (even then, Polish and Lithuanians twice selected different rulers following the death of an earlier common monarch, but the Lithuanian one always eventually assumed the Polish throne). The monarchs retained separate titles for both parts of the state, and their numbering was kept separate. The Jagiellon dynasty was a direct continuation of the Gediminids.\n\n\n== Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569\u20131795) ==\n\nThe Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth was established by the Union of Lublin in 1569. The elected King of Poland was to be elected by Lithuanian noble families as a Grand Duke of Lithuania (until then the Lithuanian dukedom was hereditary). The first common ruler of both countries was Sigismund II Augustus. Following the partitions in 1772, 1793, and 1795, the commonwealth ceased to exist and Lithuania became part of the Russian Empire for 123 years. There are some gaps in the timeline as it took a while to elect a new king. The first Grand Duke elected after the Gediminid line became extinct and after the Valois fled back to France was Stephen B\u00e1thory, who had made an effort to be recognized as Grand Duke of Lithuania by establishing Vilnius University.\nTitle: King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania\nLithuanian: Lenkijos karalius ir Lietuvos didysis kunigaik\u0161tis\nBelarusian: \u043a\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c \u041f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0447\u044b, \u0432\u044f\u043b\u0456\u043a\u0456 \u043a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c \u043b\u0456\u0442\u043e\u045e\u0441\u043a\u0456 (karol Pol\u0161\u010dy, vialiki knia\u017a lito\u016dski)\nPolish: Kr\u00f3l Polski, wielki ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119 litewski\nLatin: Rex Poloniae et Magnus Dux Lituaniae\n\n\n== Kingdom of Lithuania (1918) ==\n\nThe Council of Lithuania declared independence on 16 February 1918 and invited Wilhelm of Urach to become king of Lithuania. The name of the state was the Kingdom of Lithuania. On 9 July 1918, Duke Wilhelm accepted the offer and took the name Mindaugas II. However, on 2 November the council revoked this decision as it was likely Germany would lose the war.\n\n\n== State of Lithuania (1918\u20131920) ==\nState of Lithuania was ruled by the Presidium of the State Council of Lithuania, its chairman was de facto Head of State. Institution of Presidium of the State Council of Lithuania was changed into President's on 4 April 1919. Chairman of the Presidium Antanas Smetona was elected as First President of the State of Lithuania by the State Council of Lithuania. \n\n\n== Republic of Lithuania (1920\u20131940) ==\n\nThe institution of President (Lithuanian: Prezidentas) was created on 4 April 1919.\n\n\n== Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1940\u20131941 and 1944\u20131990) ==\n\nThe Soviet Union occupied Lithuania and established Lithuanian SSR in July 1940. As Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union, Lithuania was occupied by the Germans. For a few days before the German occupation, Lithuania was ruled by pro-German rebel government of Juozas Ambrazevi\u010dius. Under the Germans, the General District of Lithuania was governed by the administration of general Petras Kubili\u016bnas. As Nazi Germany retreated, the Soviet Union reoccupied the country and reestablished the Lithuanian SSR in 1944.\nTitle: First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos komunist\u0173 partijos Centro komiteto pirmasis sekretorius; Russian: \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044c \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u044b).\n\nThe Presidium of the Supreme Soviet acted as a collective head of state from 25 August 1940 to 11 March 1990.\n\n\n== Republic of Lithuania (1990\u2013present) ==\nThe leader of the Supreme Council was the official head of state from the declaration of independence on 11 March 1990 until the new Constitution came into effect in 1992 establishing the office of President and the institution of Seimas.

          "It\u2019s so quiet and peaceful when we came to visit. I didn\u2019t see any guards outside. It\u2019s surrounded by buildings of almost similar style. There is a big open space in front of it called Daukantas Square or sometimes Daukanto Square. Nothing much to do there except take photos.",

          "I visited on a Tuesday, and like most visitors to Vilnius, I only viewed it from the outside, both the front and the rear. When the president is there, the Lithuanian flag flies from the top of the building. Much the same as Buckingham Palace when the Queen of England is in",

          "Expected something rather grander, bigger, more imposing, but it is a very nice building. Didn't go inside as it was not open when we passed. It sort of fits with the rest of Vilnius not showy or ostentatious architecture but a very lovely city.",

      "name": "Angel of U\u017eupis",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "U\u017eupis (Yiddish: \u05d6\u05d0\u05e8\u05e2\u05d8\u05e9\u05e2\u200e, Belarusian: \u0417\u0430\u0440\u044d\u0447\u0447\u0430, Russian: \u0417\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0447\u044c\u0435, Polish: Zarzecze) is a neighbourhood in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, largely located in Vilnius' old town, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. U\u017eupis means \"beyond the river\" or \"the other side of the river\" in the Lithuanian language and refers to the Vilnia River; the name Vilnius was derived from the Vilnia. The district has been popular with artists for some time, and has been compared to Montmartre in Paris and to Freetown Christiania in Copenhagen, due to its bohemian and laissez-faire atmosphere. On April 1, 1998, the district declared itself an independent republic (The Republic of U\u017eupis).\n\n\n== Geography ==\nU\u017eupis is quite small and isolated, being only about 148 acres (60 ha) in size; it has around 7,000 inhabitants, nearly 1,000 of which are artists.  On one side it is separated from the Old Town by the Vilnia River, on the second there are steep hills, and on the third side it borders on an industrial area built under Soviet rule.  The first bridges across the river were built in the 16th century, at which time the district's inhabitants were mostly Jewish.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe district contains the Bernardine Cemetery, one of the oldest cemeteries in the city. Most of the district's Jewish population were killed during the Holocaust, and later the old Jewish Cemetery uphill would be destroyed by the Soviets. The houses left abandoned were later occupied by marginal elements of society, mainly the homeless and prostitutes. Until Lithuania's declaration of independence in 1990, it was one of the most neglected areas in the city, containing many run-down houses, many without utilities.  The district has been a common haunt of artists and bohemians since Soviet times, and even today many young artists are squatting in abandoned buildings near the Vilnia River. \n\n\n== The Republic of U\u017eupis ==\n\nIn 1998, the residents of the area declared the Republic of U\u017eupis, along with its own flag, unofficial currency, president, cabinet of ministers, a constitution written by Romas Lileikis and Tomas \u010cepaitis, an anthem, and an army of approximately 11 men. The army has since been retired. The residents of the self-declared republic celebrate this independence annually on U\u017eupis Day, which falls on April 1. Artistic endeavours are the main preoccupation of the Republic; the President of the Republic of U\u017eupis, Romas Lileikis, is himself a poet, a musician, and a film director.\nThe Republic has granted honorary citizenship to several notable individuals, including the 14th Dalai Lama, who first visited the Republic in 2013, and later returned to plant a tree in the Republic's \"Tibet Square\".\nArt\u016bras Zuokas, a former mayor of Vilnius, lives in U\u017eupis. U\u017eupis does not house internet-cafes, kiosks, shopping malls, or governmental institutions (except U\u017eupian), and there is no embassy to Lithuania.\nIt is unclear whether the statehood of the Republic, recognised by no government, is intended to be serious, tongue-in-cheek, or a combination of both.  The decision to place U\u017eupis Day on April 1 (April Fools' Day) may not be coincidental, emphasising the importance of humor over \"serious\" political decisions. The flag of the Republic features the palm of a hand on a white background. The colour of the palm emblem changes seasonally, in the sequence blue (Winter), green (Spring), yellow (Summer), and red (Autumn).\n\n\n=== Ambassadors of U\u017eupis ===\n\nThe U\u017eupis Ministry of Foreign Affairs has appointed more than 500 ambassadors worldwide. The ambassadors have the task to build bridges between people. Some ambassadors represent the republic and its constitution in a certain state or geographic region while others share the republic's spirit in various realms of life like the ambassador among humming birds or the ambassador for whistling in the streets. The Embassy of the Republic of U\u017eupis to Munich builds bridges between arts and AI technology to make artificial intelligence more accessible to society, more ethical and more innovative. Well-known ambassadors are e.g. the experimental filmmaker Jonas Mekas, the art critic Konstyantyn Doroshenko and the experience designer Dr. Nelly Ben Hayoun. Every year the ambassadors meet for their world conference in U\u017eupis on the day before national day celebrations on April 1st.\n\n\n=== Constitution of U\u017eupis ===\n\nCopies of the 38 articles of the Republic's constitution and 3 mottos - \"Don't Fight\", \"Don't Win\", \"Don't Surrender\" - in 23 languages, can be found affixed to a wall in Paupio street in the area. Sanskrit and Hindi versions of the constitution were added on 25th May 2017.\nSome of these articles would be unremarkable in a constitution; for instance, Article 5 simply reads \"Man has the right to individuality.\".  Others are more idiosyncratic; a typical example can be found in Articles 1 (\"People have the right to live by the River Vilnel\u0117, while the River Vilnel\u0117 has the right to flow past people.\"), 12 (\"A dog has the right to be a dog.\") and 37 (\"People have the right to have no rights.\"), each of which makes an unusual apportionment of rights. \nThere are a number of paired articles, such as Articles 16 (\"People have the right to be happy.\") and 17 (\"People have the right to be unhappy.\") which declare people's right to either do or not do something, according to their desire.\nMinister of Foreign Affairs Thomas Chepaitis, Ambassador H. E. Max Haarich, AI-Expert Alex Waldmann and humanoid Roboy formulated an additional article for the Munich Embassy: \"Any artificial intelligence has the right to believe in a good will of humanity.\" This makes the U\u017eupian constitution the world's first constitution to mention artificial intelligence. In September 2018 the constitution was blessed by Pope Francesco during his visit in Vilnius.\n\n\n== Angel of U\u017eupis ==\n\nOn April 1, 2002, a statue of an angel blowing a trumpet was unveiled in the main square. The idea was developed from a desire to erect an angel in memory of animator and caricaturist Zenonas \u0160teinys. It became a symbol of the revival U\u017eupis. The funds were raised by selling miniature copies of the sculpture. The sculptor, Romas Vil\u010diauskas, is also the creator of the U\u017eupis Mermaid.Previously, a temporary sculpture of an egg stood in its place.  After being replaced by the larger statue of Gabriel, the egg was sold at an auction for 10,200 litas and now stands on Pylimo street.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nNotable people who have resided in U\u017eupis include:\n\nFelix Dzerzhinsky, also known as Iron Felix\u2014 Soviet Bolshevik revolutionary and secret police founder\nThe painter and composer Mikalojus Konstantinas \u010ciurlionis\nPolish romantic-comic poet Konstanty Ildefons Ga\u0142czy\u0144ski lived here in 1934-36\nJurgis Kun\u010dinas, author of 2 novels about U\u017eupis, and translator from German\nArt\u016bras Zuokas, former Vilnius mayor\n\n\n== In creative works ==\nThe Republic of U\u017eupis, a 2009 novel by the South Korean author Hailji, chronicles the journey of an Asian man named Hal visiting U\u017eupis to inter the ashes of his father, believing the \"Republic\" to be his ancestral homeland.\nU\u017eupis was the topic of a 2015 piece of music by The Mighty Sieben, featuring the three mottos, \"Don't Fight\", \"Don't Win\", \"Don't Surrender\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nConnolly, Kate (January 29, 2000). \"They tore down Lenin's statue - and raised one to Frank Zappa\".

          "Looking upon the angel, it helps to know the story. Our guide told it like this, Before the unveiling of the angel on the 1st of April 2002, a large egg (sculpture) sat on the column, on a nest of twigs, there are many versions behind this event, we like the one that it",
          "An important historical point, but not much more than that. I have been told that the angel is the symbol of Vilnius; this is the Uzopis version of it. To appreciate it more, take your time to study what Uzopis meant in the past (and maybe still means at present day).",
          "This is a nice statue in Uzupis and makes a good meeting point in the square. There's a quirky story behind the statue which makes it quite interesting. There are a few nice bakeries, bars and a supermarket in the square so it makes it a nice place to visit.",

        "wiki": "Vingis Park is the largest park in Vilnius, Lithuania. Located in a curve of the Neris River, it covers 162 hectares (400 acres). A pedestrian bridge connects the park with \u017dv\u0117rynas. It is used as a venue for various events, especially concerts and sports competitions. It contains a small botanical garden of Vilnius University, stadium, and an amphitheater.\nThe park's history dates back several centuries. In 1965, the park was renovated and adopted to the needs of mass events, such as concerts or political rallies. The amphitheater was built using the design of the modified Estonian Song Festival Grounds in Tallinn. Several major rallies and demonstrations were held there during the course of the Lithuanian independence movement of the late 1980s; a rally on August 23, 1988 drew 250,000 people.\n\n\n== Events ==\nMany celebrities have performed their shows at this venue, including Andrea Bocelli, Elton John, Bj\u00f6rk, Sting, Rod Stewart, Depeche Mode, and famous Lithuanian music groups like Foje, Antis. The record of most attendants was in 1997, when Foje performed their last concert - over 60,000 fans were there.  \nLady Gaga has performed at this venue for her first concert in Baltic country on August 21, 2012 at Vingis Park in Vilnius as a part of her The Born This Way Ball Tour in front of 14,853 people. \nOn November 7, 2016, Robbie Williams announced that he will be performing at the venue on August 16, 2017.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nVingis Stadium\nVingis Park Rugby Stadium\nArchery field\nTennis court\nBasketball court\n\n\n== References ==\nOfficial website\n\n\n== Footnotes ==",

Piotra i Paw\u0142a na Antokolu) is a Roman Catholic church located in the Antakalnis neighbourhood of Vilnius, Lithuania. It is the centerpiece of a former monastery complex of the Canons Regular of the Lateran. Its interior has masterful compositions of some 2,000 stucco figures by Giovanni Pietro Perti and ornamentation by Giovanni Maria Galli and is unique in Europe. The church is considered a masterpiece of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Baroque.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe foundation of the first church in this location is unknown. While digging the foundations for the present-day church, workers found a sculpture of an unknown knight. That inspired a legend that the first wooden church was founded by Petras Go\u0161tautas, a legendary ancestor of the Go\u0161tautai family, well before the official conversion of Lithuania to Christianity by Jogaila in 1387. More likely, the church was founded by Wojciech Tabor, Bishop of Vilnius (1492\u20131507). The wooden church burned down in 1594 but was rebuilt in 1609\u201316. In 1625, Bishop Eustachy Wo\u0142\u0142owicz invited Canons Regular of the Lateran. Their new monastery was officially opened in November 1638. Bishop of Samogitia Jerzy Tyszkiewicz gifted a painting of Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy (Lithuanian: \u0160v\u010d. Mergel\u0117 Marija Maloningoji) to the church and the monastery. The painting was brought by Tyszkiewicz from Faenza, Italy around 1641\u201347, and depicts Our Lady of Graces, patron of Faenza. Even though it was not canonically crowned, it was covered in silver riza and attracted votive offerings.\n\nDuring the wars with Russia in 1655\u201361, the monastery was burned down and the church was destroyed. The construction of the new church was commissioned by the Great Lithuanian Hetman and Voivode of Vilnius Micha\u0142 Kazimierz Pac. It is said that Pac was inspired to rebuild the church after a 1662 incident when he hid in its ruins and thus narrowly escaped death from mutinous soldiers who later killed Wincenty Korwin Gosiewski, Field Hetman of Lithuania, and Kazimierz \u017beromski. Before this project, Pac, having made only a couple relatively minor donations to Bernardines in Vilnius and Jesuits in Druskininkai, was not known as a patron of the church or the arts. Pac, who never married, envisioned that the church would become a mausoleum for the Pac family. The construction works started on 29 June 1668 (the day of the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul) under the supervision of Jan Zaor from Krak\u00f3w and finished in 1676 by Giovanni Battista Frediani. Pac brought Italian masters Giovanni Pietro Perti and Giovanni Maria Galli for interior decoration. The works were interrupted by the founder's death in 1682. According to his last wishes, Pac was buried beneath the doorstep of the main entrance with the Latin inscription Hic Jacet Pecator (here lies a sinner) on his tombstone. At the end of the 18th century, lightning hit the church, knocked down a sculpture which fell and fractured the tombstone; the incident inspired many rumors about Pac and his sins. The tombstone is now displayed on the right wall of the main entrance.The church was finished by Pac's brother, Bishop of Samogitia Kazimierz Pac, and was consecrated in 1701, while the final decoration works were completed only in 1704. The construction of the church revitalized Antakalnis and attracted other nobles: Sapiehas who built Sapieha Palace and S\u0142uszkos who built Slushko Palace. The interior of the church changed relatively little since that time. The major change was the loss of the main altar. The wooden altar was moved to the Catholic church in Daugai in 1766. The altar is now dominated by the Farewell of St. Peter and St. Paul, a large painting by Franciszek Smuglewicz, installed there in 1805. The interior was restored by Giovanni Beretti and Nicolae Piano from Milan in 1801\u201304. At the same time, a new pulpit imitating the ship of Saint Peter was installed. In 1864, as reprisal for the failed January Uprising, Mikhail Muravyov-Vilensky closed the monastery and converted its buildings into military barracks. There were plans to turn the church into an Eastern Orthodox church, but they never materialized. In 1901\u201305, the interior was restored again. The church acquired the boat-shaped chandelier and the new pipe organ with two manuals and 23 organ stops. The dome was damaged during World War II bombings, but was rebuilt true to its original design. When in 1956 Vilnius Cathedral was converted into an art museum by Soviet authorities, the silver sarcophagus with sacred relics of Saint Casimir was moved to the St. Peter and St. Paul's Church. The sarcophagus was returned to its place in 1989. Despite religious persecutions in the Soviet Union, extensive interior restoration was carried out in 1976\u201387.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Exterior ===\n\nThe church is located on a small hill near the Neris River and the former main road to Nemen\u010din\u0117. It is part of a monastery complex that occupies approximately 1.5 hectares (3.7 acres). The churchyard is surrounded by a thick 4\u20135 m (13\u201316 ft) high brick wall that has four small octagonal chapels. The churchyard used to have a small cemetery, but it was demolished in the 19th century. The church is a 17th-century basilica with a traditional cross floor plan and a dome with a lantern allowing extra light into its white interior. However, the dome is lowered and is visible only from a distance. The exterior was copied from the parish church of Tar\u0142\u00f3w, built in 1645\u201355 and most likely designed by the same architect Jan Zaor. The facade is of heavy proportions. It is divided by a prominent balcony, freestanding columns (used for the first time in Lithuanian ecclesiastical architecture), windows, and cornices. The central facade is framed by two bell towers that are circular at the bottom and octagonal at the top. Two brass bells, 60 and 37 cm (24 and 15 in) in height, survive from 1668.The double broken pediment has a relief of Mary standing on a cannon, flags, and other military attributes. Below the relief, Latin inscription reads REGINA PACIS FUNDA NOS IN PACE (Queen of Peace, protect us in peace) and reflects the intentions of the founder Pac and is a word play on his last name. Further below is the main portal. Surrounded by two puttos holding papal tiara (symbol of Saint Peter) and a sword (symbol of Saint Paul), there is a large cartouche with Pac's coat of arms Gosdawa. Two terracotta sculptures depicting Saint Augustine (patron saint of Canons Regular of the Lateran) and Stanis\u0142aw Kazimierczyk (Polish member of Canons Regular) were created in 1674. They measure 2.05 metres (6 ft 9 in) in height. There were many more sculptures on the front and back of the church, but they did not survive. The facade was also decorated with a 172 cm \u00d7 237 cm (68 in \u00d7 93 in) painting depicting Virgin of Mercy protecting people from the plague of 1710 in Vilnius. Imagery of Mary holding broken arrows of god's wrath was borrowed from the painting of Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy that hangs inside the church. Created in 1761, it was restored at least five times and lost its original features. After the last restoration in 2000, it was moved inside the church.\n\n\n=== Interior: decor and central nave ===\n\nSt. Peter and St. Paul's is one of the most studied churches in Lithuania. Its interior has over 2,000 different decor elements that creates a stunning atmosphere. The main author of the decor plan is not known. It could be the founder Pac, monks of the Lateran, or Italian artists. No documents survive to explain the ideas behind the decorations, therefore various art historians attempted to find one central theme: Pac's life and Polish\u2013Lithuanian relations, teachings of Saint Augustine, Baroque theater, etc. Art historian Birut\u0117 R\u016bta Vitkauskien\u0117 identified several main themes of the decor: structure of the Church as proclaimed at the Council of Trent with Saint Peter as the founding rock, early Christian martyrs representing Pac's interest in knighthood and ladyship, themes relevant to the Canons Regular of the Lateran, and themes inherited from previous churches (painting of Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy and altar of Five Wounds of Christ). The decor combines a great variety of symbols, from local (patron of Vilnius Saint Christopher) to Italian saints (Fidelis of Como), from specific saints to allegories of virtues. There are many decorative elements \u2013 floral (acanthus, sunflowers, rues, fruits), various objects (military weapons, household tools, liturgical implements, shells, ribbons), figures (puttos, angels, soldiers), fantastical creatures (demons, dragons, centaurs), Pac's coat of arms, masks making various expressions \u2013 but they are individualized, rarely repeating. The architects and sculptors borrowed ideas from other churches in Poland (Saints Peter and Paul Church, Krak\u00f3w, Sigismund's Chapel of Wawel Cathedral) and Italy (St. Peter's Basilica, Church of the Ges\u00f9).The main entrance is flanked by two large sculptures of Saint Christopher carrying baby Jesus and a skeleton (grim reaper with a cloak and a large scythe) standing on crowns and other symbols of power. Saint Christopher is a protector, but death is still awaits everyone equally and Christians should prepare for it. The vestibule also has a scene of Last Judgment with various monsters and demons. The left side of the vestibule has a small room used as baptistery, while the right has a room for wakes. The latter has a scene of Pilate's court that thematically starts the Stations of the Cross. The colorful stations hang in the central nave and lead to the Altar of the Five Wounds of Christ.The central nave is decorated with evenly spaced sculptures of the twelve apostles. It also has a number of torture scenes from the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire. These martyrs include Saint Sebastian, knights Saint George and Martin of Tours, Saint Maurice and the Theban Legion, Fidelis of Como and Victor Maurus. However, they are not immediately visible as they are placed in niches. Therefore, the nave is dominated by plain white walls that contrast with the opulent decorations elsewhere. From the central nave, the entrance to each of the four chapels has two allegorical female figures, representing eight Beatitudes from the Sermon on the Mount and created according to the iconography of Cesare Ripa. Their placement above the entrance arch is very similar to the Basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo. However, they are not depicted in order but rearranged so that they would better reflect the themes of the chapels.\n\n\n=== Interior: chapels and side altars ===\n\nThe church has one central nave. Similar to the Church of the Ges\u00f9 in Rome, the narrow side aisles are turned into interconnecting chapels. There are four chapels: Women's or Queens', Saint Augustine's, Saint Ursula's, and Soldiers' or Knights'. The Queens' chapel was originally dedicated to Saint Petronilla, traditionally identified as daughter of Saint Peter. The chapel has four figures representing women's virtues: piety, generosity, purity, and assiduousness. The figure of generosity presents a stark social contrast between a wealthy lady and a pauper. Some art historians attempted to associate these figures with Queens of Poland. Painting of Saint Monica, mother of Saint Augustine, hangs in the chapel. The ceiling has scenes of executions and torture of early Christian martyrs, including Saint Fausta and Saint Theodora. The Knights' chapel has four figures of soldiers who became early Christian martyrs, including Saint Martinian, who helped Saint Peter to escape prison, and Saint Florian. The chapel also has a scene of Saint Casimir miraculously helping Lithuanians in the Siege of Polotsk and Saint Wenceslaus fighting with his brother Boleslaus the Cruel. This chapel clearly reflects Pac's interests: he dedicated most of his life to military and thought of himself as a knight. The chapel of Saint Ursula has more figures of early martyrs (Saint Apollonia, Saint Barbara, and Saint Catherine of Alexandria) that emphasize purity. The chapel of Saint Augustine emphasizes his teachings on Holy Trinity as undivided unity.The transept has altars of two brotherhoods that were active in the church: Merciful Mother of God and Five Wounds of Christ. These brotherhoods existed before the current church was built and, therefore, the imagery is inherited from the previous church. The western (left) transept displays the painting of Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy and two large Turkish war drums (timpano, 140 cm (55 in) in circumference) that were seized from the Ottomans in the Battle of Khotyn of 11 November 1673 and granted to the church by its founder Micha\u0142 Kazimierz Pac. The transept ceiling has stucco reliefs from the life of Mary (with Visitation at the center) and crucifixion of Jesus. The Rococo pulpit was installed in 1801\u20131804. Carved of wood in a shape of a boat, it is supported by two tritons from the bottom. It is decorated with gilded details, including reliefs of eagle, bull, lion, and angel which symbolize the Four Evangelists.\n\n\n=== Interior: main altar ===\n\nA noticeable feature is the missing main altar, which is known only from a description found in the inventory from 1766. It was carved from dark wood, gilded, and served as the focal center of the otherwise white interior. The altar had two levels. The upper level had a miraculous painting of Saint Peter that was most likely brought from the previous church. It was surrounded by sculptures of the twelve apostles representing the twelve tribes of Israel or the chosen people. The lower lever had a painting of Saint Paul surrounded by sculptures depicting twelve pagan nations representing the world or the converted people. This altar was moved to the Catholic church in Daugai in 1766 and only fragments survive to the present day. With the loss of the altar, imagery of Saint Paul diminished significantly within the church. The altar as such was not replaced. Instead, Kazimierz Jelski sculpted four prophets (Daniel, Jeremiah, Isaiah and Elijah) while Franciszek Smuglewicz painted the large central painting depicting the emotional final parting of Saint Peter and Paul.Four other paintings hang in the choir: another painting by Smuglewicz depicting Archangel Michael, painting of Saint Mary Magdalene of Pazzi, a formal portrait of founder Micha\u0142 Kazimierz Pac, and a painting of crucified Jesus. This painting depicts a solar eclipse symbolizing crucifixion darkness and is said to be Pac's favorite. Parts of Jesus (crown of thorns, four nails, and perizoma) are covered in metal. The apse has four sculptures that stand inside wall niches, including Saint Jacob, John the Baptist, and resurrected Christ.The ceiling of the apse is decorated with three stucco reliefs depicting the conversion of Paul the Apostle, calling of Saint Peter, and handing over of the keys of Heaven and papal tiara to Peter by Christ. This scene emphasizes that Peter and subsequent popes derived their power directly from God and is a strong Counter-Reformation statement. Above them, there is a relief of the Holy Spirit represented as a dove. The ceiling of the choir has a relief of the dinner at Emmaus. Next to it, there is a Latin inscription that reads domus dei aedificata est supra firmam petram (your house is built on firm rock) which echoes with the inscription on the base of the dome.The left corner between the transept and the choir has a sculpture of Jesus known as Jesus of Antakalnis. The sculpture is life-sized (185 cm (73 in)), made of hardwood, dressed in clothes of white silk and purple velvet, and has a wig of natural black hair. A copy of a statue displayed in the Basilica of Jesus de Medinaceli in Madrid, it is the most prominent example of Spanish Baroque in Lithuania. It depicts the scene of Ecce homo: flogged Christ with a crown of thorns facing an angry mob. The sculpture's hands and head were ordered by Jan Kazimierz Sapieha the Younger from Roman artists in 1700. They were attached to a locally made torso and can be rotated. According to an 1804 canonical visitation, there are sacred relics sealed inside the head of the sculpture. The sculpture was displayed in the main altar of the Trinitarian Church built by Sapieha until the church was converted into an Eastern Orthodox church in 1864. At that time it was moved to its present-day location at St. Peter and St. Paul's. The opposite corner has a stucco sculpture of Saint Francis of Assisi made in the first half of the 20th century.\n\n\n=== Interior: dome and ceilings ===\n\nThe dome's pendentives depict the Four Evangelists. The inscription surrounding the base of the dome (Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram edificabo ecclesiam meam et portae inferi non praevale buntadversus eam: You are Peter (rock) and on that rock I shall build my church and gates of hell shall not prevail against it) is from the Confession of Peter and is the same as that of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. Above it, there are sculptures of four Doctors of the Church: Saint Jerome, Saint Augustine (his sculpture can be seen from the entrance), Saint Ambrose, and Pope Gregory I. Still above them there are scores of angels. The composition culminates with God the Father in the center of the dome as if to say that God sees everything. This composition seems inverted since the Evangelists are below the Doctors, but that could be a purposeful statement to emphasize importance of the Church after the Council of Trent. A boat-shaped chandelier made of brass and glass beads hangs from the middle of the dome and reminds that Saint Peter was a fisherman. Made by craftsmen from Liep\u0101ja and installed in 1905, it had eight seven-branch candle holders.The ceiling is decorated with five frescos that cover 14.94 m2 (160.8 sq ft) which are the second largest ceiling frescoes (after the Pa\u017eaislis Monastery) in Lithuania. The three smaller frescoes above the organ form a triptych from Saint Peter's life: healing a cripple, escape from prison, and vision of a sheet with animals. The other two frescoes depict Quo vadis? and Peter's confrontation with Simon Magus. These frescoes are of a rather simple composition, poorly executed, and lack background detail, but the figures are expressive, making complex, dynamic, almost theatrical movements. The authorship of the frescoes is unknown. Vladas Dr\u0117ma attributed them to Martino Altomonte, while Mieczys\u0142aw Skrudlik suggested Michelangelo Palloni. Mindaugas Paknys, using surviving written records, disproved both hypotheses and attributed the frescoes to Johann Gotthard Berchhoff. Two other frescoes by a different author decorate the sacristies. They depict Jesus saving Saint Peter from drowning and a vision of Stanis\u0142aw Kazimierczyk.\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nPa\u017eaislis Monastery \u2013 another Baroque masterpiece founded by a member of the Pac family\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n\n== External links ==\nPanoramic tour of the church",

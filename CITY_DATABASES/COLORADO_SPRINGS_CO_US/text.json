        "wiki": "Cheyenne Mountain is a triple-peaked mountain in El Paso County, Colorado, southwest of downtown Colorado Springs. The mountain serves as a host for military, communications, recreational, and residential functions. The underground operations center for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) was built during the Cold War to monitor North American airspace for missile launches and Soviet military aircraft. Built deep within granite, it was designed to withstand the impact and fallout from a nuclear bomb. Its function broadened with the end of the Cold War, and then many of its functions were transferred to Peterson Air Force Base in 2006.\nHomesteading on the mountain began in 1867 and the mountain was the site of resorts and retreats beginning in the 1880s. Spencer Penrose, who built The Broadmoor in 1918, bought many of the properties on the mountain and built the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, Cheyenne Mountain Highway, Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun, a lodge on one of the mountain peaks, and a retreat at Emerald Valley. The site of the lodge has become a wilderness Cloud Camp and Emerald Valley is now the site of The Broadmoor's Ranch at Emerald Valley. Land on Cheyenne Mountain that had once been owned by The Broadmoor is now the site of luxury homes. A community, Overlook Colony, that began in 1911 still resides on the mountain.\nThe two parks on and at the base of Cheyenne Mountain are Cheyenne Mountain State Park and North Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on Park. A noticeable feature on the top of one of Cheyenne Mountain's peaks is an antenna farm with transmitters for cellular phone, radio, television, and law enforcement transmitters.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nCheyenne Mountain has three peaks. The southern peak is Cheyenne Mountain's summit at 9,200 feet (2,800 m) in elevation. It was formerly called Mount Albrecht. The antenna farm sits on the middle peak. The northern peak, The Horns, may look to some like the head of a dragon or horns. The peak is 9,200 feet (2,800 m) in elevation.The mountain's boundaries are Rock Creek, which flows from Mount Big Chief through Cheyenne Mountain to the town of Fountain, to the south and Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on to the north. The western side of Cheyenne Mountain is in Pike National Forest, within the Pikes Peak Ranger District. Colorado Springs' skyline features Cheyenne Mountain and Pikes Peak. Other mountain peaks are Mount Arthur, Mount Baldy, Mount Rosa, Cameron's Cone, and Mount Garfield.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nCheyenne Mountain was named for the Cheyenne people. Native Americans found that Cheyenne Mountain was a good source of wood for teepee poles. It was visited by Cheyenne and Arapaho people, who may have sought spiritual inspiration from the mountain's waterfalls. Cheyenne Mountain was used by Ute Native Americans to cross from the plains and benefit from the \"steep slopes and hidden valleys\" to safely travel from enemy tribes that had their horses stolen by the Utes.\n\n\n=== Late 19th century ===\nWilliam Dixon, a rancher, claimed a homestead in the Cheyenne Mountain foothills in 1867. He built a tavern along a trail up Cheyenne Mountain and turned the trail into a toll road, now called Old Stage Road, to Cripple Creek. The road begins as a paved road and is then a dirt road through Pike National Forest. His homestead ultimately became part of The Broadmoor resort.\nThe Cheyenne Mining District was located on Cheyenne Mountain. The Little Suzie gold mine was built by a group of prospectors in the 1870s. Silver and minerals were mined on Cheyenne Mountain in 1883. Towns or resorts built on Cheyenne Mountain included the original Bruin Inn (1884), Watsonville (town named in 1884) and Wade City, also called Wade's Resort, (1885). The first mining claims granted for El Paso County were for the Manganese and Rio Grande lodes on Cheyenne Mountain by January 31, 1885.\n\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\nThe Colorado Springs and Cripple Creek District Railway (Short Line) traversed Cheyenne Mountain\nduring the trip between Cripple Creek and Colorado Springs by 1905. It transported coal, mined ore, and passengers. Also at that time, a carriage road went to Seven Lakes and the summit of Pikes Peak from Cheyenne Mountain.Grace Lutheran Church built a retreat in Emerald Valley in 1904. It is now The Broadmoor's Ranch at Emerald Valley. In 1905, Dr. August McKay homesteaded on 120 acres on the east slope of Cheyenne Mountain. He developed a series of trails and rest houses that led to The Sunshine Inn that he built as a health resort above Old Stage Road. The property was purchased by Spencer Penrose, who had the inn torn down.The Overlook Colony was started in 1911 by a group of Colorado College professors. It first started as a summer retreat for the educators, and grew to include musicians, doctors, artists, generals, oilmen, and an ambassador to India. The Cheyenne Mountain Zoo was built just below and the Will Rogers Shrine built just above this community. Residents manage the Overlook Colony Mutual Water Company that governs water conservation, maintenance, and testing of the water supply from deep within the former Little Susie gold mine.Bert Swisher and Thomas Dixon homesteaded on Cheyenne Mountain in 1917. Dixon resided with his family in a cabin near the top of the mountain in the middle of three valleys. Swisher's cabin was near the present site of the antenna farm at the top of the mountain, which was accessed by Old Stage Road.\n\n\n=== Spencer Penrose and The Broadmoor ===\nCheyenne Mountain became a successful recreational and resort area when Spencer Penrose developed The Broadmoor resort in 1918. The Cheyenne Mountain Cog Railroad provided narrow gauge cog railway service to South Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on from the Broadmoor Casino beginning in 1918. It later offered service from The Broadmoor to the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. Service ended in 1974.In the 1920s, Penrose began to develop on Cheyenne Mountain property on the northern peak that he bought in 1915. He built the Cheyenne Mountain Highway in 1925. In 1926, the Cheyenne Mountain Lodge opened at the top of Cheyenne Mountain. It had a restaurant, a suite for Penrose on the third floor, four guest rooms, and living quarters for servants. Visitors could make the trip up the Cheyenne Mountain Highway on the backs of elephants. The lodge closed in 1961. It was razed in 1976 following years of destruction by vandals. It is now the site of The Broadmoor's Cloud Camp lodge and cabins.\n\nPenrose developed the country's highest zoo at 6,800 feet (2,100 m) in elevation, the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo (1926) on the mountain and Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun (1937) on the northern promontory of the mountain. The Cheyenne Mountain Highway was built for transport to the zoo, shrine, and top of the mountain. The Broadmoor built a ski area on Cheyenne Mountain in 1959. In 1986, the resort closed Ski Broadmoor, but the city of Colorado Springs and Ski Vail stepped in to keep it open. It closed in 1991. The land was sold to the Broadmoor Resort Community Association. Land that had once been owned by The Broadmoor on the mountain was sold and is now the site of luxury homes.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== NORAD operations center ==\n\nIn the 1950s, during the Cold War, the interior of the mountain became a site for the operations center for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). The center, deep within Cheyenne Mountain, was completed in 1966 after spending $142 million and using 500 tons of explosives. The result was an underground city operated by the Air Force. Popular Science wrote in 1965, before the dedication of the facility, that Cheyenne Mountain is the only mountain known to have buildings constructed on the inside of a mountain. It was built to withstand being bombed: eleven multiple-story buildings stand on coil springs to absorb the shock of a blast and it was designed so that up to 800 people could survive fall-out of a nuclear bomb. The buildings are encased in steel, surrounded by granite, and the facility is behind blast-proof doors. It was designed to be the \"nerve center\" for NORAD.The NORAD center has been staffed by Canadian and United States military personnel to monitor North American air space for intercontinental ballistic missiles and incoming Soviet military aircraft. Locally, this military boom during the Cold War included the establishment of the United States Air Force Academy, Peterson Air Force Base, and Fort Carson. After the Cold War, NORAD monitored objects orbiting the earth and aircraft without flight plans. It is also known for monitoring the Christmas Eve orbit of Santa Claus.NORAD used to offer public tours, but due to security concerns they were suspended in 1999. The off-ramp on NORAD road has been staffed by Air Force Security Police since September 11, 2001. Most of the center's operations were moved to Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs in 2006, then in April 2015, the Pentagon reported that a few operations would be moving back in.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Antenna farm ==\nDuring the 1950s, an antenna farm was built on the middle peak of the mountain when Bert Swisher deeded ten acres to Bud Edmonds and several backers and Swisher signed a non-compete agreement. Edmonds, John Browne, and Buck Ingersoll agreed to replace the trails to the area with a real road, which was opened in 1960 by the Cheyenne Propagation Company. There are 700 cell phone, television, radio, and law enforcement transmitters on the antenna farm. The Cheyenne Mountain radio site 145.160 repeater covers south central and southeast Colorado along the Interstate 25 corridor from Monument nearly to the New Mexico border. In 2002, it was operated by the Cheyenne Propagation Company.\n\n\n== Parks and recreation ==\n\n\n=== Cheyenne Mountain State Park ===\nThe City of Colorado Springs and Colorado State Parks purchased 1,680 acres of land to preserve the \"southeastern flank\" of the mountain and its wildlife habitat in 2000. The land, originally the JL Ranch, was slated for development of 2,500 houses. The land was purchased to create the Cheyenne Mountain State Park, which is the only state park in El Paso County. An additional 1,021 acres at the top and east side of Cheyenne Mountain were acquired from 2007 to 2009. The park is now a total of 2,701 acres, part of which is at the base of the mountain and part of which is on Cheyenne Mountain. It has 20 miles of trails.\n\n\n=== Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on ===\nThe 1,600 acre North Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on Park, Starsmore Discovery Center, Seven Falls, and some of Colorado Spring's \"most exclusive neighborhoods\" are located in Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on.  The source of North Cheyenne Creek is in Teller County. South Cheyenne Creek's source, also in Teller County, is Mount Big Chief, near St. Peter's Dome. The flows through Seven Falls in South Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on.North Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on Park was started when the city of Colorado Springs bought 640 acres in North Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on from Colorado College in 1885. An additional 480 acres was donated by General William Jackson Palmer. That land included High Drive, Silver Cascade Falls, and Helen Hunt Falls.  In 1909 the Park Commission called it \"by far the grandest and most popular of all the beautiful ca\u00f1ons near the city\" for its evergreen trees, waterfalls, Cheyenne Creek, and rock formations. Moderate hikes in the canon include Mount Cutler and Columbine trails.The two creeks meet and form Cheyenne Creek near the intersection of North Cheyenne Canyon Road, South Cheyenne Canyon Road, and Cheyenne Boulevard.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Historic trails ===\nTwo historic trails, only shown on the Pikes Peak Atlas, lead to the summit top of Cheyenne Mountain: the unofficial and faintly visible Swisher and the McNeil trails. At the top of the Swisher trail is a meadow and ruins of an old cabin.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nHelen Hunt Jackson's poem, Cheyenne Mountain was published by 1893.\nIn Robert Heinlein's 1966 The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, a lunar colony's revolt against rule from Earth included the complete destruction of Cheyenne Mountain by rocks catapulted from the moon.\nA fictionalized Cheyenne Mountain NORAD base was the setting for the 1983 movie WarGames.\nCheyenne Mountain is the base of the fictional SGC (Stargate Command) and the location of the stargate in the military science fiction show Stargate SG-1.\nThe Mountain was featured in the 2016 film, Independence Day: Resurgence.\nIt is an early command center for the human resistance in L. Ron Hubbard's \"Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000\" (1982, ISBN 1-59212-007-5).\nThe Mountain is a possible choice for the location of XCOM HQ in XCOM Long War, which offers the benefit of already being partially developed.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCheyenne Mountain Country Club, in the Broadmoor neighborhood\nCheyenne Mountain School District 12, which includes Cheyenne Mountain Middle School and Cheyenne Mountain Elementary School\nCheyenne Mountain Charter Academy\nCheyenne Mountain High School\nList of Colorado mountain ranges\nList of Colorado mountain summits\nList of Colorado county high points\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAlbertype Co.

          "We spent most of a day here. Activities start at 10 and are spread out all over the zoo. Bring extra money for feeding the animal opportunities. The air ride is slow and safe, not scary. Sadly the top isn't done and isn't more than a view at this time. We liked the ride, but",
          "My son wanted to visit (we live in Boulder) so we made the trip down early Sunday morning. It wasn\u2019t crowded, so it made for a pleasant experience. The giraffe and elephant feedings are a must do. It\u2019s a cool experience to be that close to the animals.",
          "This is one of the best zoos I have been to. The grounds are very clean. There is a large variety of animals to see. One of the neatest area is the giraffe area. You can get close-up pictures and if you want, you can also feed them. The entire zoo is filled with so many",
          "The whole experience was totally amazing! Very easy to get to. Very easy to navigate with the map they give you at check-in. Plenty of food/drink places. And wonderful connections with so many different kinds of wildlife, from monkeys to Grizzly Bears! We ended our day",

          "This was a beautiful zoo with loads of animals of different species. The giraffe area was family favorite. $3.00 gets you three (3) leaves of lettuce to feed giraffes. Expensive, yes. But worth it. The zoo is very hilly and a lot of walking. Wear comfy footwear. Primate area",
          "Was another great trip to this zoo and beat the Denver zoo anyday. The bears were very active that day and loved that you can feed the giraffes here at anytime during your visit. This is a must go.",
          "Absolutely wonderful! This zoo is gorgeous! We got there fairly early (10am) and there were no lines. We fed the giraffes, watched the keepers feed the lions, and visited all the other animals.",
          "Beautiful place to wander about and mingle with the kitties and feed the giraffes. Wear comfortable shoes, it's hilly.",
          "This is an unusual zoo. Right on the mountainside. Uses the actual hillside for the animals homes. Small enough to see it all. Fun to feed the giraffes & the parakeets. My grands loved that, It was a sunny fairly warm winters day. Animals were happy to be out in the sun.",

          "Was quite surprised when I took my grandkids. For those that are interested I am uncapable of walking far distances I had a scooter but it did not last long. Many hills. Yet they do offer rides they have these covered vehicles to keep rain and sunshine from harming you. Although",
          "We took a family trip to Colorado Springs and discovered this gem tucked up on a mountain side. The exhibits and animals are absolutely incredible.",
          "If you are going to visit a zoo on your trip, this is the one to see. You will never see a zoo like it the world. For starters, the whole thing is set into the side of Cheyenne Mountain, but in such a way as to be practically invsible. The walk between animal enclosures winds",

          "I know they're building larger facilities for some of the animals, but the giraffe enclosure as well as a few others seem a wee bit small. I felt bad for the bull giraffe pacing circles in his small enclosure. It was fun to feed them lettuce (kind of pricey). The orangutans and",

          "Came here with family and a young child. Never experienced a zoo on a mountain before but I heeded warning and was prepared for all the uphill walking. The giraffes were the fun part. Felt a little sad for the lions though. The sky ride was a fun additional attraction and was",
          "We make a habit of visiting zoos everywhere we travel. We didn't know what to expect in Colorado Springs, but certainly didn't expect such a superb experience as this. Perched on a mountainside above the historic Broadmoor Hotel, the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo packs a great variety",
          "Our favorite part was feeding the giraffes. I have never been so close to a giraffe before. I would go to this zoo again. Clean and fun!",

          "This was a great experience! We took our 7 month old grandbaby and she loved it. The giraffes are amazing. It's a smaller more intimate zoo with more room for each animal. We loved the way it was set up. We will definitely visit again!",
          "I've been to larger zoos in major cities, but this one stands out for its variety and viewing ease. A wonderful experience. Don't miss a face-to-face with the giraffes!",

          "This zoo is beautiful! Spectacular views out over the city & mountain. We have visit many zoos when we travel and Cheyenne Mountain Zoo literally is probably is Number 1 in the country. The animal habitats are natural, animals seem active. Fantastic experience!",
          "My family and I attended boo at the zoo. It was over crowded, my son was tripped and fell, the wait was more than 2 hours to get in. We missed all the shows and events because they didn't get us to the event nor have enough parking to support the event. Terribly organized and",
          "This is a fairly small zoo so doesn't require a whole day. In addition to a nice (but small) assortment of animals, the scenery is lovely. Make sure you feed the giraffes! The roughness of their tongues is quite surprising as they eat right out of your hand!",
          "This zoo is awesome! One of the first experiences you'll find is the giraffes -- you can feed them lettuce and get up-close to them outside! The other exhibits are a bit more removed, but the enclosures are designed so you can see the animals well. The bears are right through",
          "This zoo is Amazing! We went on a cooler day and it was super quiet which had the animals very alert and active! You get super close to the animals, the views are spectacular and getting to feed the giraffes was so cool! Highly recommend- worth every penny!",
          "We took our grand children (ages 3 & 5) to the zoo on a spectacular Fall day. We took a stroller for the 3 year old. They had a great time. Our favorite animals were the giraffes. We fed lettuce to them. The lions, bengal tigers, mountain lions and grizzly bears were all",
          "You do need to walk uphill but you can take a shuttle for about 2 dollars I think. Feed animals and walk over the elephant enclosureand lots of benches to rest or go and get yourself something to eat from pizza to deli to grill its great",
          "I have been to many zoos but this one was Really amazing Lion was calling his sons, loud growl excellent to witness. Friendly staff",
          "The zoo seems rundown and not sure of the welfare of the animals. I have been to zoos all over the country and this is by far my least favorite. Many better things to do in Colorado Springs.",
          "Highlights of my 4, 7, and 10 year olds: feeding giraffes, petting giraffes, watching the baby giraffe, seeing baby meerkats, feeding the elephants when the zoo keepers happened to be doing a presentation at that time, feeding birds and having them land on their shoulders and",
          "I live in Colorado Springs and am always so impressed when I visit. The setting is unique and always something interesting is happening. Do not miss this",
          "Despite an unusual snow the day before, we had a lovely visit to the zoo. We were lucky enough to feed the giraffes and see the elephants at feeding time. A wonderful zoo to visit.",
          "Our plan for the day was fairly simple: Leave Denver early, get to Cheyenne Mountain Zoo close to opening time, spend 2-3 hours, grab some food on site and then head over to Canon City, our next stop. In part due to unexpected circumstances, we somewhat were able to accomplish",
          "A wonderful zoo set on the side of the mountain. We love to grab a bite to eat here and look out over the city of Colorado Springs.",
          "This place will not disappoint. The views are worth the cost of admission. The animals appear to be well cared for and you can even interact with the giraffes and wallaby\u2019s. It is build on a mountain so there are steep inclines but they have a shuttle that will take you around",
          "This zoo is not like any other definitely stands out all on its own the fact that it\u2019s up 6,714 ft above sea level is incredible. And it\u2019s on 140 acres ( 40 which are in use)of pure beautiful mountain. They had some areas under construction which means it\u2019s only going to get",
          "This is by far the best small zoo I've ever been to. The animals and enclosures are both great. The layout of the park is easy to follow and makes the experience pretty fun. Long lines on the weekends, but definitely worth the visit.",
          "Wow what an impressive Zoo. Awesome views from everywhere lots of fun interactions available for an extra charge. They have great access to bathrooms everywhere. The animals look so healthy and well taken care of. My husband even got to hold a snake.",
          "That is what they are know for. Only zoo literally on the side of a mountain. We are all born and raised in Colorado. Very few experiences in any other state that are as unique, and cannot get in any other place. This is one of the many reasons people come to Colorado ,no",
          "We loved our visit. The enclosures and animal spaces were truly a unique way to interact with the animals.",
          "Truly enjoyed visiting this zoo. It\u2019s hands on, educational and allows for close up experience with the animals. The smaller size of this zoo makes it easy to navigate. We listened to a lecture about elephant care and feeding, then had the opportunity to feed the elephants. We",
          "The zoo in Cheyenne is a must when visiting this beautiful city. There is a great giraffe area and the kids will love feeding lettuce leaves to the hungry, not shy, animals. Probably the largest rhino I've ever seen can also be a stop along the many walkways as you visit this",
          "This zoo was started by Spencer Pernrose in the early 20th Century and is on the side of Cheyenne Mountain, making it the highest zoo in elevation in the US. Admission includes a trip to the Will Rogers Shine of the Sun, about 5.5 miles away. The zoo has the largest giraffe",
          "We had been to the zoo when you were ago it was absolutely great. It is clean and well done the best part is the giraffes. We fed the dress we walked all around and enjoyed our visit I got to see Jason but not to meet him and talk to him personally.",
          "This zoo is great! Unique layout! Definitely feed the giraffes if you get the opportunity. Great view of Colorado Springs.",
          "This zoo is really cool. Up in the side of the mountains, the natural setting with the topography makes for a great experience. It is also very well laid out and has some really cool animals. The Rocky Mountain area was especially cool with the Grizzly exhibit, but the",

          "Easy to see how this is consistently recognized as one of the best zoos in the country. The animal exhibits are as natural as they can be and the collection is carefully curated. Awesome sky features allow visitors to look down into many exhibits. Animals are well cared for and",
          "Had such a great time here. The giraffes are so much fun. It\u2019s set on a mountainside and is well kept. All the enclosures make it easy to view the animals up close.",

          "they didn't have a lot of different animals, but there is a lot of exhibits worth visiting at the zoo. The Griaffes are a highlight. You can feed them. And the education session was great. Enjoyed the hippo education session too. Loved the walibee and her baby.",
          "This is a great zoo. They have done a wonderful job with the space that they have and have made so very nice living environments for the animals. I really like the variety of events that the zoo puts on. Its a great place to go for a nice walk and see some awesome animals.",
          "One of the best Zoos I have ever been to. Very interactive and you can tell these animals are take care of.",
          "Panoramic views of the surrounding area while walking through this zoo. It is semi-strenuous uphill walking most of the way in a series of switchbacks, so wear comfortable shoes! The giraffe encounter was AMAZING! My wife giggled herself silly feeding the critters and being",
          "We live in Colorado Springs and are members of the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. Love this zoo. They are constantly making improvements. The Asia and African areas are awesome. We get to be up close and interact with the giraffes. The bears, cats and elephants have beautiful new",
          "I just love the challenge of walking around the zoo. I always feel like a got a pretty good workout after, which I like.",
          "I've never visited a zoo that was on the side of a mountain before so this was a must see while I was in Colorado Springs. They charge a nominal fee, their animals were somewhat active the day I went and you will definitely get your workout in with walking up and down the hills.",
          "We live in Colorado Springs and it has been a long time that we have visit the zoo. A lot of new sites to see.",
          "My wife and I have been to nearly every zoo in America in cities with populations of 500,000 or greater.....In my opinion, this is one of the best in the nation....It sits in the mountains above Colorado Springs at an altitude of 7400 feet above sea level and is laid out",
          "I am a giraffe but! You can feed the giraffes here and watch them interact with each other which is so fantastic! The whole zoo is very clean and very nice!",
          "This is a great zoo with more opportunities to interact with animals than most zoos offer. We fed giraffes, chickens, and birds - such a cool experience! Also included in your zoo ticket is a visit to the Shrine of the Sun. I highly recommend making your way up to the shrine",

          "This zoo is a must see if you are visiting Colorado Springs....it is one of the best zoos we've ever been to. We were able to feed the giraffes lettuce and watch a couple of informative short shows about different animals as we walked through. The lions and chimps were active",
          "Amazing selection of giraffe, primates and mountain animals in a lovely setting. Take the ski lift to the top for the view.",
          "Surprisingly happy animals even though it\u2019s a zoo. Lots of room for each animal. Very engaging arrangement. Loved the zebras, giraffes, lions, kangaroos. Nice hike from area to area.",
          "My friend (who happens to be blind) and I visited this amazing conservation zoo in August. We wanted a more \u201ctactile\u201d - hands on adventure than those of my \u201crock formation seeking\u201d teammates. The employees were super friendly and accommodating of my friend\u2019s needs! We fed the",
          "A very long day. The staff at the zoo is very friendly. If you are planning on walking the zoo you need to know it is uphill and I mean uphill. Don't let this deter you. There are golf carts to give you a ride to the top so you can walk down. This is much easier. You can",
          "Everyone needs to visit this zoo at least once in their lifetime. I was told it is the only one in North America of its type and I believe it. Some of my favorite things there were the sky tram ride by chair type lift up and back down the mountain. Maximum of 4 people per lift",
          "The zoo is nicely laid out for walking. The habitats are clean and the animals seemed well cared for. The chair lift is a must because it provides not only an overlook of the zoo but also an amazing view of the surrounding area.",
          "This zoo makes you appreciate the animals more because they help you understand how close to extinction each animal is. Smaller zoo, but has plenty to see & do. They do have picnic areas if you want to avoid buying higher priced snacks & lunch. I really enjoyed feeding the",
          "Learned on one of the other tours that this zoo was created by the founder of the Broadmoor. This zoo lives up to the Broadmoor standards. It was amazing. Since it\u2019s in the mountains the animal enclosures are at head level, unless they are seeking refuge under a bridge or what",
          "These zoo made you really appreciate the many animals that are endangered or were at one time. Was able to feed the giraffes. Had a picnic lunch on the property & glad we did. Food & drink prices were too high! Really enjoyed this family-friendly zoo.",
          "I took my daughter to this zoo and she fed the giraffes and the elephants. We had an excellent time on the sky lift and saw a moose.",
          "Really well laid out - up the side of a mountain, so a little challenging if you have a wheelchair or stroller, but great animal displays!",
          "This is a great Zoo! I think the highlight was feeding the giraffes lettuce. You buy it right there so it is safe for them and convenient for you.\ud83e\udd92\ud83d\udcf7 Plus it makes for great photo ops \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a! The newest addition to the Zoo giraffes is baby \"Vivian\" what a cutie!\ud83e\udd92 We had an",
          "I kind of felt like I was in Jurassic Park. It was so beautiful. Lots of walking but they had a shuttle to get you around if you needed it. Great food!!!!",
          "Early morning visit is the best. Our visit was 2 hr.+ Close up and personal with the giraffes and wallabies, demonstration with the health care of the elephants, etc. Zoo is at 6712 ft. elevation with outstanding vistas of the area. Beautifully maintained and helpful staff",
          "This experience was a gift from our son to his dad for his birthday. He purchased an animal encounter which allowed 4 admissions to the park and the encounter for all. It was amazing and so different than other zoos. Loved the giraffes, of course, but our animal encounter was",
          "The zoo is not large but has a great variety of animals. They are attractively displayed. The giraffe exhibit is especially good with the people raised to the level of the giraffes' heads. Since many people feed the giraffes, they are quite friendly and interactive with",
          "We love this zoo! Plenty of great animals within an easy to navigate zoo. Nestled in a mountain with great views of the plains. LOVE the giraffe feeding exhibit and wallabie exhibit. Awesome!",
          "We had a cloudy day and decided to visit the zoo. Great experience. You must feed the Giraffes!!!!!!!!!",
          "It was a hot day, but they had lots of cooling stations. Definitely catch the 2:45 grizzly bear feeding. Plan on getting a beer and pizza at Pizza With a View. This zoo is well up on the side of Cheyenne Mountain and is quite scenic. Not cheap, but a day well spent.",
          "Good for the whole family. Well thought out plan with areas represented by colors, such as Africa is green, Australia is purple. That's just an example. Animals are well cared for.",
          "My 11 year old LOVED it- and the older boys did to (15 and 17). Feeding the giraffes was a real treat...",
          "Shady lanes wind you through exhibits that go the extra length to be hospitable to the inhabitants. Famous for their Girraff exhibit (we petted one on the cheek!!!) the animals looked exceptionally healthy and taken care of. We saw some that we had never even heard of like the",
          "Great unique zoo with fantastic views. More interactive than many zoos which is great. But it is on the side of a mountain and all pathways are very steep making it challenging for a wheelchair user to get around. Worth the visit for everyone else!",
          "I\u2019ve been to several zoos in my lifetime, but this one is at the top of my favorites list. From getting to be eye level with the giraffes to walking freely among the wallabies, I had a wonderful time.",
          "The zoo is fantastic. Love all the exhibits especially the ability to fed giraffes. I wanted to brag on an employee today. I was taking a photo by the wallabies and dropped my wedding band. I realized it half an hour later and ran back to that location frantically as that was",
          "Went here while on vacation with 6 grandkids. The animals are close enough to see. A lot of baby animals. Feeding the Giraffes was a highlight then we happened to be there during the Rhino feeding time which my granddaughter was able to do. Awesome! It\u2019s worth the shuttle",
          "What a beautiful zoo. If you love giraffes, this is the place for you. The zoo lets you feed the giraffes and it is a wonderful experience. My husband and I enjoyed the entire zoo and the staff was very helpful and friendly.",
          "Loved this place! You get close to the animals and you have to feed the giraffe's. The BBQ was fantastic but you could feed two people off one order",
          "This zoo is wonderful. There us a skylift to take you for a ride above the zoo with amazing views. So many different animals to see!! Be sure to check out the orangutans! Admission includes Roy Rogers Shrine of the Sun. You drive your car along a winding road up the mountain to",
          "I came with the chromosome 18 group. This was the coolest zoo. The first thing I did was I got to feed the giraffes which was really cool. Then we took the go cart shuttle to the top. We enjoyed all the animals. Some animals we got to see were the porcupines, bears,orangutans,",
          "We took our family including our 7 and 1 year grandchildren to the zoo. This is the best zoo we have been too! There is a wide variety of animals like other zoos have. However, part of what makes this experience so great is the zoo sits on the side of a mountain. The layout with",
          "This is a great zoo! Be prepared to walk up and down hills though. The views from the top are breathtaking! It has many of the typical animals you would find in a zoo. I like that they have it divided into areas where you would naturally find the animals. The goat pen is great",
          "Great Zoo in and around the Mountain. Lot to see, it was a little hot and humid, some of the animals were not visible. The giraffe area is great for all ages. If you truly want to interact, you must buy the lettuce. Could be hard to get pictures if your not feeding them",
          "The Cheyenne Mountain Zoo is amazing and affordable. With large animals such as giraffes to small animals like timber wolves, this zoo has an exhibit to please anyone. You can actually feed the giraffes by hand. At less than $20 admission, it's affordable by almost anyone.",
          "If you ever get a chance to attend a special event here, do! We enjoy Moonlight on the Mountain annually and is one thing I never get tired of. Beautiful views, well kept exhibits, gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous. You won't regret going.",
          "This is my favorite zoo around!!! I drive over an hour just to go to this zoo. If I lived closer I'd be there at least once a month. If you have the time it's a must see. Wear good walking shoes as this zoo is not flat. There are lots of hills.",
          "We have been taking our kids here for years, and they still love it as teens. Having been to some other great zoos in the US such as Omaha, Columbus, and the Smithsonian Zoo in DC (among others), I\u2019d say this ranks up there with the best as far as a unique zoo experience. I",
          "We love this zoo, it\u2019s so much more interactive than the Denver zoo. The animals seem well cared for. We saw a baby orangutan the last time and it was so adorable. Lots of inclines, long bathroom lines on busy days. We took a shuttle ride from the high school which made things",
          "Our family loves this zoo and all of the interactive experiences available. Feeding the giraffes is the best!!! Beautiful setting and so much fun for all ages!! Lots of walking up and down hill so wear good walking shoes.",
          "I highly recommend this zoo. What a way to spend an afternoon. My kids ages, 15 and 10 loved the eye level feeding of the giraffes.",
          "One of the members of our group really loves going to Zoos, so we decided to check it out. It's a very nice Zoo, the giraffes are really fun! I would get there when they open because as we were leaving the line just to park was miles long. The tram is definitely worth the few",
          "We came here with our grandkids. We all had a very enjoyable time. We came early on a weekday and the parking lots were already filling up. The zoo is a little more compact than others we've seen but is on a hill so requires some good walking shoes. There's still a lot to see",
          "Giraffes steal the show!!!!! Plan for lots of walking but overall a fun time. Will definitely go back.",
          "We had a great time at this zoo - go on a week day if you can, it is $5 less per person. There are a lot of opportunities to feed animals here (for a lot of extra money), but keep in mind that does make the animals a little more aggressive. The first stop is the giraffes and my",
          "Arrive early and buy tickets online if you can. Such a unique zoo in the mountains! You can bring in your own food and drink but there are eateries on the compound. You are greeted by the giraffes who are not shy! They will photo bomb you looking for food which you can buy to",
          "We had so much fun at the zoo with our 1 and 5 year old. We go to the Denver Zoo often and this was a fun change of pace. We didn\u2019t even see it all after a few hours there. It is pretty hilly as it\u2019s literally build into the side of a mountain. The first thing we did was feed",
          "My children are animal lovers and we make it a point to visit zoos on all of our trips. I\u2019m at a loss for how the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo is the 6th best in the country. If it was for food, I\u2019d agree\u2014 fantastic, tasty, healthy cuisine available at a ZOO! And the setting is lovely\u2014",
          "We come down from Denver for this zoo. I can't say enough great things. Opportunities to feed not only giraffes, but elephants, rhinos, budgies, goats and chickens. If you arrive early in the morning I suggest going straight to the primate world to have more of an interactive",
          "I was expecting the worst, but surprisingly, my kids enjoyed themselves. The zoo is way up the hill (?), so you wind through the neighborhood of the \u2018haves\u2019 on your way, enjoy that. Parking wasn\u2019t terrible. Queue up, pay zoo prices for admission, throw some make believe coins",
          "Really cool! Loved feeding the giraffes and the birds. Great to see new animals that I haven\u2019t seen at other zoos. Kind is steep hills. Take lots of water while attending in the summer. Also take time and enjoy the huge misting fans throughout the park.",
          "Such a great experience, beautifully kept Zoo , amazing animals, reptiles, insects & bugs. Feeding the Giraffes & Elephants was so much fun for all ages.",
          "Gorgeous zoo with a real attention to the experience of man and animal together, not just walking through a set of cages. Makes use of the natural topography, so there\u2019s lots of twists and climbs and breathtaking vistas at every turn. Good food too!",
          "This is the best zoo I have visited! The layout makes it easy to visit all the animals & exhibits without any backtracking. The views are gorgeous since it is situated up in the mountains. My teenage girls & my 3 year old niece loved feeding the giraffes. We have fed them at",
          "Came to Cheyenne Mountain Zoo to celebrate a birthday. Saturday morning around 10:20 am the parking lot was packed. Had to wait 10 minutes to park. Daughter had to wait 20 minutes. Come early for hassle free parking. We purchased 2 family memberships. Worth every penny. Go twice",
          "This is the most awesome zoo ever. The staff is amazing and friendly. The animals are well cared for and the zoo is exceptionally clean. We are very proud members. We watched last year as the staff cared for a baby giraffe that has so many problems yet they were diligent in",
          "We loved this place, seeing that where we live it\u2019s 2 hrs to the closest zoo, this was an amazing day we had. So much to see, and love how some of the animals are just out and about running around! Amazing experience!",
          "We are spoiled by an amazing zoo here at home soooo that being said, we were quite disappointed by this zoo. For the cost of $74 to get the 4 of us in......not even close to worth it. It reminded us of our zoo here in our city back in the 80s. The highlight was the opportunity",
          "A great family day spent in a relaxing and wonderful animal centered zoo! Al the animals well treated and they had plenty of busy enrichment activities - inspiring to me. Great views of are from tree top mountain hill zoo. Able to spend some relax time at a zoo snack bar",
          "If you concern about, would your kid enjoy it or not- stop thinking and just go. Check the weather, 99% of the zoo is outside adventure. Don't forget to try sky ride and drive all the way to \"Shrine of the Sun\" it absolutely worth time and money.",
          "Very big zoo with tons to do! Love being in the mountain and enjoying nature with the animals! great experience all around!",
          "It is a nice zoo. the prices are a little high though. The zoo is also on a huge hill so there is a lot of up hill walking. but the sights of not only the animals but Colorado Spring are unbeatable.",
          "What a place! We have a world class zoo very close to where we live but this was out of the ordinary! It's in a beautiful location and everything is so clean and nice! We started out by feeding the giraffes. That was a real highlight for the kids. Everything was just so up close",
          "Amazing zoo, beautiful views, worth the money, would definitely recommend. Wish we could\u2019ve saw the penguin exhibit but it wasn\u2019t finished",
          "Best zoo I\u2019ve ever been to. The giraffe feeding experience was by far my favorite. They have spray fans located through the zoo to cool off and also shuttle service Available through out the zoo for $2 for the entire day. Great clean zoo and take advantage of driving to the top",
          "This zoo is incredible! The animals are well cared for, and have the space they need. I enjoyed watching the workers interact with the animals, especially one very spoiled porcupine \ud83d\ude09 Definitely worth the visit!",
          "This was one of our favorite experiences in Colorado Springs. A very unique zoo, it is situated down the side of the mountain. You must either walk to the top or ride one of their golf carts; the ski lift takes you to a separate area.",
          "My granddaughter and I had a wonderful time at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. We must have walked 10 miles but it was worth it! She fed goats, chickens, giraffe and an elephant. A must see.",
          "This zoo is very nice! It was one of the more expensive things we visited on our vacation. And it is pertinent to know that a lot of the booths require cash only for payment. (Giraffe feeding, etc) We enjoyed the exhibits and Mountain View\u2019s.",
          "Very beautiful zoo! Animals in natural habitats, great scenery, in the mountains, feeding the giraffes is a must do, they are very friendly",
          "Unique Zoo! You get up close to animals and feeding the giraffes was a lot of fun! It was a very hot day but we still enjoyed it. There is shade spots and their cooling fans are a treat. We had a great shuttle driver Kay that was very accommodating and helpful.",
          "We sort of went here on a lark as something we had planned on was so crowded. So glad we did. It\u2019s location on the side of the mountains makes for a lot of up and down walking but it was worth it. They do offer a shuttle at two bucks a person if you need it. While not huge the",
          "We took all of our kids, ages ranging from 5-15, and we all had a blast. We were disappointed though that the aquatic areas were closed due to remodeling so we weren\u2019t able to see a large portion of the animals. We enjoyed the sky lift ride and sloth that crawled around in the",
          "I didn\u2019t expect to find one of the world\u2019s best zoos during our travel to Colorado Springs but we did and it didn\u2019t disappoint at all. We had a great time overall especially feeding the giraffes and elephants!!!",
          "We are not zoo people, but man - we had SUCH a great time at this zoo. The views are incredible and you get really up close and personal with the animals. Make sure you leave time for some BBQ or pizza and a beer in the cafes perched at the top - totally worth the price of",
          "This is a great zoo with several unique exhibits. Feeding the giraffes and one of the elephants were the highlights for the kids. The young orangutans were so awesome also. Make sure you are ready to walk though as the whole zoo is hilly.",
          "Had a great time and the new Australian walk about was great! Parking and transport make this place a bit of a challenge but overall worth the money.",
          "We debated on going to this zoo because we have a great one back home in Cincinnati. We were glad we went! Both zoos have nice features. The Cheyenne Mountain Zoo has animals native to the region (moose, grizzlies, etc.) as well as other interesting exhibits for the giraffes",
          "We caught a bus over to the zoo since parking was full. Easy trip to and from. Zoo is very large and easy to miss things if you aren\u2019t looking at the map. We went in the afternoon. Weren\u2019t many animals out where you could see them.",
          "Prepare for a lot of up hill walking (or you can pay $2 and take a shuttle). We arrived at opening and a lot of the animals were not active. The setting of this zoo is beautiful. Sometime in the future the area for penguins will be open. The shire on top is worth the drive",
          "Ohmigosh, I can't say enough good things about this zoo! We fed the giraffes, petted the wallabies and snakes, watched lions, tigers and elephants perform, and saw numerous babies, including a newborn giraffe, 3 mountain lion cubs, and baby monkeys. So fun! We highly",
          "This is the best zoo I have ever been. I normally don\u2019t like zoos because the animals are trapped in cages, but the this zoo lets their animals have more freedom. The sloth and the wallaby\u2019s are loose in their habitats as you walk through, and all the other animals have a lot of",
          "Had a blast! The zoo was awesome. Love the giraffes. We got lucky and the newest baby was born the day before and we were one of the first few to view her for the first time. Make sure to check out the Will Roger's Monument at the top its included in the zoo entrance fee. View",
          "My family absolutely loved this zoo!! Everyone was so friendly and the exhibits were so amazing. Don\u2019t miss feeding the giraffes and visiting the elephants. The grizzly bear program was so cool!",
          "This is a wonderful interactive zoo for families. We took visiting family to the zoo and everyone had an amazing experience and time there. The exhibits are totally worth viewing as many are pieces of art intertwined with the animals and reptiles. Very cool and far from your",
          "I had a wonderful time at this zoo. I got to see many different animals today. I even got to see animals that I didn't see at San Diego Zoo. There were a few out of their exhibit but not many. My kids and I had fun feeding the giraffes and the birds. I was greatful for the",
          "This is rather lengthy but might save folks some money and keep them from being disappointed. We paid $80 for 3 of us, including admission, the sky ride ($4pp) and use of the tram ($2pp). There is absolutely nothing at the top of the sky ride...at all. Sky ride folks were",
          "My husband and I were traveling through Colorado Springs with our two year old son, and someone had recommended that we take him to Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. First, I was shocked that there was no reciprocity with other AZA zoo memberships. I mentioned to my husband that $50 is",
          "Fantastic zoo. The view is amazing. The animals are so well taken care of. I took my 3 kids and mom this time, while we were traveling to CO. Do the giraffe feeding! It's such a fun experience. The cost of entry is a little high, but definitely worth every penny. The price is",
          "We enjoyed our time at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. The kids got to feed giraffes. When in the Australia habitat they had wallaby\u2019s loose( it in cages). It was amazing. You can pay to have employees ride you to the top of the zoo to see exhibits. We decided to walk but if done",
          "Wonderful habitats and enclosures especially for the elephants. Misters to keep people cool and several places to eat. You can buy lettuce to feed the giraffes at their head level which was lots of fun.",
          "Have no doubt why this zoo is rated one of the top 10 in the land. Fabulous views of the animals, including many opportunities to interact with them! Fabulous views of the land below since this is on the mountain side as well. Plan on walking uphill a lot or get the $2 all day",
          "Great zoo with lots of different animals. Well kept, animals are well taken care of. Great for kids to visit.",
          "We took our granddaughter and family here. We were the visitors as they live here. It was a lovely experience. The kids fed birds and giraffes, learned about alligators/crocodiles, and saw many interesting animals in habitats built to meet their needs. It's a hilly walk but",
          "I took the 2 eight year old grandchildren for about 5 hours and we had a wonderful time. The zoo is large and has so many different exhibits. Some indoors, some outdoors, and some you can also see from the slow-moving sky ride. We probably will make 3 trips to see everything, as",
          "You won't be disappointed if you spend the money to go here. We easily figured out why it was ranked in the top 10 zoos in the U.S. We loved being up close to the animals and not seeing all of them through glass. Sometimes they would be hiding in the more natural",
          "I've been to a lot of wonderful zoos (Omaha, San Diego, Denver) but my hometown zoo is my favorite because of its setting. Eyepopping views, nice place to stroll, great collection.",
          "If you visit Colorado Springs you don't want to miss this one. It's a wonderful zoo! The exhibits are great, we loved the grizzly bear one, we especially liked seeing them swimming and splashing in the water. The giraffes are a big hit with the kids and they have fun feeding",
          "Get there early as the parking lot fills up quickly. Nice zoo, quiet a bit of walking for little kids. Plenty of things to do. The sky ride was good, with great views of the surrounding area.",
          "We decided last minute to go to the zoo so we only had about 2 hours to see everything, which ended up to be perfect as it only took us an hour and a half. I would give this an excellent rating, however the aquatics was closed for construction. I really enjoyed feeding the",
          "We didn't really have enough time to experience the zoo completely but didn't want to miss it. We made the most of the time that we had and were so impressed!! The habitats and animals were amazing. There were great restaurants and kiosks throughout. A shuttle service for",
          "Awesome zoo, best one we have ever been too! Built into a mountain with a great ski lift ride over the top. A lot of the exhibits are interactive, which is awesome! You can feed the Giraffes and walk around with the wallabies. Great for all ages!",
          "This is without a doubt the most impressive zoo I have had the pleasure to enjoy. The giraffe experience is worth the visit alone. However, the design and setting of this zoo is so well done with allowing you to enjoy remarkable access to and viewing the animals. I cannot",
          "We have been to zoos all over the US, and the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo is one of the most unique zoos. Plan to do lots of walking and definitely pay extra for the sky ride.",
          "My family visited the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in June 2019. We went first thing in the morning so the crowds weren't too bad. The exhibits are well kept and very natural for the animals. We enjoyed feeding the giraffes and seeing many of the other animals fed. The zookeepers",
          "In my opinion, the coolest part of this zoo were the giraffes. You can buy lettuce for either $1 or $5 to feed them. Highly recommend that. We arrived around 1:30pm. We saw the signs telling us the parking lot was full so go park at this other location and ride the shuttle.",
          "Loved all the exhibits and animals. bummed out that that grizzly bear and wolves wouldn't come out to be seen but everything else was cool. we took about 3 hours and saw all the exhibits. young kids would definitely love it.",
          "Had a great day at the zoo. Loved it all. Feeding the giraffes was awesome. All of the animals were beautiful and healthy.",
          "Love the layout of this zoo. Because of being on the mountain they had to build the zoo more vertically than horizontally. This allows you to see the exhibits from the front, back and many if them from above which gives a great view of the animal. Plus add in the amazing",
          "This zoo has amazing views. They really take advantage of being on the mountain. Feeding the giraffes was fun for all of us. You do have to pay for this. We also enjoyed the elephants. Due to the heat, a lot of the animals were in their enclosures or in shaded areas so",
          "This zoo is one of the best I have been to! Feeding the giraffes was definitely the highlight of the trip. I did think the entry fee was a little high compared to what I am used to ($20 per adult and even more if you go Friday-Sunday), but maybe that is just typical Colorado",
          "I couldn\u2019t have been happier with my family\u2019s experience at this zoo. The zoo has excellent exhibits, animals that are well cared for, and great hands-on experiences. We were able to feed giraffes, watch grizzlies play/wrestle in the water, per wallabies, and listen to",
          "Go slow and enjoy your day because it does take a few hours to see the zoo. I traveled with a seven yr old and we spent 4.5 hours exploring the zoo. Giraffes and wolf exhibit were our favorites. Food cost wasn\u2019t justified for quality of what we received but overall we had a",
          "Zoo was amazing. Problem is it is steep with a lot of incline walking which may be a problem with older individuals or those that may have a issue with walking/health. The sky tram that we planned on using to reduce the uphill walking was broken the entire day. In another",
          "My family happened to have some free time during vacation and decided to stop by the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. I work at a Zoo, and always enjoy seeing other institutions. We had no idea what to expect and were delighted when we happened upon the \u201celephant snack time\u201d. Paula,",
          "This is by far, the best zoo I've ever been to. The exhibits allow you to get up closer than most zoos. The giraffe feeding attraction was the highlight for our kids. The staff is very interactive with visitors. Can't say enough! Make time to go here. Is the food expensive? Yes,",
          "Beautiful zoo. Lots of great views of scenary as well as the animals. Zoo admission includes a drive to Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun. Worth the drive, more beautiful scenery. Only complaint is the skylift was closed. Better to be safe, but still disappointing.",
          "My favorite part are feeding the giraffes. Feed them early - we went to feed them again at 4:30 and they were already put away for the night. :( I love that this zoo has so many thing for children to touch! They were able to learn about and pet a snake. I'm not fond of",
          "I\u2019ve been to a few zoos including San Diego, Cincinnati, and Seattle and this zoo is great. Located along the Cheyenne Mountain it combines great scenery with wonderful animals and our kids had fun and that is sometimes not that easy to achieve anymore.",
          "After seeing a nearly full parking lot, I was worried that the zoo would be uncomfortably packed. However, I was surprised to see that it accommodated the crowd quite well, as it's spaced out and has various exhibits up and down the hill. By far the standout is the giraffe",
          "We always love this zoo. It's very well kept, and you can get closer views of the animals than you can at the Denver zoo. We enjoyed the Sky Ride with beautiful views and feeding the birds. We didn't feed the giraffes this time, but that's always fun, too. I allowed 4 hours",
          "We had a fabulous day yesterday at the zoo! Weather was gorgeous and although there were lots of people and LOTS of kids, it was awesome. Everyone at the zoo was courteous and friendly and the grounds are beautiful. Far cry from the old timey concrete cells for animals! I",
          "I am very hard to please when it comes to zoos but this one exceeded every expectation and then some. The animals were all very well taken care of, all of their facilities were clean and the park was very unique. When the first thing you do when you walk into the park is feed",
          "Stumbled onto this zoo on a recommendation. Loved the whole experience of feeding the giraffes. The zoo is under construction which is very nice to see as they are growing and trying to keep up with conservation efforts and giving the animals a more natural habitat. The",
          "We made a spontaneous trip to this zoo and it was a perfect way to spend a few hours. Very clean and the views of Colorado from up here were beautiful. The food at the Grill was good. Getting up close to the giraffes was a favorite.",
          "We stopped on our way going back home to Texas. The zoo was nice and clean. There were a lot of animals to see and the exhibits were nice. Loved being able to feed the giraffes for $3 for one bunch of lettuce or $5 for two bunches. The zoo was on an incline, which I guess",
          "We've been to a lot of zoos - many much larger than this one. However, my wife is a lifelong lover of giraffes, and when I learned that this zoo had a herd of 15 and that hand feeding them was possible, I immediately added it to our trip itinerary. It is a nice zoo , but it",
          "If you are from a lower elevation, be aware that this zoo is on the side of a mountain at a relatively high altitude. There was a lot of uphill walking and the animals seemed few and far between. It just seemed like a lot of effort for little reward. I was charmed by a",
          "We had such an amazing experience at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. It\u2019s a must do if you are in the Colorado Springs area. We loved feeding the giraffes and the snow leopard was beautiful.",
          "This zoo is near Colorado Springs at an altitude of about 6700 feet. It is quite hilly, but shuttle tickets are available for $2 per day. There are opportunities to feed giraffes, goats, and elephsnts directly, which the kids enjoyed. There are eating places and a nice picnic",
          "I\u2019ve never been to a zoo where you could get so up close with some of the animals- where the staff was genuinely engaging and polite. Such a beautiful place!!! My only recommendation is be sure to take cash as it is required for feeding experiences.",
          "We had an awesome visit! This was the coolest zoo we've ever been to - it definitely exceeded our expectations. The setting is beautiful, we were able to see lots of animals up close - the giraffe area when we came in was so neat to be up close at head level with the giraffes!",
          "I thought a zoo in Colorado Springs was going to be a bit small and boring. Boy was I wrong and it is not boring or small. It was a great day to roam the zoo and seeing the giraffes and elephants. The view from the zoo is also amazing in itself. Don't miss this place!",
          "This is a beautiful zoo! My family of four went a few days ago and we all loved it. We went on a Monday, as it was cheaper than going on Fri, Sat, or Sun. The lift ride was worth the money. We were able to see the zookeeper feeding the tiger as we made our descent on the ride.",
          "Everyone loves the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo!!! It is nestled halfway up a huge mountain, contains lots and lots of wonderful animals and plants, and people are always happy there. It's a must see!!",
          "Came last year and had to leave early due to afternoon T storms! Today was perfect- mild temperatures and not to crowded! Excellent access to Animals and helpful staff make for a great family outing!",
          "This zoo was much smaller than I imagined but when I say it was the BEST zoo I've ever been to, I mean it. We don't have zoo's with most of these animals in Wisconsin/Minnesota. I got to feed the giraffes (only $3 for one person or $5 for two - WORTH IT), caught a super cool",
          "We have visited this zoo many times in many seasons and it is amazing every time! A great variety of animals...our favorites this time were the orangutans, wolves, rhino, elephants and giraffes. It was a very cool Sunday and all the animals were very active and visible. We",
          "I am a zoo snob for sure. I go to one on each city I visit. This zoo is by far one of the top 3 I've ever been to. Feeding the giraffes was amazing. We bought 10 dollars worth of lettuce, but we could easily have doubled that since my kids loved it so much. The giraffes were so",
          "This is a very nice zoo with many opportunities for engagement with the animals. We were able to feed the giraffes and elephants as well as watch the feeding of the Lions. The park is very clean. Food is a bit expensive as expected, but you can bring your own picnic lunch if",
          "We traveled to Colorado with 4 of our 6 grandchildren and wanted the to experience some of the joys their mother had experienced when she was their ages. It is a little pricey but well worth the investment. There os a great selection of animals and the beautiful view on the",
          "On the afternoon we visited Cheyenne Mountain Zoo we were met with cloudy skies and rain showers. Although not ideal, we were equipped with rain jackets and decided to stick it out and make the most of our stop. We were able to see many beautiful animals up close in a beautiful",
          "We took our Granddaughter to visit the Zoo last summer. Our Granddaughter is from the East coast and her family travel quite a bit. She has gone to several zoos around the country. Her Review was, \"This is the best zoo because animals are in realistic and natural areas, not",
          "Our visit started with the Sky Ride. It allowed us to see the zoo from above and decide where we wanted to go first. We started by feeding the giraffes. What a fun experience!! Even my teenage son enjoyed it! We continued through this area and were able to feed both an elephant",
          "The Cheyenne Mountain Zoo quite deservedly earns it rating as one of the best zoos in the United States",
          "My 4 and 5 year old grandkids and I hit the zoo when they opened on a Saturday and were there till after 2. We had a grand time feeding giraffes and budgies, checking out so many animals, petting a snake, strolling with a porcupine, and riding the carousel. After lunch, we",
          "My son loves this place. They have huge areas on the Cheyenne Mountain and that makes very unique and natural. Very nice place for the family and kids.",

          "I enjoyed my visit even though I'm never crazy about caged animals. They seemed well cared for and by in large happy.",
          "After being in Colorado for many years we decided to make the drive to the Springs to see the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo that we have heard so much about. Although admission is a bit pricey on a peak day in the summer, we were NOT disappointed. Talk about a beautiful setting for a",
          "We love the CM Zoo! Cool layout since it is on the mountain. We loved feeding the giraffes! Sky lift allows great views of the zoo and the area. Great food on site so you can stay the afternoon and enjoy lunch.",
          "Had a great time walking around the zoo. Everyone was friendly and helpful. My favorites were the monkeys and giraffes.",
          "Was really hyped up on going to a zoo built in the mountains, but it was just okay. Biggest complaint was all the display glass was dirty so you really couldn\u2019t see the animals well. Some of the animals were not present or in other areas. I did really enjoy the giraffe area and",
          "We had such a great time here. It\u2019s a very well done zoo. The giraffes are so fun and greet you happily. It\u2019s so nicely laid out. The views are amazing. The employees are so very friendly. Free parking. Highly recommend.",
          "So, I live in a state with a really excellent zoo and we have never went to a zoo in a different state so we decided to try this one out. We were super excited to try out the sky tram but when we got there it was broken. Super disappointed. This zoo is super amazing. First thing",
          "Educational, enjoyable, exciting! The Cheyenne Zoo has exhibits that allow you to see the animals in close to their natural habitat. Be prepared to walk up hills. It's a workout but worth every step you take and every breath you make. Great for all ages!",
          "Hands down the best zoo in CO. Arrived early (highly recommended) and got great parking and no crowds to speak of. There is hilly walking throughout, but you can get up close, great looks at all of the animals. The highlight for us was feeding the giraffes. The crowds get",
          "Our realtor gifted us a yearly membership. We\u2019ve been over 5 times and every single time we\u2019ve loved it more. The food is pricey but the zoo and animals are magnificent. The animal habitations are elite in comparison to other zoos we\u2019ve visited in large cities.",
          "This was so wonderful to walk around. The animals have places to walk around, there are beautiful vistas. Nice variety of animals and you can get up close",
          "If you've ever wanted to see animals up close and feed them, Cheyenne Mountain is where you want to be. This was my first trip to the zoo and I am still in awe of how awesome it was. I loved the giraffe experience and getting up close and personal with them. You can feed them",
          "Fun zoo, nestled on a mountain so the veiw of the city is incredible. There's hills so, if you're not used to altitude and walking hills take it easy and drink lots of water.",
          "This is a beautiful place with a variety of enclosures! The ape enclosure is may favorite because only the plexiglass separates you from the apes and they like to interact if you\u2019re nice to them! Feeding the giraffes is my next favorite thing and the are a lot of them to see of",
          "This is by far one off the BEST zoos in the country. Being on Cheyenne Mountain you get not only a spectacular view, but also a little bit of a workout to work off some of the great food you can eat while perusing all of the too notch exhibits. I can NOT wait for the opening off",
          "There are various types of animals with a lot of activities for the children. They can feed the Giraffes, birds, Rhino and etc",
          "This zoo is on the side of a mountain and the trails are rather steep. They do have shuttles to get people up and down but you will still have to deal with the slopes. I loved this zoo! I have been to many around the country and this is definitely one of the best. You can",
          "Spent a wonderful day at this zoo. The animals are well cared for. The zoo is clean and the staff is very friendly. I only wish the skybridge had been open, but I fully understand as there was rain, and the wind was blustery. I fed the giraffes and was able to see the Mexican",
          "We went on a rainy Tuesday afternoon and nearly had the park to ourselves. Great exhibits! I especially enjoyed the wallabies and the peacock that was free to roam around! We even got to pet a beautiful and soft white chinchilla! A lovely zoo.",
          "My husband and I visited on our last day of vacationing in Colorado. We had a blast!! I was so surprised at the accessibility of the animals. We live in NC and have one of the largest zoos but you can\u2019t get this up-close and personal with the animals. The giraffe experience was",

          "Absolutely a must . We went during the week was not crowed ,it was windy. The animals have a inside place to go to depending on the weather. Outside enclosures looked as if they were not in enclosure.. I will come back to this zoo a million times ..",

          "This zoo is small but fantastic! The exhibits and living spaces for the animals allows them to really be visible, and it appears that the zoo keepers really try to think of ways to keep the animals active and engaged. We really enjoyed seeing the giraffes, rhino, elephants,",
          "My husband and I have been visiting zoo\u2019s since our honeymoon 28 years ago. This zoo is a treasure that should not be missed. Our visit started with our shuttle ride with Juan to the top of the zoo to the Australian area. Along the way Juan pointed out what was where so we had a",
          "We try to visit the Zoo when in town. This week we finally had a chance again and we were not disappointed. The parking is right by the front gate, very short walk. We loved feeding the giraffes, thank you for offering this experience. The map was easy to follow. We arrived",
          "I was not sure I wanted to go to the zoo. I am really glad I did. Feeding the giraffes was amazing! The entire facility was so clean and modern. The animal seemed very well cared for. They also had a great little bar with an amazing view",
          "The zoo was very well laid out. Easy to get through in two hours or spend all day. They have a text message that tells you of all scheduled events and feeding times. Fed the giraffes and elephants and birds. None of the animals seemed very hungry but they didn\u2019t mind eating a",
          "What a fun day! Visitors have the opportunity to feed many types of animals including giraffes, an elephant, domestic goats, and chickens. There is much ground to cover, some of it steep. (Take your time if you have pulmonary or cardiac issues.). My one critique: there could",

          "The Cheyenne Mountain Zoo is fantastic! Be prepared if you are an out of towner as the altitude may get you a bit winded. The animals here are well taken care of, the exhibits are well maintained, the paths clean and clear, and the whole atmosphere is one of a well ran zoo.",
          "We had the opportunity to visit the zoo on a week day, but it was still crowded due to Spring Break. However, the experience was wonderful, and views all around. The real fun was feeding the giraffes and watching the children enjoying this. Areas to bring your own food to eat,",
          "We went there with our kids and grandkids. What a wonderful day! The giraffes are something not to be missed.",
          "We recently visited for the day. We packed lunch (which I highly suggest! Food options are not great.) The weather was around 70 degrees. I think if it had been any hotter or colder we would not have enjoyed the visit. You can feed the giraffes lettuce that you buy there.",
          "So, let me start by saying I have no idea the requirements for mammalian or aviary animals, but what I saw for the herps(reptiles) was absolutely appalling. Simple things that 13 year olds understand about snakes have been overlooked. Most of the reptiles lacked hides. Which",

          "We took our 10 and 16 year old to the zoo. They loved it and we loved it. Truly one of the best zoos around. Feeding the giraffes is an awesome experience. $5.00 for two feedings. So cool to be up close to a giraffe. I would highly recommend a trip to this zoo.",
          "Cheyenne Mountain Zoo is EASILY the best zoo I've ever been to. From feeding the giraffes, to the free-range wallabies, to enjoying a zoo on a literal mountainside, I will ALWAYS leave here feeling so happy... and my kiddos, too!",
          "It started snowing shortly after we arrived many animals were not viewable but enjoyed those that were. Cleanest reptile exhibition ever seen. Should offer reduced rate for days when majority of animals are not viewable. Could tell in peak season probably a top zoo to visit.",
          "Nice small mountain zoo! All the exhibits were well matained and informative. Small enough to walk around and all the major animals were there. The zoo is into conservation, so that helps. It was a nice touch to be able to feed the giraffes and elephants. The walking paths are",
          "I spent several hours here alone while my husband had business meetings. My absolute favorite was feeding the giraffes! I didn\u2019t feel the walking was that strenuous and the zoo seemed rather compact and not widespread. I enjoyed petting the chickens and visiting with the staff.",
          "Another great (but windy) day at the zoo. The keepers, volunteers and staff are amazing. I love that they have some interactive exhibits. And that they have educational aaas throughout to let you know how to help wildlife. Primates were so entertaining this trip!",
          "This is such an amazing zoo. It is on the mountain so your view is always breath taking and the zoo is set up to make you feel as though each animal is in their natural setting! It is simply beautiful. Make sure that you take the time to feed the giraffes and the small birds in",
          "Nice, manageable zoo. Would be a great place to go with small children. Lots of interactive stuff and concessions. Several place where you could feed the animals. I opted to feed the giraffes. Great experience! Pretty, well-kept zoo.",
          "This was our 2nd visit to the zoo and it did not disappoint! Our teenagers have a great time here - very clean, amazing habitats, incredible scenery, a great layout, and even good food. Make sure to take some cash so you can feed the giraffes - well worth it. We were there on",
          "I love going to the zoo here. So much has been done and the improvements impressive; feed the giraffes, observe the bears with only glass as the barrier, and observe the city with great vantage points. I support my local zoo because it is important to the well-being of all those",
          "Went to the zoo on a whim because it was a nice day and we needed something to do. Although the parking lot seemed full when we entered the zoo you didn't get that feeling at all. Everything is spread out and you're not constantly on top of other people. There is walking",
          "We really enjoyed our day at this cool zoo that climbs the side of the mountain. Our 18 month old loved seeing the animals and it was great. We were a little disappointed that all of the shows were cancelled the day we went, and there wasn't anyway for us to know that going in,",
          "My new favorite time to visit the zoo is winter! On a sunny day in February, this mountain zoo is a blast. The animals were very active & most were also vocal. I have a new appreciation for the phrase \u201cspine tingling\u201d - standing just 20 feet away from one of the young male",
          "Fabulous and unique zoo. Built into the cliff side of Cheyenne mountain. Constantly upgrading exhibits, habitats, and dining experiences.",

          "This zoo is far superior to the Denver zoo. There are more opportunities to interact with the animals. From the giraffe feeding near the entrance to the wallabies that are located just off the path. Yes, they also have the creepy bird cage where you can feed and get pooped on",
          "Really enjoyed the layout of the zoo on the mountain. Wear comfortable shoes as you will be walking a lot, with incline and decline. Worth a visit!",
          "I was here with my family in August of 2017. This zoo is amazing, wide variety of animals and the kids loved getting to see animals they normally don't see at our local zoo. The giraffe feeding is worth the extra money, kids absolutely loved being able to feed the giraffes and",
          "This Zoo is great, there are so many animals to see. If you are ready for a long haul up and down hills, you will enjoy this zoo. They do have a bus that will take you to different areas in the zoo which is nice. The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable about the animals,",
          "I've lived in many States, and the zoo is one place I like to visit in each. There are a few throughout the U.S. that certainly deserve the recognition, and this is one of them. Here are the reasons I HIGHLY recommend: Location - when they say \"nestled\" into Cheyenne Mountain,",
          "I love zoos and couldn't resist going to this one even though the weather was frigid. Unfortunately, most of the animals were not out and about. It was fun to see a few large animals in their enclosures being fed. And we got plenty of exercise walking through the pretty",
          "We visit a lot of zoos, we travel a lot... This was one of my favorites! It makes my top 5, both kids loved it too (7 and 15).",
          "It was a cold winter morning when my grandson and I arrived at the zoo, and at first we saw very few animals outside. It got better and better though! Loved visiting the wallabies, the snakes and the playful otters. We went to the primate house when the orangutans were playing",
          "This is no ordinary zoo! First, pack in water and snacks and wear your best walking shoes. This zoo is a lovely hike even if you skip the animals. But, don't. The open air spaces allow the animals to stretch and enjoy the warm sun. They are not completely tame and the giraffes",
          "Great place to visit. Very nice exhibits and well maintained. Worthwhile to see and enjoy the animals and their nicely crafted habitats. Great views too.",
          "We love this zoo! It is so interactive and the views are amazing. We loved feeding the giraffes! I would recommend it to all families but bring a stroller because its a hike to get through it.",
          "Beware that it is an incline ao if you are not great with uphill and high altitude please use the allday trolly for $2, well worth it! Great zoo, kind of pricy bt neat experience!",
          "Amazing zoo! Lots of hiking uphill, so not for the faint of heart, but there is a shuttle up and down if you need it. Feeding the giraffes is a must! We really enjoyed the bears and the sky ride.",
          "The zoo is located on the side of Cheyenne Mountain so it offers a unique experience and incredible views. Be prepared to walk a fair amount and know in advance there are some hills to contend with. I do think there may be options to get uphill with assistance if you are",
          "I love our zoo, feeding giraffes, rhinos, and elephants is such a treat. It\u2019s a very unique zoo. There is also an opportunity to go up to the Will Roger\u2019s Shrine.",
          "We visited the Zoo on a day when it was free. Many of the animals were not visible do to weather conditions, and perhaps because it was free. The zoo was smaller than most, but we still enjoyed seeing the various animals they displayed. I particularly enjoyed the giraffe and",
          "We went in late December. It was such a cool place with alot to see even in the winter months. Of course all shows are not available at this time of year but there is still a lot to see. Unfortunately we got there late and missed a large part of the zoo so be sure to go early to",
          "Went on a super cold day and had the zoo just about to ourselves. Since it was around their 10:30 feed, all the animals were active. I love, love zoos and this was the first one where the lions were literally on the other side of the glass! An added treat was watching Lucy, the",
          "I love this zoo. it is beautiful and always has something new. Ski lift sky ride has the best views.",
          "This is a wonderful zoo to visit! It\u2019s at the base of the Cheyenne mountain area and is a great location for the venue! Being a smaller Zoo, it\u2019s still a very nice place to visit!",
          "I have been to zoo's all over the world, and not one of them is as memorable as this place. Not many places can you look the Giraffe in the eye while you feed them. The hippos were singing, loud and freaky, but still fun. It is a lot of hilly walking, but a great time, and",
          "5-words - We Bought an Annual Membership! Place has a great selection of animals and enclosures. Love the Giraffes - ability to see them at eye level and feed them is a popular attraction. It can be a demanding day for walking as it is on the side of the mountain, but there",
          "This is hands down the best zoo in the Mountain West. Despite taking no public money it is obvious a lot of money has been invested in the facility and that it has a robust operating budget. The zoo is built on the side of Cheyenne Mountain so walking can be tedious. The",
          "I\u2019ve been here many times. I love it and go every year. Lots of hills, so it\u2019s a workout but well worth it. The gorillas are always my favorite. Pack a lunch or you can buy lunch there. We make an all day excursion out of it.",
          "This is truly one of the best zoo's I have ever been to. You get to see the animals up close you get to feed giraffe's and feed elephants and have so many interactions with animals there. It is very clean and the views from the mountains is gorgeous! I am already looking forward",
          "Took the family for the Light Safari a couple of days before Christmas. This was my first visit to the zoo and was very pleasantly surprised at all they had to offer. While it was on a chilly December night we were still able to see many of their animals and take in wonderful",
          "Our family recently visited the awesome Cheyenne Mountain Zoo (elevation 6,714 ft.) on a snowy and cold afternoon. We loved feeding the giraffes! The animals were very active\u2014perhaps the cold weather had something to do with it. The exhibits were informative and well done.",
          "The animal exhibits were wonderful, but what we really loved was the sweeping panorama of Colorado Springs below. If you get a chance, visit the Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun which is included with price of admission. It is very peaceful up there, and the views are even better!",
          "It was cool and windy on the day we visited the zoo, but we had so much fun. Our visit began at the giraffe encounter where we purchased lettuce to feed the giraffes. From evelated platforms that are level with the giraffe heads, all 6 of us were able to feed adult and juvenile",

          "The zoo was amazing. The giraffes were awesome to see so close. My grandkids loved feeding them. One of the giraffes licked my daughter in the face. It was so funny. We enjoyed every moment we were there. We can\u2019t wait to go back.",
          "This zoo is a little overpriced, but it is due to being a private zoo not funded by the state. A membership pays for itself in a few visits. It is a must for families with lots of kids. Always a good time",
          "We have been to a lot of zoos in our lifetime, but honestly this zoo was so different compared to any zoos I've been to! I loved how it was on the mountain-it made the views so worth it! And some of the animals were unique-we really enjoyed the day!",
          "We love this zoo, and for the first time attended the Electric Safari Lights for Christmas. My Grandson enjoyed meeting Santa and Mrs. Claus, and we enjoyed the lights and the animals that were out and awake. Great family time!",
          "Incredible zoo! Clean exhibits for the animals, which is very important to me. The sky lift really lets you see how gorgeous Colorado Springs is up high. My favorite attraction! Got to pet & feed giraffes! Good prices too. For my mom & I it was only $37.50 (that includes sky",
          "The best was watching the giraffes licking wood, etc. and being able to pet them. That was awesome. I love otters and planned a Thursday trip for the 11:15 otter presentation. Arrived at otter exhibit at 11:05 and waited until 11:20. Nobody arrived. Great people in gift",
          "This zoo is filled with a wonderful balance of animals, big and small. Even on a very chilly December afternoon, many of them were outdoors and active. Quite a few were kept in their indoor homes to protect them from the cold, but they were still accessible. They all looked",
          "Wow this is by far the coolest zoo I've ever been to. We totally picked the best time to go - barely anyone there! We went on a Wednesday so go then lol. The animals were right there so close. The views were amazing! Feed the giraffes were the highlight of this visit. Highly",
          "This is not a huge zoo \u2013 we have been to much bigger around the world \u2013 but its giraffe and elephant enclosures were amazingly well done, and made a big impression on us. The rest of the zoo also had many other well designed animal exhibits. It is situated on the mountain, and",
          "The zoo is amazing. You can feed the giraffes, There are several places to eat. Very welcoming environment. Fun for kids and adults.",
          "The Cheyenne Mountain Zoo (owned by The Broadmoor) is a real gem in its rustic mountainside location. The animals seem content, are well cared for (in winter there are heated rocks for some animals to sit on!) and mostly easy to view. The collection is not the broadest but it is",
          "We went to the Electric Moonlight which was a 21+ event. It was great to see the zoo stroller free... Because adults love the zoo too! The beer tastings were good, the food offerings we decent, some better than other. The only downfall was that vendors were serving cold",
          "It is so much fun to see the interaction between the grand-kids and the animals, especially feeding the giraffes.",
          "The zoo is thrilling as the highest zoo in the world, I think. but you do have to climb to see the well taken care of animals. During the summer they have a shuttle you can catch, but during the winter you are SOL. I wish they had a better shuttle system, because at a high",
          "This was a absolutely terrific zoo. My family enjoyed many hours exploring and loved feeding the giraffes. Interesting historical fact, the Zoo was originally started because the owner of the Broadmoor used to receive exotic animals as gifts. He eventually had so many he built",
          "This is a smaller zoo, but probably one of the nicest I've ever visited and one of my favorites. First, the giraffes. You can feed them and pet them as they come right up to the railing at the enclosure. (I think this is as much of a thrill for the adults as it is for the",
          "My husband and I loved the zoo in Seattle when we lived there, so we decided to give this one a try. Oh my goodness, we got bvb to feed giraffes lettuce... they were so sweet and docile... it was completely awesome. As for the zoo itself, the lay out is wonderful, everything",
          "I love visiting the zoo whether it be with friends, family or on my own. The exhibits are beautiful with an amazing back drop of the city below. Along with being able to feed the giraffes and elephants there is a wide variety of animals. Be prepared to walk up hill being that",
          "We stopped here because we wanted to feed the giraffes & it was such a cool experience! There are quite a few of them & they come right up to you - not shy at all, so you get a quick chance to pet them too! The rest of the zoo was also nice with quite a few animals to see. It",
          "My daughter takes my grandson all the time to feed the giraffes. It was a great way to spend a few hours the day before Thanksgiving.",
          "My wife loves going to the zoo whenever we travel. I am not a big fan of animals. This was the best and most interactive zoo we have ever been to.",
          "My daughter and her son have season passes to Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. Since first coming to the Springs about 32 years ago, we have seen this little bitty zoo blossom into a world class attraction in the Pikes Peak Region. Worth the trip!",
          "Very nice Zoo laid out on the mountainside. Feeding of the giraffes are a must and observing some of North Americas wildlife in a mountain setting is really special.",
          "The zoo is nice but be prepared for the walking. As most things around here nothing is level so some up/down hill walking.",
          "Wow...we lived in San Diego and had access to two beautiful zoos and we always visit zoos when we stay in various cities, but this is by far the nicest and most beautiful zoo we have seen. This is a cross between Disney\u2019s animal kingdom and the San Diego zoo. It is hilly, but",
          "I think the best thing I can say about it is that I live inColorado Springs and whenever friends come to town, I don\u2019t come up with some reason not to go because I really like. It\u2019s big enough to have cool variety, yet small enough to not feel rushed to see everything.",
          "The experience of feeding the giraffes, riding the carousel and getting to see mountain lions and bears close up in their natural environment is an educational experience for everyone.",
          "This zoo is worth the drive. I've been to zoos all over the country, including the Brookfield Zoo, Denver Zoo, Houston Zoo, and San Diego Zoo, and the Cheyenne Mountain still made an impact! This zoo is so unique and we look forward to every visit! Feeding the giraffes is a",

          "best zoo in Colorado, Denver Zoo could learn a thing or two from this zoo. Animal exhibits seem to be very nice and clean. No hippos currently as they are building a whole now exhibit for them. Zoo is a good hike and has great view of the animals and city of Colorado Springs.",
          "It was recommended to me through a friend to check out this zoo when I was in COS. My son and I made it there with just over an hour and a half to take it all in, which was totally doable. We were so impressed! You can get so close to the giraffes (and can feed them!),",
          "Always a fun place for entertaining guests in town. Family friendly or just a great place to spend time outside.",
          "We have a family membership to this zoo and I highly recommend buying one if you live within an hour of the zoo. It is open year round. It is clean. The animals are out and about and feeding the giraffes is the highlight of any trip. Come and visit !",
          "We were stationed at Fort Carson Colorado and was fortunate enough to have school field trips to this zoo. Our family LOVE this zoo! Being on the side of a mountain makes it that much more fun to explore! We wore ourselves out every time we went to this zoo! My kids were 7,9,11",
          "If you go to this zoo, you can not only feed the birds, but the giraffes and Rhinos as well! Definitely a fun place for the family, the enclosures are decently spacious but still provide a good view. There's also an Australia quarter where you can walk with Wallabies!",
          "Hard to believe that this zoo is on a mountain side! Gorgeous, natural looking settings for these animals. A little pricey to get in to but when you think that it's all for the animals, it's worth it.",
          "We've go to Cheyenne Moutain Zoo any time we've been in Colorado Springs. From when our children were little to now going with grandchildren. This zoo is such a special place. The exhibits are beautiful and the animals have large habitats much like home. There are so many",
          "The Cheyenne Mountain Zoo has been and will continue to be a \"go to\" place for my family and I whenever we're having one of those \"what should we do today\" kind of days. The kids thoroughly enjoy wandering around looking at the variety of animals on display and it absolutely",

          "This is one of the best little zoos in the country! You can feed the giraffes and the elephants. There's a beautiful carousel, a ski lift ride, and a black rhino. During the holidays, they do lights and open in the evenings so you can take the kids to see Santa and tour the zoo",
          "I am an native and I can\u2019t believe it took me this long to finally get out to this zoo! The views of Colorado are amazing and they have great animal exhibits! You get to feed a lot of the animals and get to get really close to wallabies! They have a cool gondola for even more",

          "We had so much fun, the grand kids didn't want to leave. We will be returning whenever the kids are visiting. Fun place for the big kids too!!",
          "I am torn about this place. As a person in the industry I understand the cost and issue of redoing exhibit and balancing the animals comfort with the guests enjoyment. We only saw less than half the animals, at $65 for 2 of us to get in that was a huge disappointment. That said",
          "I like you get close to the animals. I loved feeding the giraffes. I wish there were more animals though.",
          "I've been to quite a few zoos, but this one has a fantastic layout. It's nestled up into the mountain side so it's quite hilly and layered. Not the best for older folks, but there are plenty of elevators and you can rent wheel chairs and strollers on site. The Giraffes are",
          "Whilst staying at the luxurious Broadmoor down below, we decided one afternoon to visit this Zoo. I am a lover of Zoos and animals, so was excited to visit this. It is interesting to visit, although not a big Zoo, to see mainly the animals from the Rockies region but although",

Being that the zoo is on the side of a mountain it\u2019s pretty steep walking or stairs at points. They do",

          "It takes about three hours to slowly walk round the whole zoo. There are some good shows when animals are fed eg lions. You are also able to feed giraffes and elephants yourself for a small charge. The long black giraffe tongues tickling children\u2019s hands as they hand over",
          "What more to say! You can buy lettuce from the zookeeper, which helps the zoo and you can feed them to the giraffes. They are friendly and careful when getting their lettuce. There was some building works to extend parts of the zoo, but they were not interruptive and well",
          "The improvements that have been made have been well thought out, walking paths are better and there are more areas to sit, both in food areas and throughout the zoo in general. Animal habitats are natural, the animals appear healthy, and the interactions we saw with animals and",

          "I have been to a very large zoo before, and this one is smaller, but don't let this discourage you from going. The zoo does a good job with what it offers. It is worth doing multiple times. I haven't gotten to take the sky tram yet, but it is on the list of to do's. Take",

          "Cheyenne Mountain Zoo definitely lives up to its name -- it's on the side of a mountain, which means there are some hilly climbs up and down to see all the animals. It also means beautiful views! It was pretty unique to be able to rove up and down to see the animal enclosures.",
          "Nice zoo with great views but confusing to navigate and were working on the hippo and penguin are so we could not see them.",
          "Cheyenne Mountain Zoo just keeps getting better. My top two times to go are around Christmas, when the lights are up, and any time when the giraffes are out. A long time ago, there were rye-krisp vending machines, which was cool. However, today's arrangement of buying armfuls",

          "We used to come here when we were younger. It feels like there has been a lot of down sizing. The price was a lot for the place. I know there was some construction going on, but it didn't seem like that much. The exhibits did seem well cared for and feeding the giraffes was fun",
          "The best part of this zoo is definitely the animal interactions! Thoroughly enjoyed the rhino, elephant, and giraffe feedings. The rhino and elephant feedaings were at a designated time and cost $10 each. The giraffe feedings are available all day and only cost $3. We also",
          "This is a must visit if you are visiting the front range. The areas are built into the mountain side making it more natural which in turn makes the animals more relaxed. As a photographer I enjoy taking the photos of the animals here then at other zoos. Make time for the",

          "We visited the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in early August (before the big storm)and were very impressed. Allow at least 3 hours to see everything. The giraffes are amazing! You can get very close and even buy romaine lettuce to feed them.we also enjoyed the marsupials, zebras, lions",
          "This zoo is the best for families. It's a lot of fun, the food is great. Most of the money made here goes towards conservation. Doesn't get better than that.",
          "Great clean zoo where the animals look like they are taken care of well. Make sure you ask about the drive up to the Will Roger's shrine if you can spare some extra time, the views alone are worth it and it is included free with your zoo ticket.",
          "Celebrated my retirement with a trip to the Broadmoor Resort. Wonderful resort to visit. Loved the golf and the grounds. Excellent resort......5 stars. The zoo is just up the road. And a very fun place. Good animal exhibits with lots of giraffes.",
          "Visited the ZOO close to quitting but was surprised to see many interactions with the animals and keepers everywhere, We were thrilled to see the tiger show off by climbing a tree for a meat treat by his handler. Also the bears were out and showing off :) Definitely recommend",
          "Stopped here on our last day of vacation. Especially enjoyed the Australian exhibit. You can tell they really care about the animals here!",
          "A must see. Zoo is interesting and there were lots of babies this summer. The wolf pups are way too cute, though still sticking pretty close to the den You can feed the giraffes which is really fun for both young and old alike. You can also feed the birds, elephants and other",
          "I was a little unsure what we would find considering the recent severe hail damage in the area but the zoo was looking good. A smaller zoo but it had a wide variety of animals but what I liked was how close you can get to them. My wife particularly enjoyed feeding the giraffes",
          "The Cheyenne Mountain Zoo is one of the main attractions that brought us to Colorado Springs and we were not disappointed. The giraffe-feeding is worth the price of admission, especially for my wife who loves giraffes. The zoo is very walkable and laid out such that seeing",

          "We were so impressed with the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. The animals were so visible and active. I felt like a kid and couldn't wait to see the next exhibit. Zoo is spread out so we didn't notice the crowd as indicated by the full parking lot. I recommend starting at the top in the",
          "Don't forget to take the mini shuttle to the top! Well worth the energy-saving properties. The same stuff that you would find at any zoo, but it's all uphill, and down-hill on the way back.",
          "Only mountain side zoo in the U.S. Plan to spend 2-3 hours in this sweet zoo. Great place to get close to the animals. Many giraffes when you first enter the park, which you can feed and pet. Check out the educational scheduled shows. Take the ski lift to the top of the mountain",
          "This was a great time. Felt it was a little pricey for a zoo but that would be my only complaint. Some of the best views in all of Colorado Springs and loved the interactions with the various animals especially the Giraffe's!",
          "The Cheyenne Mountain Zoo is located within the mountain range and laid out very uniquely. It's interesting to be at a zoo that is not flat, and to accommodate those that find walking up and down hilly paths not so easy, there is a golf cart style shuttle service that can move",
          "I have never been to this zoo before. It was large but compact because of exhibits on different levels of the mountainside. Lots of cool animals and a chair lift ride that takes you half way up the mountain. The view from which is spectacular. Nice trolleys you can ride around",
          "The zoo is on the side of the mountain so you are always going up. Once you get there you hav a great view of the city. The zoo is well organized. Animals are cared for and have wonderful enclosures. Weather is accounted for (it was hot the day I was there and the snow leopard",
          "This zoo is an awesome Mountain zoo. There is a lot of up hill climbing but it\u2019s worth it. And you must take the time to drive up to the shrine. It\u2019s a very beautiful building and view of Colorado Springs and the mountains.",
          "Went early to avoid the crowd and beat the rain. Recommend others do the same. One complaint is inconsistencies in admission policies from one gate staff employee to the next, especially when interpreting the definition of a \"guest\" being escorted by zoo members.",

          "Went there after the hail storm and you can still see the damage. Loved the ski lift ride that takes you over the zoo and you get beautiful views of the city. Feeding g the giraffes was a treat and the elephant show was fun. Highly recommend it!",
          "My tween absolutely loved it! We began with a sky ride for an aerial view of the zoo. The view of the mountains and city below were amazing. Then off to feed the giraffes. My favorite part was watching the wallabies and peacocks roam free! Plan to spend most of the day here,",

          "I don\u2019t remember ever touching a giraffe and everyone can experience this at the very beginning of the zoo! It was awesome to see so many animals in such a short time in natural looking habitats. The monkeys were very active, as were the wolves. It was mid-afternoon when we",
          "What a great zoo! Unfortunately, the week before we visited, the zoo was hit by a bad hail storm. However, most of the exhibits were still open. It was really interesting the way the zoo levels were tiered and there were suspended walkways over enclosures. Don\u2019t worry if you",
          "The giraffe exhibit was the best! It was a lot of fun feeding them lettuce. Getting so \"up close and personal\" with the giraffes (actually feeling their tongue grab the lettuce from my fingers was very cool) was an experience I have not had at another zoo. (Do not bother",

          "What a fun zoo. We enjoyed our trip to the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. We got there fairly early in the morning and had plenty of parking to chose from. The climb up the mountain was quite the feat. It seemed like everything was uphill every direction. There were lots of animals out",
          "We had a group that ranged from months old to over 80. The zoo had aesthetically pleasing exhibits and a nice variety of animals. We had a nice visit and are glad we went. 1. We found the staff to very attentive and saw staff frequently through our visit. 2. Take a few",
          "Even without having a little one to push in a stroller or chase around the zoo my husband and I truly loved our visit here. You can get up close and personal with giraffes if you like! It is easy to get around and see all they have going on there.",

          "This is my favorite zoo!!! The animals are in habitats, not cages. The zookeepers treat the animals good. You can see the respect and live that they have for the animals. We have annual passes and visit the zoo at least once a month. It never grows old or boring!!!",
          "First time here. We were smart and packed our small daypacks with enclosed water reservoirs. You will need water, and lots of it! This zoo is on the side of the mountain and you\u2019ll be doing walking. Lots of critters to see. Employees are pleasant and helpful. I suggest you",

          "Lots of outdoor areas for the animals to roam. Lovely mountain backdrop. Great overlook of the city.  The employees really care about the animals.  Very clean!  Cute grounds decor . Kids can feed and interact with some animals.",
          "Great exhibits and average price. If you enjoy each enclosure it'll take you about an hour and a half. Some steep hills so you can burn a few calories and be rewarded by some good food at the Grizzly Grill!",
          "Staff was fairly unprofessional but the zoo itself is nice with very nice views. Animals all seem happy and well fed as we'll. The reptile habitat definitely needs changed up. It was very artsy when it should match their natural habitat more.",
          "I loved the interactions with the animals! You can feed the giraffes!!!! Anytime ... you just buy lettuce and walk about on the walkway that is high enough that you are level with the giraffes heads. Pretty spectacular! You walk amongst the \u2026",
          "We live in the Denver area, so we have to drive a bit to get to Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, but the drive is always worth it. We get a family membership and probably visit the zoo about four times a year. We really love going to the zoo lights \u2026",
          "It's a small zoo and is a ton of uphill walking. Prepare to wear your sneakers! The staff is really nice and very helpful. The animal enclosures feel really close and personal. It's an enjoyable visit.",
          "My boys have been coming to this zoo since they were babies! We all love coming as a family. The walk and scenery are beautiful and offer stunning views of the springs down below. The changes and upgrades made over the last few years are \u2026",
          "Consistently a fantastic experience when we go to this zoo. The keepers really seem to love the animals and interact with them frequently. The animals are also given toys or recyclables to engage with. Boo at the Zoo wasn't worth the money \u2026",
          "Huge zoo with tons to experience! The animals are well cared for and have tons of enrichment options. There is a wide variety of animals, while less than the Denver Zoo, the crowds seem smaller and it feels more personal. The zookeepers, on \u2026",
          "This was a pretty neat zoo. I would recommend coming when it\u2019s warmer because there were a few animals that were inside due to the season. Overall this zoo was a lot of fun and very unique experience with it being on the side of the mountain.",
          "Amazing visit! We were in a group of 8, and everyone loved it. The zoo is bigger than we expected, and due to the location there is always an amazing view on the Colorado Springs area. The SkyRide is also worth the extra 4$, as you get a nice view on the zoo from above, and the lift ride is a lot of fun.",
          "A great zoo! Got to feed and pet giraffes,  goats and a big lizard, and enjoy lots of other cool animals in a gorgeous mountain setting. Hands down the coolest zoo I've ever been to.",
          "We went for the Zoo Lights, it was really neat to see all the animals at night! The lights were cool but it was much more about seeing the animals. It is a bit of walking and there was a lot of freedom to go at your own pace or skip certain \u2026",
          "We have recently moved from NYC to Colorado, and we had some pretty good zoos in NYC such is The Bronx Zoo. When we first visited Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, I was completely blown away! First of all the trip to the zoo is gorgeous full of \u2026",

          "Great experience and all the animals were happy to see us!",
          "Great park a wide variety of animals, and during the winter they have beautiful lights.",
          "Great exhibits. The giraffe feeding is a must for anyone that visits. The views of Colorado Springs is breathtaking. Military friendly and great for day with the family or just to visit by ones self. Could not recommend this zoo enough.",
          "We arrived an hour before closing but the few things we got to see were great. It was chilly. We loved the baby orangutan he was so cute. They views from the mountains were beautiful. Definitely recommend visiting.",
          "Not as good as in the past. Still fun for family. Staff was rude.",
          "Zoo lights were a fun evening. Parking/shuttle arrangements made it less hassle than some other zoos (Denver!).  More animals to see than Denver's, but less lights and no music. Good to see the 'other' Holiday lights in Colorado.",
          "World class zoo right in our backyard! Love this place and my whole family enjoys it. We love the Lions and the Elephants a lot. They are majestic creatures\u2764\u2764",
          "Our family absolutely LOVES this zoo!  Our son has such a great time coming here.",
          "All the exhibits are super cool...and this place is ninety percent of the time super busy...it took us an hour and a half to catch a shuttle bus to get up there from a parking lot last time.  The price is high to get in for a regular \u2026",
          "We took the kids to Boo at The Zoo and they had a wonderful time!\nIt was busy but not packed. Parking wasn't bad. The kids got plenty of candy. All the decorations were great and very spooky! \nThe haunted house was a bit scary for the younger kids, but still fun!",
          "So much to do tp st the zoo.  Animals are well cared for and have great enrichment to play with.",
          "Biggest killers. Mixed Species exhibit, with Ursids. A grizzly bear living alongside a dozen wolves. They offer the lions frozen thawed rabbits so they eat carcass, like they do in the wild.",
          "This was a great experience, my wife and I loved feeding the animals. This was a great idea to get a good workout with a very scenic view. This was a far better experience then the denver zoo.",
          "Awesome zoo for all ages, beautiful settings and friendly zookeepers! Highly recommended! I  have just one suggestion\u2014please get a companion for Ginger the beaver. When we visited her space she had her nose pressed up against the glass/plastic enclosure door the entire time. \ud83d\ude15",
          "Great zoo. Lots of stuff to do and see for the kiddos.",
          "I've been multiple times. I went recently on a fairly cold day. There are so many places to step inside to see animals that I was never outside long enough to be freezing. I really enjoyed that aspect for cold visits",
          "Cool, small zoo. If you don\u2019t like walking you can take the ski lift up the mountain and walk down the zoo trail back to the beginning of the zoo. Bring some actual cash so you can feed the giraffes and other small animals.",
          "Picturesque location.. had an incredible experience feeding the giraffes..!! Visited the place during winter,  but summer would have been even better experience while interacting with animals. Missed sky ride due to cold..so please plan the trip during summer",
          "Was there on a beautiful Saturday, lots of people there and it still didn't feel crowded. Loved the exhibits.  Could easily fill an entire day here!!",
          "It was a amazing experience for my whole family we got to feed real giraffes. And the rest of the zoo is full of fun! We saw awesome animals like elephant all the way to chickens. One of the coolest parts of the zoo was we got to see bears \u2026",
          "While we live by the world's greatest zoo, it costs quite a bit to feed a giraffe and other animals.  Here the prices are modest to do so, but requires cash.  $20 per person is more than enough.  Feeding birds, giraffes, rhinos, elephants. \u2026",
          "Such a fantastic zoo! It's always been one of my favorite places. The giraffe exhibit is the crowning jewel of the place, and should always be checked out!",
          "Fun way to spend an afternoon in Colorado Springs! This zoo allows you to get up close and personal with some of the animals (ex. hand feeding giraffe), which is a unique experience compared to most zoos.",
          "We have had a membership for about 6 years now and try going once a month if not more. Fun during summer or in the winter. Lots of changes and new things happening.\nLove every trip.",
          "I've been to a lot of zoo's in my life and this one is by far the best. The way they allow you to interact with the animals is amazing!  It's affordable and the layout is amazing. We'll be going back.",
          "Love this beautiful mountain zoo. It\u2019s a private zoo, so that means expensive...I wish there were more programs for low income kids...all kids deserve a zoo! But it\u2019s a lovely zoo with well cared for animals and a great staff. Love all the \u2026",
          "Fantastic place to spend time with family! Children enjoyed feeding giraffes with lettuce. The zoo is very clean and the animals are very pretty! A wonderful experience. We would definitely be back!",
          "Outstanding layout; you can really get close to the animals in their roomy habitats. Even the indoor areas (for the animals unable to handle colder days) are large and ergonomic with great viewing areas. The many opportunities to feed and directly interact with the wildlife is particularly amazing.",
          "This is the best zoo ever! There is so much interaction with the animals. My 2 year old fed a rhinoceros,  a giraffe, birds, chickens, and petted the goats and the free roaming (within the Australia area) Wallaby! These guys look kind of \u2026",
          "We had our daughter's birthday party there, today. The pace was perfect! Easy for parents, kids had enough activities to stay engaged and entertained but enough free time to not lose their minds. Thank you, Lauren, for being an awesome mentor for the kids. Really a perfect afternoon for everyone!",
          "Beautiful animals they were well taken care of. Drove from Oklahoma City ok for vacation. Highly recommend",
          "I honestly thought this would be a smaller zoo. I'm from Houston and we have a fairly good sized zoo so I thought nah I don't think it's much bigger. But they had so many animals. They even had some animals just out in the open. I was \u2026",
          "Beautiful location. If your looking for something to do with the family and don\u2019t want to travel to far this is the place. Enjoy a walk up the mountainside and see all the animals they have to offer at the same time enjoy the overlook of Colorado Springs.",
          "This zoo has a lot to offer for it's small size.\nWell cared for animals in well designed exhibits.\nBonus ski lift ride with awesome views and the Shrine of the sun.\nTake your time and go through this place slowly to take advantage of all this attraction has to offer",
          "Best zoo I have ever been to! The staff was so informative and helpful, and I had so many first experiences here. We got to pet and feed the sweet giraffes, including the new baby! We got up close and personal with the grizzlies and learned \u2026",
          "Best zoo in Colorado. Amazing animals. Easy short walk to see everything,  which is great for toddlers before they have to eat or nap. Lots of wild animals with close encounters. Will definitely be back. Our son loved the bird encounter.",
          "Definitely the best zoo experience I have ever had.  Traffic getting in was a bit painful to deal with but moved at a steady rate. Well worth the wait as my kids had a blast and had opportunities to feed numerous animals and were able to \u2026",
          "Great Zoo! Our family has had a membership for 25 years! The membership is an incredible value. The Cheyenne Mountain Zoo is one of the best in the nation. Modern exhibits and beautiful scenery. People from lower altitude need to take their time and drink water. The zoo is hilly and the elevation is 6700 ft.",
          "Animals have indoor and outdoor viewing rooms. Some also wander around open park area. Definitely nothing like the zoos I have seen before.",
          "It is a really nice zoo with lots of opportunities to see the animals and learn about them. Staff does a great job presenting at the animal sharing time presentations they do. Can be cold and windy or extremely hot, be prepared for the variety of Colorado weather.",
          "Wow! Such an amazing zoo! Nestled into the mountain side, this zoo has a beautiful view around every corner. The landscaping is intentionally planned and maintained. The habitats are large and well designed. Food options are delicious and \u2026",
          "This is by far the best zoo...anywhere...  We have been members for years and plan to remain so for many years to come.  Definitely a can't miss spot in the Springs.",
          "A unique zoo to visit. Seeing the animals up close and being able to feed them is a must do. The zoo is well maintained and the staff is very friendly and approachable.",
          "Love this place took my daughters here and they loved it. A lot more comfortable than the Denver zoo and a bit more spread out so it makes life easier and less claustrophobic with two kids.",
          "I loved the exhibits. The animals were close up and easy to see. We spend about 5 hours here from about 9:30 to 2:30, so there was a lot to see. A lot of things were out of order and under construction, but that could just be because its winter time. I'll update the review when we go back this summer.",
          "Best zoo in Colorado. Hiking around to each exhibit and there are many places to eat delicious food. They also have many animal involvement things which is super cool",
          "Great day, loved the new penguin & hippo exhibits!",
          "I love this zoo so much. You can get so close to the animals and it has a compact design, making it relatively quick to get through. Be sure to bring cash so that you can feed the animals throughout, like giraffes, birds, and goats!",
          "A cute little zoo in the mountains! I was surprised at just how many animals they had.",
          "The best zoo I've visited! Great exhibits. A beautiful variety of animals. Fair entry fee. Fun demonstrations.",
          "One of the best zoo's I've been to. The interaction with all the animals is fantastic for my daughter. She loves feeling the giraffes and watching the elephants",
          "If you\u2019re looking for a different type of zoo experience this is it. Beautiful zoo in the mountains with different unique animals. They even have a sky ride that allows you to see thee animals in the area from a top view. Simply breath \u2026",
          "This zoo is incredible. The environments for the animals were so cool. Lots of nature feel to everything. Don't really feel like you're at the zoo. Definitely worth the price to become a member. Can't wait to try the zoo after dark!! Will definitely be back. Oh and feeding Giraffes was a life changing experience!!",
          "My favorite zoo! On our last visit we saw a baby giraffe, mountain lion cubs (that had been rescued when their mom was killed) and wolf cubs. I love that you can feed the giraffes and have some interaction with the animals. It\u2019s important to me that the animals seem happy and cared for and I definitely see that happening here.",
          "Best zoo in Colorado!!! You can feed several animals and you don\u2019t have to overpay or make appointments like you do in the Denver zoo. Animals are awesome, it\u2019s a smaller zoo but it beats the Denver zoo",
          "I love this zoo! It's interactive and educational. Can't wait to see the new exhibits!",
          "So much fun. Very few people in the Winter so we felt like we had the place to ourselves. Most animals are inside when it's cold so keep that in mind.\n\n*Talk about tone deaf, we actually saw one woman wearing a real fur coat! \ud83e\udd2a",
          "I thoroughly believe this is the best zoo. Every time I go I have a special experience with an animal. You don't tour this zoo and see empty exhibits because the animal is hiding, but the area they have is still large and beautifully designed.  Love visiting this place and always spend several hours here.",
          "This is by far the cleanest zoo I've been to.    Staff was extremely informative about each animal.    You can feed the giraffes which was an amazing experience for the kids.    Highly recommend checking it out",
          "I loved the zoo today, however we brought my dad who is recovering from a stroke.  The only thing I wished would be better would be better bathrooms for the handicap or companion bathrooms.  We basically commandeered the men\u2019s restroom in \u2026",
          "This is such a neat zoo! The staff are friendly and knowledgeable, and the view is incredible. The exhibits are really well designed with some great creativity. Because it's on the side of a mountain, there are a lot of steep inclines to \u2026",
          "Wonderful Zoo, especially the Giraffe exhibit. My daughter gets to see them up close every time . It is mostly outdoors and there is a lot of uphill walking, but if you need help they offer rides.  Definitely worth a membership since it is \u2026",
          "Moonlight on the mountain was fantastic. The venders were great, melting pot and Jack Quinn's were my favorite. We had a great time. Full moon and awesome lights made for a beautiful view.",
          "It's a great place to take the kiddos on the lazy weekend., we have been to the zoo several times over the past few months since I moved to Colorado. We have been very impressed with the quality and the quantity of animals at the zoo. The \u2026",
          "This is a wonderful zoo!  The layout is great to also get a good 'hike' in as well as enjoy the variety of animals.  I recommend going early or late in the day to miss most of the larger crowds.  Don't miss the opportunity to feed the giraffes, definitely worthwhile!",
          "I really like this place. The only downside is that you have to walk hill most of the time. The animals are always out. My girl loves the electric safari they do during the holidays.",
          "This place was amazing. Lots of walking so dress appropriately, you can feed goats, chickens and so much more. This was an incredibly interactive experience and I would highly recommend. The zoo participates in lots if programs that help with the recovery of wildlife in all forms.",
          "Absolutely perfect for kids and the family. It was awesome watching my 2 yr old son feed the giraffes, he couldnt stop laughing at their tongues.",
          "Very nice Zoo, animals well kept. Plenty of exhibits to keep you entertained. Had pizza at their cafe. Price is reasonable",
          "You actually walk up a mountain as you are going through the zoo.  We were there on a perfect day; sunshine, 55 degrees in the valley, and still a bit of the first snow of the year was on the ground when we were up high enough (but only in \u2026",
          "Very kind & knowledgeable staff. Beautifully built using natural terrain along the mountain. \n*** OPT for the additional 2 or 4$ a day person to be able to jump on/off the zoo cart, especially if you have young children. (Carying my 3yrs old up a mountain all day added a damper & misery that was unnecessary)",
          "Always a nice trip to see all of the animals. The new habitats are fabulous!",
          "Always a wonderful time! Boo at the Zoo was awesome! The decorations were fantastic and there was a lot of great photo opportunities. The kids were so excited about all the candy and other cool things that were being handed out.",
          "Not as many concentrated light displays as the Denver so lights but Denver zoo cut it's Christmas light display back and it's not open on Christmas this year. Beautiful views of Colorado springs from the side of the mountain at night. Worth going.",
          "I wish I could give more than a 5 star review. This place was amazing and the best zoo my wife and I have ever been to. Great experience getting to feed the giraffes and an elephant. Love the conservation aspect and also enjoyed that it was \u2026",
          "Great zoo for all ages. Feeding the giraffes was our highlight, there were so many of them of different sizes, and their tongues are so long! They offer feeding and training sessions throughout the day for a large number of exhibits, could easily spend all day here. Views were fantastic of the city and Pike's peak.",
          "Best zoo I've been to. The giraffes are amazing and you can even feed them. They have various animal shows, a lot of close encounters and different animals you can feed. It is a lot of downhill and uphill walking but you get some beautiful views of the city below. Only con is it can get pricey depending what all you do.",
          "We went in the dead of winter but so it was pretty empty. We still got to see a whole bunch of neat animals like lions, giraffes and otters. Love it.",
          "Went to the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo for the first time last week!!! It was an AMAZING visit!!! And would like to give a special thanks to the handler of the porcupines! Courtney saw how excited my family and I were while watching their male \u2026",
          "Wonderful zoo and  Beautiful grounds! I have been there several times getting the opportunity to feed the rhino and elephant (my personal favorite)! Awesome to take my son here for the first time who  loved feeding the giraffes and the kid \u2026",
          "It was a great zoo; however you should know that it's build onto a mountain so you'll be constantly climbing higher and higher. Most of the animals were still out when with the snow. My kids loved it. The only shame was that the ski lift was down.",
          "Great experience for kids. Loved the giraffes. Good exercise too cuz there's a good bit of walking to see everything",
          "Well worth! Was about to feed both giraffes and birds. Was cold the day we went, but was still able to see all of the animals as there are entrances into most enclosures. Very close to the animals. Great design and very friendly interactive staff.",
          "Went here for Boo at the Zoo. For only $20 on a Saturday night, it was a steal!  All the animals seemed happy and interactive with the public. You can tell they are well taken care of here. Definitely spend a few bucks and feed the giraffes!  There tongues are amazing.",
          "Always a great day when we go to the zoo. The annual memberships fantastic if you go more than 3 time per year.",
          "This place is phenomenal. I read that it is one of the top zoos in the country and let me tell you, it is. The abundance of animals and the habitats are a great feature of this zoo. They are constantly working on adding other exhibits and \u2026",
          "We enjoyed ourselves. Kids loved it. Gets busy fast\n Didn't get to go on the gondola ride due to the weather.",
          "If you have not visited this zoo, please do. One of the best zoo experience i have ever had. Great set-up, awesome views. Very big enclosures and a great way to spend a day. Be prepared for mountain weather.. like gusty winds and chills or \u2026",
          "Absolutely stunning zoo! We are here from CT and made this our last day trip and regret nothing. The park is very well kept and clean. The animals were very well taken care of and have nice big areas to be in. We were blown away by this place! Highly recommend!",
          "Great zoo in a great location. The sky ride is a must, the food is great, and it's never too busy. Parking is horrible so expect to wait. It's also a little more expensive than most zoos. All that aside, it's a wonderful time and one of the best things to do in the Springs.",
          "One of only 2 Mountain Zoos in the world, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo boasts the largest herd of Giraffes in North America!  The giraffe enclosure is beautiful and lets you get up close and eye level with these amazing and graceful animals.  For \u2026",
          "The Zoo is located on the beautiful mountainside. I have been here multiple times and the animals that never let you down here are the Lions, Elephants, Giraffes, and Tiger. There are more animals there but these are the most active animals at the zoo. You can usually find the Lion roaring and putting on his own show \ud83d\ude0a",
          "We just made our first trip to this zoo and it did not disappoint! Feeding the giraffes close up out of my hand was amazing! Layout of the zoo is very nice and it is sort of built into the side of the mountain & keeps the natural terrain as \u2026",

          "I love the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo! It\u2019s nestled up on the side of the mountains in Colorado Springs \u26f0 offering great views as you make you way around the park. You can feed the giraffes \ud83e\udd92 the elephants \ud83d\udc18 and participate in educational \u2026",
          "Literally live here all summer and even still in the colder months.  The food is amazing!! Can't beat the views",
          "We make a point to visit zoos everywhere we travel.  We didn't know what to expect, but certainly didn't expect such a superb experience as this.  The CM Zoo packs a great variety of animals and habitats in an accessible, walkable, \u2026",
          "We did the Elephant Experience for my birthday\u2019 it was amazing! The staff at the elephant and rhino enclosure were perfect and amazing and so much fun!!! Thanks you lady\u2019s!",
          "The best zoo I've been to.\n\nSeveral years ago, they let me feed a cantaloupe to a hippo. Best zoo experience ever.\n\nThe trick-or-treat event is very well done as well.",
          "My first time at this Zoo I had a wonderful time with my family and I will come back again.",
          "Cheyenne Mountain Zoo is unique and a perfect way to spend the afternoon. Be ready to walk up some hills (there are options for stairs, ramps, and elevators) but the elevation adds to the experience and helps make the enclosures feel more \u2026",
          "Coming from Hawaii, we wanted to give our parents their first White Christmas in snow! We came to Colorado for Christmas and the day after Christmas we figured we\u02bbd spend the day at the Cheyenne Zoo!\n\nWe had such a great time! Spending time \u2026",
          "This zoo was very large however the exhibits were very personal and well set up.  I really enjoyed my experience and you get a great view of Colorado Springs. If you're visiting I would  recommend to visit",
          "Wallabies roaming around freely, parakeets flying in a room whilst you feed them and petting the giraffes while feeding them was so fun! Best zoo in Colorado definitely reccomend!",
          "Love my zoo \nIts so beautiful n so quiet \nLove the views\nLove spending the day with all the special wild life",
          "I love Zoos like more than I probably should. I have been to Denver, Pueblo, San Antonio, Nashville, Tampa, Disney World animal kingdom, and Wild Adventure in Georgia...Cheyenne Mountain Zoo is still my favorite. We got with our 5 kids over 50 times a year easily. I learn more about each animal and the Zoo each time.",
          "It is affordable, family friendly and you could either spend just a few hours or all day depending on your schedule. \nBoyfriend review: I thought the animals were great and the humans could use some work. No beer. 6/10",
          "Lots to see, pretty good zoo, not sure If it\u2019s anything really unique though as far as zoos go. I wouldn\u2019t really want to go again but it was cool to go the one time. They had giraffes you could feed which was different but poorly organized (kind of a \u201cfree\u201d for all).",
          "Was a cold and snowy day, but we had a blast! Didnt get to see many of the animals, but loved the giraffes and elephants! Staff was wicked nice. We got to feed the giraffes.  Gift shop was pretty cool too.",
          "Pretty great Zoo. Giraffe exhibit is amazing. I had that eat out of my hands. In the down under section kangaroo are jumping around or seating around you without any barriers. That was a first for me. View is amazing because on one side you \u2026",
          "The zoo is better than any ive ever been. It is divided into continental regions so that u can see the animals u are interested in. There are many interesting restaurants with delicious aromas. There is a schedule for animal events and playground for kids. The exhibits are designed perfectly for many views.",

          "Fun little zoo experience but pretty much what you would expect.",

          "Beautiful zoo! Lots of ways to interact with the animals, feedings, shows and knowledgeable care takers. Save around 4+ hours to see all the exhibits. Definitely worth the money and time",
          "Went for my son's birthday and the monkey pavillian keepers took extra time to teach him about the sloth's and the howler monkey's in particular. They answered questions and gave him special attention on his special day. Even the restaurant \u2026",

          "The animals are well taken care of. He pace is clean the people are nice. There's good food here also Depending on the time of the year will decide what is open",
          "Love coming to the zoo with the family. Always a good time, great reptile exhibit. Smaller zoo with a pretty large variety of animals. Plenty of restrooms and elevators if you have little ones with strollers. Highly recommend coming to the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo! Kids always love being amazed by all the animals here! Thank a zookeeper!",
          "A great place to spend the day.  The exhibits are well done, with a great diversity of animals. I would recommend going to the website beforehand, as they post a schedule of the show times, so you can plan out your visit.  The shows are \u2026",

          "We always enjoy coming here. Even with our annual family passes, we still go on a monthly basis. Our two kids never get tired and are always excited to go to. The staff are always friendly and willing to educate any curious folks and I cannot recommend this place enough.",
          "It was kind of hard to practice social distancing in some areas of exhibits. I think there should be a waiting line on some of the exhibits. I did like the tables as spacers for people to view animals. Maybe some of the walk ways need to be more established.",
          "We love this Zoo, my wife and I have been coming up here for years, the staff is always super friendly and they take excellent care of the animals. You can tell they truly care about the well being of the animals. My daughter just turned 1 \u2026",

          "The kids loved every minute of the zoo.",
          "By far my favorite zoo! It starts off with giraffes at face level that you can feed lettuce to; they set the bar high right out the gate. Interaction is the secret to this best kept secret of a zoo. Set aside a few hours to experience this spectacular opportunity to interact with animals like never before.",
          "A little out of the way if you're not from the area but in a great scenic location. Animals look well kept and fed, lots of space to roam. Prices were good to comparable facilities. Well staffed and a large child's area to entertain the kids and relax. There's a lot of walking but also a lot to see.",
          "The best zoo in the country with more renovations to come! Well done!",

          "Honestly the interaction with the animals here makes this a much more enjoyable zoo for kids and parents...GO HERE.",
          "It is always nice to go back to something you visited as a kid. The park is still in amazing shape and I can't wait for the new enclosure to be opened. The park staff were friendly and helpful and the food was good too! A lot of good picture opportunities!",
          "I am torn on how to rate the zoo because on one hand it is an exceptional facility. But on the other hand it is price prohibitive for many families. All in all we enjoyed our trip."

          "The Cave was awesome and although our tour guide, Iza was nice she went a bit fast and someone needs to teach her how to speak as a tour guide. It took everything I had to not complain to management about her saying repeatedly \u201cwith that being said\u201d. This phrase was unnecessary",

          "The Hippie tour guide gave us the most amazing tour ever. We have done hundreds of tours in different cities and nothing stacks up to the brilliance of his tour. If you don\u2019t do anything else in Manitou, do this. You will not regret this exciting adventure.",
          "Enjoyed the tour. A little overpriced. Kids 15, 13, 11, 9 enjoyed. Problem was our guide - Emily was programmed with the script and took away all spontaneity from the experience Would recommend if looking to kill a little time",

          "Beautiful park! Great staff! Amazing visit!!will definitely be back! And recommended to all my friends!",
          "The absolute worst cave we have ever toured. Very few formations and all are less than ordinary. Paying $22.50 per person for a 45 minute tour was bad. Listening to a guide who was more like a wanna be stand up comedian was the worst.",

          "The tour guide was a good story teller, but had some foul language. At the end when we were able.to walk through the end of the cave we were rushed out and missed probably the best part of actually seeing the cave. Would not do this tour again. Too much money for a story.",
          "We went for the outdoor pkg including the \"jungle gym\" obstacle course and Rick wall and geronimo leap, along with the batapult and virtual reality ride. We had SOOOOO much fun challenging each other and laughing with the employees, etc.. It was absolutely our favorite part",
          "I had such a fun time at this place. The Terrodactyl was on my bucket list for things to do and it did not disappoint. The staff there were very friendly. The ride itself was well maintained. Now for the drop; scariest moment of my life! The view however is amazing and totally",
          "Our tour guide Gale was fun and informative, tying in historical fact and scientific information, and safety with a sense of humor. This was our second visit. Thank you!",
          "We took the 6p Lantern Tour on Sunday with Cat. This was an excellent tour. It was a great way to explore areas of the cave that don't get a lot of foot traffic. The ghost stories were excellent and well told.",
          "Sadly, the cave is not what it once was. A lot of people being herded through as quickly as possible. The guides are good, but don't expect to be wowed by the caves. The emphasis is on sales more than anything else.",
          "Chris M. was an excellent cave man! The cave was awesome! Fun place for anyone who wants to live on the edge!",
          "Went on a foggy morning that cleared up by noon. Great rates for early risers and a lot that\u2019s included. Everything was fun for my parents and my wife. Would definitely return!",
          "Hadn\u2019t been here in 30+ years. I forgot how enjoyable it was. The girlfriend and I are planning a date night for the lantern tour now.",
          "We had a blast! Very friendly and knowledgeable staff, clean facility and well worth the reasonable price. Would recommend it to anyone! A++",
          "We enjoyed touring the cave & the guide was very knowledgeable. The history of the cave was quite interesting & it\u2019s worth a visit, especially if you have never been to a cave or are inclined to tour any cave. One of the highlights of our visit was sitting on the patio for",
          "Another great adventure. I am 80, girl friend 72. While in Manitou Springs wanted to try a zip line or something. We decided on the Bat a Puit and Terror Dactur. We bought individual tickets at the entrance. Couldnt do it on line. Plus we did the cave tour also. Good guide",
          "We had the best time with Lexy as our tour guide! So much information and wonderful sights to see! There were so many rooms in the caves, and so many different formations to see.",
          "Lantern tour was a lot of fun. Ghost stories sounded real and were the right amount of spooky. My husband is 5\u201911\u201d and hurt his head on a walkway, hard hats would be a good idea for this tour since you have to crawl and can\u2019t see very well. Was a lot of fun otherwise.",
          "Emily was our tour guide \u2014 she was great and made a lot of rock formation jokes (and the lights) which were cool! Would 100% do this tour if you haven\u2019t. Especially with Emily, for the jokes.",
          "The Lantern Tour was the highlight of our trip. Lexy was a fantastic guide. Make sure you reserve spots online ahead of time.",
          "The tour was informative and a pretty cool experience. Our guide, Theresa, was fantastic. Loved the way she ran the tour",
          "I came here with my 6 & 15year old boys. We took the lantern tour and then they did some of the activities with the harnesses outside until it started raining. The cave tour was awesome, spooky but not too spooky and everyone gets their own oil lantern/ bucket to light their",
          "We went on the Lantern Tour at Cave of the Winds and it was the best ghost walk of a cave that we have ever experienced! Our guide, Cat, was fantastic!",

          "We went on the Lantern Tour and had a chance to walk through the unimproved sections of the cave with Dustin St. Germaine, and he is a wonderful guide. And a master story teller - his tour was the last one for the day and it was incredibly engaging and so much fun. Would",
          "My kids loved the high ropes course, staff were knowledgeable and helpful. Did not do the cave tour or other activities at this site however.",
          "Guide was very informative. They keep track of us well and was great with kids. Was tight with all the other tour groups but they organized it well.",
          "My teen grandkids were here for the summer and about the middle of July we went to Cave of the Winds for a tour. It was a super hot day in the Springs area, but wonderfully cool inside the cave. We had a lovely young guide who liked to crack bad jokes, but that was part of her",
          "Great cave! We did the shortest tour. It was worth the money. I did get a little claustrophobic in the beginning. Our guide did a great job. We were in total darkness for about a minute. Just an FYI.",
          "This cave was discovered by two boys over a century ago, they fell through a sink hole managed their way out Today this beautiful sight shows the formation of our planet from underground, spectator colors grace this cave. The tour guide gives details along the entire exhibit,",

          "Our grandsons loved the Adventure Course. Very nice facilities and fabulous location. Cave tour was fun and informative.",
          "My family really enjoyed our visit to Cave of the Winds. The tour guide did an excellent job explaining the founding of the cave, the exploration and the modern day expectations to preserve it.",
          "Bo and Connor were fun and safe! We had a great time! To the traveler, this Via Ferrata is more physically intense than the one at AVA rafting in Buena Vista. The equipment is more comfortable in Manitou Springs. Both are quite safe, but if you\u2019re worried, Buena Vista has",
          "Took my 11 year old here for a fun day before school starts back up. I booked the Early Bird Lantern Tour and Pioneer Pass ahead of time online to save a few $. The lantern tour was fun, and my 11 year old enjoyed getting to carry a lantern thru the caves. He also said it was",
          "Just did the discovery tour with Taylor who was amazing! She was super knowledgeable and entertaining. Made for a super unique and fun experience! Worth the $",
          "I\u2019m sure this place is great but I was turned around since they don\u2019t allow pet dogs. Risks of traveling with our family dog...... The rest of Colorado is super pet friendly so I\u2019m not sure what happened here. They do have a fun adventure area at the entrance that our 12 and",
          "The family and I booked a \"happy hour\" Pioneer package and not only was it half the cost of going during the day, there were hardly any people in the late evening. My 12 year old said the ropes course was his favorite part of the trip to COS! Booked for 7:00 and that was",
          "The cave tour was very good and the tour guide Teresa told some exiting tales of the history of the cave system and it's founders. The Via Ferrata climbing and ziplining tour was an excellent experience that pushed our group to the limit. Connor and Bo, did a very good job",
          "I'd like to say that switchback drive going up is pretty scary, if you're not used to driving them. However, it's 100% worth the drive up and down. My wife and I went here unsure to the Lantern Tour, a bit pricey but it was something cool and slightly creepy. The tour was",
          "This was a great experience for myself and the family. Thanks so much! I plan on returning sometime in the near future.",
          "Stopped by here on out family road trip. Chris was our guide. He was animated and full of information. He definitely make the tour super fun. The caverns were awesome. We wanted to go on the lantern tour but it was sold out. We went in the discovery tour and had a lot of fun.",

          "Our whole family of 4 really enjoyed the Discovery Tour with Tyrese! He kept us laughing while giving us all the facts & history of the Cave. The cave itself is an amazing place!! The park also has a ropes course for kids & a zip line type ride that we did not have time to",
          "At $22 I expected more. The 45-60 minute tour leaving every 10 minutes is a little too pre-packed for me. Our guide was nice and informative enough but the \u201ccave\u201d is not exceptional. It does not come close to Carlsbad. We do the other thing because they were outlandishly",
          "A famous limestone cave complex with many visitors. I am a cave/ mine fan and have reviewed one other in Missouri. Turned up on a lovely Saturday with my wife for a looked forward to visit, it was busy as expected and we queued and paid, it was going to be an 80 minute wait",
          "Guides for rock climbing and zip lining were very helpful and friendly. Terror-dactyl was fun. Guest services and multimedia manager really came through for for us.",
          "After waiting more than an hour in relatively breezy conditions for the Terror Dactyl, my daughter and I made it to the next to ride when a new person came on to operate the ride and decided it was too windy to ride. We waited another hour with the wind being much less than when",
          "We took the cave tour 101 with our family and loved it! Not appropriate for babies and toddlers...a few had to be escorted out due to their fear of the dark.",
          "Theresa was amazing. She really enjoys her job and made the tour so much fun for everyone. The male guide after us was less than friendly. Expected us to walk down a set of rock stairs in the dark and not touch anything with our hands. Then put up a railing.",
          "We only did the cave tour, but it was really nice to able to do an activity in the evening at a lower price! Lots of fun activities to do and watch there. Beautiful view!",
          "Excellent place with activities for all ages. We had a big family group with kids from 3-14. The kid package was reasonably priced considering it was good for the whole day. Our cave tour guide was a real sweetheart and very informative",
          "We took the lantern tour and had Cheyenne as our guide. She was fantastic! Definitely worth the money!",
          "Great way to beat the heat. Our tour guide Cheyenne was engaging, funny and a great story teller. She made this excursion one of the best and moved it to the top of our list during this visit. Highly recommended!",
          "It is a definite go see place. Very good place to take older kids as it is not only interesting but educational. Our guide was very friendly and she added humor to her talks which made it fun. The only disappointment my family had was we didn't see any bats. Besides that, it was",
          "This tour exceeded expectations on so many levels! We really loved the ghost lantern tour so worth the money will definitely be visiting again!",
          "There was something for our entire family to do. We all loved our tour through the caves. Our tour guide Sawyer was great! He was full of information and jokes. The kids (2yr-10 yr) love it",
          "This is fun for the entire family. We did cave tours, zip line, and terror dactyl. Carissa was our lantern tour guide, Bo and Chris were our guides for the zip lines. They all did a great job. Great for all ages",
          "Cave of the Winds has really changed since I was a kid; I just remember a cave. Now there are rides, a VR theater, and climbing activities. We did all that and our kids (15 and 12) enjoyed it all. We did the lantern tour with Conner; he was great. The only problem was the line",
          "We really enjoyed the lantern tour. We had four 11 year old boys with us who really got into the story in addition to enjoying the cave itself.",
          "Amanda was such a great guide during our tour in the cave. She was not only informative but quite humorous! It was the perfect thing to do on a hot day and the chicken wrap + cold beer helped.",
          "This place is a mixture of a tiny Amusement Park and a historic cave. We came here twice on our 3 day trip to Colorado Springs. We did the Bat-a-pult twice and did the Discovery Cave Tour as well. Both were great experiences! The cave tour was interesting! On the tour you hear",
          "I\u2019d been as a child a few times and wanted to show my daughter what it\u2019s like. The gift shop is affordable for souvenirs, which was a plus. Hoodies were $24. Can\u2019t rven get that at Walmart. They have several Cave tours options. They have two zip lining trails\u2014the best adventure",
          "This place has been around for a few million years! The owners merely keep making the experience better. Great place to spend a full day for a family. Be sure to jump off a cliff if you are in to adrenalin. I am not, but enjoy watching the delighted screams of others!",
          "My husband and I brought our 17 year old for his birthday on this highly recommended tour - and it did NOT disappoint! Conner was amazing with his in-depth knowledge of the history of the caves and still managed to keep us on edge with humor and fear. However, the one thing",
          "We love cave of the winds! Our kids have now been twice, and they loved it both times. First we took the basic tour when they were 3 and 8, then recently we did the lantern tour- they were barely 6, and 11. We all loved it- it wasn\u2019t too spooky for our youngest. We will go back",
          "The tour, with oil lanterns and spooky stories was interesting. We got a little bored after awhile as there was a lot of standing around just listening to ghost stories. Would have liked to have seen more of the cave areas. Our guide, Connor, was enthusiastic and made it",
          "We did the Discovery tour today! Our guides name was Amanda and she did an amazing job except for her Texas joke lol. She made it entertaining and fun! Would definitely recommend this tour! Our daughter loved the bat-a-pult and the wind walker! Will come back again!",
          "If you're into all thinks spooky and scary, do this tour! Going into the cave with nothing but a dimly lit lantern was an incredibly unique experience and one that I recommend to anyone who likes a bit of adventure! Our tour guide, Bethany, was excellent. She delivered the tour",
          "Took our grandkids on the Discovery tour of the caves. All had a great time. Tall people should be aware that there are some places that require bending over (I'm 6'3\" and bent in half a couple of times) to get through. Watch for head knockers too. One is the ping pong",
          "The building and surrounding area are beautiful. The tour was fun and our guide was friendly and knowledgeable. The little ones did climb the slide and two in our group did the zipline (which they said was fun). The gift shop was packed and difficult to get around in; somewhat",
          "Took the Latern tour today. Our guide Bethany made the tour. She gave the tour with enthusiasm where it was fun and a little spooky at the same time.",
          "We celebrated my daughters 13 th birthday and did the mountain man package. We loved the rock climb with the zip line finish.",
          "There were a few things to keep the kids busy plus the cave tour and before you knew it 4 hours had gone by. Grant it they did do the reality and chair ride several times For 3 to do unlimited rides and 5 of us to tour the cave it cost about $200. 00. Not bad for a fun",
          "Our Tour guide Cassie S was fun and knowledgeable, amazing at getting the group to focus as well as making us comfortable. The caves are beautiful And I felt that the facts and history shared were very intriguing. Loved every minute of it!",
          "We did the lantern tour where you literally follow a tour guide through with only a gas lantern and get to hear creepy stories! This is not a sight seeing tour, the company offers one of those as well. We took our 16 and 17 year old daughters and they enjoyed the tour, i would",
          "I went on the lantern tour with my wife and it was so much fun! If you like being scared and hearing ghost stories in a dark cave with a horrific history then this is exactly the thing for you. Yeah it\u2019s expensive, but totally worth it for the good time and memories. DO NOT GO",
          "While Cave of the Winds is an intricate maze of caves, once you've seen other caves, they're all about the same. If it was my first time in a cave, I would have been wowed, I'm sure. The story of its discovery (we enjoyed the Discovery Tour) was interesting and it was so nice",
          "We really didn\u2019t fully understand what we were getting into with some via Ferrata to get to our zip line - but it very much bonded us as a family and made us feel accomplished! The Lantern cave tour was super fun as well. John \u201cThe hippie\u201d is an amazing story teller and made it",
          "What a fun place. Wonderful cave tour and great active adventure for the family. My teenagers loved it!",
          "My family and I had a truly wonderful experience at Cave of the Winds!! We loved the tour of the caves, the Bat-a-pulp, the Ropes Challenge course, and all of the very informative material about the caves and area. Thank you!!!!",
          "For myself, this was my first visit to Cave of the Winds, but my husband had been there before. We decided to do the Discovery Tour, as it was most popular with families and there wasn't a lot of small spaces. We got there around 2:00 pm, and it was fairly busy, especially",
          "We took our kids ages 9 and almost 5 and they loved all the activities especially the ropes course!!",
          "We did the Lantern tour with Cat, she was great! Her sarcastic sense of humor, and animation went perfectly with this type of Tour. She warned that anyone who is claustrophobic or who is easily scared, this tour isn't for you, and she is correct. If you are the kind of person",
          "The cave was amazing! We definitely would like to take the lantern tour on a return visit. We hope to come back soon!",

          "My wife and I visited the caves on a work trip and it was awesome! The price was very reasonable for the experience and we really enjoyed our tour guide Amanda! She did a great job and we appreciated her jokes!",
          "One hour tour--shortest cave tour but lots of stairs and bending over to go through. Interesting but expensive--as we have several caves in Texas, this one did not surpass what we have seen here. Our guide obviously had a prepared speech which sounded memorized and each",
          "Our guide was very fun ( Grant) and informative. There are some very small areas that some people would probably find uncomfortable. The gift shop was very nice and food was reasonable.",

          "My girlfriend and I did the candlelight tour. Wasn't really sure what to expect. We more just signed up to do some tourist things in Colorado spring, but it was just a blast. Our tour guide, Gale, was very charismatic and told great stories. She really made it twice as good.",
          "We did the regular cave tour since we had three children (ages 10, 8 and 4). They loved the cave tour! It was their favorite part of our Colorado trip and we did many other touristy places. Our guide was fun and very informative. We'd love to go back and do the lantern tour with",
          "My entire family really enjoyed this tour. The guide was extremely knowledgeable and entertaining. I strongly suggest you take the Lantern Tour. There are some elements of the tour geared toward scaring the participants, and you may feel as if you are participating in",
          "We enjoyed the Discovery Tour with our 7, 4 & 2 year old boys. It was just long enough & our tour guide, Hunter, was great! We used a front baby carrier for the 2yo- which I highly recommend! More stairs and smaller spaces than I anticipated but it was awesome!",
          "Our family has done several caves and some are very difficult for our 3 year old. This was a very easy trek that gave her and other little ones in our group a great experience. Thanks Hippie for all your help our group had a wonderful time!",
          "We did the discovery tour at 8:30pm and it was amazing! The tour guide, Chris, was very dry funny which is our type of funny and he was very informative, my husband and young teens loved it! We highly recommend it! When the kids get a little older we would love to come back and",
          "We had a great time going thru the cave of the winds. Tatiana was our tour guide and was quite funny as well as informative. It's a pretty extensive tour that didn't feel rushed. The group we were with was in a good mood which added to the enjoyment. Tatiana was great",
          "Great tour guide....kept the tour lively and very informative. Even kept a 4 year old entertained. Amazing to have caves like this in Colorado.",
          "My boyfriend and I were guided by Alex and Rob. So much mental and physical support from them, and a few laughs too! Really great experience all around even though I started out super nervous. Both guides were super knowledgeable and allowed me to take my time and give me plenty",
          "Missed my original scheduled tour but the was easily able to go with the next scheduled group. All facilities were well kept and clean. Enjoyed the selection of other activities and concessions while waiting for my tour. The tour itself was great fun for me and my preteens.",
          "We enjoyed the lantern tour although it was unclear if the stories with based on real history or if they were just folklore.",
          "This is a surprising enterprise, by the name you'd think it's just about caves, but it's far more than that, a definitely revisit is in order. Kids and adults enjoyed it.",
          "This was the first time our boys 5, 10 , and 16 have been in a cave. It was just the right length. There are some steep stairs that really little ones may have trouble with but could do with help from an adult. It was 98 outside and the 54 degree temps were a welcome reprieve. I",
          "We enjoyed our tour so much! We learned so many new things and our tour guide had a wonderful sense of humor!!!",
          "I went here with my wife, 8 & 10 year old daughters. Took the basic tour which was greatly informative. A few narrow areas and uneven ground...it's a cave. Nothing difficult. My family really enjoyed the tour. We went early, upon exiting the cave the visitor center was",
          "AMAZING! Did the lantern tour. Our guide Carissa was absolutely incredible. Highly recommend this to all!",

          "Fun and entertaining! The tour guide told a great story/ history of the caves! Very cool for the teenagers.",
          "The tour guide was great and fun for the whole family. I would recommend this to anyone that visits the area",
          "Caves are always fun, but the history behind these caves of the winds is more interesting than the caves themselves. No dramatic cathedrals or reveals, just some expected halls filled with stalactites \u2014 which one is warned repeatedly not to touch, while walking on a concrete",
          "The cave tour was a great way to cool off on a hot day. Our guide from Virginia was wonderful! The views were breathtaking! We returned in the evening to take advantage of the Happy Hour activities. This was an awesome deal! Unlimited ropes course, rock wall, Batarang, VR Ride -",
          "We visited because my kids really wanted to ride the Terror-Dactyl. My youngest was unable to ride because you have to weigh at least 100 lbs, and he was 93. They weigh everyone to make sure you can ride. It is a balance issue and not safe if someone is either over or under the",
          "The cave was beautiful & fascinating. Rob was entertaining & fun. It was a nice afternoon but a little pricey.",

          "As far as the exterior of a show cave goes, this cave has to be in the top 5% of show caves. The canyon/sink hole this cave is located in and the entrance building built around it is phenomenal! You have breathtaking views looking straight down and almost straight up! Our",
          "This place is a little overcrowded in the afternoon, so i highly recommend to go there at the earliest time possible. Cave tour was interesting, but not that great as i might look on pictures, anyway my son and wife enjoyed it. In a matter of fact we are sporty couple, but we",

          "I have not been on the basic cave tour, but from what I know about cave tours in general, the lantern tour is worth the upgrade. It was much more fun than a generic cave tour.",
          "This is a classic stop for tourists. We had a great guide who told a lot about the natural history of the caves and the Native American history.",
          "Guide is knowledgeable and friendly. Great explanations and humor combined. Must take care when walking through cave but that added to the experience--this is not a stroll in the park! Time spent was well worth it!",
          "I love how this tour allows you to feel like you are spelunking, yet it is in a safe, controlled environment. It is fun for a family tour, yet I wouldn't take really young kids. They allow you to experience the extreme darkness of a cave, and it might frighten really little",

          "Admission prices for the Discovery Tour are a bit lower when purchasing \"early bird\" tickets, so we opted to wake up early and get out there early! The entire park is beautiful and very well-maintained. The gift shop carries an assortment of clothing items and trinkets, and",

          "This was a good cave if you do not have access to any other caves. Our guide was good (we did the basic package). Walking the cave is not simple but is doable. (I only banged my head once!!) There are quite a few steps and a few low ceilings areas. Being in the cave was a great",
          "WOW!!!! So I am in Colorado Springs visiting my friend and her family and I decided this ride looked like a great idea as I love a bit of adrenaline!! My friend took a little convincing but was on board by the time we arrived and took a peak at the set up. We booked online 2",

          "We enjoyed our trip to the Cave of the Winds. We went on the Lantern Tour. It did what was intended -- ghost stories in a creepy cave! Know ahead of time that this tour does not provide scientific information on the caves. My only issue was that we got misinformation about where",
          "We visited the Cave of the Winds with our 1 and 2 year old for their first cave experience. We had seen that you could purchase tickets online but decided to try our luck which is a huge mistake when traveling with small children. We were assigned a ticket time 1 hour from our",
          "We are a family from FL so getting to go \"into a mountain\" was quite exciting. We did the regular Discovery Tour. I recommend purchasing tickets on-line ( we did just a few hours before we went). You can purchase there, but the group sizes are limited and some people had to wait",

          "The caves are very cool to see! The facility is very well run as well. It's a little pricey but worth it. If you register online for a tour before 10am, you can save $4 per person. Our tour guide, Sam, was very knowledgable and entertaining. Our boys (8 and 10) really enjoyed",
          "We flew into Denver from Texas, drove an hour and a half just to ride the \"Terror-dactyl\". We arrived to what is an amazingly beautiful park. We had the most exhilarating, frightful & fun time riding the Terror-dactyl only to find out that the videographer made a mistake and",

          "We took the lantern tour. Our guide was great. Make sure your kids are brave if they go. Mine cried the whole second half because he was scared of the ghost stories. The only down side of this tour is that you only use lanterns and it was hard to see the cave formations.",

          "It was a great time except the video or pictures didn\u2019t work when I went on the ride. The lady said there was nothing they could do to retrieve them and didn\u2019t offer anything else. Not a big deal but the video and pictures are all part of the experience",
          "My husband and I have bee on both tours a couple times and she was by far the best guide we have had. She was very enthusiastic with her stories and added details in that even made it clear how much she loved her job. She gave us the best tour out of 4 we have been on. Great job",

          "My grandchildren had so much fun. Out of all we did on vacation this even qualified for thanking me for taking them! The only thing I had ordered 4 tickets and my youngest grandson 6 years old decided he didn\u2019t want to do ANY of the attractions I was told I would be refunded",
          "Had great time at Cave of the winds. So many more things to do than just tour the cave. Ropes course and rick wall for the kids- they had a great time. Tour was neat and informative. We did the basic tour without any difficulties.",

          "We visited today with my 8 year old boys and it was PERFECT. We did the discovery tour and the kids loved it. There were some steep stairs but it was not difficult at all. For $30 you can get passes for the majority of the attractions and they loved the Bat a Pult, ropes course",
          "The price for the tour was more than we wanted to pay, so we chose to just look around at the gift shop and look out from the deck at the beautiful scenery. Very beautiful.",
          "My family and I had a great time on the Discovery Tour. We would have loved to do the Lantern Tour but it was sold out so book early. Our guide Connor was awesome. Very knowledgeable, fun and \u201cpunny\u201d. He was great!",
          "Really neat place. Something for all ages, including a climb on obstacle course for all ages, kids can shake out a pan of pay dirt for treasure, zip line, the cave tour and so much more. We took the cave tour. Guide was very knowledgeable of the caves both in history of the",

          "Some of the attractions were closed because we were there early in the season (May) and there was still snow on the ground. However, it was very clear this was a private commercial cave and not run by a park facility. The cave tour was rushed and didn't really provide time for",
          "I went as a child, and I went 10 years ago. (NOT 2018). Learn the difference between stalagtites and stalagmites (spelling probably not correct.) The temps inside are cool and relaxing. Don't hit your head on Ping and/or Pong!!",
          "Cave tour is fine. It is not as fun as the idea of a lantern cave tour is. You can barely see anything and it is only a few rooms. To make it more fun take advantage of the historical events (assuming they are even true). 1: Set up buckets for business cards or have people",
          "Lots of fun, guide was informative about cave structures and knew the history. Well organized and they cared about the customers safety which is important. Thanks",

          "A great day to explore the caves. It was hot outside and lovely inside. The guide was cheerful, well-informed and had a great sense of humor. Nothing too strenuous for any of us, although there are a lot of steps. Still, my sister, who had a recent hip replacement and I",
          "Our family (three adults and four kids) had a blast. We did the early morning Pioneer Package and easily spent 4 hours at the park. The lines were short (possibly in part due to our going right when they open) and the kids had a blast.",

          "Loved it. I have slight clostrophobia and at the beggining I really just wanted to leave. But once in my fear has gone away. Warning is that there is a 3 foot, duck walk that is less than a minute long. Also the paranormal stuff is true. My experience was horrifying. My clothes",

          "We took the lantern tour a couple of weeks ago and it was wonderful! We weren't too interested in learning the geology behind the caves, so this tour was perfect for us. Imbedded into the ghost stories was an interesting and fun history of the caves and its founders. Our tour",
          "It's a very nice cavern, great formations of staleagtites and stalagmites, when I was a child you could drop coins in the wishing well. They discourage that now, however its fun to look back on the memory.",

          "Amazing place to visit. Couldn't get the lantern tour as it was all sold out. Did the discovery tour and my 5 yr old loved it and learnt so much about caves.",
          "They have a wonderful setup and the guide was entertaining. I would love to be able to travel alone.",

          "The \"haunted\" lantern tour was big fun and not scary at all! Our guide was dramatic and had fun stories to tell. When we had to blow out the lanterns to make it completely dark, that was the \"scariest\" part of the trip. All in all, a fun and informative tour!",
          "An awesome tour with a great guide. Got very muddy and learned alot from our informative guide. Only negative is we purchased a USB at the end which was said to have photos of everything in the cave that we saw but surely it did not. We were also told we could print said photos",

          "I recently took the Discovery Tour with a friend and it was...fine. I would give 2.5 stars if it were possible. I think a lot of my issues were with the people on our tour, not the tour itself. People were constantly taking photos with the flash on, to the point I started",

          "We did the lantern tour and Iza was an awesome tour guide! The stories were great and she was very knowledgable. The caves are super interesting and very well kept. Totally worth the money.",
          "My family and I took the Lantern Tour with \"The Hippie\" aka John. It was an awesome adventure, he made everything feel more real and really brought out the ambiance you get within the caverns. I highly recommend this tour and if you're lucky get John as your guide.",

          "Very very informative tour guides I have been on two two or four times next time I tour Cave of the Winds I hope to do the cave exploration tour which is 4 hours with a helmet and a light some of the tour is actually on your back you make it fairly dirty doing this one",
          "Absolutely amazing! You dont even have to take the actual cave tour; my son and I spent an entire day just participating in the above-ground activities. \nOur favorite is the 3-tier rope course that hovers hundreds of feet above the canyon and the climbing wall, as well as one of the most amazing gift shops I've ever seen.",
          "A great place to spend the day with the kids. There is no entry fee, and there is so much you can do for free. The kids can play on the small games, and everybody can enjoy the beautiful view from the balcony. Lots of seats, jus to seat and \u2026",
          "Great for families!! Kids are able to take the regular tour with no problems. There were a lot of kids on our tour and they loved it! Plus there is a tower with bungees that kids can climb through while you wait for your tour. We had a great time and bought some really cool souvenirs",
          "The lantern tour was an amazing experience! The cave could stand all alone but our tour guide made it so much fun and exciting!! He knew so much about the cave and was so excited in how he told the stories of the caves past! Would \u2026",
          "Umm do you want to experience natural beauty beyond you imagination. Well the you know what to do.",
          "The Lantern tour was neat. The Hippie was our guide and he did a really great job sharing the history of the cave while making sure that we remember to respect and preserve the cave. I did not realize the impact that even a small amount of the oil from our skin could have. I am definitely interested in going back for caveing 101.",

          "We did not actually go to the Cave of Winds, we went to the Illumination Mountain, which wasn't too bad, it was cool that you got Free cocoa, Free s'mores, and Free drinks, but had to pay $25 which covered our entire truck!  The small fires were cool, lights were nice, and just other little things to do was pretty cool!!",
          "My boyfriend loves anything to do with paranormal activity so when he booked the directors cut version of the lantern tour I was kinda freaked out. The whole tour I was too but it was great! All the stories and the detail, you can picture \u2026",
          "This place was awesome, did I go into the cave? Yup. Did I get scared and walk out? Sure did. But I was told that it was amazing inside. \n\nPlenty to do even without the cave. The views from up top are one in a million",
          "Fantastic way to spend the day. Wes was hilarious with the kids and made it even more enjoyable!",
          "Thrilling rides and breathtaking views. Cave of the Winds is one of my favorite places in Colorado",

          "Loved the discovery tour. Must visit if you are in Colorado springs. The tour is about 45 mins.",
          "I had some family come into town for a visit and I took them to Cave of the Winds for something fun to do during the day. We took the lantern tour and it was worth every penny and then some. Our guide was amazing and she really did a great \u2026",

          "The tour was amzing! Our tour guyde Linda was fantastic! She was so informative and helpful. I had my son with me and she let me know when there was slim or low areas. She also answered all of our questions and was extreamly kind!",
          "Amazing tours. Hippy john is an amazing tour guide. The views are incredible. Staff is very welcoming.",
          "Casey was funny and interesting and made the experience more than enjoyable! Thanks Casey!!! Would recommend the 4:30 tour was definitely worth it as they give you more time to look around and it's a slower pace! For 22$ they could borrow you a flashlight but my phone did work good as well!",
          "You have to go at least once! But you can go as much as you want. It's a definite must see.",
          "We originally booked the Lantern Tour online but when we got there, they told us we wouldn\u2019t see any cave formations on this tour, there wouldn\u2019t be any light the entire time besides our lantern, we\u2019d be crawling through 42\u201d spaces and we \u2026",
          "Amanda B as a great tour guide!  Very knowledgeable and entertaining!!!  Our son was doing a science report on Cave of the winds and they were so helpful with information.  Wonderful experience!",
          "Emily is a good tour guide, unfortunately the tour language is a bit juvenile. The group was a bit large and it was hard to see all the things that the guide was pointing out. Even though the tour is 45 minutes it seemed to go much faster so it isn't at all boring.",
          "We arrived while it was raining and went on the Discovery Tour. It was awesome. Really cool caves and was a great way to spend a few hours until the storm passed. They also have outdoor activities that were opened when we left, but we were \u2026",
          "It was just... AMAZING. Fun caves to explore! Amazing food \ud83d\ude0d.  You will love this if you love exploring and they even tell about 18's storys. If you get the lantern tour they tell you some ghost story's while you are exploring the caves! They are so kid friendly and I recommend this to everyone. \ud83d\ude03",
          "We took the lantern tour. The hippie John was awesome! His way of story telling great as well. We had our 6 year old daughter with us she was able to do the walk and the stories weren't too bad according to her.",
          "The Lantern Tour was neat but primarily focused on ghost stories (who died in the caves/rooms and now haunts visitors). I was hoping to get a little more information from the tour guide, Lexy, on the cave themselves.  It was my mistake that \u2026",
          "The lantern tour was amazing! We went as a team builder with the company I work for and it was alot of fun. Listening to the ghost stories and history throughout the tour was good stuff. I want to thank our tour guide John \"The Hippie\" was the best",
          "Went today with my family for their Christmas activities. Great deal !Beautiful decorations and alot of great activities! Chris on the ropes course was also amazing so helpful and kind to my six year old !",
          "First time here for myself and my baby. We had fun but I should have had the baby carrier to walk with my child around. I thought it was very warm but others found it chilly. Some steep steps at times and definitely listen to your tour guide.",
          "A truly breathtaking experience, something you have to visit at least once in your life. Just going down in the deep dark cave is like entering a whole new world. The sights you will see, you will remember for the rest of your life. They \u2026",
          "This is a place to take the family for a days event but bring your wallet because you're going to need to open it up to really enjoy everything they offer.",
          "garden of the gods is 4 stars compared to this 5 star tourist attraction if you like rocks and especially caves if you're feeling \"different.\"  This is on par with glenwood springs (another absolute masterpiece).",
          "I have wanted to ride terror dactyl for quite some time. It was the main reason of going here and it did not disappoint! Would've done it more than once if not so pricey. The magic lantern VR ride was also a lot of fun. Beautiful views from almost anywhere.",
          "Emily was an awesome tour guide, friendly and funny. During our tour, one of the tourists started to feel ill and Emily immediately took care of the person's safety and needs, and went back to our tour without missing a beat. Very professional! The mountain views are breathtaking",

          "Cave of the winds is a great experience. There are lots of different tour choices. The lantern tour is when your only source of light is lanterns which I find can make it hard to see all the parts of the cave. I loved the discovery tour \u2026",

          "Very fun experience. Great tour. Would go again",

          "The view from the park is phenomenal and there are many things to do. If your children are under 42 inches they will only be able to do the cave tour and none of the above ground activities. The Pioneer Package is a good deal as long as you \u2026",
          "Great place to see with the family. Great views from the lodge.",

          "Great tour! Very educational and interesting. I had my kids with me and they didn't have any issues going through the cave. I will say some of the passages are VERY VERY narrow and small and for larger/taller people you will have a very \u2026",

          "The cave might have been interesting in the late 19th century when it was first discovered but it had been tarnished by excavators and tourism companies. Now it just feels like a manmade cave and the experience is really fake.",

          "A Colorado treasure and must see when you are in the Colorado Springs area. The tour guides are knowledgeable. They have a tour of the inside of the caves with lights or take a tour with lanterns in the pure blackness of a cave. Prices are \u2026",
          "We had an excellent tour guide take us underground through the caves.  So interesting!  He did a great job of explaining about the interior, and showed us examples of every kind of stagmite.  He included jokes, history and kept his group together well.  If you haven't been here, it is well worth it!",
          "A nice highlight from our trip. Guide was Tatiana, and brought a lot of info and made the tour fun with some laughter and dry humor. Occasionally hard to understand because of the speed of her talks.",
          "My husband and I did the Lantern Tour with Lexi and we enjoyed the history and the authentic experience in the cave. Lexi was a great tour guide who created suspense and also made you feel safe when the cave got a little more intense.",
          "My husband and I took the lantern tour, we loved it! Grant did a great job telling stories and he was very entertaining. I was a bit disappointed that we couldn't take pictures inside the cave, I was hoping to catch a ghost on camera! \nThe \u2026",
          "Beautiful view. I love the bat something (Zipline basically), virtual reality, and the climbing challenges. Unfortunately we didn't get to do the terror dactyl due to the weather. Overall, it was fun and beautiful. This is must do if you stop by Colorado springs.",
          "I was hoping to experience a slight hike but the views were great and the drive up was enjoyable. The tourists attractions were kid-friendly",
          "Wow! This was another fun experience you must try when in Colorado. It really was a unique one and family friendly. Both me and my husband enjoyed learning the history of this place and walking around in the caves! You have to go with a \u2026",
          "Surprisingly a perfect adventure for the whole family! This is a place for those who wants to experience adventure in all different levels (mild to extreme).  My kiddos ages 7-14 all had a blast and I did too! I recommend buying the full day pass for your kiddos or the passes because it\u2019s worth the price.",
          "Went on the lantern tour with a friend who was in town. It was a lot of fun and our guide Bethany was awesome! You could tell she enjoyed giving tours and it really elevated the experience. Highly recommended!",
          "We came here as a staff outing and it we all had a blast! We did the lantern tour with our awesome guide Connor and had a fabulous time! We did all of the rides and the wind walker challenge course again, was a ton of fun! We are planning \u2026",
          "It was a nice place to visit. At first the cave was comfortably cool but they send groups in 5 minutes apart and sometimes there would be two other groups with it within earshot and that amount of body heat warmed up the cave considerably. \u2026",
          "Iza, our guide was pretty phenomenal, for the discovery tour. It's my first time in Colorado and the features are breathtaking. I had a great time as I have always had a great interest in caves and am so grateful to have gotten to have this experience. Colorado sure seems to know how to treat guests, thank you.",
          "I took the Discovery tour with my family today, and it was wonderful! Our tour guide, Sam R, was friendly and funny and did an excellent job showing us the fun features in the cave! One needs to be cautious if they're tall as some spots are \u2026",
          "I had a lot of fun taking this tour! I will say that if you\u2019ve been on cave tours before this will be a lot of the same but if you enjoy caving, definitely check it out. I think if I would\u2019ve done anything different it would be to get the lantern tour and get told spooky stories in the dark \ud83d\udc80",
          "Have to do the tour. Great family activity.",
          "What an awesome adventure. My group did the directors cut lantern tour and had a blast. Our tour guide \"The King under the Mountain\" told the history of the cave and the surrounding area as though he lived through the actual events. He was \u2026",
          "Experiencing the falls that close up is unbelievable. No where else would you be able to get this view and experience. Totally worth it and felt amazing.",
          "It was a lot of fun learning the history of the caves while inside the caves on candlelight. I was expecting a totally different experience, where I was going to be more scared. Lexy made the tour and experience so relaxing and fun while \u2026",
          "Loved the cave tour! Chris was an excellent guide and answered so many questions. Lived here several years and never came until now and believe me it's not something I'd have put off if I'd known how interesting it truly was. I recommend everyone try to go at least once in their lives!",
          "Such amazing sites. Have been here a few times now and love it more and more each time. Plenty to see. Watch for wildlife as it is always a wonderful thing to witness.",
          "Loved the cave tour! It was about 45 minutes long so while it wasn't drawn out, it wasn't too fast and there was very informative commentary. Our tour guide, Victoria was great as well! Very knowledgeable, goofy, and entertaining.",
          "Lots of fun with my friends. Our tour guide was very energetic and enthusiastic! Will definitely be back!",
          "I took the lantern tour with John the Hippie. Ghost stories can be told, but John\u2019s dry humor and theatrics make the stories legendary. His tours are the best. ...not for sissies or cry babies though. \nP.S. Texans beware",
          "Lovely place.. two options to see.. discovery caves and lantern caves.. But after 5.00pm they didn't give us tickets for lantern caves and said tickets were over.. so if you are planning to go weekend plan to go little early.. for discovery caves they charged $22 but its worth watching..",
          "Our guide was very knowledgeable and fun. The whole lantern tour was very interesting because of her stories. However, the cave is quite small, and I think price is a bit high.",
          "Chloe was my tour guide and she was funny and super friendly and knew what she was talking about. I appreciate her effort and it really showed. Just gotta give credit when credit is due.",
          "We took the discovery tour and had \"The Hippie\" as our guide and he was great.  He was entertaining as well as knowledgeable making our overall experience great. The tour was about 45 minutes which was the perfect amount of time.",
          "Tatiana was our tour guide for the Lantern Tour.  She did a great job of setting the scene and spooky ambiance.  She kept everyone\u2019s attention, loved her rendition of the ghost stories and cave\u2019s history.  She \u201cenforced\u201d audience \u2026",
          "Tour was faster then I wanted but it is expected when they are on a time limit. Good tour, great stories and the Rick formations are beautiful! If your AD or a vet you will get a discount. Nice gift shop too!",
          "We really enjoyed the cave tour! We have been in several caves before but saw some new and interesting formations. Our guide was Sawyer and he was fantastic. We will happily come again \ud83d\ude0a",
          "I went for my 3rd tour of the caves today and took my sister and step son for their first time! Sam was our guide and he was by far the BEST one I\u2019ve had! He made us all laugh and made learning about the cave fun for everyone. One of these days I\u2019ll do more then just the basic tour!",
          "Tatiana gave us a tour and she was fantastic. Besides the cave there is lots to do for the whole family.",
          "We bought the pioneer package happy hour special for $15 for 2 hours of rides & ropes. Our  9 & 12 year-old boys loved it! (And we did too) We went from 7-9pm in mid-July, and the sun was just setting - it's a beautiful time at the cave!",
          "Carissa was an amazing tour guide. She took us on the discovery tour, and she explained everything well and made some pretty cheesy but funny jokes. She had the right amount of energy and looked like she enjoyed her job and talking about caves very much.",
          "We did the basic discovery tour which I'm glad the other tours sounded like a little too dark and too much for me. The caves were amazing looking. Our guide was Victoria she was in for informative and knowledgeable. She was friendly too. The view from the outlook is amazing the best you can see so much landscapes.",
          "The Terror Dactyl was awesome. It was a very smooth ride. Lots of fun activities for families. Some of the activities are unlimited. Easily spend the whole day here.",
          "Went on the discovery tour with my father with Iza as our guide and I am beyond impressed. Her knowledge of the caves, personality, sense of humor, and the fact that you can tell that she loves her job made the experience for me. We have a \u2026",
          "Such a great experience. The tour guide was well informed and made it even better.",
          "Nice structures inside the caves and nice thrilling rides for adrenalin rush",
          "Recently I took the Caving 101 tour. It is well worth the price. Fair warning, it does involve crawling through small muddy passageways, crouching through tunnels if you're not vertically challenged, and a 5' assisted climb. You will get \u2026",
          "We did the ghost tour and had so much fun! Our guide was fantastic! I\u2019m sure he does this tour all the time, but he definitely didn\u2019t show it.",
          "GREAT! PURCHASED IN A DRY ITEMISED PAPER RECEIPT & ATTENDED A TOUR INSIDE THE CAVE'S OF A CAUCASIAN GIRL GUIDE OF A GROUP ON JANUARY 18, 2020 DURING THE DAY OF THE SUN APPEARING OF A LITE FRIGID OF SNOW COVERING PART'S OF THE MOUNTAIN'S \u2026",
          "Just purely magical...the drive there the experience and the way the staff run this place is amazing!!! A must do in coloroda springs!!!",

          "The illumination was very nice, hot cocoa and s'mores with Santa and the coke bear.",
          "The view outside is amazing! The cave was really cool and our tour guide was awesome. Unfortunately our 1 yr old didn\u2019t agree, he got really scared so we had to cut our tour short. He\u2019s usually easy going so we totally thought he\u2019d be fine, \u2026",
          "Will most definitely make it a a point to return! It was a lot of fun.",
          "Breathtaking views! Great cave tours with multiple choices of tour types.",
          "A really neat cave.. We did the gas light tour and it was pretty neat",
          "My family had so much fun! Prices are a little high but so worth it! We rode the Terror Dactyl which was fun but probably wouldn't do it again as it lasts probably less than a minute and a video/picture of you doing it costs an additional \u2026",
          "Definitely a great tour. We just did the discovery tour and it was well worth the experience, our guide was really friendly and extremely knowledgeable. There\u2019s a couple of interesting sounding tours here and some other activities that might be worth checking out as long as you have the time.",
          "This weekend my boyfriend and I did a lantern tour and our tour guide was Bethany. First off the tour was so fun and spooky! But Bethany made the tour, with her stories and fun awesome personality! We were visiting from Fort Collins and really enjoyed ourselves! We will be back!",
          "The bat a pult was a great way to get a great view. The money for each ride is worth it! The discovery tour with the new employee \"Chris\" was a fantastic and stunning. Chris was funny and enjoyable. A very excellent tour guide",
          "Doesn't cost an arm and a leg to your. We did a family friendly hour long guided tour. My young kids loved it. Your guide was informed and pretty funny. It's a pretty location and there's other things to do besides a cave tour. They have a \u2026",
          "Ben was a great tour guide!!  The lantern tour was great.",
          "We loved this place! A must visit if u travel to colorado springs.",
          "Went for the Chrustmas lights and S'mores !  Would gave been great if my grandchildren had been here.",
          "So cool! Amazing sites & interesting facts about the caves and Rocky Mountain region. Very much worth the tour prices plus some other paid attractions. Offer military discounts too! Our guide was very fun, engaging and informative.",
          "Our family did the early morning tour which was discounted. We had two teenagers and two toddlers and everyone enjoyed it. It was very informative and the guide did a great job. Other attractions are a bit pricy though.",
          "Hippy john was an amazing tour guide for the haunted lantern tour, he was animated with both his voice and movements, obviously loves his job and the caves so much and it rubs off on the visitors! I left with a new appreciation for the cave \u2026",
          "I loved it! Not only was the tour educational, but also fun and interesting! The cave traversing wasn't difficult, the tour guide was helpful and fun, and this is overall a great place to learn and explore Colorado's mountains. Check it out!",
          "You can to are the caves or just try out the attractions. It's a lot of fun.",
          "The visit itself was great.  I only gave the visit 4 stars though because I was not impressed with our tour guide, Dakoda. He almost seemed bored to have to be giving us the Discovery Tour.  Otherwise, we had an hour wait until our time to \u2026",
          "This place was an amazing fun adventure. Our tour guide Levi was very informative and really entertaining. I highly recommend this place. I can't wait to go back.",
          "We took our YPLC Teen Camp here for the Discovery Tour! The tour guide, Connor, was as knowledgeable as he was hilarious! He had us laughing the whole tour! I would love to share the jokes, but I wouldn't dare steal his thunder. Go out of your way to come to Cave of the Winds! It will be so worth it!",
          "A must do place to visit at least once in your life. I've been going here since I was a kid. Wonderful place to visit.",
          "The cave itself is absolutely awesome. The price to explore part of nature is bit much. Total turist trap...but it was still cool.",
          "Really cool place!",
          "This place is amazing with beautiful views! We came here to experience The Lantern tour, best time ever!! Gayle was our guide. She definitely made the tour fun. It was our first time in a cave, and if we ever come back, I hope she guides us on another tour someday. Thanks Gayle, and everyone at Cave of the Winds Park!!\u2764",
          "Our tour guide Cheyenne was amazing! We took the lantern cave tour. It was definitely worth the money! We will be back. If you get a chance to go fingers crossed you get Cheyenne as your tour guide too!",
          "Haven't been here since I was a kid and frankly I don't remember it. We decided to bring the kids to check it out and had a great time! The scenery is awesome, views amazing and the cave information is fascinating!!! You can choose from 3 \u2026",
          "Cool cave tour. For someone that was claustrophobic it could be a challenge. You are led through some fairly small places.",
          "An amazing experience!! This place is a must see for tourists and locals alike!",
          "Lots of activities. Ropes course is fun and good for all ages. Had a nice tour of the caves - harder for elderly. Lovely views too",
          "Had a great time with Lexy as our guide for the last lantern tour. She's amazing and really made the experience great. 250ft of bending over and walking was worth it for the ghost stories. Loved the lantern lights and how simplistic the tour is. Kids will definitely enjoy it.",
          "We did the lantern tour and had a great time.  Spooky for sure.",
          "Okay, the 4 stars would have been 5 if I had not been to another cave on the east coast that had tremendously large stalactites and stalagmites. This cave has a lot of man made features and the tites and mites were not very many. There are \u2026",
          "If you want a better experience, best not to go on a major holiday. They had the discovery tours going every five minutes, and you constantly had to stop for another tour. Besides the caves, the views are incredible.",
          "Lantern Tour was so fun! Our guide Conner did an amazing job. He kept the spooky spirit while telling the serious history. Would recommend!",
          "A bit expensive for what you get, and a little too touristy for my taste. Odd walking past another tour guide and they are saying the same scripted jokes. Still fun though!",
          "It was beautiful to look at I'm just not a big cave person or a tiny place person. But if you like to look at cool things and learn something new this is the place to go",
          "Rob was a great guide! This cave is prety big with lots of unique formations. Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys caves but there's alot more to do than just spelunking, and the whole location has breathtaking views",
          "Me and my family went on the lantern tour with our fantastic guide Cheyenne. The tour was very scary because the ghost storys are real. The way into the cave was very small . We used lanterns to light are way through the very dark and spooky cave. 10/10",
          "Dakoda was our tour guide for the Discovery cave tour. He did a great job! A nice addition to our trip. Thanks.",
          "Did the lantern tour at 7 pm on 6/14. Conner was an amazing guide and we learned a ton about the history of the caves. Walking/ducking around a dark cave and listening to ghost stories was pretty spooky, but fun nonetheless! We did a tour during \u201chappy hour\u201d , so paid 26 a person. Well worth the money.",
          "Very fun and informative.  Taylor \"or guide\" was knowledgable and entertaining.  Would love to see adult only tour.  To many crying kids.  Would give 5 stars otherwise.",
          "We took the extra spooky, one lumen, single-candle excursion in the Cave of the Winds. I cannot recall the name of the larger cavern that we went in but it was well worth it. \n\nOur guide, Connor, was very witty and humorous. I would say he \u2026",
          "My best friend and I went on The lantern tour with Theresa as our tour guide.  She was the best! Her knowledge of the cave and the stories that came with it was very impressive.  She brought the stories to life and was funny.",
          "We went on the Discovery tour and had a great time. Hunter was our tour guide and he was both informative and funny/entertaining. 10/10 would recommend this place and 17/10 would recommend Hunter as your guide.",
          "Impressed with cave of the winds. Very impressive cave, very large with lots of walking which was really fun. Definitely has a few impressive rooms with unique formations. Interesting history as well with some old pieces left for display as well.",
          "Did the lantern tour with Lexy, and she was awesome! Her whole attitude was fun and silly :) She told us fun history facts and spooky stories. We were kinda late, (sorry about that friends!) But they were awesome enough to catch us up with the group. Definitely worth going!",
          "Loved this place. Beautiful views. Informed staff. Totally worth the money.",
          "Gale was great ghost tour was super awesome.",
          "Best tour guides! Joy & Lexy were amazing & wonderful. Had the best time and great storytimes.",
          "We tried the lantern tour for the first time and it did not disappoint! Conner was an amazing tour guide- highly recommend asking for his tours to experience the history and past events of this cave. It is chilly and spiders linger, but overall it was an amazing experience! We are extremely happy that we decided to tour this cave!",
          "Awesome mini adventure with family. \nThe guides are hilarious and fun to give you the tour.",
          "Place is beautiful and with a lot of picturesque views. There's a fee for entry but the guide is totally fun to be with and roam around the caves. It also has adventurous sports which might be cool for some daredevils out there.\nThey are a \u2026",

          "Cave of the Winds is a great family friendly place with fun guides and great history.",
          "Loved the haunted tour. Our guide was new but she was so fun. Definitely pretty scary but I'm no horror fan and I got through so what ever that's worth. Amazing views from outside",
          "Definitely a place to visit if your in Colorado.  We did the popular tour. Was amazing took about an hour to do. Definitely bring a light jacket. Our tour guide was Chris he was great!",
          "The views were spectacular and the rides were great. Terror-dactyl is a must!! It's amazing. The views and experience is unlike others. It's my favorite ride by far and I experienced alot.",
          "Beautiful views.  Took the Discovery Tour with Tatiana she was an  excellent guide.",
          "Absolutely had a blast at this place! Kids had fun and I did as well. I learned a ton also!",
          "Beautiful place to visit.. lots of history and my guide Tyrese was super knowledgeable and made it fun. we got caught in cave traffic but totally worth it.. a must see!!",

          "If you haven't been to cave of the winds yet, you need to check it out at least once. A great place to bring the kids and they keep adding more little attractions like the zip line across the canyon, gem mining, bungee tower slide, and a \u2026",
          "Great Tour of the cave, but it\u2019s pretty expensive. Everything in the gift shop is overpriced. I told my son to look for the same product on amazon, he did and found it at half the price, I think that much of an increase is a slap in the \u2026",
          "Beautiful scenery and fun options for friends or family tha that go way beyond caving.",
          "A fine old tourist \"trap\" with lots of fun things to do and see in addition to the guided tour of the cave. A fun place to take the family.",
          "Zipline and extracurricular activities make it a day worth of fun.",
          "We did the lantern tour. Absolutely AMAZING. Our tour guide was Teresa. She was amazing as well. At first I was nervous about going into a cave with just a lantern and nothing else. But it was one of the greatest experiences of my life! 100% definitely will be coming back soon just loved it so much!",
          "They put to many people in our group, over 25. I was not able to hear or see what the guide was talking about and I was in the middle of the group. When I brought it up I was told they should keep the group to 15 people max. If you can't see and hear what is going on it's not worth the price.",
          "My first time going in caves. We originally wanted to do the lantern tour but around 2pm (when we arrived), they only had 2 spots open after 6pm. Ended up going on the discovery tour a little more than an hour after we arrived. The tour was \u2026",

          "Our guide, Sawyer, was absolutely wonderful! He was incredibly knowledgeable about the caves and had a very enthusiastic personality! The caves are beautiful and the Discovery tour was well worth it. My fiance and I cant wait to come back for the Lantern tour!",
          "We did the adventure tour.  It was awesome!  We didn't have the kids with us so it only took us about three hours to ride the swing thing, the zipline and do the tour.  You could probably spend a whole day with kids. Customer service was top notch.",
          "We loved the Early Riser - Discovery Tour with Hunter. It was great fun for the family!! Hunter was very knowledgeable, we enjoyed our tour. We were only here for a short time but next time I would love to do the lantern tour and the zip line.",
          "Amazing place. I want to live in these caves.",
          "Nice tourist attraction.  Some activities for the kids.",
          "The cave was under whelming. The Terror-Dactyl looked awesome! (Giant rip cord off the side of a mountain) but they were behind by almost an hour so we had to get a refund. The climbing course was very fun!!",
          "Great your. Lots of fun. Very beautiful.",
          "Beautiful caves in a beautiful area. Unique climbing and balancing activities. The VR experience is simple, but fun for what it is. The packages are named very vaguely, when they should be named \"Cave tour\" and \"outdoor activities\" so read carefully so you know what your getting.",
          "Wow! What a great experience. We came on a Sunday evening for the cave tour and the individuals working were so kind. My daughter took to one of the gentleman and they had a great time joking and playing around. \nWe decided to come back \u2026",

          "Me and a group of friends went on the lantern tour for my birthday and we had so much fun! Our tour guide, Lexy G. was amazing. She was so fun and funny. We all had lots of laughs and a few scares. \ud83d\ude09",

          "We did the lantern tour with Dakota. He was awesome. Some of the people on our tour we being kinda of loud and obnoxious, and he made a point to ask them to be quiet. He was great at story telling, and he made the tour a great experience! Thanks Dakota!",

          "REALLY cool. Beautiful part of nature you don't see often. Kids (7, 9, 12) all had fun. Our tour guide Abby was great.",
          "Beautiful scenery! The caves were awesome. Would be nice to see a few things for the older/less active group of tourists, to keep them busy while waiting for the tours to start. If you are young and active, plenty to do to keep you busy.",
          "Standing there looking across the gourge down to the conyons bellow was breathtaking.",
          "Everything here is amazing. Did it all and had the best time of my life. Very family friendly and decently priced.",
          "Amazing experience. Discovery tour is worth it as it's a great view to see how nature paints its own canvas. Must see!!",
          "It was great! I just wish it had more closed spaces. I really would enjoy trying to crawl through the olden way.",
          "It was so spectacular. The lighting is awesome.",
          "Took my kids 4 and 6 for the first time! They loved it my 4 year old needed help walking up some of the steps in the cave but did good. My sister and her friend loved the food and the zip line. You have about a 40minute  to an hour wait \u2026",
          "It was awsome to see the caves and hear the history",
          "Very cool tour. The caves are great and hearing the story of how they were discovered is really neat.",
          "Great place to take a tour, the guide we had knew everything although if you talk to him one to one he knew allot more. The caves do halve allot of anomalies that my gf caught in her camera. If your 6 for or taller watch your head heck if \u2026",
          "The staff at the Cave of The Winds was amazing! Our cave tour with John the hippie was amazing. He was very accommodating to our family! His jokes were awesome and the kids enjoyed them! The staff at the above ground adventures were amazing \u2026",
          "Whole family went on a Lantern Tour with Connor. He was very entertaining and kept the group together. Great experience, would definitely recommend, though you should be prepared for some tight quarters.",
          "We had an awesome tour of the caves with Connor, who kept us laughing as he told stories.  After the big kids (6-11) loved the ropes course and zip line.  It wasn't as a big a hit for the 3yo, not much there his size to do but still a very worthwhile visit.",
          "We did the discovery tour and it was fun and informative. Our tour guide Grit was funny and engaging. 10 for 10 recommend.",
          "Had a great tour on friday, with Sam as our guide. I've been wanting to check out the Caves for a long time, and he helped make it a fun, educational, and enjoyable visit! There was a 4 year old on the tour who was misbehaving a bit and Sam \u2026",
          "I\u2019ve lived in CO my whole life and have always wanted to go to the Cave of the Winds. My boyfriend and I signed up for the Lantern Tour. Worth the money! Our guide Bethany was soo much fun. She made sure we had a great experience with her \u2026",
          "Okay cave tour, but cavern formations not very impressive.  We're from Texas, and compared to Natural Bridge Caverns, the stalactite and stalagmite formations are tiny.  The guides are trained well and tell entertaining and historically interesting narratives.  But the actual cave was a disappointment.",
          "Very interesting they have things to do for everyone",
          "Great place for a family visit. You can spend about an hour to two hours here depending upon your tour choice. Great guides and gift shop.",

          "Great Place to visit for family. So many options for beginners to more adventurous types",
          "If your not afraid of heights this is the good place to go they have alot of activities going on,but sad thing is not a pet friendly.",
          "A good place to spend the day.",
          "I did the lamplight tour and had a great time! Our tour guide was nicknamed 'the hippie' and really knew his stuff. Beyond just that he told the stories in such a way that I felt involved in the history of the cave that led it to this point. It was an excellent, immersive experience that I would highly recommend to anyone!",
          "Great tour. We did not ride any rides, but if I was younger I probably would have.",
          "Cave 101 tour was amazing! Way more involved than we thought, it was amazing to crawl through all the caves and learn about the tight spaces. Connor was a great  guide and taught us a lot about caving while being very fun. 4 stars instead of 5 because our group was 15 people and probably should be limited to about 10 or less.",
          "Abby was our tour guide for the lantern tour. She was amazing! It was a blast! I definitely recommend going on this tour! Loved the park as well!",
          "I LOVED IT!! It was so fun! And my tour guide was Cat, she was awesome, she was really fun and taught me so much! The rides were AMAZING!!!!\ud83d\ude06 There was so much to do! And there food was SPECTACULAR! Esspesially their burgers, and chiken tenders!!!",
          "It's always amazing going to Cave of the Winds. Lexy and Joy are awesome employees!",
          "It really cool to see and it didn\u2019t feel rushed at all. Great for families and friends to hangout at. Our tour guide Connor was awesome! Made the tour a lot of fun and made us laugh. I appreciate that he did say some things in Spanish. I would definitely take a tour here again!",
          "It was great and our guide Amanda was so nice and well informed!!",
          "So cool! Caves are cool and lots of activities for the kids outside! We expected to spend a couple hours, and ended up spending way more!!!",
          "We enjoyed the tour of the cave. The guide was energetic and knowledgeable. The views are fantastic. The gift shop selection was a little disappointing. All in all it was worth the price of admission.",
          "Our guide Cheyenne was so informative and Super cool",
          "A great place to go see and see different adventures I was really shocked to know that there was more things to do there",
          "We did the Caving 101 tour and it was amazing! We weren\u2019t entirely sure what we were in for and we were so pleasantly surprised. Our guide Connor was knowledgeable, friendly and encouraging. We got into some seriously tight spaces and I \u2026",
          "Located to lots of adventure options, plus it's cool on it's own.",
          "I love caves but since I am afraid to be a caver, I must satisfy my love with public caves. I have always enjoyed this cave. The property has been updated and includes climbing activities as well as zip lines. One that even children can \u2026",
          "Great scenery. The cave was nice, however, the unexpected forcing you to take a picture upon entrance was not. They did it to push the printed photos at the end on you. Sorry, I hate photos of myself and do not like pushy salespeople. Poor \u2026",
          "Pricey tourist trap!!  Very rushed tour. So much so that our guide ran out of breath as she was introducing herself. While Amanda seemed kind, her tone was flat and she sounded as though she was reading a script in triple time. I\u2019m sure \u2026",
          "Just had the most amazing Caving 101 experience with our cave guide Connor.  Not only was the cave itself gorgeous and full of history, Connor\u2019s enthusiasm and energy only added to the experience.  Cannot recommend it enough.",
          "Our guides Rob and Tyler were so awesome!! It was my first time zip lining. They were soo patient, and told jokes to help ease my tension. Will def be back to visit! Thanks guys!!\n-Kay!",
          "Great guides make for a great cave tour!",
          "My family had an absolute blast. We did the pioneer package and had the best time. Rock wall was very fun, obstacle course was both fun and difficult! While this mom had difficulty, a young lady who was under 10 had no.problem scaling the 3 \u2026",
          "They are exceptionally concerned about making sure everyone has a good time safely. Wicked awesome staff and lots of activities for the whole family.",
          "Was cool and I informative. But over all the tour felt rushed. Little time was given to look at things and they just seemed like they just wanted to get us in and out.",
          "So I didn't go into the caves but explored the surroundings. Loved the ride up and down the mountain and also the climbing games and the souvenir shop.",
          "The cave tour was pretty cool. There were a lot of different activities offered but we only did the cave tour. The other activities looked fun but were very pricey. The best part was the amazing view!",
          "Terrifying and educational ghost tour. Our guide was excellent, but to be honest I don\u2019t know if they should be giving tours at all since there apparently have been injuries from the active spirits in the caves.",
          "Loved it, especially total cave darkness - a truly unique experience. Guides are knowledgeable and pleasant. Bring a hoodie, if 60 degrees is too cool for you.",
          "Such a beautiful location and relaxing atmosphere for the family! Our tour guide, Cat, did an excellent job,  added humor to the tour, and was very patient with our young kids!",
          "Caving politics aside, this is a great spot for folks to see and experience a bit of our incredible underground world. The Terror-Dactyl was awesome - you probably want to do that (although, the guys running the ride are a little obnoxious \u2026",
          "What an amazing adventure! Our tour guide Cat did an excellent job and I would highly recommend her on any tour.",
          "Pretty awesome views!! A definite must see.",

          "Amazing experience. Came around the last minute and got on a tour with \"The Hippie\". By far one of the best tours I've gotten. The cave and it's history was fascinating and the way The Hippie explained it made it more so engaging. A special bit of history to be learnt if you're from Texas. Capped by a beautiful vista. 10/10 recommended.",

          "The lantern tour was an absolute blast! It was my family's favorite \"thing of the day\". Well worth the additional cost. Warning, though. This is not an informational tour. This is an atmospheric version. The lighted tour is the informational one.",

      "name": "Pikes Peak Region Attractions",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Pikes Peak is the highest summit of the southern Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, in North America. The ultra-prominent 14,115-foot (4,302.31 m) fourteener is located in Pike National Forest, 12 miles (19 km) west of downtown Colorado Springs, Colorado. The mountain is named in honor of American explorer Zebulon Pike (though he was unable to reach the summit). The summit is higher than any point in the United States east of its longitude.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe band of Ute people who called the Pikes Peak region their home were the Tabeguache, meaning the \"People of Sun Mountain\". Tava or \"sun\", is the Ute word that was given by these first people to the mountain that we now call Pikes Peak. The Ute people first arrived in Colorado about 500 A.D., although their traditions state they were created on Pikes Peak. In the 1800s, when the Arapaho people arrived in Colorado, they knew the mountain as Heey-otoyoo'  meaning \"Long Mountain\".Throughout its history, Pikes Peak has been called El Capitan, Grand Peak, Great Peak, James Peak, Long Mountain, and Pike's Peak.Early Spanish explorers named the mountain \"El Capit\u00e1n\" meaning \"The Leader\". American explorer Zebulon Pike named the mountain \"Highest Peak\" in 1806, and the mountain was later commonly known as \"Pike's Highest Peak\". American explorer Stephen Harriman Long named the mountain \"James Peak\" in honor of Edwin James who climbed to the summit in 1820. The mountain was later renamed \"Pike's Peak\" in honor of Pike. The name was simplified to \"Pikes Peak\" by the United States Board on Geographic Names in 1890.\n\n\n== Geography and geology ==\n\nPikes Peak is one of Colorado's 53 fourteeners, mountains more than 14,000 feet (4,267.2 m) above sea level. The massif rises 8,000 ft (2,400 m) above downtown Colorado Springs. Pikes Peak is a designated National Historic Landmark. It is composed of a characteristic pink granite called Pikes Peak granite. The color is due to a large amount of potassium feldspar. \nIt is thought that the granite was once magma that crystallized at least 20 miles (32 km) beneath the Earth's surface, formed by an igneous intrusion during the Precambrian, approximately 1.05 billion years ago, during the Grenville orogeny. Through the process of uplifting, the hardened rock pushed through the Earth's crust and created a dome-like mountain, covered with less resistant rock. Years of erosion and weathering removed the soil and rock leaving the exposed mountain.\nSoils on Pikes Peak above the timberline (approximately 12,000 feet or 3,657 m) are classified as Cirque Land. Forests at lower altitudes mostly lie over the brown stony, sandy, loams of the Catamount loam or Ivywild loam series.\n\n\n== European discovery ==\nThe first Europeans to see Pikes Peak were the Spanish in the 1700s. The first American sighting is often credited to members of the Pike expedition, led by Zebulon Pike. After a failed attempt to climb to the top in November 1806, Pike wrote in his journal:\n\n...here we found the snow middle deep; no sign of beast or bird inhabiting this region. The thermometer which stood at 9\u00b0 above 0 at the foot of the mountain, here fell to 4\u00b0 below 0. The summit of the Grand Peak, which was entirely bare of vegetation and covered with snow, now appeared at the distance of 15 or 16 miles [24 or 26 km] from us, and as high again as what we had ascended, and would have taken a whole day's march to have arrived at its base, when I believed no human being could have ascended to its pinical  [sic]. This with the condition of my soldiers who had only light overalls on, and no stockings, and every way ill provided to endure the inclemency of the region; the bad prospect of killing any thing to subsist on, with the further detention of two or three days, which it must occasion, determined us to return.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first European-American to climb the peak came 14 years after Pike, in the summer of 1820. Edwin James, a young student who had just graduated from Middlebury College in Vermont, signed on as the relief botanist for Stephen Harriman Long's expedition after the first botanist had died. The expedition explored the South Platte River up as far as present-day Denver, then turned south and passed close to what James called \"Pike's highest peak\". James and two other men left the expedition, camped on the plains, and climbed the peak in two days, encountering little difficulty. Along the way, James was the first to describe the blue columbine, Colorado's state flower.\nGold was discovered in the area of present-day Denver in 1858, and newspapers referred to the gold-mining area as \"Pike's Peak\". Pike's Peak or Bust became the slogan of the Colorado Gold Rush (see also Fifty-Niner). This was more due to Pikes Peak's visibility to gold seekers traveling west across the plains than any actual significant gold find anywhere near Pikes Peak. Major gold deposits were not discovered in the Pikes Peak area until the Cripple Creek Mining District was discovered southwest of Pikes Peak and led, in 1893, to one of the last major gold rushes in the lower 48 states.\nIn July 1860, Clark, Gruber and Company commenced minting gold coins in Denver bearing the phrase \"Pike's Peak Gold\" and an artist's rendering of the peak (sight unseen) on the obverse. In 1863, the U.S. Treasury purchased the minting equipment for $25,000 (or $520,000 adjusted for inflation) to open the Denver Mint.\nJulia Archibald Holmes and James Holmes traveled to the Rocky Mountains in Colorado in 1858, and reached the summit on August 5, with J. D. Miller and George Peck, making Archibald Holmes the first European-American woman to climb Pikes Peak. From the summit, she wrote in a letter to her mother: \"Nearly everyone tried to discourage me from attempting it, but I believed that I should succeed; and now here I am, and I feel that I would not have missed this glorious sight for anything at all.\"\n\nThirty-five years later, in July 1893, Katharine Lee Bates wrote the song \"America the Beautiful\", after having admired the view from the top of Pikes Peak. It appeared in print in The Congregationalist, a weekly journal, on July 4, 1895. A plaque commemorating the words to the song was placed at the summit.\nOn July 17, 1913 William Wayne Brown drove his car, the Bear Cat, 20 miles (32 km) to the summit. The ascent took 5 hours and 28 minutes.\nThe uppermost portion of Pikes Peak, above 14,000 feet (4,267 m) elevation, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961.Pikes Peak was the home of a ski resort from 1939 until 1984.\n\n\n== Today ==\n\nThere are several visitor centers on Pikes Peak, some with a gift shop and restaurant. These centers are located at the 6-mile (9.7 km) and 12-mile (19 km) markers of the toll road, plus one at the summit itself. \nAlong with other food, the Summit House sells special high altitude doughnuts, frying up to 700 per hour. The doughnuts collapse or go mushy if transported to lower altitudes.There are several ways to ascend the mountain. The Manitou and Pike's Peak Railway, the world's highest cog railroad, operated from Manitou Springs to the summit, conditions permitting but closed in 2018. While the cog railroad is closed for refurbishing between 2017 and 2021, and a temporary shuttle system has taken part of its place, a number of outfitters have stepped in to provide transportation up the mountain.Road vehicles can be driven to the summit via the Pikes Peak Highway, a 19 mi (31 km) road that starts a few miles up Ute Pass at Cascade. The road has a series of switchbacks, treacherous at high speed, called \"The W's\" for their shape on the northwest side of the mountain. The road is maintained by the city of Colorado Springs as a toll road. A project to pave the remainder of the road was completed on October 1, 2011. The project is in response to a suit by the Sierra Club over damage caused by the gravel and sediment that is constantly washed off the road into the alpine environment. The road remained open during construction.\nThe Highway is famous worldwide for the annual Pikes Peak International Hill Climb, a motor race. The short film Climb Dance features Ari Vatanen racing his Peugeot automobile up the steep, twisty slopes. It also hosts the Pikes Peak Cycling Hill Climb (formerly Assault on the Peak), a cycling hillclimb race first held in 2010, and the USA Cycling Hill Climb National Championships, a race first held in 2016.The most popular hiking route to the top is called Barr Trail, which approaches the summit from the east. The trailhead is just past the cog railway depot in Manitou Springs. Visitors can walk, hike, or bike the trail. Although the Barr Trail is rated only Class 1, it is a long and arduous hike with nearly 8,000 ft (2,400 m) of elevation gain, and a 13 mi (21 km) trip one-way. The Pikes Peak Marathon, a trail race held since 1956, is a round trip between the trailhead and the Pikes Peak. The Barr Trail Mountain Race is a 13 miles (21 km) round trip between the trailhead and Barr Camp. Another route begins at Crags Campground, approaching the summit from the west.Since the end of 1922, the AdAmAn Club has been an unusual group of mountaineers who climb the icy slopes of Barr Trail on the east face of Pikes Peak each year on December 30th, stay overnight at Barr Camp, and continue to the top on December 31. Then, at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve, the thirty or so AdAmAn members and their guests ignite a glorious fireworks display from the summit to usher in the New Year.Since 1969, the summit of Pikes Peak has been the site of the United States Army Pikes Peak Research Laboratory, a medical research laboratory for the assessment of the impact of high altitude on human physiological and medical parameters of military interest.\nOn June 4, 2018 ground-breaking was held for a new 38,000 square feet (3,500 m2) Summit Complex which is being constructed next to the current Summit House. The older facility will remain open to the more than 600,000 visitors annually through the end of construction in the fall of 2020 or summer of 2021. Around 40 contractors are working on the $50 million project. The general contractor, G.E. Johnson Construction Co., estimates that about half of the budget is for materials, many of which are prefabricated in downslope shops, and the balance is for labor, because of the project's high standards and the rigors of working for a maximum of \u200b6 1\u20442 hours per day at such a high altitude during a short season of April to October. Heavy equipment and prefabricated building components are slowly moved up the mountain's highway in the middle of the night to avoid any car traffic. Ground conditions are bedrock and alpine permafrost, soil and rock that remains at or below freezing temperatures all year to depths of up to 200 feet (61 m), only warming above freezing in direct sunlight or due to external sources. Problems with excavation and blasting exist because the permafrost in the fractured granite actually absorbs energy. The project is being constructed to achieve both Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design  (LEED) Platinum Certification and Living Building Challenge. The new complex will include a visitor center, a communications facility for Colorado Springs Utilities, and the Army's High-Altitude Research Laboratory.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nAt the peak, the partial pressure of oxygen is only about 60% of that at sea level. Water boils at 186 \u00b0F (86 \u00b0C) at 14,000 feet, rather than 212 \u00b0F (100 \u00b0C) at sea level.A faster rate of respiration is required by humans and animals not acclimated to high altitudes. Altitude sickness may develop in those who are sensitive or who over-exert themselves.\nThe summit of Pikes Peak has a polar climate due to its elevation. Snow is a possibility any time year-round, and thunderstorms with high winds gusting up to 100 miles per hour (160 km/h) or more are common in the afternoons.Surrounding areas have different climatic variations depending on location and elevation. Much of the area near Pikes Peak has a continental semiarid climate, while other areas would be classified as hemiboreal.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of mountain peaks of North America\nList of mountain peaks of the United States\nList of mountain peaks of Colorado\nList of Colorado county high points\nList of Colorado fourteeners\nList of Ultras of the United States\nPikes Peak International Hill Climb\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGillett, Bernard (2001).

          "I was completely underwhelmed by experience. It's pricey and optional extra tram fee is confusing, disorganized, and leaving a bit to be desired. Restrooms were out of order when we visited so you pay a rather hefty price for what you get - and not even decent restrooms.",
          "Falls are not as large individually as we imagined but combined made for a great pic. 224 steel STEEP steps up and same going down, bring water bottles and be ready for legs to burn lol",
          "Because there is lack of parking at the falls, you have to take a shuttle which takes about 10 minutes. The falls are beautiful and so is the hike to them. There a lot of really neat rock formations along the way. To view the falls, you can walk up sets of stairs or take an",

          "I visited 7 Falls about 20 years ago. There were literally 7 falls side by side and you could see them all from the bottom. There was no need to climb the stairs unless you wanted to. You could hear the sound of the falls from a distance. I visited them again today. It's a joke.",
          "We visited Seven Falls and were not sure what to expect. First of all, if you are using a GPS it will bring you to a parking lot where you will get on a shuttle to the falls. This is a perfect system as I do not think you can drive directly there yourself. Once off the shuttle,",

          "Beautiful falls & views. It\u2019s a tad bit intimidating if you have a fear of heights. You walk up approx. 275 steep stairs, to the top of the falls. Once you reach the falls there are a number of short 1-3 mile hiking options, which we did. You will see lots of zip liners",
          "I used to come to the the falls all the time when I was a kid and loved every minute of it. It seems like now that the Broadmoor Hotel owns the area, little things seem to go \"unchecked\". It is a very long walk from the gate to the falls. You can purchase a ride on the tram",

          "It is a gorgeous place. An elevator is available to go to see all the falls but if you want to go to the top, you need to climb 224 stairs. There\u2019s a nice restaurant on the grounds. A shuttle from a remote parking lot is available, free, which is nice. There\u2019s also a trolley",
          "First of all, you will need to park in an alternate lot about 15 minutes away. The shuttles are many and can accommodate roughly 15 persons. Depending upon your timing, you may wait a bit for a shuttle. We opted not to pay for the tram ride as it was just a short distance,",

We almost didn\u2019t go because I had read so many reviews about long lines for the shuttle, but we went early and didn\u2019t have to wait going or coming back.

          "I hate to give this place a bad review because it really does have great potential and is serene, but the challenges of the trip made it a big fail for us. We first tried to visit the falls around 11:30 which was a big mistake. The place was super crowded and since it\u2019s July",
          "Go early in the morning, first to get a good parking place and catch an early shuttle to avoid some of the crowds that come here. We did and were not disappointed. There are 2 long sections of steps that you can climb 1/2 way or all the way to the top. I only went 1/2 way.",

          "We kind of chose this last minute and we were very glad we did! We stopped by our last day to get more walking in! And we loved it! It's beautiful! I am TERRIFIED of heights and challenged myself to go up the stairs and was very glad I did! It definitely wore me out but the view",
          "If you are at all able, I highly recommend walking down to the falls and taking the side hikes. The scenery is BEAUTIFUL!! I think this makes up a large portion of what makes this place so beautiful. There are many photo opportunities along the way. The falls themselves are so",

          "Viewing from below is nice....but get on the trail and hike. There are a few benches where you can sit down and rest and enjoy the CO beauty. Once you get to the top...go just a bit farther (through the woods) straight up and you will come to Silver Slab rock climbing",
          "This is a lovely spot with a little hiking, some water, and a lot of stairs. My husband and I went in the late afternoon (if you go at night, they light up the falls with colored lights, and I'd like to see that someday). You have to park about 10 minutes away and take a (free)",
          "I recommend calling to get the address to the shuttle parking lot. The shuttle service was very good. We only had to wait a few minutes. The hike is up 224 stairs. The stairs are very sturdy with handrails. There are several hiking trails at the top. We returned to the bottom",
          "The parking is a significant distance from the entrance, and they bus you in. We wish we had known this before driving to the gps provided location. The falls are pretty, but kind of unremarkable if you\u2019ve seen others. There is an elevator that can be taken for a lower elevation",
          "Walking up 224 steps was worth the effort. A very pretty waterfall place. The information signs were helpful to identify the different types of falls you are looking at. Worth hiking past the falls to Overlook Point past Helen Jackson Hunt Memorial. Views are beautiful.",
          "The Broadmoor Hotel has taken over this attraction. They have done a good job in the upkeep, but have also kept this hike expensive. There is alot more you can do here than just hike now (a restaurant, zip line, and gift shop). Be prepared for an awesome climb on one of the",
          "We went to Seven Falls during the week so it wasn't so crowded. Enjoyed the shuttle trip from the parking area to the gate of the falls. After paying the entry fee, we were offered to ride the tram free, since we are seniors, but decided to walk and are glad we did. So many",
          "One of the most beautifull attractions in Colorado. The site was destroyed several years ago by fire, but the people at the Broadmoor purchased and fixed everything up so well.",
          "the 7 falls won't ever be confused with Niagra or Iguasu Falls but sometimes it's just about the journey. To get to the Falls the best path is to take the shuttle from the nearby community center and then either walk up 3/4 mile to the Falls or take another shuttle to the base.",
          "This is the most beautiful place I\u2019ve been to in Colorado Springs. I went up towards the Broadmore to park then took a shuttle to the entrance. As I payed to enter you have an option to take a ride to the cabin instead of taking the stroll. I chose the stroll, it\u2019s a beautiful",
          "Was pleasantly suprised to receive the senior discount which comes with free shuttle service to the falls. Parking is off site and somewhat hard to find.",
          "The place is really nice, but you do need to be ready to hike straight up 275 steps. Worth the view if you can make it. Read their website as you have to park offsite and take a shuttle. They have a great restaurant for lunch but a bit pricey.",
          "See website...as you must take free shuttle to falls. There is no parking at the falls. The grounds are well maintained and the falls are very impressive. You can walk all the way up along side of the falls....which isn't too difficult. Or you can take elevator up to top",
          "You have to park the car at the designated area where a shuttle will pick you and take you to the Falls. You have to pay $16.50 at the Gate where the Shuttle will drop and pick you up, that\u2019s including a ride with a car from the gate to the Falls or you can walk 10-15 mins to",
          "We did'nt have time to do the entire hike but were able to visit the falls and walk up to the observation deck. Lunch at 1858 was delicious. I would recommend this as a \"Must See\" if you're visiting the area.",
          "We visited here recently for the 1st time since the Broadmoor bought Seven Falls. They have really spruced the place up and made the entryway beautiful with flowers and landscaping. It does seem more tourist-y and commercialized than some of the other hikes in the area (plus",
          "Lots of stairs but worth it. In early March, the falls were still frozen but the temps were perfect. We didn't do the short hike at the top because us flatlanders were not ready for all the stairs. We got to the top and explored a little and rested.",
          "After a wonderful time Ziplining we hiked through the park and visited many of the falls. Tried to go to restaurant but closed for an event. No biggy as we were ready to rest back at hotel.",

          "The falls themselves are really just one fall that has seven levels. It is a nice trip but nothing fantastic. The restaurant at the falls seemed nice and had a great view. The Broadmoor will shuttle you up for free.",
          "I\u2019ve been to Colorado Springs many times but had not been to the falls- definitely worth seeing! I wish we would have had more time to be there and actually hike up the stairs or do the zip line with soaring adventures! Looked incredible! But even if you only have a little bit",

          "There is a free shuttle to take you to the Falls. Once there you can walk to the Falls and can see great mountains, zipliners and small fish in the stream. Take the elevator to the first observation platform and enjoy the views. Take the stairs down and you are ready to walk",
          "Beautiful falls at this spot! You park,at the base and shuttle to the road that you can walk up to the actual falls. Plenty of rest areas and all paved! You can even feed the rainbow trout at the top!",
          "Seven Falls is a must see when you're in the Colorado Springs area. My advice to plan your trip ahead of time and be prepared to wait in long shuttle lines. The hike and the views were well worth it!",
          "There is a free shuttle from the Broadmoor so this is a must-do if staying there. If you don't take the tram, it is a lot of walking - mostly uphill on the way there. However, it is a beautiful walk along the creek and in between mountains. There is a really nice restaurant",
          "Nicely landscaped, make sure to allow at least two hours to get full enjoyment. Tricky to find loading location. Make sure to use the elevator, so when you get to the taller set of steps you still have energy, do consider zip lining here!",
          "The site is beautiful and breathtaking but be prepared to walk around and climb a lot of steps. It was a little hard to find the location of the shuttle bus to the site (no parking at the venue) but I think it had been temporarily relocated when we visited. If you have",
          "At first we thought there were seven individual waterfalls, but turns out it's one water source that just flows down at various points and angles. Still very neat to see. The hiking trails were fun and easy to do.",
          "Killer stair workout that is great for older kids but not so much for toddlers . Bummed that we took disabled adults that couldn\u2019t trek too far. The tram is a must with toddlers. Not sure why I thought it would be 7 differently placed waterfalls and not just one. We could have",
          "I really enjoyed Seven Falls. It wouldn't be my first suggestion to someone looking for things to do in The Springs, but if you've done Pike's Peak and Garden of the Gods, it's an entertaining excursion. Getting there. It's easy enough. Take the shuttle and get dropped off",
          "The views were great. I thought there were 7 actual separate falls but there is only one. The walk up was not bad at all and there are benches to sit on along the way. My senior mother was able to make the walk however you can pay extra and there is a train/cart that brings yu",

          "Beautiful scenery, incredibly bad logistics, The Broadmoor touch on wilderness? First, the shuttle to get to the falls is about 3-4 miles away in a rodeo arena parking lot. No cover and just a crappy lot. Once you get there its beautiful. There is a new high end, 5-star type",
          "The shuttle can drive you or you can walk to throughout the entire park--truely wonderful! Breathtaking views of the rock formations and waterfalls. Stairs can be slippery when wet so use caution. Loved every bit og the experience. Food at the 1898 resturante was outstanding-",
          "Seven Falls was a great experience for my children and my nephews! Also my sister! We all had so much fun. The kids did so well climbing up the stairs especially for a few being toddlers",
          "Did the stair climb at night, I enjoyed it, but the elevation was something to always be conscious of. I may be also out of shape? This is a must do! There is a cost to do this hike, but I felt it was worth it. There are plenty of hiking in the area for free, but these views",
          "After getting lost a few times in a bus finalie getting there it was worth the wait . Getting the shuttle to the base of the falls is easy . Then it gets a bit harder to climb the 184 steps to one side for a breath taking view . There is another section with 265 steps to do if",

          "Interested in a short adventure through the canyons between the mountains? This is not just any walk. It's well-paved with beautiful, peaceful scenery and leads you right to the Seven Falls. A shuttle is also available if you don't feel like walking. There is an observation",

          "The Seven Falls is a really worthwhile visit if you like to walk or hike. You must park at 1045 Lower Gold Camp Road (where the rodeo is) and a free shuttle bus takes you the ten minute drive to Seven Falls. There is no parking at Seven Falls. After exiting the shuttle bus",
          "We went to Seven Falls a number of weeks ago and ate dinner at 1858. The meal was alright, not great and the staff told us that there wasn't availability later in the evening. Unfortunately, as we were climbing the stairs to the falls the heavens opened up and we retreated to",
          "It's simply a must see. I saw it first time 42 yrs ago. It's still just as stunning. Go in the morning to give yourself plenty of time as there's so much to see.",

          "Loved the Falls. There is an elevator for those who can't do the steps but I would recommend you take it anyway for the experience. You walk under a tunnel under the mountains that takes you to the top of a viewing area. Ate at the restaurant, very nice. Only thing didn't",
          "This was my grandson's first real outdoor adventure. A shuttle took us to the entrance. From there, we took our time as we hiked along a creek (although the paved road is wide). By the time we reached the 1858 Restaurant, we were hungry, (perfectly situated). After we",
          "Our GPS took us to 7 Falls, but you could not enter! Now, you have to drive about 10 minutes to a parking lot in town. A free shuttle takes you to the Falls. My husband was a veteran, so we paid the $12.50 for 1 veteran & 1 senior. The senior received an included tram ride",

          "Let's begin by saying that we almost gave up on this place. This is an expensive resort that bought the 7 Falls attraction. From their website, we followed the GPS to their parking lot, where a bus would take you to the falls. The problen is that this GPS coordinate is off by 6",
          "This was our first time visiting Seven Falls. We parked and rode a shuttle bus to the destination. It was a beautiful hike up to the falls on a paved trail. We enjoyed walking along a stream through the mountains to get there. Captured some beautiful photos. We made the",
          "We really had no idea what this place would be like. A friend suggested we may enjoy and early evening visit. We started at the gate of the Broadmoor Hotel where the attendant indicated we needed to go to catch a shuttle from the Norris Penrose Event Center on 1045 Lower Gold",
          "The hike to the falls is a little more tiring than you\u2019d expect. There are 200+ steps, which doesn\u2019t seem like a lot. However, the steep incline will tire you out. The one waterfall has an elevator option to get to the top. Bring plenty of water, but make sure you include this",
          "You must take the shuttle! Unless you are staying as a guest of the Broadmoor, you must park at 1045 Lower Gold Camp Rd and take the shuttle. We saw numerous people drive up to the start of the trial, hoping to park there, but were turned away. The shuttle from 1045 Lower Gold",
          "While the parking lot and bus seem a little wierd to start off, you quickly see the rationale to make it easy to get in, and not be over crowded as the buses force people to be spaced out. The facility is in immaculate condition. Landscaping, paved road, steps, etc all top",

          "This was one of our favorite experiences in Colorado. It is well worth the price of the transportation to get to the falls. The hike starts off with a huge amount of stairs on an incline. After you reach the top, you will explore though beautiful forest and find falls all along",

          "The Seven Falls are now owned and operated by The Broadmoor. There is a rather hefty entrance fee that I\u2019m sure goes to keeping the shuttles running and the grounds manicured so I\u2019m actually pretty okay with it (yay, keeping natural places clean). Speaking of manicured, that\u2019s",
          "Cool waterfall! I think it was past peak. Water wasn\u2019t really flowing, and it had just rained which makes climbing the wet stairs more difficult! Hiking at the top wasn\u2019t to difficult. All in all good entertainment.",
          "With limited time on our last day in the springs, we had to choose between Seven falls and another attraction. Not only did we have to drive off-site to park, then wait in line for 25 minutes to take the shuttle, paid $14.50/ea, but on our shuttle ride, we saw LOCAL RESIDENTS",
          "We wanted to go there, but there is no free way instead you need to park your car in the city Center and then take a bus. Also you need to pay for it.",
          "So many stairs but so worth it. There are 3 break platforms on the way up. Only reason it\u2019s gets 4 stars is because the first porta potties where GROSS, but besides that LOVED it.",

However we knew some of thus in advance so we\u2019re prepared and ready to climb loads of steps and go for a long walk uphill to a stunning view. For us it was a great day out. Well",
          "Okay, this is how it works...you wait at a parking lot (we waited 15-20 minutes) for a shuttle that takes you near the falls (10-15 minute ride). You then have to pay about $15 for adults and $10 for children. You then walk almost a mile where you then climb almost 250 stairs.",
          "We followed signs to \"Seven Falls.\" Arrived at open field parking lot where we waited in line for 20 minutes for a shuttle van- in the sun, no seating or bathrooms. Rode 15 minutes in shuttle van through town again to another place, got off, walked a little ways to ticket",
          "We visited on a warm afternoon in July. You MUST park several miles away and take the shuttle to the falls. There was about a 30 minute wait for the shuttle. Once there, you can pay $2 extra (seniors free) to take the tram to the actual falls or you can walk the 0.8 miles. We",

          "I was disappointed by the whole experience and maybe that\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t what I was expecting.

          "Ok, Out of all the sites we'd seen on our trip, this was the most underwhelming. That list included, Garden of the Gods, Pikes Peak, North Cheyenne Canon, Red Rock Canyon. Admission was 14.50 pp and we were able to walk to the falls within 30 minutes. I was expecting a little",

          "You CANNOT get into seven falls independently.\nI assume there are free passes if you stay at the broadmoor. shuttling in is required, though navigation takes you to the entrance, you will be redirected to park at the event center 10mins \u2026",
          "Went here a few years ago and one of my favorite places. If you are a lover of hikes and mini challenges at nature parks this is a good place for that. Or if you just want a place to people watch and relax. Beautiful and clean with gift \u2026",
          "A must see for every family member.  Be prepared for long walks, lots of stairs, and bring plenty of water. Three dollars for a can of soda?  The views, however, are worth every minute you can spend here.  They also offer zip lining. Skip \u2026",
          "This place is beautiful during Fall and Spring times. Not many people so you can enjoy it at your own pace",
          "The five star rating for this place comes from the fact that this place is as well kept as Disneyland. The workers here are far from lackluster and one particular employee, Andrew, is one of the nicest janitor or maintenance staff that this \u2026",
          "It\u2019s only one waterfalls!!! That has seven point...\nNot sure why they call it SEVEN FALLS ...\nCheck photos before u go for hour trip.. not sure if it\u2019s even natural \nNot recommended !!\nDoesn\u2019t have Parking in place, the closer one it\u2019s about 20 min walk ! Also doesn\u2019t have directions signed to the park!\nalso the manager was treble!",
          "I would have expected easily accessible running water and quality restrooms, especially given what it costs. This would probably be better managed publicly.",
          "It's a good place to see. We saw it in November so it was frozen but still were surprised how beautiful the falls were",
          "Do a little research about how to get in through the shuttle system. There is no space up in the canyon to park the number of visitors that want to see the falls. \n\nMy family enjoys everything about this place. From the massive staircase \u2026",
          "A gorgeous setting. I wish it wasn't so expensive to see, but I would have paid it again. Definitely hike up to inspiration point! The views are spectacular from up there.  You won't be sorry.",
          "Beautiful and well maintained trails with spectacular views. Climbing the 224 steps to the top was itself an adventure. The kids loved that they could pan for gold in the river, a fun and memorable experience! We will definitely be back to continue exploring all that the park has to offer!",
          "LOVED this spot!  First and foremost: make a day out of this trip.  We actually were unaware of how much there was to do on-site.  There are zip-line tours, hiking trails, panning for gold, a restaurant, a food truck, gift shops, and of \u2026",
          "The parking lot is about 12 to 15 minutes away from the entrance to the park. You board the shuttle and they drive you up to the ticket office. Tickets were about 15 dollars to get in. Then you walk up a paved road to make it to the falls. \u2026",
          "This place is just stunning. When you arrive in the parking lot, you\u2019ll get on a free shuttle to the park. From there you pay the entrance fee and you can decide whether to walk or to take a small ride up the trail for $2 both ways. I recommend the walk because you get to see all the beautiful rocks and scenery",
          "Definitely worth it. The parking situation is a little odd, but the shuttles come often. The walk in was gorgeous and the falls were cool too. Would highly recommend if you have a half day or so.",
          "Prayer time. Loved it. Took it all in before heading back to Dallas. Thanks God!",
          "Couldn\u2019t find a place to fill up my water bottle, I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth $15. You can find much more beautiful places elsewhere in Colorado for free. Probably good for families with younger kids or older people looking for an afternoon out. Shuttle takes about 20 mins both ways",
          "Ruined by the Hotel who purchased it. Shuttle service took too long to leave. A visitor used to be able to enter. Now you have to park 7 miles away. Disappointment from previous years visits.",
          "The most amazing place you can visit in Colorado springs...a must see you will be blown away by the scenery \u2764\u2764",
          "The property is gorgeous. Many scenic views. The trails are a good introductory hike for beginners. I would give it 5 stars but the wait for the shuttles is toooooo long. It\u2019s hard to stay on a schedule when you don\u2019t have the ability to leave when you choose.",
          "The seven falls is excellent for taking beautiful pictures and learning about different types of waterfalls. Bring your hiking legs! \nYou will park at the rodeo, catch a shuttle to the falls, walk up a short off road path, buy your tickets \u2026",
          "Google maps did take us to the shuttle area so that was helpful and they did have the cost clearly posted BUT at $15/person we felt pretty disappointed in what that got us. Although beautiful, the falls and area have been greatly altered to \u2026",
          "Great great great views!!! But those steps were ridiculous.  The elevator was out of order to the highest point. the shorter step route wasn't too bad.  The restaurant at the base of the falls was fantastic. Excellent service and awesome food.  Wear comfortable clothing and shoes.",
          "We will never go back. I remember taking our kids and how fun it was.  NOw, taking our grown children and grandchildren, it was not so fun. First we waited over an hour for the shuttles. Then they drop you off for a walk to get tickets. \u2026",
          "The park was EXTREMELY well maintained. We saw a staff member stop her cart to pick up a dime sized piece of trash. Staff was also very friendly and informative. Trails were in excellent condition and very beautiful. The only thing I would ask for is water fountains on site.",
          "Beautiful hike. Loved it up here. You have to park and then you are shuttled up. It is a paved trail, so we were able to take a stroller and hike with our 5 and 2 year old.",
          "Getting it out of the way, the falls are beautiful and I am glad to have gone. I just wish spaces like this were public spaces, not private efforts designed to extract every dollar from your wallet. Every bit of this area is just stunning, \u2026",
          "Great for the family, beautiful views- natural beauty, waterfalls, and mountainous terrain. Love the steps!!! Trying to get to the top was an exhilarating challenge. Great picture opportunities all around...make sure you visit the gift shop- cool gifts inside, reasonable priced.",
          "I had a fabulous time visiting. Plus having a shuttle take us there was was great.",
          "Loved the colors of the falls, and restaurant. All staff in all capacities were superb.",
          "It feels a little expensive for what it has to offer. Also, it appears 1 water fall ours converted into 7. They are really small water falls.",
          "Amazing! Be prepared to walk or you can also take the trolly ($2 per person). Great scenery! We walked up. There is a little stream where the kids were able to do some pan handling on our trip up. Once you get to the falls walk up the \u2026",
          "Nice view but be prepared for a lot of stairs and wanling",
          "One of the most beautiful places to visit whether you are a resident or just visiting the states.  A must see for sure!!",
          "A great place for walks with family and dogs to admire God\u2019s creation. \nSpend at least half a day with comfortable walking shoes, shade, cap/hat. Pack some snacks & water for young children \nTake the free shuttle after parking your car. \nDo \u2026",
          "Shuttle takes you to park in 10min. Long walk from drop off to main area. I was here several years ago when they let you park in the park but this was definitely better for experience and better for nature wo all the exhaust and dodging \u2026",
          "Really enjoyed this hike. \nYou have to park away from the park and be shuttled over, but it's free and quick. We went the first week of August and didn't wait more  than 5 minutes for a shuttle. \nThe park facilities are clean. They have plenty of restrooms.",
          "I only did one staircase it was a dozy absolutely beautiful. Great family day",
          "Area is not big but scenery is great, admission is a bit on the expensive side though the park is well maintained.",
          "We went to Seven Falls for the Christmas lights.  One section had the red, green, blue lights on the fall, but stairs were not lite which was hard to see where to step.  Needs more lights as pictured.",
          "The Falls are beautiful, but there's no traditional Indian dancers, and we've been visiting Colorado for over forty years! It's become commercialized. We waited to board a bus for twenty five minutes in a dusty parking lot with horse \u2026",
          "We visited the falls with the anticipation of seeing natural falls. The experience includes taking a shuttle to the park itself. Once arrived, you have the option to hike up to the falls or pay for another shuttle to take you up. Ticket \u2026",
          "Great views and easy walk. Stairs were not too bad.",
          "The price was high and u have to take a pretty long shuttle ride there. Our shuttle didn't have air conditioning but I can't vouch for all of the shuttles. The falls have a lot of stairs to climb and it could be scary for ppl who are afraid of heights. That said, it was a pretty area but it might not be worth the price for some.",
          "PARKING is not at the falls! Park at 1045 Lower Gold Camp Road near events centre. Then take free shuttle. \nLots to see at your own pace. Take good shoes and snacks for kids.",
          "Fun thing to do once, there's really not much to it.",
          "Excellent place to calm down.. worth visiting.. friendly staffs..will prefer to visit more & definitely suggest others to visit. It might be difficult to climb the steps for elderly but they can take a lift to view the seven falls..",
          "A long hike for a short thrill. Very pretty scenery, wonderful views of the mountains, and the falls are nice, but it was a long process just to experience the falls. There are trails that we could have done, but we were too tired from the trek to where the falls are located, and then we climbed the 224 steps to the top of the falls.",
          "Nice attraction near Colorado Springs. For the sake of other people who will go there : you need to park your car and then go to the falls by a shuttle bus. Once on site you can purchase your 15.5$ ticket. I must admit it's a bit expensive for just a small waterfall but the surrounding at the top was great.",
          "Make sure to get here early so you can beat the crowd! You will not be disappointed, if your planning on going up the stairs and to the trails make sure to pack plenty of water. There is alot of stairs at the very end but if you're wanting \u2026",
          "Beautiful tour!  The views are breathtaking!  The stairs were a challenge, but totally worth it.  The trail is very clean and maintained.\n\nHowever, NOT IMPRESSED with the shuttle system.  We stood (after walking the .8 mile trail, climbing \u2026",
          "Beautiful views breathe taking is all I can say ...but lower the price it\u2019s not worth what they charge, plus the 3 buses they have to pick up people which is ridiculous there\u2019s so many people going up to that place",
          "A little bit pricey, but probably worth it.  Beautiful views along hiking trails.",
          "Seven Falls is pretty awesome.  The falls itself is probably so so, not as grand as some of the waterfalls in Oregon or Washington that i am used too.  It also is July so water wasn't flowing as heavily as the spring.  But was very cool. \u2026",
          "Beautiful place. Definitely wear comfortable clothes and shoes. I would bring a backpack with snacks. Food of course pricey.  Definitely worth the hike up all the steps to the top. The view is amazing.",
          "Loved this place.  I was brace to climb up and found courage to go back down the stairs.  Didn't find courage to do the zip line...  See you soon",
          "Absolutely beautiful! Obviously there is a bit of walking to do here. The main walk to the top is a road, there are a few little offshoot trails to get you closer to the stream in some areas. Unfortunately, the restrooms as if right now are \u2026",
          "Grew up around the area. Become more of a show than a good time. But...the show is BEAUTIFUL",
          "It was horrible from the start. First, parking is at an off-site and you wait for a shuttle in the sun on a hot day with no shade. Each shuttle only carries 8-10 people at a time so plan to wait for at least a 30-50 minutes in the heat on a \u2026",
          "Great area for a family activity. It is pretty crowded though. I'd recommend going when they have the falls lit up!",
          "A perfect example of corporate interest commercializing natural wonders. I've lived all over the west and have visited many state and national parks, none of which charge $14 per person to enter a highly secured and managed zone. It feels more like Disneyland than a trek through nature.",
          "This place is amazing just wish it was more open and you didn't have to pay like Helen hunt falls",
          "We were a little nervous once we got to the higher lines but Derek, Pat and Scott made sure we felt safe and secure at every point during the tour!  I would definitely do this again. Please remember to tip your tour guides.  They put in the time to double check and make sure you feel safe and comfortable.",
          "What a waste of time and money! Especially if you smoke do not bother going here! They don\u2019t want you here! You can\u2019t smoke in the park. Fine, whatever make whatever rules you want. However before we entered the park an employee got out of \u2026",
          "A gorgeous, well-maintained place to visit. If there was an easier route to the top of the falls, I'd have rated it five stars. As it is, people with a fear of heights and/or health concerns can only enjoy the falls from where they end.",
          "Beautiful surroundings, challenging stair climbs, and nice water falls. There is a $2 charge to skip the uphill walk to the first falls but I recommend the walk if you can. You can skip the first set of stairs with an elevator but you must \u2026",
          "Great scenery, very expensive. Also, they like to actually charge your credit card 3 months AFTER you visit this place.",
          "The falls were not as exciting as I thought but still pretty. The surrounding scenery is gorgeous. I didn't think they had enough shuttle buses running at night, we had to wait a long time (in the rain) to go back to the parking lot. The \u2026",
          "Very scary and fun experience. Our two guides were fantastic. They both explained everything thoroughly. They were light hearted enough to make it fun and professional enough to know you were locked in and taken care of.  We did the highest \u2026",
          "Pee before you go!!!!! There are no restrooms at the parking lot. A 15 minute ride to the bottom of the falls, again no restrooms at drop off. Walk to the ticket booth, again no restrooms. Another 10 minute walk UP HILL and finally a porta \u2026",
          "It is not free! \nIt is a beautiful place but dont trust google map! Google sends you to a parking spot 15 mile away from falls! Then you have to pay to get there.",
          "Beautiful location with some great amenities around it.  You can hike, dine, and explore.  Great for both active and less than active people.",
          "This place is Amazing grew up going here with my Brother and grandma.. been wanting to take my husband but hes always busy or we dont have the same days off \ud83e\udd28",
          "More like mud falls. The process was incredibly long. Be prepared to waste some time waiting for the shuttle. And you still have to hike to get to the main attraction that you know full well is the only reason why people come to this park. \u2026",
          "The most beautiful place I went on my trip to Colorado. Ahhh I just loved it!",
          "Beautiful place, nice walk while looking at the Christmas lights, the water falls are amazing",
          "Really a neat place to visit. If you can walk about a mile or so, don't take the trolley up to the falls. The walk is beautiful and the creek is worth some pictures. The falls are really cool and at the top of the falls, which is a few \u2026",
          "Fantastic views! Make sure to park at the shuttle pickup parking lot. Really good shuttle service to get to the falls, and an elevator to the viewing/observation platform. Have to walk up 200+ stairs to get to the top of the falls, but it's \u2026",
          "Awesome views. Be prepared to walk. Stairs, take the stairs. It is so worth it. It\u2019s a little nerve racking but once you get up there, the view is all worth it. Going up is the hardest part. Coming back down was easy (obviously). We got \u2026",
          "Beautiful place! Has rides to falls for people that need it, or you can hike the paved path. There are stairs on both sides of the falls, with an elevator on 1 set.",
          "Very spectacular. A great but it gets ya tired. Great excercise",
          "Absolutely stunning! There is a trolley to take up to the falls or you can take a short hike up, I say about 1 mile, maybe. For myself, I saved my energy to climb the 200 stairs to the top of the falls, well worth the climb. Once up top, \u2026",
          "I liked it better when you didn't have to sit in a bus full of people to go hiking",
          "Great place but with current system of shuttle service it is not worth the time. Unless they change the shuttle service system and manage the drop off pick up promptly this site is not worth it. I could not find the address even for drop off. Here is it for others looking 2298 N Cheyenne Canyon Rd. Will not be visiting here again.",
          "Dont let fear stop you from the great views",
          "A must see place. Loved it so much! Looking forward to going back and experiencing so much beauty all over again.",
          "Pretty but not $15.50 a person pretty. If you want to spend $15 a person just go to pike's peak it's actually worth the money, even if it is under construction.",
          "Beautiful place, great hiking, easily enough for half a day or more, depending on your pace. The trickiest part will be ascending and descending the steep, narrow, metal stairs to the topmost trails, but if you manage to complete that \u2026",
          "Only one tram was running up to the falls.   Waited 40 minutes.  When we left park the lines for the parking shuttle were backed up.  Another 45 minute wait to get shuttle.  Park needs to resolve these slowdowns as it runs what would be a great experience.",
          "I have been coming to Seven Falls since I was a young child. I am extremely disappointed with the changes I saw during this visit. There was trash floating in the stream and along the trail, but that's merely cosmetic. I am utterly ashamed \u2026",
          "Excellent hike all around. Bring enough water because you're not going to want to leave once you reach the top. Definitely going to try the zip line next time I go.",
          "So we got through the walk and we walked back and we have been waiting about over an hour for the shuttle. The water fall isn't that special but i guess its a good walk? I liked the little stream. Over all one star...",
          "Worth a one-time visit. There are 2 viewpoints: the one with more steps has a nice trail, which is filled with beautiful mountain Maple trees. The one with lesser steps has the complete view of the falls and it's entrance is through a mine, \u2026",
          "Great place to visit. Hikes are not that long, but beware, the stairs to get to the trail heads are quite strenuous. But once to the top the views are stunning, especially Inspiration Point.",
          "Thank goodness I visited this place as a kid. Getting to the falls is a little more difficult than back then. The area and the park is beautiful and an interesting experience.",
          "Amazing visit! Although you have to park a few miles away and wait for a shuttle bus, it is well worth it. The shuttle bus is free but you do pay to get into the park. You can also pay a few extra bucks to take a shuttle bus to the restaurant and falls. Well worth it for the elderly, handicapped or during bad weather.",
          "Enjoyed our time until we went back to the car to find a window broken out and items stolen from our car.   Another vehicle was also broken into.   Broadmoor was not concerned because the parking spot was not on their property.   Be cautious of where you park.",
          "Fun spot to check out if you are looking for some cool views and a quick hike. A few trails at the top add a little more to an already cool spot.",
          "Really neat place. The restuarant was great and it was a pretty view and healthy hike.",
          "They should update the website saying CLOSED",
          "Very secluded, peaceful on inspiration point. Nice little workout with the stairs. \n\nShuttle service needs to be worked out. Been waiting 40 minutes to catch one.",
          "Beautiful breathtaking views!  This place was so amazing. If your group can't handle the stairs and the hike, you may want to skip, though. 15pp entry (military and child discounts are available) with parking included. Some choose to only \u2026",
          "I loved this place as a kid and returned to recreate the experience for my kids. Kinda missed the mark, though. You have to take a (long) shuttle ride from the parking lot to the canyon. Then, it is a bit of a walk from the entrance to the \u2026",
          "Spent a total of four hours waiting for the shuttle (combined both ways). There was a line about 100 yards long to get back to the parking lot, only two shuttles running, taking 14 people each trip. Round trip time was 15 minutes, we timed \u2026",
          "This place is just a few minutes away from Colorado springs. Very easy to reach and they have ample parking lot. There are shuttles available which take you to the falls and then it's a small hike of 15mins to get to the falls. I highly \u2026",
          "I would definitely recommend this place. If you have trouble walking/climbing, they have a tram and elevator that can be used. The elevator takes you to an observation deck of the falls. The falls can also be seen using a stairs. I would highly recommend that. There are about 300 steps to the top.\n\nOverall it's was a good experience.",
          "Waterfalls were beautiful. Be prepared for stairs. Shuttle trip to park is necessary, could have mentioned this up front",
          "This place has amazing views and worth stopping by for a visit.  Just know that visitor parking is at the Penrose Equestrian Center.  Visitors are NOT allowed to park at Seven Falls.  Use the address: 1045 Lower Gold Camp Rd, Colorado Springs, CO 80905 for visitor parking.",
          "Money pit!! A more suitable name would be \"The Mudmoor Seven Falls\"\n\nThey do not tell you the water is brown. They will not give you a refund; I tried.\n\nI paid to see this!!! I feel duped.",
          "Fantastif and majestic. I highly recommend the trails at the top of the Falls after the stairs. There's food and water and some some very pretty scenery.",
          "he falls are beautiful and so is the hike to them. There a lot of really neat rock formations along the way.",
          "Very beautiful.  Loved taking the .8 mile walk up to the restaurant.",
          "The 7 falls is really just one long fall with a couple stops. The place is landscaped and commercialized which makes it nice if your are on vacation or want an easy hike or your are special needs as it's very assessable. It's ok but not a real outdoorsy Colorado experience.",
          "We picked up the free tram from the offsite parking lot that drops off at the entrance gate.   It was $15/adult.  From there, we walked about a mile back into the canyon. We climbed the 200 stairs to the Lookout point (elevator available). \u2026",
          "What a bizzar way to make Money! Don't let the number of reviews fool you. I would avoid at any cost and visit rainbow fall if you wana see a fall near by. They charge you $15.50 per person to get in and see a fall that is not even that \u2026",
          "Great atmosphere great food great service",
          "Absolutely beautiful! Lots of walking and stair climbing but well worth it!",
          "Absolutely breath taking! Do the stairs if at all possible. Even if you need to take your time and do them in sections, totally worth it. Stopped at the 1858 restaurant afterwards and had an amazing meal and service there as well!",
          "I will never forget the burrito bowl from the restaurant place here and the cinnamon roasted pecans. Cashews were alright. Almonds did not beat the two.",
          "Before you go, know that you have to park somewhere totally different than where your GPS will take you, so look up on their site where to park. There is a shuttle that will take you to the \"base camp\" from there you pay and then you walk \u2026",
          "Had a fantastic time",
          "Beautiful canyon and waterfalls.  Zip lines for climbers and high country hikers.  Most gorgeous place I think I've ever visited.",
          "This is one of the most beautiful water falls I have seen. The trails are fun to hike and the staff are very friendly. If you can take a side trip to this beautiful place, I would definitely recommend it! It's not too far off the main roads and worth it for sure.",
          "Really good place, looks to hike and see. The restaurant is amazing. The steps are worth it, for a view you can try the elevator. The falls light up in the evening. The shuttle services from a few miles away so check it before you plan to visit. You will be amazed.",
          "Definitely a magic place, where you can take fantastic pictures and have a nice touch with nature!",
          "Let's just say for the Xmas lights I've had Better",
          "The views are gorgeous. The hike up and down was nice too. Just be prepared for a simi long walk up. They don't have drinking fountains or bathrooms. Half way up the trail is a port a potty.",
          "There are lots of steep stairs to the top of the falls so if you aren't afraid of heights, it is so worth it! Also there is extra hiking above the falls. So so beautiful!",
          "You have to take a shuttle from the parking area to the entrance of the park. (Would not be possible to park at the entrance if you tried. No room for cars)  you pay for you pass. Then you have a mile or less walk up a paved road or you can \u2026",
          "Very nice place to make some memories with the family. Cute little photograph opportunities, so definitely bring the camera. There is a restaurant to eat at but we did not visit it. The stairs that you climb to go up the side of the \u2026",
          "The owner has not taken responsibility for picking up the hundreds of wrist bands thrown out the windows of the bus after exiting the Falls. Be careful walking along the road as the buses run fast and frequent.",
          "Beutiful spectacle until you reach the top and realize they are pumping water to form the waterfall.",
          "Great place to hike/walk any time of year! Very family and dog friendly which I love! The scenery is absolutely beautiful! I always try to bring friends up here if they are here to visit or have never been here! A must go!\nThere is even a shuttle that takes you up there for free!",
          "Absolutely stunning views. Great workout! Not recommended for those who have trouble with stairs or climbing.",
          "Lovely spot but not the charming park we visited years ago.  The experience was ruined by a lengthy wait for the shuttle bus to take us back to the mandatory off site parking.  We missed a family dinner because we were trapped with no way to leave.",
          "Awesome falls! Great staff and worth a detour. I intend to go back my next time in town.",
          "Actually more like a 4.5 rating. Beautiful place. Price was ok. Nice hiking available. Restaurant. Etc. \nShuttle service coulda been a bit more efficient and the driver blared his rap/hip-hop music.",
          "Beautiful views on the way there.  Long wait for shuttle from pick-up in distant parking lot.   Liked that they had an elevator to one of the views.",
          "There's a lot more to do here than just walk up and see the falls. There's an elevator to take you to the top and get a bird's eye view. And there's trails that you can spend a couple of hours on to see Midnight Falls and Inspiration Point. \u2026",
          "Spectacular care is given to every aspect of your stay. The rooms are large and well appointed. The bath is large and comfortable to soak in. The views are amazing. On site dining is wonderful. I enjoyed the hike up the falls and strongly recommend that people visit this property. While you're there, also visit the bee!",
          "Very nice place. For those who can not climb stairs, there an elevator opposit to the restaurant.  Good option.",
          "Nice places to visit but you need to walk a lot",
          "Nice place. Very well maintained. I\u2019d recommend to come in the morning otherwise there\u2019ll be a line for shuttle and tickets. I arrived to the parking aaprx at 10:30 am and it took me 29 min to wait for a shirt bus.",
          "Beautiful place. Awesome sceneries. Very good restaurant at the foot. Lovely experience.",
          "Amazing! Gorgeous views and fun hike. Our whole family, including a 7 and 9 year old enjoyed hiking up the stairs and both the strenuous and lighter hikes. It took about half a day and we enjoyed every minute of it, especially for the $10 \u2026",
          "It was jus fabulous place,wide go back again.",
          "Was a little underwhelming. I love waterfalls. Was expecting a big fall after the 20min walk after getting to the top the seven falls. \nWas still a nice experience but would only do once . It was a lot of steps . \n\nI would recommend the \u2026",
          "I come from louisiana to see it it was worth it had a wonderful time with my wife",
          "Have to park and get a shuttle to falls.area. Great paved road for walking the first part to base of falls. You cam tale stairs to the overviews of the falls. There is alot so bring your walking shoes.",
          "Omg! So beautiful. The walk to the top is very peaceful. Also its paved so its wheelchair accessible which is so great. The mountains, falls, and creek are breathtaking. If you are up to it, you can climb the 224 stairs all the way to the \u2026",
          "This place is awesome! We went in the evening as the sun was slowly setting and the canyon was changing different colors. It was as if I was in a western. The falls were stunning. The stairs that led up the falls was literally breathtaking, \u2026",
          "Oh my what a fantastic restaurant. The trout was perfectly done. There were three of us and we each ordered our trout prepared differently. We loved our own trout and the tastes of each others.  They all tied for THE BEST. The atmosphere is unexcelled with the rustic building and drop dead views- it's almost heaven.",
          "A hidden treasure. Recommend for the whole family. My 4 year old went up the stairs with no problem.",
          "Great public place for beginning Colorado hikers. ....Dony be afraid of heights cause....omg.",
          "The Falls are very nice and nice place to visit, BUT there has got to be a better way on the  shuttling situation. It was nice but not ideal. We waited an hr to leave the place which is ridiculous. At this point seems no other options besides UBER.",
          "Wow what a beautiful place! Get your comfy shoes on because you're going to be walking quite a bit. Take the stairs to the top of at least one of the waterfall lookouts, even if it takes you a while. It's really beautiful!",
          "the falls are gorgeous but the location is very confusing to get to. you can't drive up to the falls and instead have to park far away from the location (not even at the broadmoor) then be shuttled to the gate of the falls and either walk to the falls and restraunt or pay for another shuttle.",
          "Beautiful park with seven water falls. Lots of exercise getting to the top, and can be very dry so bring water. A nice break from city life for a few hours. Keep in mind that it is not possible to drive to the property, you must park at a designated area and ride the free shuttle in.",
          "This place is magical. Even more beautiful at dusk.",
          "Go in the evening so that you can see the falls lit up with colored lighting.  Beautiful!",
          "Definitely a tourist trap. The walk to the waterfall is better than the waterfall. My husband and brother walked up all the stairs and said there was barely even a view. Very overpriced.",
          "The falls were cool, and you got a great work out on all those stairs. The view from the top was breath taking",
          "This place is absolutely stunning. Beautiful walk up to the falls once getting off the shuttle.",
          "Has changed a lot since Broadmoor took over. Super commercialized - very expensive. There are WAY better waterfalls throughout RMNP...and they are much cheaper and more natural.",
          "This got a 4 due to the scenery when we got to the falls. Other wise,  this would be lower. Kind of expensive for what you get and the shuttle buses need a little love. The seat we were in didnt have a seat back or seat belts, the driver \u2026",
          "This was a stunning sight to see! We went on rather dreary day and it still was neat. The stairs to the top of the falls were wet and made me nervous. They are also a very steep incline. There is not another to the top of the falls so just \u2026",
          "Beautiful views all around. We loved the hiking trails at the top of the falls",
          "Fantastic falls, scenic bus ride to the falls, beautiful at night with the lights on",
          "Expense and long waits for shuttles.  It was much cooler before broadmoor took it over.",
          "Nice view of seven falls. Facility to climb up. Had excellent time",
          "absolutely beautiful but be careful at this altitude if you're not from the area! overall a fantastic experience!",
          "A must-see! Climb the stairs and be amazed every step of the way for awesome views. Every where you look is a postcard shot!",
          "Amazing place. Hike is easy. Very clean and superbly maintained.",
          "Very well maintained park. The steps are doable for most people to get to the top where there is more trails and gorgous views.",
          "Beautiful place to visit. You can climb the stairs to the top or use the elevator. The only thing that I didn't like was the price and the fact that you have to shuttle.",
          "Beautiful place for a long walk, the scenery is amazing but do not expect that in the end you will find something impressive. The only thing you are going to see is a staircase with more than 200 steps and a restaurant that you cannot enter without having made a previous reservation ... disappointing",
          "Falls= Exaggeration of your shower (Don\u2019t go by the pictures online)\nCustomer Service= Horrible.\nShuttle Frequency= Pathetic.\n\nIt might be less painful to flush $16 down the drain than go here. I hope this review will at least save a few souls from the dreadful experience I had!",
          "Always a great place to visit. This place is wonderful, staffs are helpful and environment is so great. They don\u2019t have enough parking lot but they provide a free shuttle.",
          "Beautiful to see, lots of stairs to climb, and clean. Expensive and not worth the money. Go to garden of the Gods or Red Canyons for free! Cave of the Winds is a nice pay to visit site with education for the family",
          "Not sure if it\u2019s worth the price but it was pretty nice.  Just went there because we had time to kill but otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t be on the top of my list to go back or anything.",
          "This was a bucket list place for me! Just beautiful and great cardio!",
          "Be prepared to wait. The  place is ok, but nothing you cannot see for free in the area or in a good state park. Don't be fooled by the location of the place on Google. You actually have to take 15 minute shuttle ride from some remote \u2026",
          "Incredibly beautiful place that connects you with nature, creeks, canyons and waterfalls (rocks, tunnels and all kinds of fun!). You could even see falcons, ducks and other variety of wildlife. \n\nThe only downfall is that they have been \u2026",
          "Beautiful hiking trail. Amazing views and scenic waterfalls",
          "Expensive but worth it, gotta climb many, many stairs though and I hope you like walking. It is beautiful though.",
          "Absolutely a joke. Whoever runs this has no sense of customer service. To get to the fall first of all, you cant even park right up there. You have to wait for a shuttle in the glaring sun. Once you get there, you\u2019ll notice a huge line of \u2026",
          "Beautiful scenery and great little hiking spot.  Will be back for sure",
          "I know we visited CO during its dry season, but you can see the pipe which was feeding the falls, and the intake at the bottom which recycled the water.\n\nIt's a pretty place... But you're in Colorado. Everything is pretty. And tons of \u2026",
          "Very pretty!! Totally handicapped accessible  which is great. Staff was courteous and helpful.",
          "Beautiful sight, nice little hike but there are a lot of steps up the falls (I believe 242) so I may not recommend for small kids or elderly. When we went this poor elderly man really struggled to go up and down with his grandkids. Kudos to him for going the distance but you could tell he was hurting.",
          "Perfect for a short hike through beautiful scenery. The trail is paved all the way to the falls and there is an elevator to take you up to a viewing platform (the eagle's nest). Prices as of March 17th: \n$10 for adults\n$5 for kids (2-12)\nFree for infants\nSeniors get a free tram ticket\n\nOverall a fantastic day outing",
          "Breathtakingly Gorgeous place for photographers buffs.\nGOD is Everywhere",
          "The elevator up to a viewing platform was great. The falls spectacular. The restaurant was outstanding.\n\nThe detractor was the shuttle wait.",
          "Did not like this attraction.  Parked in the lot and took the shuttle to the box office.  Paid admission, then walked up the canyon.  It was end of December, so pretty cold, and the creek was mostly frozen.\n\nAfter getting to the restaurant, \u2026",
          "I had not been here since before the major flooding and change of ownership.  The Broadmoor has definitely put their touch on it.  We had a late lunch at the restaurant and then hiked the stairs after dark to get the lighting.  Very \u2026",
          "So expensive when they make you walk to it by yourself, no real bathrooms and the experience is like whatever it\u2019s just one fall. Everyone was nice but we paid 56 dollars to walk and look at rocks... I expected to be impressed or in awe.",
          "We had a blast. Littles enjoyed the walk up to the falls and panned for gold on the way down.",
          "A short beautiful home thru the valley of hills on both sides and a stream running up to the base of the mountain which leads up stairs and then a gentle up hill walk to the falls.  Really enjoyed it!",
          "Its a nice park around the seven falls. Brilliant thought on how they have developed a nice family friendly park around a small falls. Was here last week (December) and the falls was completely frozen but illuminated with night lights. They have stairs that take you all the way up to the water falls.",
          "I enjoy bringing my out of town guests here. The walk up to the falls area is beautiful. If you don't want to climb the stairs to the top you can take an elevator ride to a beautiful scenic look out.  It's pet friendly. The falls are \u2026",
          "Most expensive birthday dinner, but definitely not the nicest.  One cannot just go to the restaurant, BUT there are fees for entrance to Seven Falls (which they will not validate if you eat at the restaurant) AND it costs an additional $2 \u2026",
          "Really not worth the $15 per person entry fee. No public parking either, need to take a shuttle to get there. Only trail is the one at the top of the waterfall, to get to the waterfall you either take the shuttle or walk a paved road. But \u2026",
          "Nice hike once you get to the top. Roughly 200 something stairs and you're done. Very much worth the climb",
          "Lovely falls, and dog friendly trails. With over 200 stairs up and down, be ready for a climb.",
          "Poor shuttle service.Our group waited for more than 45 minutes for shuttle. But still very scenic and good staff and is a incredible experience",
          "The directions given was to the actual falls not to the site where the tour started. To my understanding this was the only way to see the falls, never did find where to go",
          "It\u2019s pretty, the Broadmoor has done a nice job landscaping the walk to the falls. It\u2019s too expensive as there are so many beautiful free walks in Colorado. Can\u2019t ride the shuttle to the top for free unless you\u2019re a Broadmoor guest.  Bathrooms were closed and port-a-potties were out.",
          "Really awesome and colorful see it right as the sun sets and you will understand",
          "Great hike for everyone up beyond seventh bridge. Going across the loose-sand path across the huge landslide above the seventh bridge takes a bit of confidence and/or good shoes",
          "Beautiful area. Good hiking. Well provided with shuttles for less able. Good restaurant.  Steps up falls not suitable for under 7yrs but worth the climb. Lift to  seeing platform good for less energetic and young kids. Take a quarter for kids to feed the trout!",
          "This is a must see place to visit if you like waterfalls! Pay for the shuttle fee, it's worth it. The only thing I didn't like was the porta potty.  Where are the actual restrooms to such a magical place?",
          "Do not miss this experience. The parking and shuttle are a bit of a hassle, but the canyon and the falls are beautiful. Red rock formations surround you going up, and there are two great ways to view the falls, the stairs, and the Eagle's Nest.",
          "so pretty. hell of a walk though. dont wear Steve madden flip flops.",
          "Wow, what a lovely place. Highly recommended!",
          "Amazing site to see, wish I could have seen it before it got bought. I was recommended to go  after dark and I would differently pass that advice along to everyone. The staff were all pretty nice.  At night the falls look amazing. The best \u2026",
          "The waterfalls are OK. Nothing great. The best part was climbing up the 254 stairs.",
          "Very beautiful park.  A must see in Colorado Springs.  It's a lot of walking,  but there is a tram to take you up the road.  We climbed the lower steps to the platform.  The view is great.  My husband was able to go to the top.  Not me.  Walking down was very scary, but fun.",
          "Taking the shuttle was confusing but the juice was worth the squeeze. I highly recommend the .8 mile ride to the top also. The view and experience was breathtaking. Very excited to do it again.",
          "We loved it . Staff is super friendly.",
          "A beautiful park! Just will be hard for anyone who has a fear of heights!! Even if you do you can still enjoy the beautiful scenery.",
          "Of course, scenery and waterfall were gorgeous. If you aren't scared of heights, take a nice hike up the steps to get a full range of the falls. The restaurant there was really great too.",
          "Somewhere between 3 & 4 star location.  The stairway is pretty epic.  Would like to try the restaurant sometime.  Forgo the tram (sham).",
          "This place is so amazing. I suggest you to visit this place in summer rather then winter. The fall is all frozen in winter as I visited this place in winter. \nThis place cost you 14-15 dollars to visit if you are adult. It is cheap for \u2026",
          "Seven Falls used to be free, for all who don't know. The Broadmoor bought it up, slapped a gate around the property, set up some Bougee venues right in front of the falls and charge a relatively hefty price of admission. Very disappointed \u2026",
          "Was there during the hailstorm yesterday.  The staff was totally unprepared for the dangerous conditions that were present in the park.  Empty vans taking non existent passengers to the broadmoor on multiple occasions with flooded ticket area loaded with people.  You are very lucky that no one was seriously hurt.",
          "So beautiful. Be ready to walk a lot of tight stairs. So worth the walk up to the falls",
          "Although it's quite a climb up the stairs, I like walking around the falls and seeing the unbelievably beautiful  canyon.  Tha view from the Eagles Nest is spectacular.",
          "It's a beautiful place but not worth the admission price especially when you have to park miles away. I visited this place several years ago and quite a lot has changed and not for the better.",
          "Brochures don't lie.  Beautiful, trails are well maintained,  staff is friendly",
          "The scenery is beautiful. The walk is beautiful. The prices are expensive and not necessarily do you get the full bang for your buck. The website prices are not up to date. It was awesome but not worth the dollars.",
          "Beautiful place.  You should visit",
          "I love this pretty waterfall.\nThis is a cool experience to see what one looks like.",
          "Beautiful place to visit and well worth the money! If you don't enjoy walking I would recommend paying and taking a ride to the top of where the falls begins. If you don't mind a walk up a incline it's well worth the walk to the falls with \u2026",
          "Good for kids. Transportation was very slow so prepare to wait in line. Many resting areas, and there's a trolly for thps who have a hard time walking. Most of it is wheel chair accessable.",
          "Very scenic stop to check out the falls. Be ready to walk a lot of stairs.",
          "Got to the gate before finding out a shuttle is required. Free shuttle, professional staff, beautiful site. Good time",
          "Natural wonders should not be own by private companies.",
          "If you are not a Broadmoor guest, plan on a an extended time to get there and to get back to your vehicle.  Parking is at the Norris Penose center. Visitors then take 20 minute ride to the entrance. Then after paying the entrance fee, it is \u2026",
          "Loved it!!  Great place to eat, great location, great staff!!",
          "A little misleading... seven falls is really just one fall...each time it hits a landing or turns...they count it as another fall. Otherwise beautiful hike and I was able to conquer my fear of heights and climb the stairs!!",
          "Amazing views that you're not going to find elsewhere. I highly recommend going up the stairs, the view is worth it.",
          "I love hiking trails into the Falls, this place is truly amazing, seven beautiful waterfalls, all in one side of the mountain.",
          "My legs were shaking after all of the stairs and hiking but well worth it!",
          "I dont know if this is the proper place to rate, but my husband and I visited for our 14th anniversary today. We did the fin ziplining course. AIDEN AND BEN WERE AMAZING. The views were breathtaking. As the lines got a bit more intense, \u2026",
          "Although the infrastructure and the service or attention given by the staff to visitors is probably close to a 5 star, the actual waterfall is not more than a 3 star, specially considering the high price you pay to enter, even including the \u2026",
          "We absolutely loved the scenery \ud83e\udd17",
          "Pricey. But that makes it less crowded, which is awesome. Beautiful falls. Easy hike. Stairs are no joke, STEEP 284 steps on one, 167 for the other, so if the elevator is broken (like it was for us) be ready to get your workout in. The \u2026",
          "We walked from the gate up to the falls.   Was a beautiful walk with mountain and river views.  Stopped for lunch at 1858 and we had the trout which was amazing.  We then took the stairs to the viewing deck.  That is actually why this is \u2026",
          "Beautiful terrain and easy walk.  You can make the hike at the top of the falls as aggressive as you like.  You can even bring small children and the elderly.  Your can take a free tram to the base of the falls from the entrance as well as \u2026",
          "Reasonable price tourist place that can be challenge for those who want to climb 225 step to go from bottom to the top of the 7 falls",
          "One of beautiful falls I have ever experienced. Night time lights make it soo special. Love it",
          "Beautiful!! Definitely a hike for people who want to observe nature in the lap of luxury. Strange mix of natural beauty and landscaping complete with planter pots. Nice for people who really don't want to walk as you can shuttle your way \u2026",
          "Very beautiful hike but you have to park forever away and take a shuttle so don't go to the posted address. Go to the website and look at the address where the shuttle will pick you up. Be prepared for lots of stairs!",
          "Grew up coming here. I can't get enough of the water falls at night, truly a site! Also in the winter it's an incredible view.\nI am disappointed that you now have to park in a different location, shuttle to the gate and walk a solid mile up \u2026",
          "Great views. Paved hiking was easy. Trails and stairs a little tough but worth the effort. No bathroom at the entrance, which would be a good investment otherwise, you have to walk 10 minutes. Bring a CamelBak for water. Most of trails were in shade in the morning. Overall a fun adventurous time. \ud83d\ude0e",
          "Kinda hard to find the pick up point, as they shuttle you to and from the actual falls. You park about 12 mins away, and shuttles run every 10 mins. I believe it's about a .8 mile walk to the falls, at a slight incline. However they run to \u2026",
          "Nice. The evening lights would be better if they highlighted the water.",
          "The Broadmoor has turned it into a get-richer-quick scheme. Used to be able to walk or drive right up the road to the top and see the falls but not anymore. The bathrooms are on a septic system and that's Colorado Springs' drinking water \u2026",
          "\ud83d\udca6 We really enjoyed our visit.  The initial walk to the falls was comfortable, paved and a slight incline.  We decided to do the stairs which gets you up close and personal with the water.  There were a lot of people on the stairs going in \u2026",
          "Four of us (adults) went here on 6/20/18. You cannot park at or near the entrance.  You have to park over by the Broadmoor hotel several miles away in a special parking lot and take their free shuttle to get into the falls.  Be prepared to \u2026",
          "Beautiful views! Well worth the price especially if you go up the stairs and hike the two trails.",
          "First of all, this is a sight on a private property. You have to park quite far away and  take the shuttle bus to the entrance. You have high hopes for the place because it cost so much to get in. From there you can either walk about one \u2026",
          "Little pricey for what you get to do/see. Loved the falls.",
          "Very good fantastic to visit very well run place",
          "The creek was still frozen so it was cold. The restaurant wasn't open so no luck with warm food or bathroom break. There were two souvenir shops, one at the top of the stairs, and one is next to the elevator. Stairs were a bit steep, but we made it to the top. On the way down though, not for people who doesn't like heights.",
          "Beautiful!  We ate at the restaurant, great service and food.",
          "I didnt like climbing all of the stairs but overall it was very easy, pretty, and family friendly",
          "This place was outstanding! We had such a great day. Trails were beautifully kept, food at the 1858 Restaurant was amazing. I brought an out-of-town guest. I will definitely be bringing more visitors through Seven Falls in the future. \u2026",
          "Really a neat place to visit. If you can walk about a mile or so, don't take the trolley up to the falls.",
          "Beautiful views, hiking, and great outdoor atmosphere. I brought my 10 year old son and he enjoyed it. Approximately 3 mile walk taking the 20 min midnight trail.",
          "Beautiful, but underwhelming. 15.50pp was steep for what you see. 7 falls equates to 1 large waterfall.",
          "THEY TOOK OUR MONEY BUT THEN THEY FORCED US DOWN OFF THE TRAILS 30 MINUTES IN! DONT TAKE OUR MONEY IF WE CAN'T RUN THE TRAILS. WE GOT UP THERE EXTREMELY FAST!",
          "Went with some friends, had a really good time. If you enjoy the outdoors and you have not been yet then I'd recommend checking it out.",
          "One of the hidden beautiful places in Colorado",
          "These falls are worth talking some time to see and climb the stairs that lead up to a longer trail. It's a beautiful sight.",
          "Beautiful area! Easy shuttle service and parking. Be prepared for the stair climb to the top, but well worth it.",
          "The only fault is having to take the shuttle from 5 miles away. But they run pretty regularly. Great tourist destination if you enjoy hiking. I'm not sure it is worth the visit if unable to enjoy the workout. The falls themselves are soso. \u2026",
          "Not gonna lie, the walk up to the top of the falls and then onto the inspiration point was challenging. But the views all the way are beautiful and totally worth it. Plus the ealk back down is a breeze..!",
          "5 stars for mother nature. The shuttle service accommodated a stroller and our drivers were great. $20 to see the falls, 2 adults, one 2 year old,  and a 6 month old. The Canyon winds were cool.. We were able to see the falls from below and \u2026",
          "Great place to visit during summer time. Rock formations, the pond and the views from the top are amazing. You have to be careful while climbing the steps as they are very steep, trails are beautiful. Entry is $14 and tram costs $2(It is \u2026",
          "Excellent hike all around. Bring enough water because you're not going to want to leave once you reach the top",
          "This was our first visit since the Broadmoor Hotel took over Seven Falls. I must say, it is so much better now. \nYou get the shuttle at 1045 Lower Gold Camp Rd at the Penrose Event Center (not across from the Golden Bee anymore despite what \u2026",
          "This is a must visit place. Easy parking and transportation. Lastly the views are incredible!",
          "Our first visit to Seven Falls was fantastic!  I was pleasantly surprised by how beautiful the entire area is - not just the falls themselves, but even the short hike up to the falls base is gorgeous.  The landscaping is immaculate, \u2026",
          "Too expensive and underwhelming. The walk up to the falls is nice, but overall this is a bad tourist trap.",
          "Privately owned park?\n\nWe spent the day in Co. Springs so we stopped by.  The grounds are nice and this may hit the spot for some.  Our take was that there are so many beautiful places to visit in Co., we would not make the return trip and \u2026",
          "Good price, clean and very pretty, but should really advertise that the falls at the top is not very big",
          "You have to ride a shuttle in now and pay. However, they did some great improvements to the area. Broadmoor did a great job with it.",
          "Beautiful park. Lots of stairs for any stairs lover like my sister.",
          "There's no words to describe these beauty of the waterfall. And the trails are just as pretty! With that said, be prepared to wait time getting to and from the actually place. But it's definitely worth going.Gift shops are more expensive \u2026",
          "This is a very beautiful sight. The two sets of stairs can be quite daunting not just by the number of stairs but they're steepness and they are a bit narrow. One set has an elevator but the set that actually leads up to the trails and \u2026",
          "Must see.  Utah area. Right next to highway.",
          "Nice place to visit for a few hours if you want to see some spectacular rock scenery and take some amazing pictures. Seems that there are other activities, like sliding hanging on a cable from one pick to another at a extreme high altitude, \u2026",
          "As someone from Colorado- there are soooo many other places to see! This is a true tourist trap! The walkway to go up to the top of the waterfall was closed when we went....which made me even more infuriated! It cost almost 18 DOLLARS for \u2026",
          "Amazing place. Definitely worth to visit, if you have time wait for sunset. Colours are amazing. If you can walk short walk from gate to falls.\nThere is a lots off to see",
          "Beautiful scenery, sit in the rocking chair at the bottom. Amazing",
          "I thoughr this place was very beautiful if you love nature the Reasturant looked pretty good little high priced. 15.50 for adults there are 2 sets of stairs the second has 244 steps all the way to the top where there is a 20 min round trip \u2026",
          "Historic site, gorgeous views,  hiking trail at top, elevator to mid water fall if you do not want to climb stairs or can't.   The Restaurant was also very nice service and food were 4 star.  Prices not outrageous.",
          "My first time here. It was a bit confusing to me trying to find this place. GPS led us to a horse farm parking lot where they offer shuttle services to the Falls. $15.50 per Adult and $12 per child. Shuttle service to tje falls is free but \u2026",
          "Def worth checking this out! Beautiful",
          "Super pretty. But I don't think it's worth the amount you paid!",
          "Gorgeous. Breathtaking. There is a good climb up some stairs. Not for those afraid of heights. However, there are resting areas along the way. Once you are at the top. You can take the elevator down.",
          "Really a great spot to visit while here in Colorado Springs...the only thing is the parking is not clear or perhaps I missed it at their website, but do not Google it ...youll need a shuttle bus to take you located at a different spot. Also \u2026",
          "Couldn't make it, it's long line wait in hot summer afternoon.",
          "Beautiful well kept resort. Climbing the stairs was a workout!",
          "What a workout but views were beautiful",
          "Cool place tucked back in the mountains, great veiws, nice experience to see",
          "A good place to visit during spring summer time as the falls when steps down through the seven steps goes through a beautiful lighting setup making it one of the beautiful water fall visualizations.",
          "There are no drinking fountains! BYO water! Beautiful waterfalls, but way too many tourists.",
          "Enjoyed our visit here!! Beautiful",
          "You'll see better holiday lights on any random street in Colorado Springs and save 16 bucks per person and 30 minutes of riding around in a shuttle. For waterfalls, Helen Hunt falls is intriguing and not commercialized.",
          "Good place, I have seen better. Although it has many facilities such restrooms, restaurant, etc but I wish this place has not been modified for human convenience.",
          "Beautiful. God's creation. Love it. Been several times.",
          "Well maintained park. And also a worth going!!",
          "One of the best places i have been.",
          "Kind of \"Six Flags Over a Waterfall\" feel about the place. I've seen better falls in free parks, but maybe this is a really good waterfall for this part of the country. Really wasn't worth the time or money in my book.",
          "The park is very clean and well maintained. Even the bathrooms were well kept. Parking at the Broadmoor and being shuttled seemed like a weird idea at first but there was almost no wait time and it was nice to not have to fight for a \u2026",
          "Amazing staff and grounds at this private park with hiking and dining.",
          "We loved the history behind the private park and 1858 restaurant that changed hands in 2012, all but ruined after the mudslides.  The Broadmoor did an amazing job renovating, and the experience is amazing.  Park in the distant parking lot \u2026",
          "Interesting place but it is an uphill hike all the way. For you seniors there is a shuttle..... take it! It's a much easier walk coming back.",
          "Outstanding place to visit everybody visiting this area should go here helps get you in shape if not it'll teach you that you need to be in shape but it's a wonderful place to see if you make it to the top you definitely need to take the \u2026",
          "Awesome place. I recommend to do the hiking paths. :)",
          "If there is a \"zero\" I don't mind giving one. Terrible experience....no rest rooms, no waiting area or warm-up area while waiting for tram....the tram folks are rude and non-professional...I would never go again....I wish it was like before \u2026",
          "Wonderful place to be. Invigorating and the scenery is so beautiful. I would visit often and will bring friends and family as well. I went didn't have to wait long for the train. The cost for the zip line is a bit high for where you are zipping from. All and all a great experience.",
          "Great hike, the restaurant has great food, only downside is parking and taking the bus and the price to get in. But it\u2019s worth it regardless!",
          "An absolute amazing place to visit. Doing this on a cold and foggy day really enhanced the visit. There is a fee to enter but well worth the price. Beautiful waterfalls and some great hiking can be done in this area. There are two viewing \u2026",
          "We went in the middle of the week and towards the end of the day.  Glad we did, we almost had this place to ourselves.  It's nice when you can enjoy it with nobody else around.  The scenery and the sound of the falls was awesome.  You have \u2026",
          "Great place to make out with a hot chick.  BJ's In. Waterfalls are out of this world!!! I recommend it.",
          "Gorgeous place! Worth the hike to inspiration point!",
          "Iggest waterfall I've ever seen. Beautiful but the stairs are a little disorienting. Still worth it!",
          "Once we get in there is parking spot . From there we have to take shuttle to the privately owned property . Entry fees is 15 dollar and 2 dollar for the tram . We have walk a mile to fall . Don\u2019t expect something big it\u2019s a small fall . We don\u2019t have much option for food inside so better to have lunch outside \nTotal time 2 to 3 hours",
          "I went here with some friends. Definitely a must to visit in Colorado! Free shuttle takes you to the falls, and back. You can choose to walk around the falls, or for $2 more you can ride around a tram. Highly recommend walking to enjoy \u2026",
          "Great attraction amazing waterfalls gorgeous scenery. Negative nellie reviews were ignorant not to research ahead of time on interested sites to see the kind that go anyway and love to complain.",
          "Tourist trap \"hiking\" destination with beautiful views of a waterfall. Nifty tram to help you get up the hill,  especially if your knees decide when you hike like mine do.",
          "Beautiful walk.  The stairs up to the actual hike is a little scary. The restaurant is not bad, but nothing exciting.",
          "Great brisk hike.  Very calm and peaceful.",
          "This place is so awesome. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to reach the top.",
          "Lives up to the 5 star name of the Broadmoor. Always picture perfect during the holidays. The restaurant was better than I expected. Made for a perfect birthday!",
          "This place was so beautiful. Great service all around. Staffs were friendly, everyone of them! From the parking lot, to the free shuttle to the entrance, the ticket office, the walk up to the fall, the gift shop, and the bus ride back to \u2026",
          "Expensive, touristy and not safe in the winter.",
          "I was not expecting such an exhausting trek to the top of seven Falls but oh man it was worth it! As you're walking to the falls you're in the canyon with huge mountain walls to your left and right. An amazing experience and definitely a \u2026",
          "Views  and scenery are amazing!",
          "Falls were frozen but it was amazing plus exercise in the mix. Steep stairs though and scary going back down.",
          "Me and my brother had an epic snowball fight",
          "Beautiful area! It is quite a climb up the stairs to the top but worth it.",
          "Nice hike. We  did the whole thing, including both upper area hikes. The hike to inspiration point was well worth it.",
          "Easy to access, nice calm place. Only issue is we have to park 15min away to get on the shuttle, but parking and shuttle is free of cost. Did not eat in the restaurant but over heard people taking nice about it.",
          "Awesome place to hike. The stairs had me dying but that's just cause I'm out of shape ha",
          "We loved this place! Just beautiful!",
          "Once is enough it a 10 bus ride and the cost for admission is too high they do have a tramp for an extra 2 bucks on top of the 15 entry fee",
          "We had a lot of trouble finding it. If you put seven falls in your GPS it takes you up a mountain and randomly tells you you've arrived when you're nowhere close. We talked to a few other drivers who also had similar problems. Upon further \u2026",
          "Very enjoyable.  But if walking stairs it is steep.  I  did it though.",
          "So glad I decided to check this out! Absolutely beautiful. Great staff, super friendly they all seemed like they really enjoyed they're jobs. Totally worth the $14.50 . Would say that if you struggle with walking the stairs may be challenging.",
          "Awesome challenging climb up 200 some stairs",
          "It was nice it was in a little nook nears Beutiful mountains",
          "Short, easy hike were were very close to a doe at the top of the waterfall",
          "Absolutely beautiful scenery. Super clean, short walk on paved road. Upon reaching the top, there is a restaurant and gift shop. If you wish to climb further, it is exactly 222 steps up the side of the cliff and you can even hike further by \u2026",
          "A bit scary! But worth the experience, Going up those stair steps!",
          "Friendly staff the place was clean the restaurant we ate at by the falls was nice and definitely a must to stop at",
          "One of my favorite places to hike! Seven falls was absolutely beautiful. The stairs definitely killed my calves but definitely worth it when you make it to the top! Theres a trail called inspiration point and it really takes your breath away! Very inspiring! Make sure you bring plenty of water and good shoes",
          "Not worth the parking fee.  The build-up turns into a bit of a let-down once you see it.  It is a nice area, but not as nice as the advertisers would lead you to believe.  Save your money, and go to Helen Hunt Falls.",
          "Great place to visit for everyone who loves tge nature, but the best place for those loves hiking , camping or hanging arround there with friends or alone...",
          "This place has some amazing views and interesting history. I'm thankful my wife and I were able to see this on our trip we loved it and if you are able you should add this to your to do list.",
          "Park at 1045 Lower Gold Camp Rd where shuttles pick you up. Wish we would of known this will help. They changed how to get to the falls last year!",
          "The falls are pretty cool, but the entire place is an experience. The grounds are kept up extremely well. I was also impressed with the staff. Everything was run really well. I will definitely be back to hike up the stairs and eat at the restaurant.",
          "Get ready to climb some stairs!   But it is worth the climb to the top.",
          "You\u2019ll park at Broadmoor and take a free shuttle up to the entrance to the falls. Great family friendly activity that doesn\u2019t take up your whole day. Scenery is great and the walk isn\u2019t bad at all. There are some steep stairs if you want to go to the very top. Fun thing to do in the springs!",
          "Beautiful whether it's hot or cold. Tours are offered or you can choose to hike your on own.",
          "Fun hike with some cool shops.  Not sure if worth the price of admission",
          "I love this place! The waterfalls look gorgeous around autumn season...best time to go is around September to November to watch the leaves change, while the skies are clear blue.",
          "This place is absolutely breathtaking. If you have any kind of handicap a shuttle can take you to the top of the hill and you can take an elevator up to catch some views. If you are willing to walk up 224 steps, you're a short trip away \u2026",
          "Beautiful place best to go late so you can enjoy all falls lit up in colors",
          "The Broadmoor 7 falls is absolutely beautiful.  Park for free in the designated parking area next to the Broadmoor hotel. Ride a shuttle bus for free to be entrance of the Falls. Buy your tickets online or purchase them at the ticket office \u2026",
          "Entry price worth the money.\nClean trails, amazing views.\nOff site parking with shuttle service available.\nRestaurant on site. Pricey but does have non-typical game food on the menu.",
          "Phenomenal place! Wonderful experience!",
          "Absolutely beautiful. Great hike to see the falls.",
          "Good place to walk around and hike, very nice scenary.",
          "Very challenging climb up the 260 plus steps . Very beautiful place with rock formations, waterfall and nice forest trails at the top. Must visit.",
          "Great views and good place to climb a bunch of stairs.",
          "A visually interesting little sideshow near the resort. The hotel shuttle drops off & picks up just inside the main gate. There is a short, but uphill walk to get to the falls. So if you\u2019re affected by the altitude this stop would be better after you\u2019ve been here a few days.",
          "Amazing! The walk was great! So beautiful",
          "The Seven Falls were a spectacular site! We went in the evening and saw them all lit up. Next time we go I'd go during the day to be able to take the hour hike back down and around, instead of the crazy steep staircase. Only downfall was \u2026",
          "Fantastic! Beautiful park. Share with the entire family.",
          "Suggestion to be ready to climb stairs! Once you get up all stairs there is the top of the 7 falls to look down upon. You can explore further if you like. There are 2 trails up the mountain. One is a 20 min trail, the other a 40 min trail. \u2026",
          "it was so fun i went when i was 12 and i didn't like it while i was there, but looking back now it was so cool and an amazing experience",
          "This place has changed a lot but I'm totally loving it. It's completely beautiful and renovated. I absolutely loved the walk from the beginning to the end. It is very peaceful and relaxing. 5 stars!",
          "I live going here all year around it's easy from my 5 year old to walk we see all kinds of wild life very beautiful worth going if you can",
          "Very clean and landscaped so nicely. You can walk or pay extra to take a ride up to seven falls. When you get there, there is a fantastic restaurant ($$), a spot with rocking chairs to watch the falls and everyone going up and down about 750 steps. Probably more. We went to the top, pretty difficult lol.",
          "Gorgeous a must see",
          "Family and I had so much fun when we visited here! We hiked... the falls were gorgeous and the restaurant is great too. Highly recommended. We will get yearly passes for sure.",
          "Well if you're ever in Colorado springs treat yourself to the zipline the Broadmoor / 7 falls into Manitou springs absolutely astounding and stunning the scene. So breathtaking you will not regret one second of the journey and you might want to do it a second time or third give it a try release the child in you",
          "Awesome place to go hiking and do a lot of outdoor activities. The zip lines are great and the overall scenery is well worth the trek to get there.",
          "Beautiful,  staff and other tourists real friendly,  must see.",
          "Not what it used to be before it was bought out by the broadmoor, but still a neat site. Kind of pricy",
          "Gorgeous but a bit pricey.  The $ is worth it for the ease if access.  This isn't a great place for those who appreciate the trek in to the destination.  The restaurant at the top looked really good.  All in all, a very well maintained beautiful area.",
          "My entire 1858 experience was five star. My party and I were promptly seated for lunch on the patio, our server was very attentive and professional (thank you, Junior!), and the food and beverages were extremely flavorful and delicious. I \u2026",
          "When I came to the states all I wanted was to experience at least one waterfall, so boy was I blown away when I found this absolute goldmine (not actually a goldmine). It had SEVEN waterfalls!?! That\u2019s like seven times the amount I was \u2026",
          "BEWARE - Very difficult to gain access, you can not drive your car directly to this location. We went to 3 different locations trying to find a shuttle that would take us to the falls before giving up.",
          "Beautiful, fantastic, holy stair steps!  I was feeling the burn at the top, but so worth it.  Stopped at the restaurant half way back coming down, very nice.",
          "Paved walkway. Elevator in the rock. Not pristine anymore but still beautiful.",
          "We absolutely loved our trip to Seven Falls. The views were breathtaking, it was clean and the walkways and stairs were well taken care of. The staff there were incredibly friendly from our shuttle driver giving us information on the way to \u2026",
          "What a wonderful view from the top of the mountain! The restaurant there is amazing, super fancy. But it is well worth the trip inside! I would 100% recomend this spot. I went at night to see it lite up. I am happy with my choice, but wish I brought a jacket. It was warm during the day but freezing at night.",
          "Amazing.  Must see if you are in the area",
          "View is definitely worth the workout at top of falls. Don't forget the 'inhaler' if you have asthma. Very hard to find the parking lot as it is miles away, in fact we almost gave up.",
          "I enjoyed our visit, but wasn't overly impressed. The trail to the top is paved and an easy walk. The views surrounding the falls are more impressive than the falls themselves. It's decent if you enjoy man-made waterfalls.",
          "Very good place to visit once. Very well maintained area. Elevator was very helpful if you could not climb actual steps.",
          "The five star rating for this place comes from the fact that this place is as well kept as Disneyland.",
          "Couldn't drive straight to it. Had to park at another location and be shuttled. So if it is a touristy season, you might be waiting a while for the shuttle. Beautiful, but had to pay to go through. Some of our group were afraid of heights \u2026",
          "Beautiful attraction, just make sure you have plenty of time to go!",
          "Very cool place to check out. They now have a shuttle that will bring you to the falls. The shuttle picks you up near the Broadmoor hotel and then drives you a few miles to the actual site of the falls. Awesome to go check out at night, they have the falls lit up with colorful lights",
          "This is a fantastic place to visit when in Colorado Springs, Colorado. There are beautiful stops to take pictures along the trail and the view at the end is spectacular. You could actually see seven waterfalls at the same time. There are many zip lines and I can't wait to return to see the view from above.",
          "Can't drive up to it but there is a complimentary shuttle that takes you to the entrance where you can buy the tickets ($10 adults, $5 child up to 12 years). We chose to hike our way up but there is a tram available also for an additional \u2026",
          "Great park and very, very clean.  A must see!",
          "Has an awesome view.",
          "With $15 per person this felt a bit expensive and plus $2 for the tram ride. The falls are ok, This is something that can be skipped if you are a tourist to \n Colorado springs.",
          "The natural beauty of Colorado. Magnificent!!!",
          "Great way to spend half a day. Beware the tram only takes you up the short paved path and is not worthwhile. You would still need to climb the stairs by the waterfalls if you wanted to see them. There is a lookout point with an elevator or \u2026",
          "Everyone working there was polite and friendly, I recommend walking to the falls from the drop off point",
          "Not exactly Niagara, but a nice park, lovely staff",
          "Must see, makes it very busy. Seemed to cross the line to being too commercial and touristy, subtracting from the point of admiring nature's beauty",
          "Really pretty. Great for an afternoon walk.",
          "Beautiful place. Parking was a bit odd but we loved it.",
          "Very cold wear clothes.. gloves and a hat! And bring your Visa, because no one takes American Express.  Nice views..",
          "Seven Falls is a great place to visit but has some limitations.  Parking is terribly out of the way and you have to be bussed in.  And it is rather expensive to get in and hike around the woods.\nViews are great, but you can get the same \u2026",
          "Gorgeous place. We were a little annoyed that we had to park so far away and use a shuttle but it was totally worth it. The views are amazing and the hike is well worth your time!",
          "Recommendation: Get your shuttles figured out. \nA simple hike turned into an all day wait. If you\u2019re taking parking away from the location and charging people $15/person then scale appropriately. \nPlan four hours for a one hour thing... went during the weekday but sounds like the same thing no matter web you go.",
          "Nice view but not worth the price. To get tickets [ $14.50 per person], you have to park at the Broadmoor lot made just for the falls. There is no parking close so you MUST take the shuttle. It drops you at the gate where you either have to \u2026",
          "We had a great time. Waiting for the shuttle was moderately annoying, but we had some great views and some great hikes once we got there.",
          "Pretty pretty. Best at twilight.",
          "Beautiful place but not real happy with having the weight  In lineto be bused in-and-out",
          "The fact that you have to pay to get in here is a bummer, but once you get in and start walking, it is one of the most beautiful sights you will ever see! You are completely surrounded by mountains and trees and it seems to never end! It is \u2026",
          "$14 a person isn\u2019t too bad for the amount of time you can spend there. Peaceful to spend some time out of the city here. Dogs are allowed which was a plus for us. Pretty pictures. This would be an awesome location for senior pics.",
          "Beautiful and breathtaking.  Didn't need to hike  up the stairs.",
          "There's no place to fill water bottles, the shuttle lines are right next to the portable restrooms so it smells bad. Our shuttle had no air conditioning. Overall I would not care to go back here for the price.",
          "Awesome place to Chill or Climb steps...get it!!!\ud83e\udd19",
          "Loves the falls. Beautiful veiw.",
          "Do not support the Broadmoor.  They are a disgusting monopoly in the city who is trying to take over the city's attractions and land. Take a ride down rampart range road for the ultimate scenic trip and it is free. Only takes a hour and a half. Do not give the Broadmoor a dime of your money.",
          "Pretty landscaping, waterfalls were less than we expected.",
          "Went zip lining. Wow. Breath taking. The guides were too notch.",
          "the walk to the falls was nice. very scenic! I don't recommend going up the stairs to the falls if you have anxiety and heart issues like me. i wasn't able to but did take the elevator inside the mountain up to a lookout point. stopped for \u2026",
          "It's extremely beautiful even though the zip lines and stairs detract from the natural beauty. I recommend bringing water. I saw where no outside food or drinks were allowed, but they let you bring in water. The restaurant is good the bison \u2026",
          "WONDERFUL waterfalls!! Water is still flowing good for this late in the summer, nice hike to and from the falls after a shuttle ride from the parking lot. Watch for zip-liners enjoying the view from above.",
          "Steep lol but great hike overall",
          "Gorgeous, absolutely stunning",
          "Absolutely loved it. Walk instead of taking the tram if you're able. It is beautiful. Beware. The first set of stairs to the bird's nest comes with an elevator with a cool walk up tunnel to the elevator. But the second set of stairs does \u2026",
          "First time here.  Make sure you park by the shuttle parking. \nYou CANNOT DRIVE into the entrance of seven falls. \nYou pay when the shuttle drops you off inside the park. \nI recommend you pay a little extra ($2.00) more to take the Tram, \u2026",
          "Not worth paying for in my opinion especially if you aren't going to go up all the steps to the top, and the tram ride should not cost more. There's plenty of other beautiful things to see in Colorado for free",
          "What a beautiful place to visit, the weather was just perfect no humidity. The waterfalls look amazing at night definitely going back to visit...",
          "Beautiful place to view. The restaurant has nothing the kids would eat so we had to leave for lunch. There\u2019s a shuttle that takes you back and forth but that means you spend a long time waiting to get out for lunch. For the $14 each to get in I wouldn\u2019t do it again.",
          "Suggested for address correction on google. We were literally lost while finding this place. Parking place is at \u201cNorris Penrose Event Center\u201d. Free shuttle takes you from there to seven falls. Walk is around .8 miles. There are two spots \u2026",
          "Beautiful place, great hiking, easily enough for half a day or more, depending on your pace",
          "Planned are day around the hours of business (open until 8:00 p.m.) we got there at 3:00 p.m. They had just closed for private party. With all the social media nowadays. It would have been nice to post the different closing time. Garden of \u2026",
          "The first 10 minutes of the walk is on a tarmac road surrounded by some pretty cool cliffs. The waterfall is pretty big, and I imagine it would look good when not frozen. Next to the fall is a stairway of several hundred steps that leads to \u2026",
          "Very pretty place. It's nice that there is a free shuttle to take you to the falls. Don't waste your money on the trolley. The short walk is very scenic and you still have to hike up to the falls anyways.",
          "Great trail and place to go with family , handicap accessible, children safe and knowledgable experience. Updated the trail is pavemented. Bathroom easy access. Parking could've been better but there's a parking lot with bus access that takes you up for free.",
          "I love this beautiful hike. I really like midnight falls and inspiration point! Great family hike any time of year.",
          "The place is good but other services were not matched with it like visiting fee too much high.",
          "I first visited when I was stationed at Fort Carson from 1987-1989. I have enjoyed taking my family back over the years. Absolutely Breathtaking every time. Make sure to ride the elevator to have a different view of the falls. The hike up the stairs was always my favorite. Always a must visit every time we travel from SE Texas.",
          "Really cool historic place. The falls are beautiful. There are hiking trails and a restaurant and a couple of gift shops. We decided to eat at 1858, the restaurant at the base of the falls. Food was good and service was fast. We took the \u2026",
          "This was a really cool place to explore. Good workout climbing the stairs alongside the falls and well worth doing the other trails especially to Inspiration Point. Worth going in the morning to avoid the crowds as it was getting busy when we left at noon on a weekday",
          "we were a little bummed that the elevator was not in service :/ , but we still enjoyed our visit here, our waitress Amy at 1858 was so sweet and recommended places to visit in Colorado Springs! we were not able to visit but will be back next year!"

        "wiki": "The Manitou Cliff Dwellings are a group of relocated Ancestral Puebloan cliff dwellings and museums located just west of Colorado Springs, Colorado, on U.S. Highway 24 in Manitou Springs.  \nThe Anasazi Museum was established and the cliff dwellings were built starting in 1904, and were opened to the public in 1907. The museum features displays about the lives of the Ancestral Puebloans, including exhibits of archaeological artifacts, tools, pottery and weapons. Visitors can also walk through the ancient-style ruins outside.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Ancestral Puebloans lived and roamed the Four Corners area of the Southwestern United States from 1200 B.C. to A.D. 1300.  The Ancestral Puebloans did not live in the Manitou Springs area, but lived and built their cliff dwellings in the Four Corners area, several hundred miles southwest of Manitou Springs. The Manitou Cliff Dwellings were built at their present location in the early 1900s, as a museum, preserve, and tourist attraction. The stones were taken from a collapsed Ancestral Puebloan site near Cortez in southwest Colorado, shipped by railroad to Manitou Springs, and assembled in their present form as Ancestral Puebloan-style buildings closely resembling those found in the Four Corners.  The project was done with the approval and participation of well-known anthropologist Dr. Edgar Lee Hewett, and Virginia McClurg, founder of the Colorado Cliff Dwelling Association.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCave of the Winds (Colorado)\nGarden of the Gods\nSeven Falls\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nManitou Cliff Dwellings Museum\nTourist Information\nPaul Weideman, \"Like a magnet on Stonefridge,\" Santa Fe New Mexican, 7 Feb. 2008",

          "We have lived in this area for over 20 years and had never visited this exhibit. It was a nice way to learn about some of the indigenous tribes of the region. The museum was more of a gift shop(s), but the gift shops, like the one at Garden of the Gods, have some great",
          "I find it interesting to see how people adapt their surroundings to meet their needs. The Anasazi people built these amazing structures with limited tools. This site is one of the most well preserved examples of cliff dwellings that you can visit. The overhanging rock protected",
          "Even though the snow was falling, we could not resist visiting the Manitou Cliff Dwellings. It was great!",
          "It is very interesting to learn of by gone days and how the people lived and survived. Doesn't take too much odd your time. Worth the stop",
          "I got to learn about American history a bit. The museum was quiet and peaceful. It gave a new perspective to how people at those times lived.",
          "Walking through the Clift Wellings was extremely educational as to how centuries ago people lived and survived. Taking our time, walking through the rock formations was quite educational. Well worth the time to stop and learn",
          "Educational and interesting. It's not a must-do, but it doesn't take long, so if you have an hour or so to kill, it's worth it. Make sure you go through the museum part for the full story.",
          "Very informative and unusual place. Loads of cool and interesting items and information in the museum and then brilliant to have such an immersive aspect too, different to most museums you visit. I learned a lot and am eager to learn more",
          "You get to glimpse how a family/community was very dependent upon each other out of a need that we today cannot comprehend. With supermarkets, cars, retail stores, we often feel we can do without other. Could we as a group work and live together if these things were not part",
          "While this is a privately owned site, the family running it has done a great job at preserving the dwellings and providing interpretive pannels. The museum is extensive and has a number if native artifacts on display with interpretive pannels on native culture and pottery",
          "The Cliff Dwellings themselves are an architectural feat. My kids (7, 13) had fun crawling around and through them. The museum did not interest them much. Be forewarned before you enter the gift shop - it is huge! And very hard to find your way out of. I was disappointed that so",
          "we weren't sure about this place when we drove in, but it was quite amazing, complete with pictographs. nice museums to walk through",
          "It was a nice experience exploring this place and knowing the history behind it. The view is picturesque. Not worth the money charged though. Can visit if you have extra time at hand.",
          "My parents and I stopped here for a quick visit this summer and we were absolutely blow away. The cliff dwellings were in really good shape and you could climb all around to look at them. Definitely want to go again when it\u2019s not so hot.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this museum. I dragged my husband here because I teach on the southwestern Native Americans. But I think he liked it as much as I did!",
          "We enjoyed our visit to this park, and especially enjoyed the original pueblo building, original photographs and museum and gift shop. The park is landscaped nicely and is very photogenic. I enjoyed seeing a real kiva at the deep-red-rock Anasazi dwellings and",
          "Not very big and easy to tour. Wouldn't miss it. Some steps to maneuver but overall a lot of history",
          "Not a MUST do but nice if you have the time . The children there seemed to really enjoy it . We took some nice pictures and it was nice to read the pieces of information through the area . I would not go back but I am glad we saw , we found it expensive since so many other",
          "I went back to visit this museum after 40 years and loved it all over again. It is one of the only things I remember about a visit to Colorado Springs as a kid. Now I know why. This is not your typical museum. It is a interactive place where you can walk around and touch and",
          "The Manitou cliff dwellings were moved to this site over 100 years ago. We climbed around and took some great shots. Yes, the gift shop is a big focus but with quality art and jewelry as well.",
          "Might be the smallest Indian cliff dwelling site in the USA, but still worth the money. They have done a great job of preserving the original structures, while using modern methods to do so. Not a Bucket Lister, for sure, but if you have time, go.",
          "We were looking for a \"quick\" activity to fill some time during our afternoon, and ahead of a visit to the Seven Falls. Manitou Cliff Dwellings are really neat to experience, but given that it is a relatively quick \"in and out\", the admission price is a bit steep for a larger",
          "Paid nearly $40 for family of 4 to visit. Worth about half that for what\u2019s on offer. The only real part of the \u2018attraction\u2019 that any effort has gone into is the large gift shop where they can rinse visitors of more cash.",
          "We stopped by the cliff dwellings after a visit to Garden of the Gods. It was intended to be a quick stop with the kids (ages 5 and 2) to learn about some Native American history. However, we were surprised by how interactive this attraction was. You are encouraged to climb",
          "Tour is $10 per adult and self guided. We could not find the audio tour on their website so we were left with signs to get information. Very cool to walk inside the cliff homes. Lots of steps but not exhausting might he difficult if theres mobility issues. Museum was nice but",
          "We visited during the first snow storm of the year so almost no one was there. This was great to look around. The dwellings are in amazing condition and you get to walk right into them. There\u2019s a few stairs but not a lot of distance to cover if you have someone with",
          "This was an interesting historic site with a museum smaller than the gift shop. The young children around seemed to be having a great time, however. The dwellings themselves are well-preserved but it took us less than an hour to see everything.",
          "We had a great time! My sons loved climbing though everything and exploring all that is there. Wonderful museum!",
          "This is a very interesting museum/venue. It to pics how people lived hundreds of years ago. Very clean well-kept not too many people it is off season the gift store had a lot of fun great gifts.",
          "I visited this place, based on must see things to do as advertised by the hotel. The visit lasts about an hour..max. I am disappointed to read that post visit this place is a tourist trap and the dwellings are not real. It defeats the hole point of the visit.",
          "It is a small area, and a reproduction. It was interesting to see, glad we did it but probably would not stop again.",
          "We were not planning on visiting the dwellings, but had some extra time in our schedule. We went about an hour before closing and there were only a few people there (which was nice). We were able to go inside the dwellings and with so few people we really got a chance to look",
          "We did a Homeschool day at the Cliff dwellings and it was amazing! Students learned history, painted pottery, toured and climbed in and around the ruins. The gift shop was excellent too!",
          "Open at 9. Modest entry fee. You can enter the cliffside dwellings and marvel at how these communities lived here generations ago. Watch for the low entrance points and the impressive central community firepit area. These dwellings have been moved here from their original",
          "The Cliff Dwellings exhibit was amazing. It was a real treat to be able to enter the dwellings and not rely on just peaking around a corner over a rope. There was even a ladder to climb up to some of the upper levels. It is pricey but well worth it.",
          "Very enjoyable peek into history. Glad these ruins were saved and moved to this location over 100 years ago. The plaques along the ruins give helpful information and being able to go behind the facades was a treat. There is a small museum with pottery, photos, basketry, etc.",
          "This is a beautiful and serene place. I could feel the history in this location. Just preserving this space is worth the entrance fee.",
          "Great example of how cave dwellers lived. If you\u2019re looking for a large gift shop with a wide selection of well priced high quality gifts stop here! Easy access and plenty of parking.",
          "If you had young kids and the cost was $10 a car I'd say it was worth the stop to walk the kids through the ruins. However, there is not enough to see here to pay the $10 per person. We stopped, walked through the one room museam the housed a few indian artifacts, and then",
          "We did enjoy our trip to the cliff dwellings. It is a good bit of history though not quite as exiting as the Cave of the Winds perhaps.",
          "Our family thought his was one of the best trips ever. I am so happy the cliff dwellings have been preserved. It\u2019s something everyone should see.",
          "An interesting site to experience a bit of the life of the cliff dwellers. And lots of gift shop opportunities.",
          "Very cool to see replicas of the dwellings. I enjoyed being able to walk in them and check it out. Great place to take small kids.",
          "We really wanted to see the cliff dwellings at Mesa Verde but our itinerary didn't allow the 6+ hour drive one way from Colorado Springs to see them. So when we learned about the cliff dwellings at Manitou Springs we got excited to go see them. We were disappointed by the small",
          "The place is small but an unique attraction to visit. A beautiful place to spend some time to learn about cliff dwellings. It is quite picturesque and is very closely located to the cave of the winds..",
          "This was interesting and educational. Enjoyed walking thru and understanding how these people lived/survived their day to day lives.",
          "Lots of history here and yes it was moved from another area to its current location in order to preserve the structure. Definitely a hands on location with a museum and exhibits that describe the native populations of the area. Even the gift shop has everything you could ask",
          "Great place to visit, full of history and learning, my daughter loved climbing the houses. About 12 dollars a person, there is a museum and a shop.",
          "Fun little excursion for families or couples or solo trip. You can walk and crawl around the cliff dwelling to see what it was like for the native American people. Very cool museum and little gift shop.",
          "The Manitou Cliff Dwellings are outstanding. I've lived in Colorado for many years but had never been here and so glad to visit it today. The ruins are in amazing shape, peserved, and you can walk through them. The cost is very reasonable and if you're in the Colorado Springs",
          "Really enjoyed the cliff dwellings. It is not a large attraction but very interesting. Nice piece of history to see and the view is not bad.",
          "Very nice cliff dwellings. Although the park is small it is an interesting piece of history. We spent about two hours exploring.",
          "Not a very large park, more of a tourist trap, but highly interesting. Super well preserved in places and a piece of history not to be missed.",
          "It doesn't take very long to go through but you can walk in and around to fully experience this piece of history. My son is 8 and he loves history so for him to be able to have that, \"hands on\" experience was exciting for him.",
          "Trailers are welcome there but only a small area to park with a trailer is available. After we parked there with a jeep and 1 ATV trailer, there was maybe room for 1 5th wheel, maybe? If we squeezed really tight and held our breath. They do have you wait a little ways back from",
          "Walk through the Anasazi dwellings. See how they lived. Walk through the museum attached. Very neat how they built into the cliffs. Doesn't take long to go through since there aren't very many of them. We got there early so it wasn't crowded.",
          "The dwellings are not huge, but it shows all the details and different solutions they used, as well as the functions of the rooms. The museum has 2 parts, interesting and informative, but you have to walk through the shop in between the museum rooms. The museum\u2019s selection is",
          "This cliff dwelling does not go on for miles, but it is marvelously preserved. Rooms were built below different levels of cliffs for living and grain storage. There is some art work on one of the walls. The Museum and Gift Shop are enormous, with terrific displays of Native",
          "We enjoyed our visit and view looking thru the ruins. I understand that these ruins were relocated and rebuilt to protect it. Good on the association for doing so.",
          "Brings you back in time and see how brilliant they were. How creative and organised they were. It's worth the trip.",
          "We always have to stop and see the Cliff Dwellings when we visit Manitou. Why, because they are so very interesting, interactive, beautiful, etc. They have so much to see and read. Both in the actual dwellings and the museum. The landscaping is full of plants that the Native",
          "Awesome historical hands on culture activity. 10 & 12 year old loved it. You can climb all through the dwellings. Super dog friendly! We were able to bring our dog with us everywhere. We spent 60-90 min without rushing not including the museum.",
          "This attraction was fun for our whole family, including 3 year old grandson. It was interesting learning how the cliff dwellers lived and how they built their homes. Bottom line, it is fun enough for young children and interesting enough for adults.",
          "This place has tourist trap written all over it. Overall, though it was small, the dwellings themselves were worth the trip since they were a short distance from our hotel. If you go, check out coupon books & websites to find coupons to save money on the price of admission. The",
          "Particular exemple of pre-Hispanic Native America similar to that of Mesa Verde. This one is more tourist driven than the aforementioned as the plece has a museum and a gifts shop.",
          "Great way to experience cliff dwelling culture with minimal investment of $ and time. Drive up and short walk to cliff!",
          "Our kids are 9 & 6 & we had to make them leave because they loved these Cliff Dwellings so much. They loved being able to go inside a piece of history & imagine what life was like for the Native Americans who lived there. The museum is also very interesting & informative.",
          "We stopped by this site for a quick visit while visiting Colorado Springs. It's a bit touristy but very interesting. The gift shop goes on and on but the actual site is amazing. You are allowed to walk in and out of the cliff dwellings and gain insight into the life of the",
          "The dwellings were relocated from the south of the state, and the museum (included in admission) tells you a LOT about their lives and history. Really fun visit, people of all ages there. Good facilities, clearly designed self-guided tour and decent gift shop. Picnic tables",
          "A TouringA must visit! This place is old history. Beautiful scenery! The gift shop has plenty of nice things you'll want to buy for gifts. The museum is great.",
          "We visited with three children ages 8-11 and spent about 1.5 hours exploring the dwellings and gift shop. The dwellings are really interesting and the signs help explain what each was used for. The information about the plants is also interesting. The gift shop is extensive",
          "It was a smaller area than I was expecting, but it was really fascinating to experience. It was crowded, so it was a quick walk through the ruins, but still well worth it. We had a 4 and a 5 year old with us and they enjoyed exploring the ruins. I thought that their gift shop",
          "Though these dwellings are relocated, they seem more like replicas. They don't seem like genuine ancient dwellings, but more like they were newly built as one would do for a recreation in a museum scene. Too many people for such a small exhibit. We had to wait a long time to",
          "My brother and I loved being able to see things from history! The museum, the dwellings, and the gift shops were all great! We drove 18 hours to Colorado from Ohio and it was well worth the drive!",
          "I love our Native American History and learning about the cultures of our past, this was an amazing experience. The views are amazing and I was surprised at how affordable pricing was. Entry for 4 \"adults\" $40, shirts and snacks $35!",
          "I find it amzing that this history was lost and now it being recognised for how native americans used to build their cliff dwelling homes centuries ago. If you are interested in the history and cultures of people this is a place to visit.",

          "Although not a large cliff dwelling site, this was still a very cool place to check out. You can go inside and crawl around the cliff dwellings. There are signs to explain what rooms were used for. My children had a great time exploring the small rooms and climbing through",
          "Some travelers may not think it worth the cost to stop to view these relocated Indian cliff dwellings (originally in McElmo Canyon) at $10 for visitors 12 and over ($7.50 for children 4 - 11), but we found the visit to be an interesting experience. You can walk through the",
          "The Manitou Cliff Dwellings site is a great place to visit and tour, especially with kids! The dwelings are easily accessible and very educational. Those who operate the facility are super nice and helpful also! This is worth your time to stop by for a tour!",
          "The Cliff dwellings are replicas. They are not very big and you can quickly go through them. I didn't care for the dwellings and for the cost, I thought it was a little pricey. Save your money and go for a hike at the Garden of the Gods or some other hike in the area.",
          "The history was amazing and going through the caves and seeing how they lived back in that era was very interesting. The kids even used the stones to pound corn or meal as a learning experience - it was fun and interesting",
          "First off, this place has the best gift shop of any attraction I've ever been to. I've been to a ton of show caves, amusement parks, museums, and others. This gift shop very easily beats them all! It is two stories, offers a hugely diverse selection of things to buy, had a",
          "We visited the Cliff Dwellings and I was so intrigued about the history. The museum was very informative and it was easy to get in and out and the staff was very friendly.",
          "Don't get me wrong the dwellings are cool and I like that you get to walk around them yourself but I was a little underwhelmed. I wrongfully assumed that Manitou Cliff Dwellings was a substantial sized dwelling place. My husband and I climbed through the dwellings which were",
          "This is a great place to take children to help them understand the native people of Colorado and their life. Nice Museum and rebuilt dwellings. Excellent for a family trip or for anyone who enjoys history.",
          "We were staying in Manitou Springs so we thought we needed to stop by. It is interesting but as it\u2019s private there\u2019s too much concrete and metal railings which detracts from the feeling of visiting a cliff dwelling such as Mesa Verde. It\u2019s also very small and the visit is done",
          "We were a group of eleven family members being sown around the area by our sister and her family who live there. We 5 siblings and two spouses came out for a family reunion to see our baby sister who lives there. This was one of our daytime outings. We climbed up to see the",
          "A quick visit that is worth your time. It\u2019s not very friendly for strollers so leave it in the car, but was a great otherwise.",
          "I have heard of this area in the past and wanted to experience it myself. It was a good taste of history and I could feel like I was actually living there. Walking the area on the self tour was good as I could spend as much time as I wanted. Could see where families might have",
          "A very small dwelling site. You walk on your own without a guide. They were very nice and well kept almost not looking very authentic. They may have been many years ago but they\u2019ve been restored very well. If you\u2019re interested in a better site check out Mesa Verde National",
          "These dwellings are absolutely amazing! As you walk through them, you almost feel as if you have traveled back in time. The museum has several items of interest and the gift shop is full of great stuff. We traveled with our dogs and were pleasantly surprised to learn not only",
          "These ruins are interesting. The nice part is that you can actually climb into the dwellings. It was a fun activity for an afternoon.",
          "The old dwellings in the stone cliff was really great to see first hand. Plaques on the walls are great at explaining how and why things were. The old Pueblo house museum however was less of a museum, and more of a gift shop with a little bit of museum.",
          "This was not interesting to my family at all. You walk through a large gift shop to get to the museum which is just ok. My teenage girls didn't think the cliff dwellings was worth it at all.",
          "We liked: 1. Self guided 2. You can climb around the dwellings 3. Views were nice 4. Large and interesting gift shop and museum 5. Free to roam around as you like 6. Gift shop personnel were very friendly 7. Pretty landscaping 8. We were there later in day so not crowded We",
          "Mostly reconstructed, not too authentic. Save your money and go further west to Arizona to get the real deal. Too expensive to get in for what you get, no one around the attraction to ask questions. However the gift shop was massive and tons of workers in there making sure it",
          "After some very long hikes in the beautiful parks of Colorado, this was a great, low-effort switch up. No hiking required other than some steps here and there which really was nice after our legs were tired but we were still excited to sight see. The dwellings are really cool",
          "Biggest attraction seemed to be the gift shop. Some of the displays in the museum were very informative about cliff dwellers, but I would not put this on a high priority list. Had two teens with us who enjoyed it but were expecting more \"hand's on\" experiences.",
          "Well the things I liked - visiting with a group of 15 this was a good stop - easy for kids and adults to move about the site on their own (we did visit early in the morning during busy holiday week so that helped); appreciate the group rate discount; our kids enjoyed being able",
          "We liked finding a coupon for this adventure. It was interesting, museum type set up with cliff houses you can walk through. Really nice gift shop. Fun to do for a few hours. Glad to have had a discounted rate!",
          "My wife and I spent a couple hours at the cliff dwellings after coming down from Pikes Peak. For someone not from the area, the museum and dwellings were interesting and the gift shop is quite large. Yes, we know the dwellings were moved here in the early 1900s, but for $10 per",
          "The resourcefulness of Our Native American ancestors, never ceases to amaze me. They were obviously smaller in stature but made the most out of what they had. Simply interesting. If you have any interest in Native American history, this place is worth a visit. Large gift shop,",
          "On a recent visit to Colorado I was at Pike\u2019s Peak and on the way back to Colorado Springs passed this Cliff Dwelling place right off of the highway and decided to stop. It is really well done. Delightful music playing and an awesome sight to see. Great way to spend an hour",
          "This was my first cliff dwelling experience and thought it was interesting but I agree with others that it feels very commercialized. The dwellings take about 10 minutes to walk through. To get to the museum you have to go through this huge gift shop. The museum has artifacts",
          "I did not realize before taking my family that these are not real. They are just cliff dwelling stones that someone relocated here in the early 1900s to make a tourist place! They took them from somewhere else and built these! They look fake. My teenage kids having seen real",
          "I had seen Anasazi cliff dwellings in Canyon de Chelly but had never walked in them because they were still in the cliffs. I asked several people before going to Manitou Cliff Dwellings if they thought it would be a commercial exploitation of Native Americans and they assured",
          "Didnt plan on stopping here, just cruising around and decided to try it. 11 a person to get in, parking is super close to the dwellings, which is so nice! We loved it here! You get to venture around and read lil signs here n there. The museum and gift shop combo was nice also",
          "My family visited the Manitou Cliff Dwellings in June 2019. We arrived just as they were opening the gate. We enjoyed being able to walk and climb through the variety of rooms that make up the cliff dwellings. It was like stepping back in time. There are many opportunities",
          "Worth the visit but very commercialized. Found the museum very interesting but you will be guided through gift shops in order to see everything which is why I rated it 3 stars. Still, all in all, we were not disappointed to drop in.",
          "Very interesting. If you have time, you should visit and learn how the original I habitants lived. Does not take a long time to see.",
          "I love history and this place is full of it. It\u2019s amazing to see how people lived used to live. How they could make these dwellings in the mountains without our modern tools is mind blowing. It was a little hot so the dwellings coolness was a welcome treat. They have great gift",
          "We visited Manitou Cliff Dwellings while visiting Colorado recently. I've seen the cliff dwellings before, but this was my first visit with my son and niece. We enjoyed climbing on the cliff dwellings and learning about the Anasazi people. The gift shop and museum are also nice.",
          "This was a pretty interesting little stop on our trip to Manitou Springs. It was definitely a neat place.",
          "This was an okay drive by. It was kind of expensive. It really just boils down to a cliff dwelling with a HUGE gift shop attached.",
          "This is a great educational experience for the whole family. You can touch the dwellings, climb on them, interact with the architecture if you will... our three year old had a great time climbing the ladder and going in and out the window of one of the dwellings. The setting is",
          "Very cool stop! Go early to avoid a long line to get into the park! Loved being able to walk right through history and the kids were interested as well. The gift shop has something for everyone!! Loved seeing interesting plants as well.",
          "Most experiences like this have you standing behind a fence. Not here. We got to walk around and through the buildings, and climb ladders to the different levels. Hands on is a much better way to capture the attention & have it be a meaningful experience.",
          "This is not a big place, but it provides a real glimpse into the lives of the people who lived here long ago. The dwellings are interesting and true works of art, engineering and architecture. Be sure to go through the museum and read about the people and how they lived. The",
          "Came here with family from out of town and received the WORST service from 2 young teenagers working the cafe. They took forever to cook a pretzel & after 10 minutes and NOT washing their hands I just gave up! Ugh.. please have competent young people who can do simple math,",
          "The museum was nice, but what really caught the boys interest was being able to touch and go through the dwellings on their own. One of my boys said it was his favorite place because unlike the other places, he was able to look at what he wanted and explore on his own.",
          "This is not as large as some in New Mexico but great for a shorter I and less climbing. It is wonderful to have it available and well maintained locally. I love history and this is a place to take kids and help them understand how great they have it!",
          "Coming to this area of Colorado I had my mind set on visiting the cliff dwellings because when I was about 5/6 years old my family took a trip to the area and this is one of the things we did! It is definitely a lot different then when I remember it and much nicer with all the",
          "Very interesting, but smaller than they appear in pictures. Great gift shop. Easy parking. Good place for photos. Good place for younger children to explore.",
          "I loved this place! It was so cool to see the history of the Native Americans in this area. Even though the actual area itself it pretty small there is so much to see. Everywhere you go there are information cards about the style of dwellings and the plants and tools that they",
          "We are a family of 6, 4 children 2-11. This was a neat stop. Fairly cheap, we traveled with a couple of other groups and took advantage of the group rate. * Self-guided tours through the dwellings * Museum - rather small, but had some really neat artifacts, skulls, and",
          "I love the fact that everyone can walk into and around the rooms of the the cliff dwellings. You experience the actual size of the dwellings and store rooms. The museum has genuine artifacts from the ancient basket maker culture. The shop has Navajo jewelry. Lovely relaxing",
          "Very cool. Worth the trip. My 7 year old love climbing in and out of all the little rooms in the dwellings.",
          "These were interesting. My son caught that the dwellings were bought, tore down, and moved to this location. That makes it lose it\u2019s authenticity. The museum is about 1-2 rooms.",
          "Very cool! It's so much fun to walk through and see the architecture of the whole place!! My son absolutley loved this!! And so did I! Very glad we decided to check this out!",
          "Easy to find, just down the road from Cave of the Winds. We enjoyed walking in and around the dwellings. Great piece of History to check out.",
          "Stopped in Manitou Springs for lunch and a walk after visiting Garden of the Gods, which was spectacular and free to park/enter. Saw the signs for the cliff dwellings and decided to visit. $21 for two adults. Once we parked, we saw the relatively small site. The positive",
          "This museum is well worth the visit. The dwellings have been solidified so you can actually walk around them and get close to them . Everything is well marked with information so you can be informed as to what each area represents and its use. There is an interesting museum that",
          "this was a must see. it was very cool. not much walking was needed and it was all self explatitory. the price was also good",
          "We didn't have this attraction on our list of things to do while we were in Colorado Springs, but the weather changed our plans. We decided to go to the cliff dwellings last minute and we were so glad that we did. It gave the kids a chance to burn some energy, explore, and learn",
          "Very small \"park\". Really impressive to see these cliff homes and what great shape they are in. Takes maybe 30 minutes to see and read everything. The gift shop was nice also.",
          "this is a very small stretch of dwellings which you can see all in 20 minutes. the gift shop was actually bigger. you can park right up to the dwellings which takes away from its natural feel in my opinion. they did have photo opps with some rescue wolves during our visit",
          "The dwellings feel unauthentic mostly because it has been owned privately and restored as a tourist attraction in the kitschiest sense of the term. Underneath the inartful \u201cimprovements\u201d and excess of handrails is the story of an ancient and fascinating people and their",
          "We chose the Cliff Dwellings as our main focus on today\u2019s time in the area. It was well worth the time. It\u2019s a short drive from the north side of the Springs to the Cliff Dwellings. The scenery in the area is amazing. We had 4 in our group including 2 adults, a 9 year old and",
          "Beautiful views of the snow across the mountains. A nice walk through what was. The museum provided information and helped to bring to life of those who came before and shaped our land.",
          "Nice 60 minute self guided tour if you are interested in Indian lore, if not don\u2019t waste your time. Really nothing to see unless you really have to. Save your $10 per person",
          "A bit spendy for what you get, we couldn\u2019t get the walking tour to work so relied on Wikipedia for the back story. But it was really cool to be able to go into the buildings, and the museum was full of interesting information. It was a perfect quick trip off the highway.",
          "I had never heard of this before. I found it extremely interesting. A little pricey for what it entails, but definitely interesting. Staff in the store was very friendly.",
          "There\u2019s great potential in this place, but the tour guides need more instruction on how to encourage and teachi kids. The cost is very reasonable. It wouldn\u2019t take much to make this a five-star outing",
          "The most important feature of the Manitou Cliff Dwellings is that it is interactive. You can go into the dwellings. Each room and section has a sign explaining how the area was used. It is evident that life in the Southwest was not easy 1000 years ago. A very good classroom",
          "Hoped to really learn some things about the original inhabitants of the cliff dwellings, and I suppose we did - that part of the visit was completed in about 15-20 minutes. The gift shop seems to take up most of the real estate here with a bit of space dedicated to a museum.",
          "If you are traveling with your dogs you have to stop here! The entire park is dog friendly! The park, museum and the gift shops! Very clean, fun and a great place to take pictures too! Also, if you\u2019re looking for a dog friendly restaurant in Manitou Springs go to Red Dog Deli",
          "As it was interesting, not sure we would return. However, some children who were there were having a blast!",
          "Very interesting place to visit. Filled with lots of history. The museum was nice. The views were absolutely amazing!",
          "The site was very affordable and they offer a military discount for entry into the park. The museum was very informative and they had a huge gift shop with a multitude of appropriate gifts and trinkets. I purchased a book that I very much enjoy. Our party took some amazing",
          "A nice little spot for a great view. Make sure too look at the mountains from inside the dwelling windows. Great for children young or old, friends and family. A must see if in the area. Great museum and unique gift shop.",
          "My sister and I decided to visit here since our parents had taken us here as young kids. The history of this place is very cool and the museum is very informative. You can even walk in and through the cliff dwellings which lets you feel part of history. However, it was about $25",
          "This is a fun sightseeing spot! Lots of history here and an awesome museum! Self guided tour but a lot of fun!",
          "We enjoyed the self-guided tour. We could move along at our own pace and the information along the way was brief but informative. Everyone in our group, ages 6 - 78, had a good time learning about these people and their way of life. The younger ones enjoyed getting to touch,",
          "I loved seeing this sight. I wish the cost was a little lower since we spent less than an hour here. It is self guided, and unless you go into the gift shop to ask questions, there is no out to answer questions aside from the informational signs around the dwellings. My teens",
          "I brought our Italian exchange student here because I wanted him to learn about Native Americans. I was expecting a more authentic experience like the Gila Cliff Dwellings my family hiked to in New Mexico. I was disappointed to find out that the Manitou dwellings were just",
          "The dwellings were very interesting, and I especially liked the information plaques along the way that can also be accessed by QR code once you buy your tickets. The museum had some intriguing artifacts including replicas of early Indian skulls. If you\u2019ve been to Mesa Verde,",
          "There\u2019s a website with an audio tour if needed. I enjoyed exploring the dwellings on my own and at my own pace. Fair warning that if you are over five feet tall you will need to duck. There is a massive three floor gift shop with plenty of trinkets from $-$$$$. The bathroom and",
          "This is not where any cliff dwellers resided. Google it first! Everything was \" rebuilt\" here, as a model from an actual site somewhere else in Colorado. Something they should really let people know before being ripped off.",
          "This was a really neat place to visit. We visited in February, so it wasn't so crowded. I can't imagine trying to crawl through everything in the summer time. I almost went last summer, but the line of cars going all the way to the highway told us that it would take hours to see",
          "Just a neat place to see. You get a chance to see how the cliff dwellers lived. It's small enough that in a couple of hours, you can be amazed and on your way.",
          "I stopped here with my daughter after visiting pikes peak. It is right down the road from piles peak. It\u2019s a really neat little place. Had it been warmer we would have stayed longer to Enjoy the beautiful views. The gift shop was a real find so much great stuff. They had",
          "To actually walk thru this dwelling and learn how it was used was so interesting. How we take so much for granted of modern conveniences and they survived with no real comforts amazes me! Interesting for both adults and kids (who can climb in and around the dwelling too). Great",
          "We found out about this place from an insert in our hotel's local info, and boy are we glad we did. From a strictly historical point of view, this is not an accurate depiction (in other words, this attraction has been moved from it's original location) of these cliff dwellers,",
          "The Cliff dwellings were really neat to learn about and see. The museum was very small compared to the gift shop and it didn\u2019t take us very long to see everything . Overall we had fun learning the Native history and would definitely recommend!",
          "It was a 45 minute stop. The cave dwellings and reading facts was interesting. I wouldnt go back a second time, but it was worth a look.",
          "It had been years since we had last visited the Cliff Dwellings. Nice gift shop with a nice variety of American Indian Art. It does cost a lot for admission, but it was worth it.",
          "- Great historical preservation - On grounds museum also very intersting - Very informative and easy to understand - A must see stop! - Extensive gift shop",
          "We had wanted to go to Mesa Verde again but did not have time. First time trip to cliff dwelling for one in our party. I thought admission was reasonable. Very enjoyable look back in history. The indian music in the background is a very nice touch. Clean. I have a",
          "This is a fun, close place to go that's like a privatized Mesa Verde. There is a cumbersome line to begin, and the admission is pretty pricey, but there is a lot to see, and it's easier to access than ruins like Mesa Verde. The ruins are reconstructions, but they are hands-on.",
          "Even though these are a replica of the real thing in Four Corners this place is Awesome. It's very cool the way you can walk around in them to experience what it was like in another time. Great for small, or large groups. Just minutes away from downtown Colorado Springs so",
          "If you're traveling with young kids its probably a good stop. Not commercial but heavy on history although the structures are largely re-constructions from early 20th century. The small museum has some very good baskets and pottery.",
          "This was a very lovely trip it was so beautiful, I took my so who was 9 then he loved it. Being able to walk in and out of the structure was what he enjoyed most that and the gift shop/visitors center.",
          "This is a hoky little (very little) tourist trap, with a pretty big gift shop. If you are into that, or have real little kids, maybe they would have fun running through some tiny re-created dwellings. My wife did buy a mug in the gift shop and my daughter bought a t-shirt.",
          "The dwellings did have some tight spaces, but well worth taking the time to explore. The museum had many neat artifacts. The gift shop had a lot of different souvenirs. The entire establishment was very sweet and pet friendly. The workers were very welcoming and caring to my two",
          "I've always wanted to see cliff dwellings. This is a nice stop since it is not far off the beaten path. They are a small sample of ruins but shouldn't be passed up. Maybe an hour spent here.",
          "I visited Mesa Verde National Park this past summer and got to visit a cliff dwelling, but we walked on the outside. At Manitou Cliff Dwellings, you get to walk inside, and that was really neat. We visited at Thanksgiving, so it wasn't crowded. My favorite part of the museum",
          "This was my second visit to the Cliff Dwellings and found that there is more museum information in the gift shop area. And the gift shop seems to go on forever... if you need local items or post cards this is a good shopping spot. The dwellings are very interesting and it\u2019s",
          "The views are amazing and it's wonderful to take a step back in time! The site may have been moved, but it does not take away from the experience at all. There are explanations along the way for what rooms were used for making it a great educational experience for the kids.",
          "We really enjoyed our visit here! I saw a few reviews complaining about the site not being the original, which we didn't even know after going through the whole exhibit, so I guess they don't highlight that part too much. Whatever though - it's cool to walk through the ruins and",
          "The entire 40 room cliff dwelling site is right next to the parking lot \u2014 there is no hiking needed to reach this amazing ancient community complex. Our visit began inside the three-story Pueblo-style building that houses the museum and gift shop. The building represents the",
          "The first thing everyone should be aware of is that this is not the original site of the dwellings. They were moved to this location. If you want something that is in situ, these cliff dwellings aren't for you. That being said, it was fun to be able to walk into the rooms and",
          "For the money paid, there really isn't that much to do or see... We walked through the dwellings, with 2 kids, and stopped and read every sign and watched every detail. It took us less than 25 minutes to go from beginning to end.... There's a museum that's pretty interesting",
          "Have visited Manitou ten times and never stopped at this attraction-a Big Mistake!! Great diversion for kids and old alike-cheap entrance and about and hour of your time on the dwellings (you get to walk in and around them) and about a half hour for the Gift Shop (it was",
          "The Manitou Cliff Dwellings in Manitou Springs, Colorado, near Colorado Springs, are comprised of ancient Anasazi ruins that date back 800 to 1,000 years. That fact alone makes this an interesting attraction for anyone with a mind for history and a desire to learn about Native",
          "Tourist trap and rip-off are the first words that come to mind. The cliff dwellings are not original, they were stolen from their original location somewhere in the Four Corners area and rebuilt here. No respect for the people who built them or their descendants. You basically",
          "There are a few different things to do/see here. You can go through the actual cliff dwellings, visit 2 museums in the adjacent Pueblo, and visit the gift shop. This place would be great for a school field trip if you are located near Colorado Springs...there is a lot of",
          "This place is very interesting. I love learning about the Indian culture. They are so interesting. You can explore the dwellings. There is a cafe and a museum there. Would go again",
          "the historical buildings are really interesting, especially if you enjoy history and culture. You are able to get up close to the buildings and touch them.",
          "We were lucky to be the first visitors in the morning, and for a while we could browse and explore on our own. We appreciated the accessibility and permissiveness of this site, compared to Mesa Verde and Taos. Of course, we realised that this dwelling was reconstructed on this",
          "My wife and I found the Cliff Dwellings to be very interesting. Although this is not the original site of the dwellings, you wouldn't know it if they didn't tell you that. I, for one, enjoyed seeing these structures that had been moved many many years ago as I don't know if I'll",
          "This little gem of a spot was well worth the stop. The outdoor restored cliff dwellings are accessible for families of all ages. Near the dwellings is a pueblo building first constructed in 1898 that contains both the museum and gift shop, which flowed into each other. I think",
          "We jusr moved to area, and wanted to check this out. For $21. For both of us plus tax. There wasnt much to it really. Expecting,some,trails and such. Found out it was moved from southern location and put back together. Gift shop is nice, but overall price to high for what it is.",
          "We didn\u2019t have a lot of time to spend climbing and walking around, so these were a perfect size. There is a self guided tour through the different dwellings. Many explanation cards along the way describe what you\u2019re seeing and the history. The gift shop is another dwelling",
          "Stepping out of the car I was filled with an incredible spiritual feeling that continued the entire time we where there. The music playing in the background while walking through the dwellings was just a feeling like no other. They have a couple of museums you can walk through",
          "Interesting information on these Dwellings. Glad we were able to work this in on our trip. Old photos in the welcome center are nice to look at.",
          "It was interesting to see and learn about. Not a high cost but I wouldn\u2019t have paid any more. It took me about 30 min to tour without a trip to the gift shop. Was not as \u201coriginal\u201d of a dwelling as I expected. Was preserved well, but it looked like just that - well",
          "We visited the dwellings yesterday and enjoyed the visit. Take the time to read the history posted along the caves.",
          "Interesting view of Indian homes and life in the rocks. Interesting info on medicinal plant uses. It's fun for children to walk through and nice to be allowed to touch the rocks/homes. It doesn't take very long and not a large amount to see. But if you like history and info on",
          "Enjoyed walking through the dwellings and was amazed at the architecture. I realized that the structures have been restored and modified but it was amazing to be able to enter and see them up close.",
          "Not worth the money. I wish I would have trusted the reviews on this one. We stayed here maybe 30 min. It took maybe 10 to walk through he dwellings and it would have been faster if there weren\u2019t people in my way. It was nothing like I expected. It\u2019s literally just what\u2019s in",
          "This is a must see for anyone that is interested in history of any kind but especially American Indian. It\u2019s beautifully preserved, and you can walk through it. There is also a large gift shop and museum that is also a historic adobe home. It\u2019s not real large and you can get up",
          "Such a unique experience! Loved walking through these ruins and learning about these ancient people! If you have a QR reading app they offer a virtual tour using the qr code that you are given when you enter the park. There are also signs in the dwellings that offer great",
          "The visit included myself and my 4 grandkids (ages 4-12), and unfortunately, they were bored and not impressed. No comparison to a Mesa Verde tour, seemed unbelievable as ruins. Gift shop was on many different levels and confined, staff was not up front, friendly or helpful",
          "I think it's a good place to go to and there was some history behind it and it was very informative. I would definitely recommend it.",
          "Unfortunately, most of the ruins have been rebuilt due to or refinished due to past damage. It was however very informative and had nice artifacts.",
          "I used my phone to access the self guided tour. It was informative and interesting, but without the voice recording the tour loses something. I highly suggest having a fully charged phone (maybe with headphones too!) and figure out how to access the tour before arriving as",
          "This is a place you can say you have been if you come to visit or live in Colorado Springs area. It is really neat, but I was actually expecting to see more. The gift shop has nice items, but get out the credit card in order to finance some of the pieces. I didn't feel like",
          "This is definatly a great place to visit and learn about the native people of Colorado. There are many displays and artifacts to see and they even have free fudge with additional purchase.",
          "You can go inside some of the cliff dwellings. Beautiful views from the valley below. You can see why they lived there. Nice gift shop. They play Indian flute music over the loud speakers. So relaxing and beautiful. If you like Indian ruins you will like this place.",
          "The Cliff Dwelling is a nice place. It is not a large place. If you were there with a school group it would be easily crowded. The museum was nice and folks were friendly. There are snacks and things to purchase. Glad we went, but it is small.",
          "I went here with a bunch of my friends. It\u2019s only an hour away from Denver. To enter, you have to pay $10/adult. Big Parking spaces but small exhibits or Museum. But you can see the ancient artifacts and learn about the Indian Civilization here in Manitou Springs. And they do",
          "The exhibit consists of actual cliff dwellings that have been moved from another location. Therefore, the exhibit is very authentic. Each section of the exhibit has information posted on how that particular section was used. The museum was also very informative. Takes about",
          "Beautiful spot and very interesting learning how the Native Americans lived and worked. I did feel it was a little too touristy with an expansive gift shop that seemed to be the focal point of the preserve. However, it is still well worth a visit to learn of the Native American",
          "This was built in 1904 as a representation and museum. stones are relocated from other dwellings to build this replica.The museum had lots of priceless artifacts though and was interesting. At the gate, we asked how handicapped friendly, and told it was only 20 rooms, not much,",
          "I'm always on the look-out for things that people with physical limitations can fully enjoy, and this place fit the bill for me. That may not be the case for everyone...there were a few moderately tight squeezes and some ups and downs to get around the place, but on a",
          "I loved this place, not crowded but really informative. Good prices. Very nice museum. Handicapped accessible.",
          "We had never seen anything like this until now. It is amazing how this place was constructed. It is well worth the few $ to spend a hour checking this place out.",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed seeing this place. Not only was it amazing to see the dwellings, there was also and really great gift shop. It was a very scenic and interesting.",
          "The cliff dwellings were very interesting. I used my app on my phone that explained and walked me through the dwellings in great detail. Would recommend for older people and middle school age kids. Young children would not understand the history.",
          "As we were looking for things to do with our grandchildren we decided to include the Cliff Dwellings. Definitely a hit. It was very well maintained and extremely educational. It definitely gave you good insight into how early native Americans lived. It is definitely something",
          "It was an interesting visit, but the site was a bit over restored. The old photos where much more interesting than the actual dwellings.",
          "Whether it is worth the money to get in or not is your call. The dwellings are recreations, but seem accurate. The museum is small but packed with information about the cliff dwellers. The gift shop is , well a gift shop. I would go again.",
          "For $10 or so, this is an excellent 1 hour stop and see. Cliff dwellings have been meticulously transplanted here over 100 years ago giving one an easy, accessible chance to view and walk through real cliff dwellings without the long trek to Mesa Verde and the challenging hiking",
          "You can see the recreated dwellings and all other exhibits in a half hour easily. They are interesting and informative, but there just isn't much to this small attraction. If you have extra time it is a decent stop, but don't omit some other local attraction to get here.",
          "Not really what I was expecting. I understand the historic need to preserve this area and it was interesting walking though. If it wasn't for the wolf encounter, I would have just driven by again without stopping. Go for the history, leave knowing it's not the best thing in",
          "This is a good place to show kids how the ancient cliff dwellers lived before 1200 AD.Unlike a visit to Mesa Verde where you are discouraged from touching walls and many old structures can no longer be entered because of the need to preserve them, this place is different. These",
          "I give them credit for being honest about it - there is a display in the \"Museum\"/gift shop that talks about the history of the site and how the dwellings were moved from the Mesa Verde area to Colorado Springs around 1900. But if you miss that sign,you end up thinking the",
          "The Manitou Cliff Dwellings have been around for a very long time, and are unprecedented. Although not enormous in scope, they are the largest such cliff dwellings to be found. I was very surprised that we were allowed to walk everywhere, as this place is very, very old, and",
          "The cliff dwellings were good and the museum was okay. For the price of 10 dollars a person, I thought I would see more than just a huge gift shop. Honestly the gift shop was biggest thing there.",
          "Family activity of reconstructed Anzi cliff dwelling. Expensive for entry and gifts but educational. No military discount but do have large group and senior discounts. An educational activity and even children seem to like. Good photo opportunity.",
          "We found this attraction easy to find parking and to access the dwellings themselves. These dwellings are are very good condition. If you have been to Mesa Verde, there is only 1 dwelling here to walk through and explore. There is also the museum and gift shop. We found the",
          "They don't have a lot to work with, which is fine and I understand but it's just not worth your time or money. If you've seen the photos you've literally seen all there is to see. Little kids can climb around its, which is novel, but less fun than any of the dozens of parks",
          "This was a neat spot. My four year old loved being able to climb around and explore. Having almost no restrictions in the cliff dwellings themselves was so fun. The self-guided tour posters with info were great for the adults. The museum is 90% gift shop but what was there was",
          "I missed this place in a previous trip to Colorado Springs, so it was on my list to do this time. So glad we did! Great for the kids and us parents to look back in time and into Native American culture. You are able to explore and touch everything! I do wish it was more",
          "The place was neat to look though and read the information shared by the signs It is pretty amazing the ability people had to make a home before our modern day carpentry skills. Interesting fact all over to make you stop and think. I to agree with many that is was a good history",
          "My family and I visited Colorado Springs and did this tour one afternoon. My kids really enjoyed exploring the cave dwellings. Your ticket(s) are good for 24-hours, so if there's bad weather that comes in or you have to leave because of a fussy kiddo, you can still return within",
          "Good history of the Indians that occupied the area. Felt it was overpriced for our visit. Would not return.",
          "If you are in Colorado Springs and enjoy history, you MUST see this place. We were there as the gates opened and so the place was not very full of people. Very fascinating historical site. We were there 2 hours and could have spent a lot more time there. To see the actual",
          "This was neat. My teenagers enjoyed exploring the village. Really nice gift shop and an adobe/museum close by.",
          "I have always wanted to visit a cliff dwelling, and this is a very well preserved dwelling to tour. It was very interesting to see the design and to actually walk in and around, and have to crouch down at times, through the dwelling. Do need to take turns, 2 people at a time,",
          "The cliff dwellings are very interesting and give a good picture of ancoent Native Ameican life. Walk the dwellings! The museum is okay.",
          "Overall a neat experience. Drove up to the entrance gate to pay. I thought entrance fees were satisfactory; however, I was offered my military discount, so huge plus! Parking is limited, so go early. Long drive, first stop - the bathroom!! Immediately we were drawn to the cute",
          "My family liked looking around in Dwellings. they were very cool to look in and go through. My only complaint is that there was not much to see for the price of going in. Not sure we would go again and see them.",
          "Interesting place to visit - self guided tour thru the dwellings. Took longer to get through the gift shop than thru the attraction. Probably one of the cheaper things we did for our vacation but it is over-priced for what you get.",
          "Very interesting tour. We really enjoyed it. You can even listen to a self guided tour on your phone if you don't want to read all the plaques. (I liked that) I would suggest a visit!",
          "It wasn\u2019t worth the price and after taking a poll from two adults and three teenagers at the end of our CO vacation this attraction came in last place of the many we did over 10 days. It\u2019s very small, museum boring and gift store all the same old stuff. Lucky if you spend an",
          "The dwellings are a nice and well maintained part of history. Kids enjoyed walking through them but this really is a 1hr activity. Considering how much they charge for entrance, I felt it was a bit overpriced.",
          "There really is not much to look at here. It is not worth the price of admission. We spent about 20 minutes walking around and then left.",
          "This was a beautiful place set right near Pikes Peak and Colorado Springs. To see how the native Americans lived is quite an experience. You actually have to see this to believe it. How they did this with just their own hands and hand made tools is nothing short of amazing.",
          "Not really my thing, but I'm glad we visited for the education and experience. My husband thought it was really cool. The kids said it was so so. Our 10 and 8 year old liked climbing through the dwellings. Wasn't really our 14yr olds thing either.",
          "my partner and I visited this attraction while on a road trip. next to the cliff dwellings is the pueblo, a three storey building that houses Anasazi museum, featuring displays of southwestern artifacts. it really is an historic treasure. preserved under a red sand stone,built",
          "This was one of my favorite stops during my Colorado Springs vacation. Being able to go inside actual Indian cave dwellings was a unique experience. I appreciated the plaques on each dwelling telling guests what the building was and details about it. I highly recommend taking",
          "We spent approx 2 hours here checking everything out. The kids enjoyed the Cliff dwellings and the gift shop is ginormous. If you have school age children, it may be helpful to brief the kids on what they will be seeing, there are a lot of informational plaques. The place is",
          "My family went to visit the Cliff Dwellings. You can actually walk into the rooms in the rock face and see how people lived. A large History museum and gift store is located on the property. A fun and interesting place to tour. Worth a couple of hours visit.",
          "A fun way to take a sneak peek at Cliff Dwelling without the hike. Our kids love running in and out of them and making believe they are transported into the past. The view is unbelievable and we have seen beautiful birds and a black footed fox in the parking lot. Far enough",
          "probably the northern most anazasi cliff dwillings. at most there were only maybe8 families there by the size of the buildings. very good reconstruction and restoration of the buildings. however some of the labels in the muesem are erroneaous?9 one states the basket maker had",
          "This was an amazing place to visit. We have been here before. You can walk around the buildings. They have plants with medicinal purposes that the old Pueblo people use to use. Very easy to get to from the interstate. Very well kept and the guide was awesome. So glad we were",
          "We were on a family vacation with 3 teens. We found it an interesting stop. The gift shop and museum combination was confusing. A tour guy would have been nice too. The kids did enjoy the hands on nature of the cave dwellings and it was an unique experience. Admission",
          "Such a bonus to find a well preserved site with insights into the people and history of this region. So worth visiting if in the area.",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the cliff dwellings. It was nice to be able to walk through and experience them. It was very busy for our mid-week visit, which made it hard to really read much info about the dwellings. The gift shop was nice- lots of options, as well as inexpensive",
          "these do not begin to compare. Whereas they are authentic, so much has been added for affect that I would actually call them touristy. Sad to say...",
          "So glad m family got to go here. My kids learned so much and had a great time. Well worth your time to go if you ever get the opportunity",
          "We visited with our 15 and 11 year old. The 15 year old was interested in reading the signs and learning about the ruins, the 11 year old, not so much. However, he still enjoyed it and thought it was interesting.",
          "So this place is pretty cool when you visit it until you find out that these cliff dwellings were brought in and placed into the cliffs. This isn't the dwellings' original residence. Still, there is a lot of information for those who want to learn.",
          "If you love history and travel, to love this place. My wife said it was best part of her trip. We were in Colorado Springs for an event and decided to check out Pikes Pike. On the way we saw signs for Old Colorado Springs, Garden of the Gods, Manitou Springs and the Cliff",
          "We found the price for three adults and two children to be way too much for what there is to see. In all honestly, the world TOURIST TRAP comes to mind. We tried to avoid places like this, but we were in Manitou and decided to give it a try. Do not bother if you come to this",
          "The cliff dwellings are nice, but not worth the price of $10 per person. (There is an entry gate that stops traffic so you pay as you drive in). My family of four visited the cliff dwellings in the afternoon. There is a very small \"museum\" with some artifacts that is about 90%",
          "Even though there are re creations of actually homes, it is done really well. Signs are informative and so cool to step inside and back in history! Well wirth admission price.",
          "We really enjoyed the Cliff dwellings. We had our 11 year old Grandson and he enjoyed it also. We enjoyed walking through the dwellings along with the narration on provided. Very interesting to read.",
          "Focus not on history but on merchandising so disappointing after entry fee of $10 each! Did have ice cold beverages but gift shop a traffic jam",
          "So nice to be able to get up close and see the expertise of the builders. Wish there had been a guide, but the pamphlet was just fine.",
          "I had researched the Cliff Dwellings as a stop for our family while recently in the area on vacation. My daughters loved being able to play/explore the cliff dwellings and the plaques describing all of the different variations of family homes the American Indians lived in was",
          "This was a interesting find for a family. You can walk through the dwellings and the small museum. If you are interested in American Indians this would be cool to visit. Found the price to enter a little on the pricy side, but we enjoyed it.",
          "This was a kind of short little excursion for us, but very educational. Can easily see all of the displays in under 90 min.",
          "we enjoyed looking at the cliff dwellings, going inside them and walking around. Pretty neat to see how they built into the cliffs and the rooms, doorways and inside spaces",
          "We love historical places. We always incorporate tours of various historical sites into our vacation . We were deeply disappointed in this attraction. We visited based on good reviews. It is $10 per person plus tax. Children were $7.50. This fee is way too much for what",
          "We spent about an hour at the cliff dwellings. Easy to navigate. You can actually walk through the buildings with interesting facts displayed in each room. Good gift shop. There are coupons so use them.",
          "I love seeing how people lived in the past and this showed how these Native American lived. There is also a museum with everything from pottery to skulls. Beautiful gift shop. We went on a sunny afternoon--inside the dwellings was nice and cool. There is a tour that you can",
          "My 19 year old and 13 year old daughters were not sure about this place. When we got there and they could go inside and all around the dwellings, they loved it. After looking around and climbing all over the dwellings, they even wanted to go into the museum to read about it and",
          "This is very close to Garden of the Gods and makes a great 1 day venture. We enjoy looking around the ruins and had fun doing it. Price for the admission is good.",
          "I thought the cliff dwellings were interesting but thought the entrance fee was over priced. It doesn't take long to go though and the gift shop was big and over priced as well. This was our first time in Colorado Springs and glad we saw the cliff dwellings, but probably won't",
          "This was on our list because our kids learned about cliff dwellers this year however this felt too touristy. The Dwellings were interesting and it was cool to climb Stubbs in them. However parking was a nightmare and the gift shop seemed to be a huge emphasis. It was pricey for",
          "We had a good time seeing the cliff dwellings and museum! Could see everything within an hour. The kids enjoyed trying to climb into the various rooms, worth the stop, pikes peak and Colorado Springs nearby.",
          "History is the key to this attraction. It is very interesting to see these renovated dwellings. But it won't take more than 15-20 minutes to walk through them. There is a big gift shop with a small museum portion in the basement. This would be best paired with the Cave of the",
          "Our family of seven thoroughly enjoyed walking through the dwellings. The temperature was cooler inside. It was almost like recess at an elementary with all the kids running through the exhibit. The museum was interesting along with the gift shop.",
          "If you are spending time on the Front Range and don't have much time to spend driving around Colorado to see the sights, I guess a visit to the Manitou Cliff Dwellings is an okay way to spend an hour or two. They're even interesting in a way. But it needs to be said, these cliff",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to the dwellings! They are interesting to explore! It was a great photo opp. for our vacation! Beautiful area & great museum. They had tables of shirts outside that were very cute & the best prices around! We got a bunch there.",
          "I hadn't been here since I was a little kid. Even as an adult it was fun to look though the museum and see all the cliff dwellings. You can spend up to 2 hours here before you've seen everything and are out of things to do. I wouldn't come here often but once every 20 years",
          "Interesting to walk through, but doesn't take very long to cover it all. Might not be best for young children since they might get bored in the museum.",
          "You actually walk through the Native American ruins. Its self guided & well documented. The gift shop serves as additional museum space",
          "Visited the cliff dwellings during our stay in Manitou Springs. It was fun to walk through and explore with lots of signs to explain what different areas of the dwellings were used for. The museum exhibits in the building were nice as well. They have an expansive gift shop",
          "Glad we went. Easy to do self guided tour with numbered information signs. Online QR code said the same thing as the numbered signs. Would be good if crowded and couldn't get close to signs but we just read the signs. Spent about an hour. 8.50 senior discount. Nice museum",
          "This attraction is not an actual Cliff dwelling. But it is a nice little playground to show children some of the history of the native people. It\u2019s interactive so you were allowed to go inside the cliff dwelling, in and around and up. But it is not an actual cliff dwelling,",
          "See and learn about where native Americans lived in the side of the mountain. Very cool dwellings with lots of information to tell you about things. Has a very nice gift shop with lots of local handmade items. Discount tickets online if you look",
          "We were disappointed with the cliff dwellings- their size and the concrete stairs and handrails that took away from the authenticity. It probably was perfect for families with small children, but disappointing for older kids who wanted to climb. For us- a carload of 5- it was",
          "Neat history lesson. The dwellings are really interesting. There is a lot of information to read in the Pueblo.",
          "My Inlaws (both early 70\u2019s), myself, and children (11,8)spent a weekday afternoon here. It was busy but not overly crowded. They offer both Senior and Military discounts if that applies to your group. My son (8) could have stayed for hours exploring the dwellings. He enjoyed",
          "Stopped at the cliffs dwellings for a few hours. Interesting history. Kids had fun climbing through the dwellings. Easy stop without excessive hiking, which the kids were a fan of. Pleasant stroll for fudge through the visitor center also. Worth one time stop.",
          "My husband and I stopped off here after a morning of hiking at Garden of the Gods. Not a bad admission fee. We liked that it was a self-guided tour. We didn\u2019t do this, but they offer an audio tour via QR codes. Perfect to visit in the summer, as temps inside the dwellings are",
          "Interesting to stop and see. You are allowed to get up close and explore the dwellings. Neat artifacts are also on display. Neat stop when in the area.",
          "We toured the dwellings at the end of May and enjoyed the self tour and museum. Much to learn but if you wanted to just explore you can do so quickly. Perfect for our group of grandparents, parents, teens and tweens.",
          "I was very excited to visit this place. It is small but very interesting. Reasonably priced and great gift store with locally made items.",
          "Considering that the creator disassembled cliff dwellings and reconstructed them hundreds of miles from the original, this is a remarkable display of early Puebloans. Good gift shop. Not a good assortment of foods.",
          "This was amazing! I have always heard of things like this but didn't really know that I could ever experience it. I would recommend that everyone who can, get to know how people lived in different cultures and times. These are so well preserved and set on the backdrop of the",
          "This was a wonderful learning experience for the adults as well as the children. The best part of the experience was the fact that the children could walk through and interact with the buildings, see what the rooms look like, and have a hands on experience. Although the",
          "This is one of the easiest ways to see cliff dwellings up close and personal. There are others of greater size, and in their historic location, but this lets everyone -- including kids and the less mobile among us -- get a reasonable view, at your own pace, and without traveling",
          "Nice look at housing of a bygone peoples. Able to walk around and get multiple angles of the dwellings. Nice size gift shop and inside more history.",
          "Not really worth it. Pretty much a let down. They do offer mil discount. Its seamed kind of tourist trapish to me.",
          "Me and my dog went here. It was cool to learn about the culture and get to walk in the dwellings. Parking is right next to the dwellings and a gift shop is available with bathrooms as well",
          "Not a lot to see as regards the cave dwellings. Nice museum and huge gift shop. $10 a head was stretching it. But if you have a spare hour...",
          "Good day spent with the fam! Learning about the settlers, and seeing artifacts brought me to a centered place. The dwellings in the cliff left us in amazement. Fun times!!",
          "This dwelling place was extremely interesting to go to. We almost didn't, based off some reviews, but we must remember that this was not built for our amusement. This is a great historical site to respect and to learn from and provides a good amount of education regarding these",
          "This museum is small but interesting. The cliff dwellings are not extensive but they do demonstrate the way of life of their inhabitants, the museum exhibits are part of a large gift shop, you view some exhibits then you have to walk through part of the shop to see more.",
          "Manitou Cliff Dwellings was a neat place to visit, but was rather small. Our stay was short lasting roughly an hour. If you're looking for something to waste a bit of time, then this is a good \"extra\" to add to your trip.",
          "This dwelling site is rather small and a bit boring. The gift shop was huge with the museum spattered throughout. Felt like I paid $21 (2 adults) to go shopping.",
          "We made a pit stop here, completely unplanned. Parking is limited but we didn\u2019t have any issues finding a spot. The cliff dwellings can be seen in a short amount of time because they are not extensive and easily accessible from the parking are, which makes it easy to see them.",
          "The Manitou Cliff Dwellings were very interesting. You could actually walk inside of them and view the world outside through the window openings. Well worth your time. The weather was perfect. The museum had a wonderful assortment of artifacts.",
          "It was amazing to see how the ancients built house and communities in the cliffs. It was amazing being able to walk through the buildings and see how ancient Indians once lived. Was well worth time spent at the location.",
          "Interesting from a cultural and historic perspective, this attraction it well worth a visit. It will only take an hour or so. The place is very clean and well looked after. Staff were friendly. Museum was very informative.",
          "This historical site is amazing! You should definitely take the time to visit and there\u2019s not a lot of hiking/walking like most of the other sites in Manitou Springs/Colorado Springs",
          "Great day trip to visit with your spouse, and just enjoy history. took fantastic pics. close in to town. great gift shop.",
          "I visited the Cliff Dwellings with my son and I absolutely loved it. This is a great place for families and friends of all ages.",
          "Manitou Cliff Dwellings is a cool spot to visit. I enjoyed walking through the dwellings. They are neat to see and the site is beautiful. It\u2019s a nice stop that just takes a little time but is worth visiting. The gift shop is nice with plenty of souvenirs.",
          "I loved the sleuth of information and details that were presented on what possibly happened. Most things on display were from out of state. I had a sense they didn't know much about the original occupants...hence 3 stars.",
          "This isn't the original site, which was located near Mesa Verde. The site itself is fairly small and shouldn't take more than 30 minutes for a visit. It's also only a 5 minute drive from Garden of the Gods, and on the way to Pikes Peak.",
          "A quirky little place with interesting cliff dwellings (moved from their original location about 100 years ago and reassembled here with cement instead of mortar, so you can walk/crawl around and through them), featuring information placards throughout with some interesting",
          "The cliff dwellings are interesting and educational. Saw a bat while we were there. They moved these from the actual cliff dwellings that are located in the SW part of CO around 1907. Kids can climb in them and etc, which you can't do in the other one. Take about 10 min to",
          "I enjoyed the peaceful surroundings and the opportunity to go into the dwellings. It is so much more meaningful to be able to walk and climb through the same places as the Native Americans years ago. The signs provided pertinent information which was all new to me. Also the",
          "We went with some folks that have never been to cliff dwellings...they loved it. We felt ripped off. Small REPRODUCTION of Native American Cliff Dwellings. Most of the place is a gift shop. Some (some...not a lot) real museum quality items on display....but, you have to",
          "Something different the shops have a lot to choose and the museum it\u2019s nice a lot of educational from the natives.",
          "This was the fastest $38 I've ever spent. We soon discovered the \"authentic\" cliff dwellings are kind of / sort of / maybe / really stretching it... \"authentic\". I would have been more happy for them to just claim it as a replica with some old ruins. You can visit the cliff",
          "Only needed 10min to go through the dwellings and the one room \u201cmuseum.\u201d The museum was mostly a collection of dishes, and all-in-all it was a waste of $10 (per person!) and time.",
          "Checked out this place while in colorado. Absolutely love that they have preserved this area. It's not like an amusement park, it's relaxing and a good place to reflect back on the past times. Staff was nice and very knowledgeable. This is a must see if you're in the area.",
          "We visited the dwellings on a beautiful weekend in the off - season. Not overcrowded, and SO much fun! Our group of 7 included 4 kids from ages 2 - 8 and all had a great time. There is a lot of rich history that you can read up on as you walk through the dwellings and museum,",
          "Spent a couple of hours exploring inside and out. Fun to imagine living in the caves. while inside had many exhibits of local Indian art and lifestyles.",
          "We had a very nice informative visit. It's not that expensive to get in and you can spend as much time as you want. We will probably go back during the summer.",
          "This place was very tiny and should be free to the public. Your already going to be spending a lot at there over price gift shop. But then again, gift shop are usually overprice everywhere. However, we had a very friendly elderly lady ego was very nice who live engaging with her",
          "Visited on a Sunday morning early with two under 2 year olds. It was a crisp but sunny day and glad we rapped up as it\u2019s pretty windy up there. The dwellings are very impressive and there are some interesting facts (there could be a few more in my opinion). It doesn\u2019t take very",
          "It was cool to see the relocated/rebuilt/replica cliff dwellings. The \"museum\" is a joke though. It's basically a giant gift shop with a couple of small hallways with some artifacts. My mother-in-law enjoyed it and we took some good pictures of the dwellings.",
          "Its a fun replica (google it).. nice viewing area of cliff dwellings. Again, its not original but hey its got a great price. the gift shop is massive 3 levels. the price for items in there are great!",
          "Great experience and great gift shop! I have been here several times. The dwelling were unique, well keep, and accessible. The gift shop had unique gifts that were high quality and the museum was amazing!",
          "I visited here alone after having been to the Garden of the Gods. It was only a matter of miles away. There is a $10 fee to enter - I think this is per car, but I can't recall exactly. Once I was at the dwellings, they were wonderful. You can walk right through them, read about",
          "My husband and I stopped to see these cliff dwellings and enjoyed crawling in and around the site pointing out the cement spots. The museum was interesting and the gift shop was huge. Guess you know what is valued the most.",
          "This is a small but interesting site of cliff dwellings. It takes about an hour to see the whole thing. Theres a museum and interpretive center showing how the pueblo Indians lived. Plus a gift shop, of course",
          "I knew these were built as replicas of actual cliff dwellings in another part of the state. Having visited Mesa Verde and sharing that experience with my daughter, I wanted her to see for herself what that life would have been like. It is not similar to what I toured at Mesa",
          "We have been to the four corners area so thought this would be a neat stop. Prior to entering, we felt's there was something oddly off about this place. It was a little too polished. While they don't really come out an say it, these cliff dwellings are the not the real deal -",
          "I though it was a cool place to see stuff from the past. I think I could handel a vacation home in the rocks.",
          "We took our two granddaughters to see the Manitou Cliff Dwellings. We had a coupon, which made the trip affordable. Check out Groupon or Living Social. The girls really enjoyed climbing in and out of the dwellings, and there were plenty of photo opportunities. The gift shop is a",
          "This was a nice historical place to visit. We went here after The Garden of the Gods. It was a little hard crossing the hwy.",
          "Very inspiring, too imagine these were built so many years ago without the tools & knowledge available today.",
          "Was driving down the road with my wife when we saw the sign for this attraction. We were on an adventure so in we went. Weweren't sure of what we were really going to see, but we went. The ruins are easy to explore and very accessible. The museum parts of the complex are",
          "Very small part of the ruins were available to view, only a couple dwellings. Tons of people. Expensive for what was offered. The best thing about this was the beautiful baskets in the museum at the gift shop. Do not miss this chance to see amazing Ute Native American artifacts.",
          "Very interesting to see and learn about that part of history. I think a guided tour could have been helpfull. Looks much smaller than mesa verde but closer to Colorado Springs. Price was ok.",
          "We found the staff to be rude when giving tours. They did not respect our time there and did not consider any of the cultural differences we had. The buildings were moved from another archaeological site which was kind of upsetting to know they stole another culture's history.",
          "Very close to Cave of the Winds so a combined visit and then a stop in downtown Manitou Springs would give you a nice day. The dwelling is interesting as is the museum. The tax on admission is ridiculous.",
          "interesting but not worth the $10 per adult. i think per car would be good and fair . It cost me $80 for 8 of us. we stayed all of one hour",
          "We found this to be an interesting tourist attraction, although rather expensive for what there was to see. Car parking was challenging too, with limited spaces. However, the history and heritage was fascinating and well worth a short stopover of an hour or so.",
          "This is kind of a tacky tourist trap. It is merely a museum and is rather small. Not much to do or see. There is a small section of rock that is carved out and restored to show how natives once lived. There are signs that describe the history and lifestyle of the natives. And",
          "It was so interesting and educational to see the actual cliff dwellings and to see how the Indians lived in such small, tight quarters. The museum is also very informative. Definitely worth seeing!",
          "The buildings where transported from the Mesa Verde to their current location and reconstructed in the early 20th century and are in private ownership. They have been a tourist attraction since around 1907. Very interesting to see the way of life of the Anasazi, including the",
          "I've visited several times over the years and I enjoy the peace and tranquility every time I go. During tourist season, they have Indian dance demonstrations and talks. It's a self guided tour, so take your time. The gift shop has a wonderful selection of Indian themed items of",
          "Manitou Cliff Dwellings would be much more interesting if the dwellings were actually real. In fact, they're 20th century recreations. Kids will have a great time running and climbing among the different dwellings. Make sure you check out the museum with its extensive",
          "The museum and the cliff dwellings are definitely nice. The place is overpriced when you factor in how small the place is and the short amount of time you'll spend there. I would not recommend this unless you're short on time and can't travel out farther to see more natural",
          "A small place - just one 'house' to go through but it IS interesting to see how Indians lived back then. It's interesting how they knew to build/erect their housing with fire pits, ventilation and even storage space. We wanted to go to Mesa Verde where they have the original",
          "Obviously historical and very interesting to visit. Wonderful for all especially children who are interested in history.",
          "this is a very nice facility to visualize living conditions. in addition there are plants which were used by natives to cook food. the best part is that you can buy some of the original food in the museum store",
          "First, I love anything historical and especially related to Native American history. While the Cliff dwellings are not originally from this area, they were moved to ensure their survival after being vandalized in their original location. I spent about an hour walking through",
          "Fun side trip for a Colorado Springs vacation. Does cost to get in. Well preserved site. Easy access for people with mobility problems.",
          "was chilly in Oct. but still worth the visit. was cool how you could crawl through and see all the rooms and how sparse and cold they would have been. to imagine they hard life they had. well kept property and dwellings, staff pleasant",
          "The cliff dwellings were neat, but they do not advertise that the structures were relocated from the four corners area. I guess it's not that important but I feel like it would have been more honest to disclose that. The history behind them was neat but I felt like it was",
          "We were looking for something quick to do our first day in manitou springs so decided to check this place out. It costs $10 per person to enter, lots of parking. It is privately owned so the money goes into operations & profit. Nothing mentioned about it returning to the people",
          "The Manitou Cliff Dwellings is a great half day activity. The historical information is interesting and was liked by both teenagers and younger kids. The site is beautifully restored and shows multiple types of Native dwellings.",
          "Interesting history and up close look at the way ancient people lived. It doesn't take long to go through the dwellings and the museum. Beautiful views of the surrounding area.",
          "These relocated and restored dwellings are one of the best ways that one can view how the Anasazi natives lived, for many people. Though Mesa Verde's authentic dwellings are in the actual location where they lived, I think that the Manitou site is more appropriate for children",
          "This was cool. I guess I had much higher expectations but the place is pretty good and my daughter loved it. It seemed a little contrived and not very authentic from my POV. We spent a little less than an hour here, and hit everything in the place. I am glad I spent some",
          "We were looking at the buildings up close and noticed concrete holding the rocks together. We asked about it and they said that they found all of this about 30 miles away and brought it to this location and reconstructed it with concrete. Hunters were destroying it around 1900",
          "Very informative and great place for kids to learn a bit of history. Lots to see in gift shops and different locally made gifts",
          "We stopped here on our way out of town. There is a $10 charge per person to enter but it's very interesting and well kept. You can actually walk and climb through the dwellings which is cool and educational. The museum is informative and interesting as well. It's a beautiful",
          "Not a large place but still very interesting and educational. The self-guided tour can be accessed via your Smartphone. Very well-maintained and with a wonderful gift shop. Very nice way to spend a morning.",
          "This is an excellent example of Native American culture and architecture. The cliff dwellings are interesting but not extensive. There is some steep climbs and awkward stairs. The gift shop and museum are very interesting. I feel it was worth the entrance fee.",
          "We visited here on our way back from Pikes peak at evening. It's a small place, can be done in 30 mins - but I suggest to take more time and relax. Soak up the history and try to imagine how life was back then! Check out the store to buy any gifts. The cliff dwellings are small",
          "The Manitou Cliff Dwellings are the most accessible of this type I have come across. The dwellings although not large are right across from the parking area. The self guided tour will take you about 30 minutes reading all the placards along the way. There are also 3",
          "Visiting the Manitou Cliff Dwellings is to travel back in time. Even though it has some of the feel of a reconstruction, it is still evocative of Peublo life a thousand years ago. It's small size allows young and old to grasp the history of these ancient people.",
          "This is a great site to view history of our ancient Pueblo indian culture....to see this in person brings you back in time to the early Anastazi indians and how they lived...there is a museum to see the artifacts and read the history behind their culture...there are real skulls",
          "The cost is $10 a person to enter the grounds. The site doesn't feel rustic because it is so well \"manicured\". However it is very interesting and has lots of educational information. There is a gift shop and museum.",
          "We visited the Manitou Cliff Dwellers museum in August while we were in the area. I've always liked going there. It's fascinating to imagine living as those Indians did so many years ago. The homes have been restored so you can take a walking tour through them, and there is a",
          "It was amazing being able to go inside and truly experience the cliff dwellings as well as reading about what life was like.",
          "Very fun and interesting history. However, very small ruins, but still worth a trip through. I would recommend you plan for more than just this stop in while in Manitou Springs. There is certainly much more to do in this city.",
          "This almost seemed like it is not real. We have been to National Parks that actually have tour guides to explain about the cliff dwellings and the inhabitants. This has a shop that lures you to buy souvenirs. I wouldn't go back.",
          "Having been to Mesa Verde, we were a bit skeptical, but the reconstruction of this dwelling was well done. We enjoyed being able to walk through all the rooms and read the information regarding each. There is a snack bar on site for lunch, and a huge gift shop/museum.",
          "WE visited on a very wet and cold day, but it was still very interesting. The history is fascinating - please also visit the museum as it also provides some interesting information and additional history.",
          "They are more than expected! Love the history and natural artifacts! The museum and gift shop is one of the best gift shops we have been in! Parking is great and easy to get to!! You will love it!",
          "We really enjoyed our trip to Manitou Springs and the Cliff Dwellings. I really liked that you are able to go inside the dwellings and have a little hands on experience.",
          "We love history of the area we are visiting and this was good. So interesting to see how people existed and lived many years ago. Privately owned-well kept-and easy to get to-fun guy at the entrance\ud83d\ude0a",
          "I was amazed with this museum and how interactive it was. It's not often a museum let's you wander through and touch the real homes. We learned so much and had a lot of fun.",
          "the kids loved visiting this place, they ran from room to room exploring what they can find. I enjoyed it also and my wife. this was the 2nd time visiting this place",
          "It's been a couple years since visiting the Manitou Cliff Dwellings. This visit was with out-of-town guests and all of us were impressed. The grounds were very well maintained. The museum was informative and the gift shop has a fantastic selection. Discounted price of $8.50 for",
          "Extremely cool to see this rare historical site in this condition. I've been to Colorado Springs before and I've never known about these cliff dwellings before. There is a small fee to enter the gate per person. Pets are allowed on a leash. Your able to walk around inside",
          "Though the entrance fee to this park is rather high considering it's a self-guided tour and they do not even give you a brochure, it is interesting to see the cliff dwellings. Of course, there is a very large gift shop that will take your money, too. Bear in mind that the",
          "Fellow traveler very interested in native Indian history. This was right up his alley!!! Travel at your own pace...maps provided. In addition to the dwellings, they have a small museum with photos and documentation. Very interesting! Discounts for children & seniors.",
          "This is a quick stop and a bit pricy, but you can really feel the history. We homeschool, so getting to experience the inside of a cliff dwelling was a great way to learn for our family. Just feeling the temperature difference alone (inside vs outside) was a great learning",
          "Worth visiting to see the dwellings and the gift shop has lots of ideas for things to purchase to take home.",
          "This was a quick visit (did it in about 90 minutes) but was glad I stopped. A quick walk up from the parking lot gets you right to the dwellings. Take the time to walk through and read all the sign plates. There's a lot of good info on them. The museum is small but also",
          "We were a little disappointed going here. While there is a lot of information that you can learn, what got me was they moved these dwellings to the spot they are in now. I thought that they were where they were originally, but was disappointed that it wasn't the case. I",
          "These dwellings have been stabilized so tourist don't have to worry about destroying a historical artifact. They are authentic to the point that you get the feel for what it was like to live there. The children love crawling in the low doors to the storage spaces and just",
          "We passed the Cliff Dwellings on our way to another attraction so we decided to go back the next day. It was very interesting to see how the Manitous lived. Some of the dwellings are so small it's hard to imagine that multiple families lived in them. You can scan the QR code",
          "This site cost $10 to get in. It is well worth it. The Cliff Dwellings was like nothing else we saw in Colorado. Great learning the history - going thru the museum. Has a nice gift shop. Can walk thru some of the Dwellings - everything is self guided - so go as quick or",
          "Everything about this place was nice except the parking...glad we got there when we did...not set up very well. Very interesting with a great gift shop area. Couldn't beat the price. Under $10.",
          "We had a good time at the Cliff Dwellings, it's only $10 and they have a good museum, massive gift shop and it's so interesting to see where they used to live. I'm not a big history fan so it's not my type of thing but I actually enjoyed it!",
          "This is a small sample of what Mesa Verde, CO is like, no comparison but if your in this area its great to stop and visit it. You can get out and go into the ruins and see what it was like. Lots of plants outside that tell you what they used them for. They have a nice little",
          "The museum was very small and you had to walk all the way through a multi-room gift shop that was about three times as big, just to get from one tiny exhibit room to the next. Outside was a very highly fixed-up example of cave dwellings. However, it was kind of fun to go",
          "It was very interesting to see these cliff dwellings up close. They are moved from the another location but the importance and up close look are still very intriguing. it is worth the side trip on a slow day in the Colorado Springs area.",
          "When I learned that these \"dwellings\" were actually constructed in the early 1900s from materials carted in from authentic ruins hundreds of miles away, I realized I had been drawn into a classic tourist trap. Nevertheless, the reproduction is skillfully realized and it's cool",
          "This is not a reproduction, but rather actual 1000 year-old cliff dwellings moved to the area. Saves a drive to Mesa Verde. Great museum and shop.",
          "Outside of the $10.00 per adult $7.50 PER KID, not a bad place. I don't think its worth that and if you have a big family, but overall good time.",
          "We left Cave of the Winds and one of our party was interested in seeing the Cliff Dwelling so we stopped. Apparently we were fortunate in arriving early. Very few visitors and we had great parking. The dwelling is not huge but very interesting. We were impressed with how precise",
          "Really nice. You are able to walk around and explore. Views are spectacular. Staff friendly, clean washrooms.",
          "Upon reaching the parking lot one was immediately confronted with the commercial aspect of this attraction. When viewing the actual cliff dwellings one could not help but question the overall authenticity. We have visited truly authentic cave dwellings and one could not dismiss",
          "I wish there would have been more to the actual cliff dwellings. There was a small wall that had been preserved and had a hoaky, touristy vibe. Nothing stood out and I felt like I was walking through the pages of a text book. I think this would be perfect for young kids who",
          "Interesting to see but only a small area of rock houses which I got through in 15-20 minutes. When the gift shop is bigger than the attraction you have got to worry.",
          "This is a smaller version of Mesa Verde National Park but very well done. My sister-in-law had never seen cliff dwellings and wanted to go here. I was impressed with the park and thought it was very informative. Well worth visiting if you have not been to Mesa Verde.",
          "Stopped by and spent 90minutes or so. Dwellings were cool, kids had fun in them. Small museum and large gift shop",
          "Travel through the museum first to understand the history of the Indians that lived in the cliff dwellings. Experienced the small space of the rooms and good to take several photos! Incline walking so have comfortable shoes. Good souvenir and food sources!",
          "Our family, with children, enjoyed a morning at the Cliff Dwellings of Manitou. It is self guided. The nice thing is that the children can get a glimpse of our history. They are allowed to climb in the dwellings. (Note it is a totally different experience than Mesa Verda.)",
          "What an amazing place! It shows how the first Americans lived. What intelligent and well planned designs for living quarters these people had. The attraction itself is very clean, friendly, and offers amazing views from every angle. The gift shop has an impressive amount of",
          "So glad we stopped to see these. They are much more accessible than Mesa Verde, and you can really climb through them. Small museum and gift shop as well. Try to arrive early, not a lot of parking.",
          "For the amount they charge to get inside, you would think there would be more to see. The rooms are very small. Crowds make a thorough look impossible. The museum is very small and the kids were not interested. Parking is a mess. Better places to spend your time.",
          "The kids loved climbing around inside the dwellings. The place was cool, but a little lacking. Not bad for a quick stop if it's along the way but wouldn't go out of my way to see it.",
          "I found this place very interesting. It is pay to view and seems to be privately owned, but it is a very convenient way to see cliff dwellings and does a pretty good job of explaining them.",
          "Even though these are not original to the area and were transported here it is very interesting to see and learn about this way of living.",
          "My kids loved climbing through the dwellings, they learned so much about the amazing people who lived there. They had a great gift shop and museum too. One of our favorite parts was the day we went they had a wolf exhibit and we got to take pictures with wolf hybrids.",
          "Instead of just looking at the cliff dwellings you can walk thru them. They have a gift shop and museum. The museum showed how the American Indians lived. They had a pottery display that showed the different patterns and where they came from. That was very interesting since",
          "Good history and it is not too large if you have small kids. Grounds are niceand well kept. Interesting at all age levels.",
          "This is a great place to take the kids and give them their first view of cliff dwellings. Very interactive and hands on -- my grandson loved it. Brought his mother here years ago, and she loved it too. Now we need to take him to Mesa Verde to experience the scale of the",
          "Nice place to visit if in the area. Takes about an hour to view dwellings, small museum, and large gift shop. Was fun for my 11 year old daughter. I would recommend for families.",
          "We found this to be very interesting with the history and the acess to touching and climbing inside the dwellings. The museums and gift shops were very nice.",
          "Took my family here and the kids loved it. It's really cool to see the scale of the homes and how they lived. It was a bit tainted when we read that these Dwellings were actually relocated here and this is not the original site. They were apparently relocated to prevent further",
          "It was okay, but after seeing Mesa Verde and Bandelier National Monument, this pales in comparison. Also, knowing that this is not the original location, and the ruins have been moved, kind of takes away from the historical significance of it.",
          "I was not sure how my 5 and 7 year old would do with the cliff dwellings. I was afraid they would be ready to go after just a few minutes of looking at dwellings carved out of the rock. They stayed engaged for over an hour. There are a lot of nooks that kids can crawl in and",
          "Very disappointing! It was $10 per person. I would have happily paid $10/for all 4 of us. We spent more time walking through gift shop than the museum and dwelling combined.",
          "This place was okay but not worth the $10 per adult entrance fee. There are a small amount of ruins and a small museum. A gift shop of course. I don't have a great interest in Indian clay pots, arrowheads etc. so perhaps if you do you will enjoy more than I. They have parking",
          "This place is a must see. Lots of stairs and climbing so don't go if you can't handle that. Made that mistake with my Mom and sister who can't navigate all the stairs so they didn't get to see much, couldn't even get to the gift shop.",
          "Very disappointing! Felt almost like a movie set. Did not offer much in the way of history-seems like the gift shop was were all their energy was placed. Price hardly reflected the value one would expect for the fee charged. Getting into the area was awful--they need to work",
          "We went with my parents, wife and daughter. So all age range. Cliff dwellings were a lot smaller then we thought. Took maybe 10 min to walk through and it was expensive to get in. This is a \"yah I mean sure let's go see it, may as well mark it off the bucket list say we did it\"",
          "Very informational. We spent a few hours looking around through the dwellings and the museums. A lot of neat artifacts to look at we all enjoyed it!",
          "Close parking. You can walk through the dwellings and experience it all close up and no long walk to get to them. Interesting. One of the largest and best gift shop of Native American and Mexican items.",
          "This is a place not to be missed! We actually walked in the \"ruins\" and experienced what it was like to climb into the doorways, through the windows, and see just how small the spaces were and how the Native Americans lived in these homes and community. Maybe a little",
          "Unfortunately, we visited Mesa Verde National Park a few days before so this place, though having its own history, was a little let down. The $10 fee for an hour's worth of entertainment is decent. Since it is a hands-on experience, most of the wall surfaces appear black and",
          "This was a unique and fun place to visit. It was very cool to be able to walk around and inside the ruins. The gift shop was huge and awesome. We would have stayed longer to check out the museum but we have a fidgety toddler.",
          "I really appreciated the opportunity to go into the cliff dwelling and absorbe the sense of history and it enable one to imagine what life was like in that place and time.",
          "WE had initially planned on going to see this. Then one of the locals told us that all of the cliff dwellings were not from around there. They had been moved from some other place and installed here as a visitors attraction! There had never been any cliff dwellers in this",
          "We felt this was a bit expensive. With kids who are impatient and run through everything as fast as possible there just isn't that much ground to cover. We spent more time in the gift shops than looking at the attractions. To be clear, it's a great attraction and worth a visit.",
          "This is situated west of Colorado Springs and straight of the main road. It cost us $10 each and there was plenty of free parking. It is self guided to look round with some plaques to explain each part. Be aware according to Wikipedia the dwellings were shipped by railroad from",
          "If you are in the area a stop off here is a must. Found just off the I-24 northbound. 10 dollars for adults On arrival there is a pull up gatehouse where you pay and they give you a map etc . Plenty of on site parking and your are guided where to park! The whole complex is",

          "I thought it would be a nice to visit. It's not an original area for the dwelling. Not a lot to see except for the large over priced gift shop. With in 20 mimutes we were bored and left. I wish we spent our $30.00 elsewhere.",

          "Very commercialized. I was disappointed to find these were only \"ruins\" moved from another sight (supposedly about 1900 to save them? Or was it to exploit them for commercial purposes?) and not an original archeological site of Indian cliff dwellings. All of it seemed to be a",

          "The dwellings themselves are small, but you are able to walk through them, touch the walls, see hidden rooms, and even climb a ladder to some rooms. We had a fun and cultural experience! They also have a HUGE gift shop there that seemed to go on for forever - some nice stuff",
          "Had to queue on the road to get in and thought it was a bit pricey for what it was but was interesting and worth a stop off. Too many people made it hard to move around but was informative and good. The gift shop was good, with lots to see and the small museums.",
          "Way too expensive. Way too much like a tourist trap. The gift shop was nice, but the actual display was not worth the cost of entry.",
          "We didn't do our research on this place, if we did we wouldn't of stopped. It is overpriced and not a lot to see. Save your money & spend it somewhere else.",
          "Lovely place to see if toy get the chance. They have an awesome gift shops, with some really great finds, Amazing fudge too, and will give you a discount too if you buy a pound.",
          "We stopped as we were leaving Manitou Springs on our way to Garden of the Gods. Not sure it was worth the $20 for the 2 of us to visit this. There is very little of historical significance left in the site. The gift shop was larger than the cliff dwellings.",
          "We spent more time in the gift shop than we did the dwellings. The dwellings are very cool and interesting but it was crowded and not very big. It is a self guided tour and you can download the audio by scanning the map. The best part of the dwellings was the last one where"

          "It was amazing to actually be allowed in the dwellings! I expected to just get a view from in front, but no, we got to go inside. Come here if you are nearby-trust me, it\u2019s worth the time!",
          "This place was a little surprise. We were able to enter the dwellings and learn a lot about the way people lived there. Fir our kids it was very instructive. The place is clean and the museum and gift shop are a plus. To really enjoy it you \u2026",
          "I initially thought that these rooms were built by the ancient Indians , but they were modeled on the ancient Indians built by the later tribes. There are nice people working there the entrance for an adult is $12. You need probably an hour \u2026",
          "Such a fun, historical place that's been well preserved.  The indoor part of the museum was a delightful surprise coupled with the quaint, beautiful shops.  The outdoor exhibit was 100% hands on, prepare to zig zag and climb your way through history whilst  enjoying the scenic views of gorgeous Pikes Peak mountain.",
          "Well maintained. Cool to walk through. Read the signs throughout. The museum is small but the information is very interesting. Gift shop is great and the employees are so nice. Very clean restrooms as well",
          "Stupendous learning experience. Love the way people lived in the past and their traditions. Great little museum as well. Great price (bargain).",
          "Such a cool place to visit. I'm not a fan in winter and we visited in December when it was 37 degrees. Although it was cold, it was so interesting to walk around and there was practically no one around. The views are spectacular. The museum has some great artifacts and useful info.",
          "I really enjoyed my visit.  It was a glimpse into the history of our beautiful country and the people of a time before us.  The site itself is very nice and informative and a great place to spend a few hours while in the Colorado Springs area.",
          "This place is absolutely amazing.  It's definitely a fun place for children to walk/crawl/run through.  Watch your head if  you're bobbing in and out of the many little windows.  Make sure to walk around the gift shops.",
          "While the dwellings are fun they are quick to go through and are man made replicas. The history is in the museum and gift shop and not very extensive and holds little information and no one to guide you through the information. Great for the price but will not last more than an hour.",
          "Very nice place to visit. The museum had some very interesting and well preserved artifacts. I loved being able to walk through the dwellings. The gift shop was also very nice with a wide variety of items to purchase.",
          "Fun and relaxing. Easy to explore. Give yourself lots of time to visit the museum (several floors and many things to see and learn), and gift shop with unique items on several levels. \nWe really enjoyed it!",
          "It's really neat until you realize it's all just a reproduction and no Indians actually lived here.  It seems they really try to beat around the bush with that.  But the kids had fun and the gift shop is extensive.  A decent way to spend the afternoon.",
          "A nice place to visit and learn some local history. It's interesting to see the dwellings and life style of the past. I hear it's much better if you go in the summer were there are live events. So avoid a winter visit, if you will be around in the summer.",
          "Nice spot for a half-day visit. The tour is selfguided and there is also a small museum to walk through. It's smaller than I expected and it seemed to fill up pretty fast. I would recommend going early in the day to avoid crowds. Good spot for kids as well.",
          "A lot of history. It's very small, but still interesting if u were looking to do something and kill an hour. The gift shop was personally my favorite, along with the staff. They had great recommendations for around the area. The structure itself is fascinating",
          "Vacationing from Texas and this was on my husbands to-do list. It was very interesting to tour these dwellings and witness just what the native Indians were capable of. You develop an even stronger respect for their culture. The Manitou \u2026",
          "Very nice tourist stop. Spent a few hours exploring the tight little spaces and the giant gift shop. The gift shop is a tour of its own. So many things to browse. The collection of dream catchers is large and very unique. Tons of handmade items and hand carved items. There is an entry fee to enter the property, but it is worth it.",
          "Very interesting to see the Pueblo Indians homes so well preserved. I enjoyed it . The gift shop was a little over the top for me. But that is just my personal opinion. For those who like that kind of think it's HUGE! The museums were interesting too. Great place to take a field trip for kids as well.",
          "None of these cliff dwellings are actually real (they were recreated), but it's still pretty cool.",
          "Brought my family here for a little history near Colorado Springs. Absolutely fantastic if you enjoy history.",
          "A very well-preserved dwelling area of the Natives. The information plaques detail each room/opening/design in a way that allows us to understand how people used to live in the early days. The museum is also a very good place to understand and learn more. This place is worth its entry price.",
          "Fun place to visit to learn how cliff dwellers lived many years ago.  Family friendly. We got there early and had the place to ourself.  Fun going through the dwellings and getting up close with the structures.  These structures are replicas not actual cliff houses.",
          "Price for admission was worth the awesomeness past the gate. Pretty cool items in the gift shop although I don\u2019t believe they are authentic to the area, as most said they were made in Mexico.",
          "Such a great place to visit! Was moved to this area years ago and they have done an amazing job in keeping it up with all of the visitors! Thank you for preserving this so well!",
          "Parking lot gets full. Views are incredible. Self guided tour. $20 per car which is well priced the more you bring. It does get hot in summer. Gift shop is nice but over priced. Pace yourself. Bring water.",
          "It is a nice stop but a little pricey for the amount to see. The gift shop takes the longest. With 4 kids it just wasn't worth the amount of time and experience for us. The is an audio tour on a browser you can play while you walk around.",
          "Nice easy way to really be able to explore what these structures may have been like. Simple layout and it's possible that the gift shop is larger than the Cliff Dwelling. Would suggest a visit when children are in school if you don't enjoy their antics and if you have a mobility problem make sure you have a friendly arm to hold on to.",
          "It's amazing to think people used these rooms as homes thousands of years ago!  My adult kids loved it, as I did years ago, and a little 10 month old, newly walking, loved it and enjoyed it just as much!  Really good museum, and fantastic \u2026",
          "Plan on spending less than an hour here.\nIt was a nice visit, with lovely views but I think the main focus was on the gift shop which was large, well stocked and contained a multitude of items. However, I felt that while it had a history \u2026",
          "This place was awesome. Loved going through here. Amazing how they built this with limited tools. A must see.",
          "I had written this off as some kind of tourist trap.  Pleasantly surprised to find a lot of history and opportunity to crawl around inside the dwellings.  Really gets your brain rolling with respect to how people lived and survived in the years past.  It's worth a stop, the kids can run off some energy",
          "It was a nice experience exploring this place and history behind it. The view is picturesque. Not worth the money charged though. Can visit if you have extra time at hand",
          "You get to wander through the dwellings to get a sense of what it was like to live there. The fee for adults is usually $12, but was $9 bc the main museum was closed that day",
          "Pretty AMAZING!! A place you want to make sure you have plenty of time to wander through.  The architecture and construction is just mind boggling!! Lots of steps and they're pretty steep.  Most have hand rails, so it's relatively simple to get around.",
          "Amazing place to visit. A lot of history in a great setting. Very informative museum too",
          "Cool place. Went with my daughters field trip. Definitely something to do if you just moved to the springs.",
          "Really cool to see these cliff dweelings and actually get to go inside them. Fun for all ages!",
          "Not as big as I expected but still cool. You can walk all around the dwellings and the museum inside has a lot of meat artifacts. The gift store was filled with a lot of cool items as well.",
          "Cool interactive site. The museum has lots of artifacts and interesting bits of knowledge. Definitely work checking out if you're in the area.",
          "These dwellings were built elsewhere and brought piece by piece here. It\u2019s amazing how well constructed they are. In the desert where it is hot in the sun, while Inside the dwellings, it\u2019s cool and comfy. Great gift shop. Took about an hour to enjoy.",
          "Interesting and informative experience full of local history and artifacts. A great view of the surrounding area as well. \n\nAlso, a fun gift shop for visitors.",
          "Beautiful and well-kept. Self-guided tour, but there are signs explaining each structure. The museum and the gift shop are wonderful! Price of admission for adults is only $8.50. Plenty of parking space.",
          "It was fun exploring the cliff dwellings. Experiencing the dwellings and imagining living in them is surreal. Lots of cool native plants, clean, and plenty of parking. I would highly recommend it if you are going through the area.",
          "Awesome fun for everyone.  Although partially handicap accessible.  To get the the gift shop/ museum is rather steep if you're completely wheelchair bound . The cliff dwellings themselves are very fascinating. With signs explaining each \u2026",
          "This place is really neat. Was pretty busy even though I was able to park right in front. Can't believe it is privately owned and operated. Gift shop is probably one of my favorite places I shopped for souvenirs. Real authentic Indian \u2026",
          "Pretty cool place to learn some of Colorado's history. With beautiful views. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable. They definitely need to get a changing table in the bathrooms this is a family place.",
          "Really interesting place. Gives you a glimpse into the past . Love the gift shop really offer alot of things .",
          "Very cool historical site but overpriced. Gift shop was bigger than the attraction. Wouldn\u2019t plan for more than an hour of time to see it all.",
          "Nice place and has nothing to do with made up words like cultural appropriation. Just showing what was found and how in its restore state it would have look. The gift shop is great allot of interesting items. Try the fudge it's to die for. Great place to look around and wonder what living in a cliff could have been like.",
          "Interesting, unless you grew up visiting Mesa Verde every summer. The community has done a good job restoring. Excellent field trip for schools.",
          "Oh my God it was just beautiful. You learn so much about the history of the Anasazi Indians. It was very interesting and had a nice and cool temperature inside the cliff (great for warm days) 1 adult and 1 kid was $18. I had a wonderful time.",
          "Very nice just a bit smaller than I expected... great place for kids",
          "Amazing!! Great place to share childhood memories with my kids. I shared their excitement... awesome place, a must visit for everyone",
          "Great views and historical sites. Excellent museum and a neat way to see how they lived!",
          "There\u2019s a small museum you can walk through showcasing the Native American lifestyle. This was definitely something I would recommend to a family with children since a lot of it is navigating the little rooms and pathways. This is a really short stop if you\u2019re not into exploring around these structures.",
          "Really neat place! A lot of information. The stretch of houses isn't very large, but you can walk through them & there is information on a plaque that tells you information about how the room was used. There was a large gift shop as well as \u2026",
          "This museum is not owned by any indigenous people nor does it give any profits to local Pueblo people. The cave dwellings also were moved to this location and have clearly been very altered and have lots of concrete in them and signs of \u2026",
          "Kids loved this place . Enjoyed by going through small passages and had fun time.",
          "I would have given a minus if there is an option.. It's not at all worth for $10 entry fee.. Please don't waste money here, better visit some other places in Colorado springs",
          "A step back into the history. It is great to know how the ancient civilization lived. How did their civilization nourish. The houses in the mountains are small. This shows how much bonding there would have been amongst those families that \u2026",
          "I\u2019m fairly certain these are fake. I wish I would\u2019ve researched these me before visiting them. Definitely a tourist trap!!! The view was incredibly beautiful though:)",
          "Winter with my boyfriend and his family and it actually was really neat and the gift Center and museum are giant",
          "What a place a site to visit. i was overwhelmed with the magnificent cliff dwellings. to bad that my camera run out of battery. everybody should experience visiting this place in the life. really a wonders of the world.",
          "It's nice and well kept but there isn't a lot left of the Dwellings and the historical context/information was a bit lacking. You'll find nearly as much information about the site's ownership history as you will those that dwelled there.",
          "Now this place explain very well about the Native Indians life. I love it coz you learn a lot of their history. How they live and why it looks like that. I love their house :)",
          "Nice setup, but could use a freshening up in the museum. And this is not the original location of the cliff dwellings, they were moved here.",
          "When in Colorado Springs, please visit Manitou cliffs. I enjoyed this little town so much. Natural mountain water. Great shops. And delicious ice cream to your taste. You'll love it there.",
          "We really enjoyed the cliff dwellings but these people really love to try to sell u stuff. It says they have a museum but really it's a giant gift shop with small areas of artifacts. It would be much better if they put it all together and made a really nice museum and then had a gift shop at the end.",
          "It's more interesting then we thought it would be.  It's a great insight into the culture.",
          "You can spend an hour or so here. The site is interesting to wonder in and out of ... kids can climb and run around which is good and bad. The museum is tiny but very interesting and well done, it\u2019s carved out of the rockface! Fitting!",
          "Enjoyed our day at place close to home ! Gift shop has lots little gift ideas ! We walked all thru cliffs ! Spent about hour and half and saw all was to see",
          "What a neat place. Worth the entry fee. Very cool to be able to see the cliff dwellings not only from outside, but inside of them! All six or so buildings you can walk through, climb up, and look around from the inside. Especially great if \u2026",
          "One of the coolest places I\u2019ve ever been to. It was neat to see the dwellings and it\u2019s amazing how it\u2019s withstood the test of time. It was a fun learning experience and was a highlight of our vacation.",
          "Pretty cool place. The architecture from then is drastically different than today's standards. The four family house is smaller than my living room. Ceiling heights were barely 6ft and chairs were a luxury. Their pizza oven is pretty large \u2026",
          "Really interesting bit of history walking around in these old dwellings.  It costs about $10 for adults and 7.99 for kids.   It's good for kids, although if you have young kids it's a little stressful in the museum and gift shop (too many breakables).",
          "It seems so authentic! Very interesting and great learning experience. Amazing gift shop with yummy fudge and samples. If there are a lot of people at the ruins it's hard to get a good feel for everything so I suggest doing that while the least people are near it.",
          "This palce is a good half day trip, I thought that this was really interesting since I work in the accessible construction business.",
          "There's the cliff dwelling you can enter, there's also a unique store and museum. theres an original grainary where kids and adults can try old school milling of corn on the traditional mill stones. Just a couple minutes up the road is Cave \u2026",
          "Of all the days to be closed it was the day we went - looked interesting from the outside",
          "The Manitou by itself is a very cute,unique,and lovely dog lover town. You can walk hours in Manitou  and then visit the Manitou Cliff Dwellings on a way back.The Manitou Cliff Dwellings also was another unique experience that we had when \u2026",
          "A little pricey for such a short \"field trip\". It is definitely one I'd recommend you do at least once. Very informative and a fun experience as you can actually walk through the dwellings. As mentioned above... short and sweet. You'll probably be there an hour at most.",
          "This place is amazing. The ability of the pueblos to create such beauty is without comparison. The signs were informative and explained questions. The museums and gift shops were clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. This is a \u2026",
          "A bit touristy, thought it would be more authentic. Believe it\u2019s a recreation of the original dwellings that once were in the area. Still interesting to see but the gift shop seemed to have more action than the attraction itself.",
          "Cool place to get a glimpse of Native history- a bit pricey for what it is.",
          "Everyone was super nice and very helpful in tour information. Going into the cliff dwelling was a whole new experience.",
          "They let you walk freely through this but this is not a real Village of the Native Indians.",
          "This is an easy to get to site. Both in driving there and walking from the parking lot.\n\nA very interesting experience of ancient way of life. There are informational signs all along a self guided tour you take at your own pace.\n\nA nice \u2026",
          "Very educational. It's quite impressive to see what the Anasazi were capable of building with no tools. Just beautiful. Be sure to go through the gift shop too (it's pretty big)- it has a couple sections of museum artifacts on display.",
          "Nice place to visit and learn. Only gave 4 stars because of the price. The dwellings were very cool, but not that big to explore. The museum seemed smaller than the multi-level gift shop.",
          "Reminiscent of the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde, but more commercialized. The pueblo building has more gift shop than museum. The cliff dwelling structures have been kept up in a way that makes them seem more modern, whereas Mesa Verde is \u2026",
          "What an amazing experience! To see up close the way ancient people made their homes. I was very impressed to see the length the park went to preserve remains of the ruins. The museum was well organized and contained some excellent examples \u2026",
          "Sorry but we were disappointed. It was more expensive to visit here than it was to see the same thing at Mesa Verde National Park. The dwellings at Mesa Verde are all authentic. The dwellings here were moved here from somewhere else so they \u2026",
          "Very neat piece of history, we made a quick stop here while on our 3 day stay in Colorado Springs. We saw all we needed to see in less than an hour. There were tons of neat things in the gift shop. All in all, I am glad we stopped here.",
          "Fascinating to see how others have lived in the past. You can climb in, up and around to see how small the space was for several people to be in. There is a museum about the dwellings and about the Indians lifestyles. Huge store too.",
          "Neat that you can walk around and touch everything.",
          "It is evident from the moment you read their history plaques that this is a highly commercialized instance of cultural appropriation and condescension. The history is poorly written: \"it is impossible to bridge the gap between the modern \u2026",
          "Very interactive and that gift shop is mind blowing.  Even had a museum  inside",
          "Wife and I enjoyed it. Kids thought it was okay. My dad was in hell. LOL. Plan on about an hour stay.",
          "Unique spot, one of a kind for sure. Felt like the entry price per person is a little steep, maybe per car but charging per person is crazy. Explored the grounds in about an hour. The gift shop is a little crazy, meaning tons of unnecessary \u2026",
          "I've time to time wondered how the ancients created homes with what little resources they had. (Yes, I'm weird that way.) Here, you see first hand the ingenuity of the early settlers. You can walk through the dwellings, which was an \u2026",
          "A fantastic preservation of a native American cliff dwelling.  You can investigate and see everything up close   you can even go in the dwellings   great gift shop too, much more than the typical junk.  Great fudge too!",
          "This was my second visit to Manitou Cliff Dwellings. This hands-on \"museum\" expplores the Native American culture of the Anasazi over the past 700 years. You can walk through and touch the Cliff Dwellings. The large, adjacent store \u2026",
          "Amazing place! Definitely recommend going rigtt before sunset, gives the best lighting \ud83d\ude0d",
          "Great place to bring children. Highly recommend for families",
          "This place is truly beautiful and majestic. It is an amazing experience that everyone should see at least once in their lives. We got very lucky we got there and the park had other people but it was tolerable. Once we were leaving though, \u2026",
          "Great place to explore. Gift shop is large and has lots of interesting trinkets",
          "Fun place for kids of all ages ! Fairly quick getting threw and decent priced",
          "Fairly interesting to see. Amazing to think about living in those conditions. Nice that the kids can touch and climb in some of the \u201ccave rooms\u201d. Museum was fairly informative. Store was a little overkill.",
          "This place is a recreation of ancient Indian homes, and culture You can walk through it and climb around it and it is pretty cool. However if your not into Native American history it\u2019s not worth the 10 dollars per person for admission.",
          "Colorado history at its best!  Gift shops were great!  They also have a small food stand, but we were unable to get anything because they closed.  Maybe next time.",
          "Great historical place and loved the gift shop very affordable.",
          "A first hand look at cliff dwellings, you can explore them. The museum is amazing, rich with detail. If you are in the area I recommend visiting.",
          "Fascinating look into the past. A quick stop. The kids will get bored pretty quick but the gift shop is quite extensive.",
          "Most interesting, educational part of my trip.",
          "Worth watching.. if you were a fan of ancient constructions, you will love this place.. lots of parking, at the entrance you need pay for visitor ticket which costs $10 for adult and $7 for kids.. also there is a pueblos store which has all fascinating stuff like color stones, jute bags, antique stuff, jewelry, decorative items..",
          "Didnt like it   most info  artifacts  and  pretty much everything was from other places    i wanted to learn more and see more about this place and old stuff not other places new items not related to this and so on     example  hole display \u2026",
          "This was neat to walk through with the family and read all the history involved. It wasn't something we'd visit more than once, but it was nice to see one time. We opted not to walk through the gift shop, but that is an option.",
          "A good man made playground for kids. It was nice they let those in wheelchairs in for free (though access was limited to the parking lot view), but there was more gift shop than dwellings or museum.  Many dogs were out and about so that \u2026",
          "Beautiful cliff dwellings and fantastic history all over the place. We enjoyed it more than we thought we could. Our son got to see a little bit of history and could actually touch it instead of just looking.",
          "Very interesting. It was cool to climb inside of a place where the people would have walked and lived and experience what it would be like, especially how small. We were disappointed to learn it\u2019s not an authentic site but was \u201cmoved\u201d from \u2026",
          "We loved it!\nThey are dog friendly and really open to kids going through the dwellings.\nHighly recommend stopping in to admire the craftsmanship of the  indigenous people's.",
          "Very cool! I've been saying I need to go back for over 2 years now, but have yet to go. Sad times. May need to change that next weekend\ud83d\ude01.",
          "Stop here! It's worth it.\nThe museum is small and it only takes a few minutes to walk through the dwellings themselves, but its so gorgeous and interesting that it is a must see. The gift shop was impressive and I bought some of my favorite souvineirs here.\nCafe only has deep fried options, not a great place to have a meal.",
          "The replica and museum are very good. The gift shop is extensive. The turn off is all the signage instructing visitors on what not to do and to control their kids. I felt very unwelcome . I  am telling people to skip this place and visit the actual ruins near Cortez.",
          "For what it is, definitely see it if you're in the area. Between the museum and dwellings, it shouldn't take more than an hour to see everything. Perfect for kids or people who know little about the Indians who lived here. Very friendly staff! I was here 10 years ago and the museum is virtually unchanged.",
          "Awesome place to visit. Very informative and lots of fun to explore.",
          "Fun place to take kids and adults who enjoy a little history.  There are marker signs exploring the dwellings. A small museum with information on local native Americans.  And a gift shop with some interesting stuff.  It's right across the highway from Manitou Springs, a fun place to walk around and visit shops.",
          "A very fun place to visit if you have a bit of spare time on your hands.",
          "This was a very fun place to go. You have shelter everywhere when it starts to rain. We loved it and would recommend going. I loved learning the history.",
          "Very cool. I'm a Hopi indian and it had tons of interesting information in the museum about the people that lived here along with some extra information about other groups. The dwellings were cool to get up close to. Some places like Montezuma's Castle dont let you go inside (at least when i went).",
          "Not the real place they lived, but an exact replica. Pretty cool place to go visit and see how that used to live, and the gift shop is huge. They closed most of it down early that day for some weird reason. Only took like 1 hour to see it all.",
          "After doing some simple research I learned that this \"historic\" site was actually built in the 1900s as a tourist attraction. I am disappointed that this isn't advertised. In other words it's FAKE.",
          "This would be good for kids.  Fudge was heavenly.",
          "This was neat and the cost was only 10.50 per person but like others have said it was a 15 min self guided tour.  I think I'd just go to Mesa Verde if you really want to see cliff dwellings.",
          "Our kids loves crawling through all the houses and we liked learning about them. I wish there was more educational info. The dwellings are not original to the location just FYI",
          "We had such a great experience here.",
          "Very interesting to see. It's very educational and beautiful views, even when you live here, it's well worth the trip.",
          "Interesting & good for young kids, but it's small.",
          "An absolutely incredible place. When we entered the sacred smoke room we got goosebumps before we read the sign stating that the room was sacred. A very thought provoking view with an incredible history. The gift shop is full of awesome \u2026",
          "Best place for picking up souvenirs while visiting Colorado Springs! I could spend hours at this place!",
          "Beautiful, Interesting and Small Museum!\nI think is a must to visit if you are in Colorado Springs specially if you have kids...I saw so many enjoying the dwelling. Different kind of gift shops where you can find anything you thought about it for home...souvenirs for family and friends.",
          "Good to enjoy with friends and family. Place is well looked after and sees a good amount of visitors.",
          "A little touristy but  Enjoyable and informative",
          "Small but very well done. The museum is very interesting. The gift shop is very well supplied with Indian made items. The garden around the ruins is planted with vegetation used by the Indians with description.",
          "Its a good place, but 10 $ per adult is too steep",
          "Very informative, how life was back then. A lot of artifacts that give you a closer look. And The gift shop is endless as the prices are. So much. Too much!",
          "Crowed. The entire tour seems very interesting but when kids are running up and down the steps of the dwellings and in and out of the small caves it\u2019s hard to appreciate all the tour has to offer. The gift shop was huge and had a lot to offer if Indian culture is your thing.",
          "Cool place but pretends way too hard to be genuine. They do a great job hiding the fact that it was created in 1904 by a white mining mogul for tourism. No Anasazi people ever lived in the area.",
          "Awesome, beautiful.  I loved the place",
          "A must visit... beautiful views and you learn something.",
          "While there was interesting information shared at this location, ultimately it fell somewhat short of my family's expectations. The transplanted dwellings were \"neat\", but there weren't as many of them as I'd have expected for the cost. All in all, the information about native Americans was interesting, but we left feeling \"meh\".",
          "Hot day this Nov 9 . Tons of people on this lovely weekend . Nice site to visit",
          "My husband and I brought the kids and they really enjoyed it.  The hands-on experience brings history to life.  We've been a couple times and each time was fun.",
          "Very interesting! Really enjoyed entering the dwellings! The site was smaller than I expected",
          "Great place to go and have fun with the family!",
          "Great experience! A tourist \"must see\"!\nThe views are amazing and the historic details are really interesting and fun to explore. The gift shop is a great place with all kinds of treasures too!",
          "This place has one of the best places to get high quality Native merchandise. There's a small museum.  The best part is the dwellings. You'll spend most of the 2 hours in the gift shop.",
          "Love this historical place. It is definitely exciting seeing all the dwellings, the artifacts, and the beautiful colored landscape. The gift shop, well you definitely won't leave without buying something. Good prices and friendly staff.",
          "Interesting piece of history.  Easy for a few hour afternoon trip.",
          "The cliff dwellings are interesting and fun to walk through however, it was $40 for my family of 4 to go and we had walked through the entire place in 20 minutes.  There are only a handful of actual dwellings and a museum and gift shop. The gift shop prices were very reasonable and had a nice, large selection.",
          "Worth the visit. There dwellings are interesting. While it's not a huge site, there is enough to learn about life in the dwellings. Huge gift shop. T-shirt prices outside were fantastic.",
          "Great for education on the ole back days and fun for family vacation.",
          "Good place to get up close to cliff dwellings. I understand that this location is not totally authentic as they have recreated dwellings here but the bonus is that you are allowed to walk all around and inside of the dwellings. Parking is also close by. No long hikes.",
          "My two kids loved being able to immerse themselves literally into the history there.  Perfect place for families.",
          "The place is awesome and a nice trip if you are in the area. A little pricey for 2 adults and 2 kids, but very easy to walk up to the site. The gift shop is huge.",
          "Absolutely incredible experience everyone should do.  Really surreal experience to knowingly walk through what was someone's home centuries ago.  The caretakers do a great job of maintaining the premises and giving a good balance of education and enjoyment.  Highly recommend.",
          "I was underwhelmed being here while the area is very pretty well maintained the dwellings themselves are very manicured I guess if you go there knowing that you're not seeing entirely original work it's a pretty area they've got a great gift shop and artifact pieces plenty of opportunity for some education it was $10.50 per adult",
          "Nice folks I'm the gift shop. 10$ per person sonwas",
          "What an awesome piece of history to learn and explore!",
          "Loved this place! So much to take in, everybody was friendly. So many kool dwellings and history behind it all. Definitely going back, recommend everybody to go at least once.",
          "AMAZING experience! It was so interesting walking through the dwellings and learning about the ancient way of life of these Indians. \u2764",
          "What an incredible history here at the cliff dwellings \ud83d\ude00 the museum is super fascinating with tons of artifacts and photos from years back to present on the happening a at this location. Bring your camera \ud83d\udcf7 for close up pictures and also \u2026",
          "Great place to spark interest from kids to adults, and everyone in between. Get up close and personal with these historic dwellings, and see what it was like to live here!",
          "Wonderful place to visit, lots of culture and great experience.",
          "Very interesting seeing how natives lived in this area. The facility was clean and the area was beautiful.",
          "A quick stop and visit to learn the history of the local Anasazi Indians lifestyle and culture.  Great place to bring your kids and family to see such fascinating architecture beneath the Cliff Dwellings.\n\nThey have a nice gift shop to go \u2026",
          "Really unique and interesting place. If you are interested in local history then it is definitely a place you should visit. I guess you could say there are 3 museums there. The cliff dwellings are one, there's a cave museum inside the \u2026",
          "Great place to take your family. Fabulous gift shop.",
          "It was interesting to see the dwellings. There were a lot fewer than we expected but they are well preserved. The cost was appropriate for what it was.  Only needed am hour to explore and check it ther gift shops",
          "Loved coming here when I was kid and finally got to bring mine",
          "Although it looks newly constructed, it is an actual historical site. Interesting place with a huge gift shop and good museum.",
          "WAY more than I expected. I lived seeing the inside if the cave dwellings. There's a nice picnic area and fun gift shop to poke through. We found a coupon online for a discount on entry. It was worth a visit for sure.",
          "Pet friendly and very interesting, huge gift shop and good museum.",
          "Place was an amazing blend of history and senseless trinket shopping. It's $10 a person, which gets you up close and personal to the dwellings and access to the 3 floor museum. \n\nWe spent about 2 hours here and had a bit of fun and learned quite a bit.",
          "Very interesting. In a beautiful  area of Colorado Springs.",
          "If you want to see dwellings that have been put back together to give you a real sense of how these people lived then this is your place.  10$ per adult isn't too pricey plus they have an awesome gift shop and museum!",
          "Way too much money for basically an enormous gift shop the actual Cliff Dwellings did not seem real ( especially if you've been to Mesa Verde) and they let kids run all over them. I would definitely not go back",
          "Great place for visit and learn about the First peoples.",
          "My whole family was so mesmarize by this wonder. really cant belive how all of this dwellings was built. we are just blown away by this site. wish my camera didnt run out of battery but will surely never forget how wonderful this place is.",
          "Interesting if you're into Native American history, but kind of underwelming for the price. We spend a half hour or so walking through the dwellings and had our fill. The museum has some cool artifacts.",
          "This place was surprising,  I expected to see a tourist trap. No where near. The dwellings themselves are well kept and the information very good. These dwellings were moved from there original place in early 1900, in an effort to protect \u2026",
          "This is a very beautiful place to see the native American homes and how they used to live. I just wish the museum they have was a bit bigger it'll take you about 30 min max to see everything.",
          "A fun place to take the family to spend a day. It is small but a fun experience.",
          "100% dog friendly. They're welcome in the cliff dwellings, as well as the buildings on sight. Very cool place to visit.",
          "I love anything that has to do with history!",
          "Well worth the stop. A nice variety of things to see and do. I really enjoyed my time there",
          "That folks had the foresight to disassemble, move and reassemble these dwellings is amazing! Huge gift shop, too.",
          "Kids like to run around and climb on everything. It seems strange that we are touching and climbing on the ruins. Self guided tour. I was just hoping for more... it was kind of a let down.",
          "What a cool experience! If you love history like I do, you need to visit this place! Take the kids! Take the grandkids! You won't regret it at all!!",
          "Super cool place. It is small, but it is done extremely well. There are plaques that walk you through the cliff dwellings, so each room is explained. Great job of connecting you to the past.",
          "I so love history. These American Indian dwellings are fascinating. They are not near as big as Mesa Verda but they used to be a part of it. I'm still amazed at how they evan moved it with only carts and horses. There is a very nice gift shop and even a little museum.",
          "Interesting stop. Worth the small admission price, but not as impressive as Mesa Verde in my opinion. Kids had fun imagining the lives in the small houses and getting up close with the dwellings.",
          "Not very big. But perfect for a quick look. Great for kids",
          "Sorry for the long review.\n\n     Very educational and informative. The self guided tour and the museum were very interesting and they gave a good outline of native American history in the area. \n     Just to correct some of the reviews \u2026",
          "Neat place! You get to walk in the dwellings and there's a museum with artifacts and lots of historical photos and information. Help support this place by visiting.",
          "Beautifully preserved cliff dwellings of the old Pueblo Indians. Clean facilities and super friendly staff.",
          "This was a great experience for me and the kids. Super cool to see the dwellings. Be sure to check out the gigantic gift shop you won't leave empty handed! Staff was ever so friendly.",
          "Very informative, even has a museum. Staff was very friendly but not overbearing in the trinket shop.",
          "It was amazing getting to learn and see about how they lived. There was so much to see and do. Very well designed, and just a bit joy to go to.",
          "Lots of fun and a ton of stuff to see and learn",
          "Really cool place. A must see in Colorado Springs!",
          "So, so, so awesome!!! We loved that they let you go in the dwellings. Some places are a tight squeeze for a larger adult. Definitely use the digital tour guide, because if you go inside the dwellings you miss some signs",
          "If you like History this is awesome to visit.",
          "Great place to learn a bit of history.  Well laid out with a mix of several artifacts and \"societies\" of the region.  Will definitely recommend as a stop.",
          "Very well preserved artifacts with tablets for letting interesting facts, even the gift shop is very interesting. You get to go inside the ruins and witness first hand the architecture used hundreds of years ago.",
          "Big waste of time and money unless you want to pay to see their gift shop. I guess I did not know I could see the whole thing in 2 minutes and get a picture with everything you will see in it. Really disappointing and definitely not worth even $10!",
          "Loved seeing this place in person my daughter enjoyed it as well !",
          "Loved it! The man that takes admission was super friendly! The dwellings themselves were awesome, but I loved all the artifacts and history available to look at.",
          "Nice stop to stretch your legs and learn some interesting histort. Awesome cliff dwellings.",
          "Super cool to see. You can walk through. Only takes about 45 mins to do everything but was worth it",
          "Even though these are a replica of the real thing in Four Corners this place is Awesome. It's very cool the way you can walk around in them to experience what it was like in another time. Great for small, or large groups. Just minutes away \u2026",
          "I just loved this place..soo beautiful",
          "Well presented history and the shops are superbly done. Items from what you expect to marvelous quality.",
          "The dwellings were awesome to see but the staff at the gift shop were rude. I had my service dog with me, who had his service vest on, and he is not trained to use a leash. He is trained by voice commands. They asked if he was my dog and I \u2026",
          "Absolutely enjoyed our time here! Self guiding was easy and fun!",
          "Super cool to see how people made use of the cliffs for their homes. You can walk through them to go back in time and imagine what it would have been like to live in that time in history. Great museum and gift shop too.",
          "It's a Native American historical place I don't know why there's so many white American Caucasian people working instead of natives the only thing I don't like about it besides that nice place nice gift shop",
          "Really cool! You also get a great up close view of the mountains",
          "Not exactly what I was expecting, definitely a tourist trap. Cool to see once, the dwellings themselves were gorgeous.",
          "Kids loved it. It is not like mesa verde so don't go expecting that authenticity. It is a new rendition of how they lived. But it is pretty neat and interactive.",
          "Beautiful historic cliff dwelling close to Colorado springs. Well maintained and good staff",
          "I enjoyed the history and seeing where native Americans lived",
          "One big tourist trap, don't waste your time.  Nothing to learn except hown to scam people.",
          "Wow! This was a very fun experience! Not only can you look at these amazing structures but they let you go inside and explore them! It is a wonderful place with amazing views and just fun for any age. There is also a very large gift shop you can wander around in and a muesum. Overall really wonderful experience.",
          "We had a Great time here going back in time into Native Indian history!",
          "A well done look into the culture of those who came before us!",
          "Enjoyed being able to walk through the dwellings. Loved learning the history hands-on.",
          "The picture in the ad is literally all there is. Its neat, but I feel like this would be better to see in the southwest. The whole thing can be done in an hour.",
          "Very cool, lots of stuff to do, lots of information, and beautiful.",
          "Cool place to visit, nice bit of history and neat to see the exhibits and museum. Nice gift shop too! Friendly staff and even met a 4 legged employee. Such fun!",
          "Fantastic historical site.  The dwellings, though, seemed smaller than the gift shop which is where i spent most of my time.",
          "Shops are beautiful. Actually, shops have more paid attention than the Cliff dwellings themselves but still a nice place of history.",
          "Not really worth your time, definitely not worth the entrance fee. This is a tourist trap from the 1910's that hasn't aged all that well. It's sole existence is to take your money.",
          "WOW! This place was amazing! History preserved was astonishing and very inexpensive.",
          "What an awesome piece of history! It was beautiful and very enlightening! Loved it!",
          "Beautifully reassembled, well laid out and thought out. Great museum and gift shop.",
          "Great museum to learn about some Native American history and culture. I do suggest coming early in the day or to have patience as some of the small pathways can be hard to navigate with so many people.",
          "Very interesting. The dwellings were moved to this preserve from other locations. Fun to walk through the dwellings and see the museum exhibits. Entrance fee overpriced and too much space devoted to souvenirs.",
          "What a lovely place to visit. One of the few that will let you climb around and see the spaces where lives were lived. There is a self guided tour, and the museum/gift shop are incredible.",
          "So much history! Our family really enjoyed visiting.",
          "Informational and easy access. Definitely more commercial than Mesa Verde, but also far more convenient. Staff was very friendly.",
          "The dwelling was interesting and exciting to see but taking the family wasn't worth it when their are much largee dwellings to see and explore that are much cheaper and/or free. It cost our family almost $50 since they charge by family and \u2026",
          "I came here as a kid and had great memories. Visited again recently as well. Seems a bit pricey at $10 (I believe) each for entry. I walked through the dwellings rather quickly then found myself meandering around the gift shop to kill time \u2026",
          "Amazing how well taken care of the dwellings are.  You can climb inside them and really explore it.  The museum isn't too big but it was very informative.   There is a huge gift shop with all kinds of souvenirs.   I really didn't see any wheelchair access.  $10 entrance fee is worth it.",
          "Great place to take the kids and interesting things to see",
          "My kids and I enjoyed this place. The real gem was the gift shop. So many really good quality souvenirs.",
          "Replicas just aren't the same. This stop was  primarily promoting the sale of trinckets. Tourist trap.",
          "Nice experience.  It was fun walking in the dwellings and taking pics. Would recommend for anyone",
          "freaking cool! great place to check out and learn something!",
          "Fun for the whole family. Loved that my toddler could touch and feel the dwellings and didn't have to keep quiet or still. The museum was very interesting",
          "It was an interesting experience.  Seeing the houses people made and lived. Learning how they lived and seeing the dishes they made. The gift shop was pretty big and had a wide variety of things.",
          "Real nice, I love history.",
          "Amazingly preserved piece of human history",
          "I went here 2 times I likeed it it's fun to go to",
          "We had such a great time learning the history of the folks that once inhabited the cliff dwellings and climbing through the rooms.",
          "Pretty tourist attraction - but, beware, that's all it is.  Much of the site is \"recreated\".  Very large giftshop is the majority of the space.  OK for something to do but don't be overly expectant.",
          "Interesting but a little over done on the mach up. Tourist stop.",
          "Very nice, large gift shop enjoyed it",
          "Very nice piece of history, and well preserved.",
          "Adults entrance fee was $10, kids $7.50.  Small, but enjoyable. Amazing people lived in them, although this was not the actual location of where these cliff dwelling was found.  A little museum led to the gift shop followed by more museum \u2026",
          "These Cliff dwellings are interactive, unlike most.you can climb in and on them and experience them. However there is not much to it. You can see everything within an hour.  after seeing the cliff dwellings there is a small museum / tourist trap gift shop you can go through.",
          "Get there early and you will have the place to yourself. Just beware that they do not open the gates until after they open. Also go to their website and there is a coupon to take $1 off per person.",
          "Great for school trips or taking kids.",
          "Interesting culture gifts shop",
          "Kind of small but definitely a unique place",
          "Very cool place, learned a lot of history.",
          "Pretty cool place to check out.",
          "The dwellings are Mesa Verde transaplants. You can climb in and roam around them. They're devoid of any artifacts for the most part. Personally, I found the museum much more interesting.",
          "Nice and priced accordingly. Very interesting",
          "Great!  Good day with history lesson.",
          "What a wonderful piece of history to be able to walk through and observe!",
          "Great place to go down time with the fam",
          "Very cool place. Highly recommended visiting",
          "Easy walking, not too big of a facility, great little shop.  I loved that we were able to walk in and view and touch the dwellings.",
          "This is a good tourist place to check out. There is an awesome musuem featuring the lifestyle of the native americans back then as well as a really cool gift shop that has all sorts of goodies for everyone. There is an area to look at the sights as well.",
          "Very cool! You can go inside and through the dwellings. Definitely worth it. Gift shop and museum portion is also very interesting. Don't be discouraged by the line of cars! There's always a line but it's deceiving.  Due to it being by a \u2026",
          "Interesting history of the cliff dwellers. amazing construction for just having stone tools.",
          "A tourist trap, sure. But the real cliff dwelling location is about 6 hours further. A decent place for the kids to learn about these Native American groups. Kinda pricey, but if you read everything it'll probably take 2-3 hours with kids.",
          "Fantastic field trip for a homeschool family. Prices were reasonable considering used for upkeep and such. They did offer a military discount that was so appreciated. \nWould recommend to everyone, very family friendly!",
          "Amazing to see Anasazi ruins from over a  thousand years ago. Nice museum with displays of how they lived.",
          "We loved the place.",
          "Amazing to see that families lived together in these tight communities. The fact that there was beauty in such rustic means of building was awesome!",
          "Good if you are interested in the culture, however there isn't much to do. \n\nThey also shoehorn TWO Gift Shops in the Museum Portion.",
          "Fun experience and interesting small museums.",
          "Self-guided tour through the dwelling. Although it's not the original location, it's still fascinating to learn about. The gift shop has three floors worth of stuff to purchase.",
          "The museum is very informative. It's neat to actually walk through the dwellings. Extensive gift shop with beautiful items. Cost to enter seems a bit high.",
          "It was a lot smaller than what I had imagined! Still interesting... you can do the entire tour and gift shop in less an an hour!",
          "Kids enjoyed climbing in and out of the\"house.\" I feel as though it was a lot of money for our family of 5 for there to be so little to see and do or interact with. It was good for a one time thing.",
          "Such a wonderful place \ud83d\udc95. Gift shop is wonderful. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Great piece of history. Nice area for families",

          "Awesome Place had a great time",
          "Small but unique and easy to get to.",
          "Was a great historical experience. Just only problem came when it became time to leave. When you exit the road that leads to the dwellings to go back to Colorado springs you must cross a busy highway and there was no room (as I found out) \u2026",
          "Somewhat suspect \"ancient cliff dwelling\" with plenty of modern day mortar holding it all together. Not exactly autentico.",
          "Very cool experience seeing these firsthand. And for $10? Money well spent.",
          "You get a peek at the ancient ways of community living at it's best! \nThe cliffs are surprisingly COOL in the Heat of the Summer. \nI feel we took So much from the American Indains and thier ways. You can SEE  by this Construction that has \u2026",

          "Field trip for school. Wonderful guides!!",
          "It's a great place to learn the history of our region",
          "An interesting piece of history here. You can climb in and out of Indian cliff dwellings. They have a small onsite museum dedicated to the Indians that lived in the area plus a well stocked gift shop.",
          "Quite a touristic place. The admission charge includes a museum and a gift shop. For an additional cost it was possible to take some pictures with some wolves.",
          "Museum was more a gift shop than museum, not advised with kids. Great place to spend alot of time trying to keep your kids from climbing. Overall a good waste of time if you are board.",
          "Beautiful site! Very interesting! Glad we visited!",
          "A wonderful place to go full of information about an ancient culture",
          "Great place to see history,  not worth the $.",
          "You can take pics with a wolf once a month. How great is that!",
          "Smaller than I thought but still a lot of fun! Love that you can walk through everything. The gift shop is HUGE and has something for everyone. Dogs are aloud everywhere, even the gift shop which is extremely nice! $10 a person seems kinda high. We were thinking $5 a person or $10 a car is fair.",
          "Awesome experience. Learned so much historical information about the region. Definitely recommend to others.",
          "Museum and replicate cliff dwelling experience is fun and enlightening but does not compare to the real deal in Mesa Verde, NM.",
          "Enjoyed the history and view. Glad we took the grandsons here. They were glad we went - ages 6, 9 & 11.",

          "Stole my time and money, obviously fake, had me thinking it was the Mesa Verde(actual ancient ruins) but instead was a cheap cement lookalike. \nHowever, great for kids. \nAlso coming in they give ya a free coupon for their fudge, but as it \u2026",

          "Too expensive for what you get. Was moved not natural and not too much to it. There was more gift shops than what to look at. Save yourself and either spend more time viewing at one of your other destinations or another place entirely.",
          "Beautiful well preserved cliff dwellings. The museum was pretty cool too.",
          "There are two main attractions here: a pueblo that was inhabited up until around the turn of thes last century and an early 1900s reproduction of an ancient cliff dwelling. The pueblo is fascinating, very well preserved and has been \u2026",
          "Kids had a good time exploring ancient housing options and comparing them to what we have now.",

          "It was quick and museum was small.  If you are interested in Native Americans its a must.",
          "I got the take an out of country friend to the Cliff Dwellings recently... as an architect student, she was really quite impressed with the dwellings. Just the same, I was proud the have such a unique and affordable attraction in our backyard. 10/10 worth it and would recommend. Pet friendly, so bring your llamas! \ud83e\udd95",
          "Interesting museum to learn about the natives in Colorado",
          "Interesting, but not a real cliff dwelling.",
          "Had such a amazing time with my wife exploring these old civilizations and feeling what they went through",
          "Very nice but a tad too expensive! If your desire is to contribute to the local Indian tribe it is well worth the cost. Take the time to fully explore the cliff Dwellings and the museum.",
          "Really neat place to visit and see the history,  great gift shop also.",
          "Great little stop in Manitou Springs. Great for the whole family! A walk through of the dwellings gives an authentic feel of what life may have looked like for the Native Americans who lived there.  During the walk through there were very \u2026",
          "Disappointed. A very small site - not much to see. We completed the entire tour in about 20 mins. Too expensive relative to what you will experience.",
          "This was very interesting to see, especially since we are not as familiar with Colorado Native American history as we are our local history.  I hope the charter and goal of this place is to increase awareness of these great people and that \u2026",
          "The cliff dwellings were fun to explore and read about the history. The gift shop was very tight and maze like but that's the only complaint.",

          "Loved it as a kid and loved taking my kids to be able to experience and see walk in around these things its amazing",
          "Its cool and interesting to look at, but your feet will HURT when your done walking through",
          "Not great but not bad.  The walking tacos were the best thing.",
          "An amazing period of Native American history which is beautifully depicted in the way of how the tribesmen in Colorado lived. I have been privileged to live in Santa Fe, New Mexico and visit Sedona, Arizona and seen the different how the Native American tribes lived in those areas too.",
          "Awesome place to visit. Amazing so take your time.",
          "It teaches about the past of how the Indian tribe lived as a community. The gift shop is also fantastic.",
          "This place was good to see and learn from. But my expectations were higher based on the photos I saw online. Just ok...... saw garden of the gods on the same day and that one was free and spectacular!",
          "I learned something new.",
          "Neat place to learn how it was done long ago!",
          "This place is an amazing stop to make with the family if you're spending time in Colorado Springs/ Manitou Springs. The dwellings themselves are fascinating, and the self guided tour plaques make for a great educational experience. Don't \u2026",
          "Was able to walk thru the dwellings; was like walking back in time. The gift shop and museum were also awesome!",

          "Interesting...really liked the museum and the gift shop!  Gift shop is HUGE!",
          "It was really cool to learn the history and see these dwellings even though they weren't the original dwellings.",
          "A must stop on visiting Colorado Springs.  Shop and museum is of a good standard.",
          "Tourist trap, but still fun for everyone",
          "This was an enjoyable day trip. Wonderful replicas of how and where Native Americans lived in this part of the country.",
          "Incredibly fascinating place to visit, the dwellings are fun to explore and the interior of the gift is actually unique.",
          "Very nice place to stop. We spent maybe 30-45 minutes here and learned a lot about the culture. It\u2019s a great first thing to visit in Manitou",
          "Super cool. It shows how all the I primitive Coloradans lived. And a good place for kids to run around.",
          "There's not much to this place for the price to get in and the gift shops are not legit from what I can tell in regards to traditional Native American craftsmanship.  There is some cool stuff there though.",
          "It's a must see. Very interesting and the gift shop is huge",
          "The site is smaller than we expected. They ask you buy the enter tickets right at the front gate. You have no way to peek before you paid.\nThe site is small. However the souvenirs shop is pretty informational. We enjoy get into the shop and discover some facts.\nStill a pretty good educational place to visit",
          "Interesting attraction, worth a visit, fun stop!",

          "Very cool. Interesting to see how people lived years ago.",
          "Great place to wander around",
          "Neat place .. fun for the family",
          "It was a very interesting place because of its great history. I'm only giving it three stars because it is not worth the price of admission. If you have money to burn or you're traveling and may never come back through this area it's worth seeing just once.",
          "Nice walk through history. Kinda disappointed that this was moved from its original place. The hill on your exit needs improvement as it was slick the day we was there because of rain, and was hard to walk up if there are older people they would probably have a had time.Nice gift shop and museum.",
          "Beautiful and interesting culture. Love the views. Really nice gift shop and museum.",
          "Always a great experience to learn about our history.",
          "Such a cool experience! A little spendy since the actual site is so small but overall really neat!",

          "Definitely something to go to and see if your in the area or passing through.",
          "Cliff dwellings were fantastic, not far from Colorado Springs at all.",
          "If you're interested in American history and native American history this is definitely a stop if you're in the Colorado springs area.",
          "Cool place to visit!  The gift shop was great and the employees were very nice and helpful.",
          "Loved it just so cool to see. Love Colorado Springs",
          "It was really neat. I wish they had more information about the history of the ruins. Overall, I am really glad we went.",
          "So cool. I wanna build some and live in them now.",
          "This place was pretty cool to see, but it was nothing compared to Mesa Verde National Park if you've ever been lucky enough to have gone there. There was almost more to see in the museum than the ruins themselves. I did love the deal they had on fudge where you buy 1 lb and get 1/2 of another lb free",
          "Decent museum, cliff dwellings very well done.  Very reminiscent of Montezuma's Castle in Arizona.",
          "Really cool but not as big as expected.",
          "It's an awesome Place recommend to go see",
          "Great Place to visit, lots of knowledge on the cave dwellings. Awesome history on all the tribes that were originally spread throughout the United States. There is also a 3 story gift shop, along with a nice historic museum.",
          "We had a great time.  Self guided tour.  You can use your phone and scan the QR code for an audible experience.  I like the signs and plants showing you what they used in the past for spices and medication.  Museum and gift shop good too.  Love the history!",
          "Stunning landscape giving home and testimony to an early agricultural society in the Americas. Small but well curated museum. Well worth a visit!",
          "Amazing experience, great scenic views and good for a quick history lesson.",
          "Don't waste your money, the gift shop is it's main focus. Two thumbs down.",

          "Took my grandson and we both really enjoyed it. Found this beautiful ring in the gift shop.",
          "Great little park. One of the few cliff dwellings you can actually walk through and is very well maintained.",
          "Love the place small but Nice place",
          "Fun walk thru museums with self guided tours of the homes. Very good photo opportunities and reasonably priced gift shops.",

          "Great place for kids and gift shop has good souvenirs",
          "Great little place, full of history.  You can walk through the dwellings.  I wish one would have had furnishings to really see how they lived.  Worth the trip.  Museum in the pueblo was well appointed with artifacts and gift shop.",
          "Are kids of walking around dwellings and said it was excellent my wife and I visited the museum Church card",
          "Very interesting little private Museum. The cliff dwellings were well maintained with an interesting story about about the inhabitants. Who's women we're the ones that had all of the property. The children belong to the women and they belong to the tribe. I believe it's worth the money",
          "Fun little stop to see some Native American history.",
          "They were interesting no doubt but it\u2019s too expensive for what is offered. Mesa Verde is truly unique, this was meh.",
          "Very educational. Nicely laid out. Staff was friendly",
          "Fun place to take the kids",
          "Fun and well priced for a quick visit! The tour was self guided and perfect for taking photos. The museum was very interesting as well with lots of information about the dwellings history.",
          "It was very fun! If you are close you should stop",
          "I've been to Colorado Springs more than anywhere else and I've never been here. I'm amazed at the history and care that's gone into keeping it safe and secure.",
          "Soo cool it must be seen",
          "Wish the wolves were there more... But awesome time as always....    Fun place.. Nice gift shop",

          "Good to see the place is still open since I was last here close to 20 years ago!!!",
          "Amazing condition native pueblos and an amazing gift shop/mini museum(its only one room)",
          "Cool ruins...but you can tell they restored alot of it...",
          "Great place to learn some history and crawl in some holes",
          "Gross, this \"ruin\" was torn down where it was built outside of Cortez, Co. It was rebuilt outside of Manitou and is utilized as a tourist trap. It feels gross. I'm embarrassed to have spent money getting through the gate. It would be easier \u2026",
          "I was loving this historical site. Great gift shop. So cool!",
          "Good place for little kids to explore and be able to go around ruins. Disappointed as an adult. Not much here to see or explore. Ruins are replicas.",
          "Gives you an idea of what a cliff dwelling is like.  Some history exibits.  Gift shop and snacks.",
          "It's very neat! Seemed like we spent more time in the gift shop.",
          "This was a great place to stop! Best gift shop in Colorado and great prices on tourist T-shirt\u2019s",
          "Awesome historical place. Remember there is some uphill walking for those who might have physical limitations.",
          "I understand it takes money to keep the place up, but $10/person is a bit steep for the little bit the have, especially since it starts at 12yo for the adult ticket.",
          "Super cool.                                                                   \nGreat sights and history",

          "Very nice place for a short walk and learn a little bit of history about native.",

          "It was Awesome!!  Very interesting.  A must see",
          "The museum here is wonderful for anyone interested in American Indian history. The gift shop here is large with an awesome array of items",
          "Ok very strap climbs on fut good everything else.",
          "Great place to check out. Really liked that you could walk through. A little expensive in my opinion for that and the small museum bellow the dwellings. Still liked it, family had fun, I would go again.",
          "Fascinating place to visit and learn how native Americans lived.",
          "Beautiful location. Contemplative and serene. But when I learned later that this is a construction from the early 1900\u2019s and the people that inhabited these type dwelling lived in SW Colorado, it diminished the experience. Worth seeing for the natural beauty and historical education, but know beforehand what exactly it is.",
          "A must see attraction.  Beautifully restored and kept with rich history and hands on experiences for adults and kids alike.  The museum is interesting and the 3 story gift shop has lots of treasures for everyone.",
          "Very interesting to walk through the cliffs and caves. Good scenic views.",
          "Very cool unique experience. recommend going in the morning to avoid the heat and the crowds.",

          "Well done but small and commercial",
          "Remarkably well preserved Native American Clift dwellings. It\u2019s real cool to walk from room to room with the self guided tour and try to imagine what life was really like living here centuries ago. They also have a huge gift shop here that \u2026",
          "Really interesting to see this and imagine what life was like for these folks!",
          "The cliff dwellings were really cool and the \"museums\" (gift shops) were some of the best gift shops I've been to.",

          "Been going here at least once a year for years, took my daughter for her birthday, only person working was to take our money at the gate. No one else anywhere, cafe closed, gift shop closed, but we weren't told any of that, so paid money for just about nothing. Can't get anyone to answer the phone for over a week.",
          "Tourist trap. Crowded and felt like a kids play ground. Kids were climbing up, on, and around things. It was a small place and very crowded. There wasn't a lot to see. Not worth the trip what so ever.",
          "Very historic,  lots of information about the Anasazi and Colorado native plants.  Easy to get around and the gift shop has a wide selection",
          "Interesting place to take a stroll. 10 per head but 1.5 off for seniors.",
          "I liked it but it was pricey. I also got sick there from eating at a place in town so maybe my view is skewed.",
          "Terrible tourist trap. Not real, nor original. Save the $10 and go somewhere else. Absolutely junk. Put the money toward a road trip to actual cliff dwellings.",
          "I have been wanting to see this gem since I was a kid. Great site, very small, but great",
          "A beautiful place to see. I only wish people held this place with more precedence. A beautiful piece of history.",
          "Amazing native architecture. Self guided tour. I am sure this place can get busy, but we visited late October and it wasn't very crowded. Nice gift shop, prices were reasonable.",
          "Really interesting and beautiful scenery. I would totally recommend bringing your family",
          "Great learning experience!",
          "I really enjoy and appreciate going to ser historical things. But this was pretty underwhelming and not even the original thing, but a replica since the original was destroyed by explorers and looters.",
          "This place has the potential to be very inretesting and educational. However, the gift shop is 4x the size of the actual cliff dwellings. There is very little educational material and there isn't even a staff member outside to explain to \u2026",
          "We've been to Mesa Verde National Park and this is much smaller but was very nice just the same. We did get to walk and clime through them unguided, which I always prefer. They are well maintained and were in very good shape.",
          "Beautiful. Very peaceful",
          "Another great place to check out.  Small, I thought it would be huge.  Had a military discount so was $9.45 for and adult",

          "This was one if the most fascinating locations we've visited this summer.  It was educational and you can't beat being able to climb around in ancient dwellings while learning about the people who lived there.  Absolute must for anyone interested in history and/ or Native American culture.",
          "A little bit of a tourist trap vibe - and trust me, coming from Florida, land of tourist traps, I can sniff them out - but doesn't detract from a glimpse at what life may have been like for the people of this culture. While these particular \u2026",
          "When coming to the cliff dwellings I thought it would be a lot bigger and take more time. It\u2019s not very big. But something to definitely see non the less. Loved my kids and I could crawl through it!",
          "A lot of reading, make sure to have time to read and explore.",

          "Great area to view and learn in the cliff dwellings and inside the museum.",

        "wiki": "Red Rock Canyon Open Space is a 1,474-acre (2.3 sq mi; 6.0 km2) city park in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  It is situated on the west side of the city, adjacent to Manitou Springs and south of U.S. Route 24.  The park consists of a series of parallel ridges (called \"hogbacks\") and eroded canyons, a continuation of the same sandstone rocks of the Fountain Formation that make up Garden of the Gods a few miles to the north.\nRather than being pristine conservation land, the park contains a number of reclaimed former industrial sites, including quarries, gravel pits, a gold refining mill, and a 53-acre (2.3-million-square-foot; 214.5-thousand-square-metre)  landfill.  The land parcels were purchased piecemeal by John George Bock in the 1920s and 1930s, and acquired by the city of Colorado Springs in 2003 for use as a recreational site.  Today the most visible scars from past exploitation of the land are the remains of the Kenmuir Quarry, which produced Lyons sandstone in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and the Gypsum canyon landfill, which operated from 1970-1986 and remains off-limits to park visitors.\nThe park contains many miles of trails of varying difficulty that wind through and around the rock formations, and is popular with hikers, joggers, and mountain bikers.  The park trails connect to the Intemann trail to Manitou Springs and the Section 16 conservation area to the south.  Technical rock climbing is allowed with a permit.\n\n\n== References ==\nCity of Colorado Springs - Red Rock Canyon\nFriends of Red Rock Canyon",

          "My husband and I went hiking here on suggestion of our Airbnb host. We loved it! It's a beautiful area with jawdropping landscapes. It was a lot less crowded than Garden of the Gods, if you are looking for a more quiet hike. Near the entrance, it looked like they had a separate",
          "Absolutely the best part of the trip. You must see a concert in this arena. Breathtaking. Would highly recommend to anyone!",
          "It\u2019s very pretty, we saw some wild deer! We were able to get very close to them. Personally I think there are better places to visit in the springs. There is a dirt bike track and a few paths, we weren\u2019t there very long as we got bored",
          "I hike here at least once a week with my dog. It's one of the many pleasures of living here; visitors should check it out.",
          "Went after breakfast for a nice walk it was nice seeing kids outdoors .Spent about an hour, parking was easy and free.",
          "Same kind of geologic formations as Garden of the Gods, with a beautiful lake. This is a park outside & walk or bike in place. Beautiful but not a must do.",
          "The hike to the Rock Quarry was an easy pace with a nice view. Not a whole lot to see, the lake had a scum film on top and the hike was short and sweet. I'm glad I did it but not worth visiting again.",
          "This is a less visited park, compared to Garden of the Gods, however is equally as stunning.Many good hikes, you can make it as hard or as easy as you want. Highly recommend you climb up in to the quarry area, it has great red rocks. We saw a lot of wildlife in this park.",
          "Tons of trails, from the relatively tame \"Hogback Valley Trail\" to the brutally thigh-burning \"Palmer Redrock\", this space has it all... rocks, dust, views, wildlife, and even lots of Geocaches. It's open longer than the sun is in the sky and there is LOTS of free parking.",
          "This place is so beautiful and offers a lot of options: a playground, a dirt-bike course, an off-leash dog park, and of course, hiking trails! We didn't make it far down the trail, but even so, this was well worth the time.",
          "Just decided to come out early this morning and take a nice walk. We don\u2019t live far from here while we are visiting for the month at our Airbnb we only went a few miles in and a few miles back we will come back during the week. What a great park to stroll and quiet not a soul",
          "I couldn\u2019t believe how close this was to some busy roads and city! It felt like a hidden gem. It was quiet and had so many different options for walks/hikes. We stuck to the easy and intermediate and it was gorgeous. I liked seeing the rocks by the water and quarry. Next time",
          "We have been here a couple of different times (in 2016 and again this past summer). We head here for a hike every time we visit. Beautiful place to spend some time outdoors!",
          "By far, this was one of our favorite areas to visit while in Colorado. There is a free parking lot, a sign with a map, and a vast area with multiple levels of hiking/walking trails for everyone. We enjoyed exploring as many as we could in a three hour time. It was a wonderful",
          "Red Rocks is a great place to go if you are short on time. It has a beautiful view but is not far from the city. There is a range of trail difficulties and lengths to choose from. The loop I normally take is about an hour an a half, but I have also gone up and down in as little",
          "Very good hiking with well-maintained trails. Beautiful views and an interesting feature in the old rock quarry. Good for all ages.",
          "We hiked around red rock canyon for several hours. Some of the trails are a little more difficult for people that dont normally hike and live in flatland ohio. The scenery is beautiful here! Bring a bottle of water!",
          "Take your choice of the several trails. We didn't get to lake side but, went to the right and saw the canyon. Solid rock lining the canyon and all the formations on the way there was just beautiful. Plenty of shade with the sunshine. A good workout. Pretty dusty but, worth",
          "I really enjoyed the stark beauty of the canyon. We had no trouble parking and it's a cool , nearly urban , park.",
          "Beautiful views. We were a little confused at first which trail to take, so we just started walking and eventually ended up doing a loop that consisted with parts of different trails. Take water with you and go for it! Be sure to look up and cheer on the cliff climbers :)",
          "My husband and I took a great hike/run through a few of the trails and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Saw a lot of mountain bikers and would love to go back and bike it!",
          "Went for hike as well as for senior photos. Fun to walk around and hills are not to overwhelming which is not always the case in this area.",
          "Really awesome place to visit near Colorado Springs. You can easily spend from 20 minutes to hours hiking around all the different trails",
          "Very nice park to enjoy the view. You can drive through and park in certain areas to enjoy the views or hike a trail. Free of charge so if you are in the area stop by and enjoy the sites.",
          "The Red Rocks are so beautiful. It was breathtaking to watch the sunrise from here. It was a short drive from Boulder, CO where we were staying on our vacation. A concert would be so lovely! Maybe next time.",
          "You can drive this , but you can see it on your way to Pikes Peak. We took a tour bus and it was much safer. The summit is 14,000 ft. at the top with a great gift shop and lots of picture oportunity's. If you have respiratory problems take an Oxygen Concentrator with you. The",
          "Lovely place to spend a couple of hours just taking in the peace and quiet and nature. Rock climbing areas if you're into that or just walking and enjoying bird watching etc.",
          "Not very crowded at all. Very peaceful and relaxing. We enjoyed sitting by the water and talking. There was not a lot of people there while we were there so it was perfect.",
          "So many trails here to hike! It's beautiful! You could easily spend all day here if you have the time. Lots of dog owners come here to walk their dogs. They are responsible enough to pick up after their dogs BUT they don't throw it in the garbage. We found so many doggie bags",
          "Beautiful scenery! If you are looking for fun hiking and no crowds, I would highly recommend Red Rock Canyon. Only downfall was we got lost and our 2 mile hike became a 5 mile hike. It was still a lot of fun. Just be sure to bring lots of water!",
          "The parking lot was full, but we didn't see many people during our short hike. Beautiful views. There were bikers, runners, families, and seniors (including us). Go early to beat the heat.",
          "Easy to park, free and interesting short walk. Smaller park than the others in the area, but worth the stop. Body of water at the top over the parking lot. Fair number of dirt bikes, but arrived late as they were leaving.",
          "What a great place to guide yourself through an easy or difficult climb. Watch the locals rock climb, bring a picnic, or walk your dog.",
          "Fantastic location, known for climbing ... but we only had time for a hike. Really lovely. The parking lots were filling up around 6 30 so we had to go to a secondary lot. Climbers note: registration required to avoid a hefty fine.",
          "We hiked about 3/4 mile up the top trail, looking at the red rock formations and the views of Pikes Peak on the way up, and looking at the Garden of the Gods on the way down. There were lots of birds in the bushes, and the cloud formations growing over the mountains were",
          "The views are amazing, but stay on the path and don't go climbing un the rock cracks or you may meet noisy friends *rattlesnakes*. But the hike is great, hot so sunscreen and water is a must! You will get your exercise!",
          "This is a gem. A fantastic place to go for a hike and enjoy the rock formations, distant vistas, fauna and flora. Even has 2 enclosed areas so that dogs can be unleashed and run. I don\u2019t think our furry friends enjoy the distant views of Pikes Peak (I didn\u2019t see any purple",
          "If hiking, biking, or rock climbing are your thing, Red Rock Canyon is where it's at! Miles of easy to moderate hiking. Which also means...miles of great biking. For climbers, enjoy over 80 sport routes!!!! And they are fantastic examples of Colorado sandstone climbing. Smear",
          "We had a good time here. Beautiful day, not crowded. We didn\u2019t go all the way through it but enjoyed what we saw. We aren\u2019t hikers but was able to here with rests occasionally.",

          "Stopped to do a little hiking through Red Rock Canyon. Although we reviewed and took a map at the trailhead off of highway 24, we just could not get our bearings on our short hike (user error). It was interesting watching rock climbers on some of the rocks and overall was an",
          "This is an unexpected wonder. Well-worth a hike. We took a hike in the late evening, which was ideal.",
          "We enjoyed hiking the trails and climbing the rocks. The scenery was beautiful with a deep blue sky The grand children had a great time exploring.",
          "Wanted to see some cool scenery in the afternoon between lunch and dinner. Saw alot of ppl comparing this to garden of the gods so we thought we could swing by. So its super small, one way style drive that quickly dead ends to a parking lot. Unless there is more to do hidden",
          "Something for everyone. Beautiful rock formations and trails canoe as long or short as you would like.",
          "The hikes are easy, the rewards are the grand views of Pikes Peak. Do take water as it is best to stay hydrated.",
          "After being in the car for 12 hours, this was a welcome site! We enjoyed watching the dogs play in the dog parks and discovering new-to-us paths and rocks along our hike. Beautiful view everywhere!",
          "We took a tour of the area and went to see the museum. It was quite interesting but it sure would be nice to hear a concert,.",
          "We stopped at Red Rock Canyon Open Space in the morning as we were heading to Pikes Peak. There were many trails to hike in order to see the awesome red rock formations of Red Rock. Every turn of the trail revealed a new formation, spectacular in the morning sun. There were",
          "Took our son, his wife and grandchildren including stroller for a hike. Beautiful park with all kinds of trails, road and walking paths were suitable for young children. Lake/pond view was beautiful. We even had deer coming down to the water in the early evening. Birds,",
          "We loved Red Rock Canyon almost as much as Garden of the Gods. It was more of a hiking experience - dirt or rocky trails with options for every skill level. We took lots of pictures. The views of the rocks were amazing. A lot of people had their dogs with them. We started early",
          "Some locals told us about this spot. Much less crowded than garden of the gods but same rock formations. Park in the southeastern most lot and you will see where they cut into the mountain to send the rock to quarries, 4 foot deep, 7 feet high and 10 feet long",
          "This is a beautiful park in Colorado Springs, CO. We did the drive since we were short on time. There are some trails you can take but make sure you only do what you can handle and stay hydrated. Will definitely come here again when in the area.",
          "We had been to Red Rocks Canyon numerous times before but took a new trail on the west side of the park and loved it. Fairly easy trail, great views and varying terrain. The other trails are fun, too!! Great place for a hike or bike! Hiking boots are not necessary. You can spend",
          "this is a real beautiful area. the red rock contrasts nicely with the green pine trees. very cool trails and obstacles for mountain bikers and even a large dog park.",
          "Whatever your ability, this stretch of land ( which nearly became a resort golf course) has trails of various lengths and degrees of difficulty. Immensely popular on weekends, parking can be an issue, but you will not become bored with all the choices! Wear hiking boots if",
          "Went to see the facility, wow, super acoustics, and great parking. Had lunch and took pictures of the layout, super !",
          "This is one of our favorites. Please respect trail etiquette and look out for critters big and small. Scenery and trail selections are always amazing. Post-snow hikes and early a.m. mtb rides are our favorites!",
          "Great place to just relax, and enjoy mother nature at her finest. Whether you just drive through, or stop to take a break you will enjoy this beautiful park. Great part of the West side of Colorado Springs.",
          "One of the most beautiful canyon drives that is FREE! I love driving up here and enjoying a wonderful picnic by the beautiful stream. So peaceful and relaxing! Lots of hiking trails, and a bike route also. Overall, one of my favorite places on earth!",
          "There are several biking and hiking loop with scenic views of the slanted rock rock formations. Good for a few pictures. I was warned of recent thefts at parking lot. Good restaurants close by like Front Range bbq and Wimberger bakery.",
          "This is another great spot to hike when you have a little time. If you are heading from COS to Manitou you can stop and take a short hike.",
          "This was a great little park. Beautiful and not super crowded. Great well marked trails for hiking, biking, riding horses or walking your dog.",
          "Excellent park with one of the funnest trail system in the city. Jumps, cross county, climbs, and downhill. Pretty much everything you could want for MTB in the city. Dogs abound and access is great. Close to food and adult beverages for post ride too! One problem, crime seems",
          "We came here for a short hike in the morning. The scenery is absolutely stunning. Trails are pretty well marked. They even have specified trails for those who have dogs and want to walk them without leashes. Easy to find, convenient location.",

          "Was a little warm this day. so we did not hike far. Maybe about 3 miles. what we say was beautiful almost as good as Sedona",
          "This is a very nice area to walk through and do some moderate hiking. There a some tricky climbs in which you might twist your foot, slip, etc. So, if you plan to climb, proper shoes/boots is recommended. Otherwise the trails can be walked with gym shoes. You can spend quite a",
          "This is a great place to spend part of a day hiking. It is dog friendly & has two fenced off areas where the dogs can be off leash. It has a good view of Garden of the Gods. The trails are well maintained and easy. Parking can be a challenge but if the front lot is full go",
          "Beautiful red rock formations surround this former rock quarry. Both easy and difficult well marked hiking trails. There is ample parking in front or just off to the left of the main lot. Dogs are welcome but are required to be on leash. And if you do take your furry friend",
          "Many trails to choose from, all scenic. A nice alternative to the too-crowded Garden of the Gods. There's a trail that allows dogs off leash, which is nice to know if you have a dog, or if you want to avoid that trail. I think all the trails here are fairly easy walking.",
          "Lots of trails in a beautiful area close to Manitou Springs. Trails vary and you can create long loops with combining. A lot of people can be here during good weather. Easy to hike even in winter.",
          "I hike Red Rock Canyon at least one day every two weeks in the summer, spring, and fall. With something like forty miles of trails and access to other trail systems in the Colorado Springs area this place is a gem. A former quarry it gives a glimpse of a bygone age and yet",

          "We were staying in the city and wanted to get out and see some of the area. So glad we chose to come here. We hiked the calico tanks trail and it was really beautiful. If you hike all the way up it is a spectacular view of the city and park down below. it is a bit challenging",
          "My favorite place to MTB. There are a few access points, and all provide great, diverse opportunities for riding. You can get some easy trails, a lot of climbing, some pretty technical track, and bomb some downhills. Diverse terrain as well, where you can ride through forest,",
          "Hiked several hours around this park. Had some pretty views and cool rock formations. Watch out for bicyclists on the trails they are going fast.",
          "We hiked about 4 miles here. The elevation was tough after awhile and there isn't much shade, but glad we went. Not as picturesque as some of the other many sites we visited in beautiful CO, but glad we went. On one of the tougher parts of the trail, narrow dirt path with a lot",

          "I love Red Rock Canyon because it gives you the same beauty of Garden of the Gods with a fraction of the traffic. This canyon has a much more local crowd and more natural beauty without the roads or pathways. You'll be glad you came.",
          "We hike and bike in this park every month of every year. It\u2019s close to home, however access is difficult unless one drives there. Crossing hwy 24 is death defying on bicycles and entering from 31st street really isn\u2019t much fun nor very scenic. There are awesome trails and people",
          "They called this an \"open space\" and you could spend an entire day exploring it! There are several levels of trails, we started on the easier one and somehow ended up on the difficult trail. As always, I was glad I took my trekking poles, because some of the trail was very",

          "There's a handy picnic spot near the parking lot (beware\u2014the portapotties are disgusting). There are many well-marked paths of different difficulty levels. We didn't walk too much, but the quarry area was quite interesting. Lots of red rocks!",

          "This is a great place for visitors new to the area to hike and acclimate to the altitude. It isn't a strenuous hike but long enough to get a good workout. The proximity to restaurants in Old Colorado City and Manitou also is a plus.",
          "You really cant see much from a car. Toilets are portaloos and were absolutely disgusting. Perhaps its only for hikers",
          "This area is less crowded than Garden of the Gods but has really nice hiking trails and some very nice red rock. The views are great if you do the Mesa Trail. There\u2019s a quarry and some off leash dog areas I was afraid it would be full of dog poo but it wasn\u2019t. You can see",

          "A positive surprises - not the Great Canyon, yet very interesting and much close. The tour is actually one-way ride with several stops, some walking around, watching picturesque landscape. If you have a good guide, like Captain Jack from Pink, it gets even better!!!",
          "My wife and I went there to hike around. We did an intermediate trail and had fun. Our only complaint was that some of the paths were not very noticable so it was hard to tell which direction to go. We went down one path and ended up have to go down a very Rocky path. When we",

          "Wonderful place to relax, hike and take in the beauty. There are several trail options that can be combined for a longer hike. The trails are not as busy as some other trails in the area. There is plenty of parking when I visited early morning.",
          "If you don\u2019t have too much time, you shouldn\u2019t go. If you do, stop. We tried to go the amp hits there but it was closed for a concert, so check when you go if you want to go inside",
          "The views are spectualar. Great hiking trails. Abundant wild life. Close to Denver. Great outdoor seting for a concert",
          "This is much less well known than the nearby Garden of the Gods but it is no less spectacular. Excellent hiking!!! highly recommend.",
          "In this park make sure you have your tennis shoes on because the trails are sandy and there are hills (but not steep) to walk or ride your mountain bike on. This is one of my fave places to walk because it is so beautiful. For those that rock climb there are plenty of bolted",
          "This is a short distance from the Gods and deffo worth a stop .. stunning rock formations and stunning views .",
          "We visited Red Rocky on our last evening of vacation. Enjoyed the trails and views. Lots of rock climbers and mountain bikers there.",
          "as a beginning to the Garden of the Gods, take it all in. So worth it. Manitou is the town from which to begin the road trip into the red rocks.",
          "Red Rock Canyon is gorgeous! We took our mountain bikes and rode the trails and saw some beautiful views! The only complaint, beware of the flies! They were terrible the day we visited. We had bug spray and that helped, but they bite!",
          "When God created this place he spared no beauty in nature the colors change as the sun covers the rock formations. Not to be missed when visiting Colorado Springs",
          "Perfect for all levels....short walk to the breath taking lake....plenty of trails to explore, and tons of back country trails for bikers. Enjoy!",
          "We visited red rock canyon open space to take a morning hike around the loop. It was so peaceful and serene and the views were breathtaking!",
          "I had not planned on visiting this 780 acre city-owned park, but on the spur of the moment pulled into the parking lot and checked the trail map. I chose the Mesa Trail thought in retrospect I should have taken one of the trails leading to the ponds. The trail was easy going,",
          "In a recent trip to Colorado Springs I had Red Rock Canyon on my list of stops as a friend had previously been to the area and suggested it as a nice trail for my daughters. Though it was pretty hot that day we managed to take a short trail and visit the lake and do some",
          "This area offers beautiful sights on easy trails. This is a great way to experience some wonderful Colorado hiking without having to get too far out of town.",
          "This was our first stop, killing time until Garden of the Gods opened and we totally felt like we stumbled upon a gem. There is a skate park, dog park, lake view, I totally recommend exploring and spending more than an hour or two here. We are going to come back and explore",
          "My sister and I were wondering if this would be different enough from Garden of the Gods to justify a visit, but it really was. It felt like wandering through a desert set, with rattlesnakes and vibrant rocks. I would recommend going off the beaten path and exploring the side of",
          "This is the most fun your eyes will ever have within the confines of a major city. The red rocks are fantastic, and the thoughtfully laid out trails make for fine viewing. Be sure to bring your camera. Trails are a delight to hike or mountain bike, and some connect to more",

          "Enjoyed a couple of hours at Red Rock Canyon on our first day in Colorado Springs while waiting to check in at our hotel. We all thought it was a great place to hike with some interesting rock formations to look at along the way. Lots to explore here and even saw some folks",
          "This is a nice, free park to hike in. We didn't hike and extreme amount but there are nice views within the few miles we did. It definitely isn't as 'amazing' as some of your higher areas but a nice use of time.",
          "Very disappointed after visiting Garden of the Gods. Would go do something different. Lots to do in Colorado Springs.",
          "Enjoyed our visit to the area. Not nearly as busy as Garden of Gods. Lots of wide trails and places to explore right up next to the rocks. The pond was only a short walk from the main parking area. Was fun watching the bright orange fish swim around. Was worth the time to stop",
          "Have been to Red Rock Canyon twice now and have enjoyed myself both times. There is a map in the parking lot that shows various trails and its difficulty. Great views of Garden of the Gods in the distance, a pond where there's often ducks/geese. If you walk far enough in theres",
          "We stopped here spontaneously as we drove by and were pleasantly surprised. Good trails and beautiful views!",
          "Walked here with my baby daughter and loved it. Beautiful space with manageable walks and lots of route options. Lovely view of Garden of the Gods too.",
          "Good for all ages! Dog friendly, they also have a off leash hiking trail for dogs. Great views you can see Pikes Peak, the incline and Garden of the Gods.plus enjoy mother nature and so animals. We saw deers, squirrels and birds on the trails.",
          "Just moved to the Springs but this is already an early favorite. There are so many paths and trails that you could hike here all the time and never take the same path. Some areas for dogs as well, so the entire family can come.",
          "Walked twice over the span of two days, amazing! Great with the dogs too, lots there so it's great when all are social. Goes for miles and miles it seems. Very photographic!",
          "Nice place Really amazing. You can meet the wild life A place to visit when you are In CS It is free. Why to not stop by!?",
          "If you only have a few minutes and live in the southern part of Colorado Springs, this is a decent walk. Dogs love it, but there are so many better hikes in the area. Trails.com can lead you to a multitude of trails, but again, this one is quick and easy.",
          "Definitely a tourist thing to do. There's a nice little gift shop and places to park to see some of the sights. Definitely worth a few hours if you're in the area, but probably not a destination.",
          "All skill levels will find a trail to explore at Red Rock Canyon. There were joggers, hikers, bikers, strollers, dogs, elderly, youngsters--yes, it's a place for everyone. We hiked a short loop into the park, near the canyon, around cool rock formations. Great views of Pikes",
          "Pretty easy hike. Trails are great, with lots of trees, but narrow at times. View of the lake is pretty awesome.",
          "We went over to Red Rock Canyon open space because we arrived too early for Pikes Peak, but it ended up being one of our favorite stops. We parked in the second parking lot and hiked around for about 2 hours. We got lots of great sights and hiking in. It was not crowded which",
          "great way to spend some extra time to exercise while enjoying the view of the red rocks. Make sure to wear some sunscreen, there is no shade. lol",
          "Nice hiking trails with easy access, benches to rest at and an up-close view of the landscape. We really enjoyed the easy walk to view the landscape. We even got to see some of the wildlife: deer and birds. Well worth seeing.",
          "We actually just stopped in here early one morning as we were too early for where we were going for the day. We parked and walked about 45 minutes. We practically had the place to ourselves. Nice views and trails.",
          "My Hiking buddy and I trekked multiple loops thru out the Canyon and were not disappointed. It is a well maintained public park that charges no fees , stunning vistas and an easy drive from most resorsts and hotels.",
          "you willl never see such red colours again.... they seem a little bit unreal.... look at the different forms, you will see... plates, rocks, hoodoos....",
          "We hiked for almost two hours at Red Rock with our 9 & 10 year old children. We appreciated the trail\u2019s having difficulty ratings. They had a blast on the more challenging trails. Be sure to bring water to stay hydrated. We found that taking a picture of the trail map was",
          "Red Rock Canyon is a long, straight canyon that, amazingly enough, is surrounded by sheer walls of red rock. It is especially interesting that this canyon was originally a quarry. There is a section on the right side about half a mile in, that clearly shows where pieces of",
          "This is a beautiful place to hike. Its close proximity to Colorado Springs makes it an easy day trip. The rock formations are amazing and the area holds a lot of history. A morning hike is best because it can get pretty hot in the afternoon.",
          "There are masses of walking and cycling tracks to chose from. You decide how long or far you want to go. Plenty to see from the red rocks, the quarry and the ponds. Head up into the hills to get stunning views down over Colorado Springs and Manitou Springs. Lots of parking",
          "I have traveled around the world extensively and can truthfully say that this entire area is one of the most beautiful places for sure. We love the natural beauty of the Red Rocks everywhere and all the super cool rock formations not to mention the clean, crisp air. Make sure",
          "First - I am a tourist so I understand that locals won't have the same comments that I do. After hiking at Garden of the Gods I was expecting a little bit more signage at Red Rock so I know where to hike. I would never hike off the trail intentionally, but I was a little lost",
          "Always a good hike. I go there frequently so had limit the travel time down to just the most recent trip which was on the Section 16 loop.",
          "So easy to get to with plenty of parking. The maps are great and you can decide how far you want to walk. The hike will certainly clear your head but can still see town from the hills which I usually want to forget about. Great place to take the dog with a dog run too.",
          "Driving through Red Rock Canyon was fantastic. Plus, it's free. Several times we got out and the kids can lend up the rocks and things like that. The views are amazing. Roads are well maintained. It was just a nice drive for the whole family",
          "I am always impressed with the different shades of red you see in the rock formations. The formations themselves are pieces of wonder and then add the color. Makes for a sight you'll be very happy you took the time to see and share.",
          "Our long hiking trip in Colorado after 20 hours trip started here as we needed few days to get climatized before the hikes in Pikes Peak etc.... we had a whole day trek - took wonderful pictures... parking may be a problem if you arrive late... early mornings and late",
          "Nice trail system, especially the upper trails. But too many dogs off leash on the trails. The city apparently cannot control all the people ignoring leash laws. Also, cars have been broken into. I stopped coming here for these reasons.",
          "This is a wonderful tour of the incredible red rocks, which are huge and all different sizes. Some are very unique and it is amazing to stop and walk to get closer to them.",
          "We try to take the kids out hiking at least (minimum) of once a month. Both our boys (9 & 10) love the Red Rocks open space. There is plenty of trail and terrain for them to feel like they're exploring.",
          "Plain and simple, it is gorgeous and worth the visit. I have found my new favorite place in the world!",
          "The park has a large variety of trails to walk or bike with differing levels of effort required. On a warm day bring water. Great scenery from stone outcroppings, old quarry sites, and mountain views to the west. Large parking lots on the north and smaller lots on the east",
          "A sight to see. You can drive through it and see such a wide geography and colors. Go in the gift shop.",
          "This is a excellent spot to take your dog bike or family for a walk they're such beautiful views there's not much parking",
          "Beautiful area, so much to see and do. Theres bicycing, runners, and hikers. Families that are taking a day to explore..",

          "We love hiking here because there are great views and a good variety of trails to choose from, whether you\u2019re hiking or mountain biking. We also love that it\u2019s less than 5 min from our house... very easy to get to from Old Colorado City area.",
          "My son and girl friend went on a hike there with my husband and daughter. They had a great time. Not to strenuous for those not acclimated to altitude. Beautiful views.",
          "This was a fun place to visit. It's got some nice trails. Unfortunately I didn't get to spend as much time there as I would have liked. Definitely worth going back to.",
          "We walked one of the shorter routes at the canyon. Being there in the fall made the place look wonderful, the lovely reds and yellows of the trees were beautiful. There is plenty of parking, although I should imagine it get pretty busy on the weekend.",
          "This is a must see in my opinion. The scenery once you get up a little on the trail is absolutely gorgeous and worth every step taken. We were actually there around the time the sun was going down and the pictures don\u2019t even do it justice. It\u2019s so beautiful.",
          "You can bring your dog on a leash. Trials on red clay so can be difficult with ground is wet. Also bring a pair of shoes to switch to after your hike. Just off I24 headed West. Enjoy.",
          "In the area for a business trip and had some time to explore the area. It was beautiful and very peaceful to get some exercise outdoors.",
          "If you are in the area in the Spring, Summer or Fall plan to attend a concert here. You wont regret it! One of the best places to see a concert. Great acoustics, with Colorado backdrop.",
          "I have never seen this place too crowded, it's like the best kept secret in Colorado Springs. There are many trails of all kinds of levels of hiking and the views are very cool. This used to be part of an old quarry. You can see where they cut the stone. There is a pond at the",
          "There is a trailmap in the parking lot, but none of the trails seemed to be marked with signage and it was very difficult to tell what was a \"path\". We tried following three or four different trails which surround a couple of rock formations. It was not that interesting and I",
          "Spectacular views, would have received 10 if facilities were open past 2! Wonderful views close to center city but you feel like miles away. Different trails and lengths , but all with views!",
          "So have a few hours to kill. The locals told me to go to Red Rock Canyon and walk the trails. Some of them get pretty strenuous and you need to be acclimatized to the altitude if you do not live here but it is so worth the trip. We went on a cool day so layering is very",
          "GO GO GO !!! < so fun, spend a morning , have a picnic. Great for any age or ability , easy parking, shade and sun, outstanding , can't wait to go again !",
          "I entered at Red Rock Open Space which is very easy to get to right off the 24 freeway. A good amount of parking. I'm sure on weekends this place fills up. Nice place to explore. Great scenery. Once you get away from the noise of the freeway it just gets better. Hiking trails",
          "We loved the canyon, wonderful and beautiful. No crowds trails are well marked. Plenty of parking, would go there again.",
          "It's more of an exercise park than a sight seeing park. There's trails to walk on, bike trails, a bike course, and a small lake. I'm not a big hiker, or exerciser, or anything that usually has to deal with being outside, so the hike up was a little rough. But as long as you are",
          "Neat!!! I knew it was there, but I didn't know, it is the beautiful complimenting hiking park of the Garden of the Gods:) It is right across Highway 24, heading North down Ridge Road coming out of the Garden. Be aware they are doing construction, Oct '17. Worth the stop.",
          "A good choice of trails based on activity level. The views are great and even views of Garden of the Gods. This used to be a rock quarry over a hundred years ago, and you can see where they cut the slabs. Colorado Springs never looked prettier at these views. The lake is",
          "Terrific place for a leisurely walk among some spectacular rock formations. 0r, a more strenuis hike above the valley floor.",
          "Very scenic, and had very little traffic on it. Great for picture taking, with several turn offs. Due to little traffic, was even able to go slow and stop in road (obviously check for traffic)",
          "This is a very popular place to hike, walk dogs and get some fresh air. We just started birding in the past year and were pleased to see a nice variety of birds. A friend of ours took us out to see what birds there were to see yesterday. Ebird should have a checklist of the",
          "Views are awesome, but if you are going take the time to paint the rocks why not paint them multiple colors to be more interesting? I want to see some blue rocks. Also moving the amphitheater closer to Denver would be ideal.",

          "Beautiful park and very easy access from Hwy 24. You could not ask for a better park. Great views of Pikes Peak, great parking, easy access into and out of the park. The trails are well defined and their are many trail options for all types of hikers. Great family get away. Or a",
          "Red Rock is an amazing place for a leisurely hike or a technical hike. The views are breathtaking and the trail options are endless. We spent half a day here and hiked an inner trail as well as the outer rim trail. The park does fill up on the weekends but you shouldn't have any",
          "Spectacular rock formations within easy reach of Colorado Springs. A beautiful place to hike, picnic, or take in the morning views which are spectacular when the morning sun is out. Garden of the Gods in a smaller package and well worth the visit.",
          "Being an outdoor kinda guy and having a wife that never sits still we are always looking for something to do. Over the past few years we have walked all Red Rocks finding new ways from one side of it to the other. Four years ago we walked just the main part and got board with",

          "We spent the better part of a day hiking the many trails in the Red Rock Canyon. Also enjoyed the CO Rock and Roll Museum which is part of the gift shop. It was great to see some volunteer groups out maintaining and improving the trails as this place is so beautiful!",
          "rock formation were unbelievable. This was a wonderful place to enjoy nature. We drove back roads to get there. We could look at Pikes Peak",
          "Visited this place after Garden of the Gods. I almost wish we went here first - the scenery is beautiful - so many red rocks! Plenty of trails to hike, and not too difficult. This is a place that would appeal to everyone - and it's FREE. Plenty of parking, and portable toilets",
          "Do not miss is amazing site donated by he family to the city-well maintained and fun, fun, fun!!! The red rocks are beautiful and if my back was good great place to hike",
          "Hadn't planned to go here but we sure are glad we did. Wonderful trails to explore and see the red rocks. It was fun to see the multitude of volunteer groups grooming the trails. The people of Colorado appreciate the natural beauty in their state. There was a wedding going",
          "So beautiful a must see, if you enjoy the outdoors!!.... wear comfy clothes and shoes...and take a camera!!",

          "its great hiking place, water, rocks, views, close to town, not crowded, its free, so what do you want for free",
          "This hike is one of the easier hikes in Colorado. It's dog friendly and I've seen a lot of younger kids doing this hike as well. You can go as long or as short as you want. There's a lake around there too that has beautiful views!",
          "I've been to the Springs numerous times, but had never stopped here. I was pleasantly surprised. Miles of trails and some gorgeous views. So much less touristy than GOTG. For walking the trails, I would choose this place 100 times over GOTG. I can't wait to go back and",

          "Good to hike through to see the different formations and views found throughout your trek. It is roughed and but well worth the effort.",
          "Good parking available, excellent maps during the hikes on trails. Lots of beginner to moderate hikes available as well as some rock climbing. Not overly technical. I appreciate that dogs must be leashed except on the \"off leash area trails\"",

          "Have a small dog and a small boy and they both enjoyed the park. The more narrow trails were a bit more natural and less traffic. The east side of the park by the quarry is the best.",
          "We enjoyed Red Rock even more than Garden of the Gods. It was less touristy, easier to get up close to the rocks, with a great variety of trails to follow. Really amazing colors and views.",
          "A nice area to walk around, albeit a smaller scale version of Garden of the Gods. Apart from the rock formations the quarry is interesting and the lake is very picturesque",
          "better than garden of gods, less crowded. very enjoyable. The area was clean, there were porta-potties to use though. really enjoyed, there was a large aggressive Rottweiler out in the field unleashed and unsupervised which I later saw trying to attack a passing car. Gave me",

          "We hiked around here one evening. A great city park! An easy walk through the park. We did climb up to the top of a ledge on a safe path, across the top and back down the other end on a path. There are climbing pins established for climbers. We also did the Garden of Gods and",
          "Maybe we didn't venture far enough but this park was not the most scenic nor the cleanest. While there were some sparse red rocks, and some wildflowers, there was not much else. We walked to a lake and then back to the parking lot.",
          "This is a very accessible city park for hiking miles and miles (I think about 16 miles total). The trails are not technically difficult as they are all well marked but they can be steep in areas. Wear comfortable shoes and bring water. There are no toilet facilities except at",
          "Red Rock Canyon Open Spaces is exactly that. An open space amidts Red Rock. It's an old quarry that has a trail system that allows you to wander through. It's fairly well marked, with some beautiful scenery. The difficulty of the hikes available seem to vary. We showed up at",
          "Decided to drop in here because I always drive pass it going to Pikes Peak. What a great place to just take the kids and or your dogs for a walk or a run. There is a BMX area and a couple off leash areas for your dogs. There are several trails with differing difficulty",
          "This place was great and our kids loved it. Miles of trails with varying degrees of challenge, beautiful scenery, and plenty of rocks to climb. This is definitely a must-visit in the Manitou Springs area, and best of all it's free. I wish we'd had more time to spend there.",

          "Red Rock Canyon is awe inspiring like Garden of the Gods. It's a continuation of the red rock formations and many were quarried back in the day. This is a place for contemplation if alone. You can connect to other trails as well & end up over by Pikes Peak if you are on a bike",
          "We took grandkids for hike where they found their own private \"ninja trail\" at the base of red rock cliffs. They found \" water slides\" in the unique rock formations at the edge of the pond. We picnicked under the shelter of red rock pavilion when rain threatened and we saw a",

          "It's a really nice park. The rocks are quite amazing. If you are from the east, you will be amazed at the large spine formations. The hikes are nice and not too demanding. We've taken families on hikes there. Since it's close to Manitou Springs, it's kind of close to Garden of",
          "Really nice hiking very near downtown. Can't get lost. Lots of map boards (take a picture! ). Make sure to see the Quarry",
          "Billed as a \"mini-Garden of the Gods\" without all of the \"busy-ness\" and hype, this park offers several miles of hiking trails, as well as spectacular scenery. You can get a great view of the Garden from Mesa or Greenlee Trails. Get there early, and avoid the weekends.",
          "We had a great little ride here. It had variety and various levels of difficulty. There was a very technical part that required body armor. It looked pretty serious- we didn't try it. The rest offered some good trails. Loved seeing all the dogs here. Note: there was an off",

          "Red Rock Canyon Open Space is definitely worth a stop if you're looking for a place to hike. There are many different trails of varying difficulty that weave in and out of each other. We often ended up not on the trail we intended to be on, but always made it to where we wanted",
          "If there's one thing Colorado Springs doesn't lack, it's the many places to go hiking. Red Rock Canyon Open Space has varying levels of difficulty for all levels of hikers as well as some scenic points that are great for taking in nature's beauty. There is rock climbing",
          "Although I didn't think the rock formations were as spectacular at Garden of the Gods, I did enjoy a walk through this peaceful and beautiful canyon. Large Garden of the Gods formations are visible in the distance as you enjoy the serenity of this canyon. You may even see",
          "We stayed in a vacation rental not far from this amazing, free park. It was hot in the beginning of August so going early was the best. We hiked and we were able to go up to the top of some areas with trails. Arriving at the top was amazing as each way you looked it was an",
          "We have hiked this park several times, but most recently with an 11 year old and infant. The trails are varied enough for any age and activity level. We had a picnic lunch and there are several beautiful spots to choose from! It wasnt as crowded as GoG and is more for actual",
          "Beautiful area to hike. Many trails, all marked for difficulty. All the red rock is so pretty. Some bodies of water that make everything even prettier. We went near dusk one night and saw numerous deer. Also lots of bunnies both times we went. Wish I lived nearby! I would",
          "Great biking paths, expect to climb up for a while before you feel you are out in the wilderness. They do have a great obstacle course for bikes at the bottom that is a ton of fun to ride",
          "This is the place you need to visit to get the real feeling of the outdoors and admire the canyon and the stunning dry scenery .",
          "Large parking area, wide trails. Relaxing and enjoyable for an afternoon walk about. Part of the canyon was a quarry where the rock was used to build several buildings in Colorado Springs and surrounding area.",
          "I've twice taken my daughter and a friend to Red Rock Canyon Open Space for painting and photography. The hike to the place of the activities was do-able but strenuous for all of us. But there were LOTS of people, both children and adults, hiking further than we did and",
          "We spent the day hiking through the open space and mining areas. The trails are well maintained. They have a bike only area as well. You can spend days hiking the different trails. Take plenty of water!",
          "Loved the trail. Quiet place. Friendly people (walkers, not staffed). Great area. Can't wait to go back!",
          "Red rocks offets many beautiful views and so much wildlife. There are trails for exploring and the concert venue is the best i have ever been to. So much to see and not too far from town. I visit regularly just to explore or spwnd time with nature.",
          "When in Colorado Springs, a drive through the Red Rock Canyon should be on your agenda. You will enjoy many breath-taking sites throughout the canyon. For the more adventurous, pull off onto one of the pull offs and take a walk among the rocks. Pack a picnic lunch and enjoy",
          "Garden of the Gods too crowded for you?? If so, check out Red Rock Canyon Canyon, it is similar but much less crowed. Many of the trails are loops or connect with other trails, you can make your hike as long or short as you want. In terms of difficulty, most trails are either",
          "I have been here many times and always hike the longest route. It takes about an hour and the terrain is variable throughout the hike. Also get to see Garden of the Gods without the crowds!",
          "The main draw in town is Garden of the Gods, but this place is just as good and almost no one is there. Plenty of trails to walk. Looks like a good mountain bike area though we were just walking. The views are great. It really is just like a normal local park, but it happens to",
          "It is accessed from residential areas and relatively quiet apart from a few dog walkers, joggers and walkers. There is wonderful countryside, spectacular views and lots of choices of routes. A very enjoyable walk.",
          "A good place to walk off a hardy lunch or Dinner lol . To me it was like a locals place to ride a bike or walk or hike a little & walk your dog . Mostly dirt trails",
          "We saw beautiful red rocks, a peaceful lake, and a cool, old rock quarry. The scenery was comparable to Garden in the Gods, but with alot less people. It's free!",
          "An extremely beautiful walk. The walking paths are relatively flat and are suitable for everyone. The roadway has a dedicated bike lane which allowed you to see the whole area and avoid having to find a parking space.",
          "Unfortunately, we got caught in a sudden rain storm with hail so had to hustle back to the parking area. But we did have an hour of beautiful, easy hiking. Just walk on the trail and take in the beautiful red rock formations. There is a porta potty in the parking area to use",
          "Enjoyed the Red Rock Canyon Open Space area very much. The lake was beautiful as well. Lots of trails.",
          "If you're looking for a quiet walk/hike away from the hustle and bustle of the city, this is the place! I originally wasn't going to go here while I was visiting because I didn't think I'd have time, but I took the time to go one evening and I'm glad I did! There are trails",
          "We did this hike and loved it. We did it with our kids and my 69 year old mother in law. Not too strenuous.",
          "Such a pleasure to be able to enjoy the beautiful parts of Colorado and not have to pay to do so. We spent an afternoon here. Bring plenty of water for the hike.",
          "Wonderful easily accessible green-space not far from downtown. Great for dogs and short day hikes, plenty of parking and some great climes along and on top of the sandstone and within sight of Garden of the Gods.",
          "We love this place!!!!!!!! Nice hiking and biking trails. Very clean. Some tough biking though! Beautiful place to take pictures. Would love if they could add some trees between the parking lot and the highway.",
          "Enjoyed the variety of trails offered here. It was peaceful no matter where we walked, even with many others there.",
          "This is Very Pretty but can be very hot. Make sure you bring lots of water and sunscreen. Also if you have pets it can be very hot on their paws.",
          "Nice place to hike - has become somewhat crowded on the weekends - trails are easy - beautiful country",
          "Although it doesn't look like much from the highway, the rock formations are similar to Garden of the Gods but not as visually spectacular. Where this park exceeds is the numerous trails that web their way through the peaks and give you spectacular views of the surrounding area",
          "If Garden of the Gods gets a 5 rating, then Red Rock Canyon is at least a 6. The trails were amazing. The best part is you deal with only a fraction of the people you see at Garden of the Gods. The other advantage is you really get away from traffic. No cars or paved roads.",
          "If you are in Colorado Springs to see the Garden of the Gods, then you must stop at Red Rock Canyon. There are several hiking/biking trails to explore among some truly beautiful rock formations. There is a cool view of Garden of the Gods off in the distance. We wish we had this",
          "We would definitely come back to this peaceful place. Our kids loved watching the ducks on the pond and exploring the canyon. It wasn't that crowded either, which we appreciated. We stayed here 2-3 hours and didn't even see everything.",
          "We drove all the way to the top of Pike's Peak and it was so worth it! The drive itself is fascinating because it curves around and around and around the mountain. Spectacular views at the top.",
          "Free, not crowded at all, with great views of the mountain, Garden of the Gods, and the Manitou Incline. An awesome compliment to the Garden of the Gods. Highly recommend!!",
          "Very nice park, accessible, easy to find. Not enough trash cans, disappointed people didn't hold on to drink bottles till they got back to the parking area. Multiple trails, nice ponds, you could do some rock climbing without gear and got some great views from those points.",
          "Red Rock Canyon is so beautiful. A trip well worth the time! So much beauty to absorb and explore! Not all the trails are hard, just take your time and enjoy.",
          "This is an overlooked place. Garden of the Gods gets all the attention as well it should. We did GOG but we liked this second option as well. A lot less fewer people and we could climb on a lot of the walls",
          "RRC is easily one of my favorite places in Colorado Springs. The park's history is interesting, as well as its convenient location and ease of access. I have taken many beginner rock-climbers there to practice technique on the relatively easy climbs in the park. It is also one",
          "So many fun hidden places to adventure. The kids loved searching for new trails and climbing to all the secret passages. Such a beautiful place!!",
          "Red Rock Canyon is worth the stop! It is a great place to hike and explore. We spent a good 2-3 hours hiking and had we had more water and snacks, we could have kept going. We had so much fun. It was full of great views and all sorts of different scenery. Would be good for",
          "Red Rock has a nice mix of trails for both hiking and mountain biking. There is also a skills area and a jump trail. Trails are clearly marked and well maintained. Mutual respect by all users is nice.",
          "The trails are very well marked, great for a family outing. Perfect for enjoying the outdoors and not overly strenuous.",
          "This place is amazing! Every step is breathtaking and picture perfect. You can walk for hours and feel peaceful.",
          "Quite a few locals and a some outsiders such as myself enjoyed hiking. I went there 2 of 3 days in the mornings before going on other adventures There were \"easy paths\" to \"advanced paths\" to \"only idiots\" paths. Scenery was amazing!",
          "Red Rock Canyon is my absolute favorite place to hike in Colo Spgs. The dogs and I are in absolute heaven when we go there. I like the fact that it's not a far drive from the city, the trails vary in difficulty and length so I can take not so athletic family members and they",
          "A beautiful park with easy hiking trails, wildlife, and rock formations to rival garden of the gods. A great place for wildflowers and birdwatching also",
          "A great place to explore with interesting rocks. Not as 'monumental' as Garden of the Gods but it's also not as touristy. I stress previous reviewers who note this is NOT the amphitheater west of Denver. But a great thing it's a free place to enjoy the outdoors.",
          "Great variety of trails. Can choose long or short hikes. Nice scenery. Trails well maintained. Not crowded. Lots of parking. Easy access off Rt 24.",
          "We toured GOTG, the. The 2nd day we went here. Wow! Some city, just minutes away from each other but such different hiking & views! Just as the other park. Get there early to make sure you get parking. This park has a little less shade than GOTG so I would suggest getting",
          "Don't confuse this with Red Rocks Amphitheater near Denver. This is a great open space with awesome hiking and exploring located near Colorado Springs. If Garden of the Gods is crowded (and when is it not so?) check out this area instead. Be ready for a little walking and you",
          "Great place to hike. My kids, ages 12-18 really enjoyed Red Rock Canyon. Beautiful scenery, exercise, family fun, and it's FREE.",
          "Was a great place to get out with our dog and take a walk. Park is free and dog friendly. You can tell the park is used and loved by the locals. It was clean and has pretty views of the Canyons.",
          "We went here today for a hike and really enjoyed the views. We climbed much higher than we expected to. Trails are well maintained, however there seemed to be more actual trails than there are on the maps. We got lost a few times. Glad we packed extra water because we hiked",
          "Nice place for a bike ride or a leisurely walk. Beautiful scenery, great for pictures as well. I love watching the ducks in the lake. My husband loves to bring the teens here for a mountain bike ride.",
          "We stayed very close to Red Rock Canyon! It was just across the street from where we stayed. It wasn't as busy as Garden of the Gods. Parking was available the several times we were there. This is certainly a great place to hike with cool views of Pikes Peak and Garden of",

          "My family and I enjoyed this park as much as the Garden of the Gods. Although this park does not have the unusual shaped rocks of Garden of the Gods, it does have plenty of rock formations to enjoy. Our early morning hike was so enjoyable, we came back the next day to hike a",
          "Red Rock Canyon open space has many paths nestled among the red rock formations quite similar to Garden of the Gods (which I've also been to) but without the crowds and much more peaceful. It's free, it has one port-o-potty, and it has trails specifically designated for dogs,",
          "We had to check this cool little spot out for an afternoon hike. It was a nice finish to our vacation. There are plenty of trails for people to try. You can easily hike a couple miles without feeling any pain. Such a beautiful place.",
          "Beautiful area free to public. Nice for very short or long hike. These huge rocks are awesome, and indescribable. Picnic areas available. Nice pond in the middle.",
          "In our beautiful city, this is another pearl of a place to visit. Less crowded than the Garden, and special in its own way. Great hiking, seclusion if you are an early riser, and even if not, a real sense of community and caring. You can ride your bike, walk your dog, hike,",
          "Great views with good angles of Pikes Peak and Garden of the Gods. Good places to stop especially if you are not fit like me but the trail is reasonably flat if you stay on the main path",
          "Went to the Red Rock Canyon today. Not a lot of people there. More gorgeous scenery! Especially loved the lake views! We walked down to the water and had fun watching the ducks, geese and koi! Wish we would have brought some bread, the ducks are obviously used to being fed and",

          "This little walk was just that! We could decide how far we wanted to walk, and when we wanted to head back to the car. There was a lot of beautiful vegetation along the way, rock areas for climbers as well as a lot of beautiful views to photograph! There was a lake, but",
          "In comparison with Garden of the Gods this park was not packed with tourists. We went early in the morning and enjoyed the cooler temps and low crowds. The trails were well kept and had beautiful scenic views. There is a stunning lake in the middle with crystal clear water and a",

          "My kids and I thoroughly enjoyed this hike because of all the neat things to see that you wouldn't normally find on a hike in Colorado. The old rock quarry is really cool, and actually looks like a giant Egyptian pyramid cut into the side of the mountain. There is a great",
          "This hike is moderate to easy in difficulty. There are lots of red rocks and sometimes red mud, too. Volunteers try to keep the noxious weeds at bay. I prefer hikes higher up on the mountain, but this is an easy one to access by car. It is right off the highway."

By far my favorite out door park near the city and I always find new paths and fun things. Like the coy fish in the Lake.",
          "I remember when Red Rock was still a relatively undiscovered park. Those were the days. It's still gorgeous\u2013maybe even the most visually stunning park in Colorado Springs (including Garden of the Gods). But it has gotten rather crowded. I'd recommend going on a weekday, when it's more sparse.",

        "wiki": "Steamboat Springs, often shortened to Steamboat, is a Home Rule Municipality that is the county seat and the most populous city of Routt County, Colorado, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 12,088.The city is an internationally known winter ski resort destination. The Steamboat Springs tourism industry is highlighted by Steamboat Ski Resort, which is on Mount Werner in the Park Range just east of the town. It also contains the much smaller Howelsen Hill Ski Area. Steamboat Springs has produced more Winter Olympic athletes than any other town in North America.Steamboat Springs \u2013 known colloquially as \"The 'Boat\" \u2013 is located in the upper valley of the Yampa River, along U.S. Highway 40 just west of the Continental Divide and Rabbit Ears Pass.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe area surrounding Steamboat Springs was originally inhabited by the Yampatika band of the Ute Tribe Utes, who hunted in the valley during the summer. Trappers began to move through the area during the first decades of the 19th century. James Harvey Crawford, the founder of Steamboat Springs, first arrived in the spring of 1874. The Crawford family moved there in 1876, and for the first five years were the sole permanent Anglo-Saxon residents of the town. The native Utes were forcibly removed from the area to a reservation in Utah by the U.S. Army starting in 1879. Milestones in the development of the pioneer town included the first sawmill in 1873, incorporation of the town in 1900, and the arrival of the railroad in 1909. The economy of the region was originally based on ranching and mining, which still have a large presence in the county.Steamboat is home to natural hot springs that are located throughout the area (see Geography). Upon first hearing a chugging sound, early trappers believed that a steamboat was coming down the river. When the trappers saw that there was no steamboat, and that the sound was coming from a hot spring, they decided to name the spring Steamboat Springs.Originally, skiing was the only method of transportation during harsh and snowy Rocky Mountain winters. In turn, the popularity of skiing as a winter pastime catalyzed development of the town and other communities all over the Rocky Mountains. In 1913, Carl Howelsen, a Norwegian, moved to town and introduced ski jumping. Howelsen built the first jump on Howelsen Hill, now part of the Howelsen Ski Area. He also founded the annual Winter Carnival, a celebration still held each winter. The festival includes ski racing and jumping, dog sledding, and chariot events down Lincoln Avenue, the city's main street. Light shows on both Mount Werner and Howelsen Hill are highlights. Howelsen also founded the Steamboat Springs Winter Sports Club and built the town's first ski jumps. The oldest continually operating ski area in North America, Howelsen Hill, now bears his name and is one of just three complete ski jumping complexes in the United States.\nThe Steamboat Ski Resort was largely established by two local men, Jim Temple and John Fetcher. Temple led the effort to develop the area. Fetcher, a local rancher, was the main designer and builder. The resort opened on what was then called Storm Mountain in 1963.\nIn 1974, The Industrial Company (TIC) was started in Steamboat Springs and has since grown into one of the largest industrial construction companies in the United States with revenues of approximately $2 billion in 2007. The company is one of the largest employers in Routt County and has more than 9,000 employees worldwide.\nTIC - The Industrial Company was acquired by Kiewit Engineering and all operations except the Training Center moved elsewhere (Denver, etc.).\nThe main TIC complex on Routt County Road 129 has been acquired by Yampa Valley Electric Association as their new headquarters, with extensive renovation. This property provides ample areas for offices, vehicle maintenance, and construction laydown activities.In 1993, the City Council of Steamboat Springs, Colorado conducted a poll of its residents to choose a new name for the bridge that crossed the Yampa River on Shield Drive. With 7,717 votes, the winning name was \"James Brown Soul Center of the Universe Bridge\". The bridge was officially dedicated in September 1993, and James Brown appeared at the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the event.\n\n\n=== Historical buildings ===\nHistorical buildings in Steamboat Springs include:\n\nChristian Science Society, at 7th and Oak, was built of logs in 1934 and is now listed on the National Register of Historical Places.\nThe Crawford House, at 12th and Crawford, was built of local stone in 1894 by the founder of Steamboat, James Harvey Crawford, and is now listed on the National Register of Historical Places.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 10.1 square miles (26 km2), all of it land except for the Yampa River.\nThe Yampa Valley and surrounding area contain several geothermal hot springs. The city is named after the Steamboat Spring, located near the present-day library and the old train depot. The spring itself was so named because its bubbling sounded like a steamboat to early settlers. Unfortunately, the construction of the railroad, which passes right next to the Steamboat Spring, silenced the chugging sound in 1908. Locals take pride in the name of their town, as evidenced by the humorously named Steamboat Yacht Club, a local restaurant formerly located on the Yampa River, but has since been closed. It was later reopened under a different name.\nThough there are no steamboats in the town, except for an allegorical \"steamboat\" playground in West Lincoln Park which was designed to resemble a steamboat and has since been mostly torn down, the area does offer two hot springs that are open to the public. The largest is at the Old Town Hot Springs, with multiple pools and two slides. Located in the hills a few miles out of town is Strawberry Park Hot Springs, with two pools, lodging (camping and cabins), spa and natural rock features. There is a fee to enter Strawberry Park, cash or check only. Strawberry Park Hot Springs offers excellent stargazing opportunities due to the lack of ambient light.\nThe Yampa River flows through the middle of town.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Steamboat Springs has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Dfb). Precipitation is very consistent year-round, with heavy snowfall during winter and thunderstorms during summer. Summers are very warm to hot, and winters are extremely cold, with lows close to zero.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 12,088 people, 5,201 households, and 2,275 families residing in the city.  There were 9,966 housing units. The racial makeup of the city was 94% White, 0.6%, 0.8% Asian, African American, 0.4% Native American, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.7% from other races, and 2.5% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 8.5% of the population.There were 4,201 households out of which 24.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 43.2% were married couples living together, 6.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 46.6% were non-families. Additionally, 28.5% of all households were made up of individuals and 2.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.27 and the average family size was 2.81.\nThe median age of Steamboat's population was 36.5 years. By sex, the population was 54.2 percent male, 45.8 percent female.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $54,647, and the median income for a family was $65,685. Males had a median income of $35,536 versus $28,244 for females. The per capita income for the city was $31,695. About 2.7% of families and 7.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.4% of those under age 18 and 3.1% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n== Skiing, river sports and cycling ==\n\nSteamboat Springs offers excellent skiing opportunities (also see history section) and has been the locale of world-class skiing competitions, including competitions for the 1989 and 1990 Alpine Skiing World Cup. The Steamboat Springs Winter Sports Club has brought forth many successful skiers, and the Steamboat Ski Resort attracts a large number of visiting snow aficionados. Snow cat skiing on Buffalo Pass is offered at Steamboat Powdercats which is operated under special use permits from the Routt - Medicine Bow National Forest and is an equal opportunity service provider.\nThe Yampa river is a popular conduit for water sports like fishing, rafting, tubing, and kayaking (playboating). The 4-mile (6.4 km) grade II-III whitewater run through town ends with two surfable holes. One is called D-Hole; the other one\u2014near the library, close to the Steamboat Spring\u2014is named Charlie's Hole or C-Hole for short, after local kayaker Charlie Beavers (1981\u20132002). Beavers started kayaking at age 12, was the first to explore a number of rivers (\"first descents\"), and successfully contended in playboating competitions. He died in a non-boating accident in 2002. The hole and some kayaking events were dedicated to him.\n\nEvery year on the first weekend of June, Steamboat Springs organizes the Yampa River Festival. It includes a kayak rodeo (i.e. a playboating competition) which attracts national and international world class playboaters. Additional events include but are not limited to a downriver race which is Colorado's only upstream slalom race, and The Crazy River Dog Contest, in which dogs retrieve sticks from the river and may pass a whitewater section.The defunct ski area Stagecoach is about twenty miles (32 km) south of Steamboat. It lasted two ski seasons, closing in 1974\n\n\n== Notable Events ==\nThe Steamboat Winter Carnival is a largest annual festival, held annually in early February since 1914. The highlight of the festival is a parade down the city's main street, Lincoln Avenue, featuring children on skis pulled by horses, and performances by the Steamboat Springs High School marching band -- the only marching band that performs on skis.\nOne of the winter's most popular on-mountain events is the annual mid-January Cowboy Downhill.\nThe Steamboat Hot Air Balloon Festival is held annually in early June.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nDebbie Armstrong (born 1963), alpine skier and Olympic gold medalist; lives in Steamboat Springs\nChris Baumann (born 1987), rugby union player, prop for Leicester Tigers and USA Eagles\nNelson Carmichael (born 1965), mogul skier and Olympic bronze medalist; born in Steamboat Springs\nJames Harvey Crawford (1845\u20131930), founder of Steamboat Springs; soldier, farmer, pioneer, cattleman, miner, land developer, and politician\nShannon Dunn-Downing (born 1972), freestyle snowboarder, Olympic bronze medalist and 4-time Winter X-Games medalist; raised in Steamboat Springs\nTaylor Fletcher (born 1990), Nordic combined skier; competed in his first Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver in 2010\nArielle Gold (born 1996), Olympic bronze medalist and World Champion snowboarder; born in Steamboat Springs\nTaylor Gold (born 1993), Olympian snowboarder; born in Steamboat Springs\nCarroll Hardy (born 1933), Major League Basesball player; resides in Steamboat Springs\nBilly Kidd (born 1943), alpine skier and Olympic silver medalist; moved to Steamboat Springs in 1970 and serves as Director of Skiing for Steamboat Ski Resort\nCaroline Lalive (born 1979), alpine skier and two-time Olympian; attended Lowell Whiteman School and lives in Steamboat Springs\nTodd Lodwick (born 1976), Nordic combined skier, Olympic silver medalist and two-time World champion; born in Steamboat Springs\nVerne Lundquist (born 1940), television sportscaster; resides in Steamboat Springs\nTravis Mayer (born 1982), freestyle skier and Olympic silver medalist; moved to Steamboat Springs to attend the Lowell Whiteman School\nCarey McWilliams (1905\u20131980), author, editor, lawyer known for progressive ideas; born in Steamboat Springs\nRobin Olds (1922\u20132007), ace fighter pilot and WWII/Vietnam fighter group commander; retired in Steamboat\nRyan Max Riley (born 1979), freestyle skier and humorist; attended Lowell Whiteman School in Steamboat\nReese Roper (born 1973), singer and songwriter; born in Steamboat Springs\nAndrew Sisco (born 1983), baseball player; born in Steamboat Springs\nJohnny Spillane (born 1980), Nordic combined skier, three-time Olympic silver medalist and World champion; born in Steamboat Springs\nSteven Ray Swanson (born 1960), engineer and a NASA astronaut\nAlvin P.

          "The building for this museum is gorgeous and full of character. The exhibits were weak and boring. Our family only spent about a half an hour there and saw everything. It is free though, so not disappointed.",
          "Was not expecting much but pleasantly surprised. Some areas for kids but feel they would lose patience due to needing to read information. Kids today want it spoon fed but for adults very well done. Well worth an couple of hours.",
          "The staff is super friendly and informative...they make the museum! The building is beautiful and worth stopping in just to see. Don't miss a ride on the old fashioned cage elevator...feels like stepping back into time. The exhibits were interesting, but there isn't a whole",

        "wiki": "In the mid-19th century, Colorado Springs was a center of mining industry activity. Coal was mined in 50 mines in the area and towns, now annexed to Colorado Springs, were established to support residents of the coal mining industry.\nIt was the home to gold and silver mine investors, like Winfield Scott Stratton and William Jackson Palmer. The Midland Terminal and Colorado Midland Railways were established in Colorado Springs to transported metals and ores and people from mountain towns. Once in Colorado Springs, ore was smelted there. People and goods were transported on the Railways to and from Colorado Springs, as well as on the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad.\nMine workers typically lived on the west side of town, like Old Colorado City, while investors lived in the Old North End.\n\n\n== Gold ==\n\nDuring the Pike's Peak Gold Rush, Old Colorado City was founded in 1859, based upon the vision of it being a major supply hub via Ute Pass for the new gold mines in South Park, the Upper Arkansas River area, and Blue River.\n\nThere was a significant tie between Colorado Springs and Cripple Creek, particularly among investors and people who settled in Cripple Creek. Mining exchange businesses were established in downtown Colorado Springs. Colorado Springs Mining Stock Association was founded about 1886 to trade stock of Cripple Creek mines, some of which grew between 1,000% and 10,000% by 1893. It traded stocks \"in almost every state and country in the world.\" John W. Proudfit & Co., founded in 1890, was the first organization in Colorado Springs to buy and sell mining stocks. It had office in three cities in Colorado and in London. The Crosby-Ehrich Syndicate was a mining stock and investment brokerage house, with representatives coordinating transactions with Cripple Creek businesses.\n\nWhen gold was discovered in Cripple Creek and Victor in 1890, some of the Colorado Midland Railway owners formed the Midland Terminal Railroad, a standard gauge spur line from Divide to Cripple Creek, which allowed for passenger travel to and from Cripple Creek, shipment of equipment into the area, and the transport of ore to processing mills in Old Colorado City beginning in 1895. Colorado Springs was a transfer point for people and goods to and from other areas of the country via the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad. The Colorado Springs and Cripple Creek District Railway completed an alternate route to Cripple Creek and Victor, traveling through the mountains south of Pikes Peak, called the Short Line in 1901. It was used to transport cargo, as well for sightseeing. In 1920, the tracks were abandoned the resulting road is the current Gold Camp Road.\n\nAssay offices were established in Colorado Springs to test the purity of precious metals.In the 1890s, the metal ore smelting businesses were established in Old Colorado City. Golden Cycle Mining and Reduction Company, involved in coal and gold mining, operated a custom mill, treating up to 40,000 tons of Cripple Creek ore each month. The mill had rolls, roasting furnaces, and cyanide equipment.In 1900, Cripple Creek was the world\u2019s second richest gold camp, bringing in $20 million a year. Three years later, mine industry workers went on strike for better working conditions and higher wages. This involved people that worked in smelting firms, mills, and in mines. After people had died and property was damaged during the strike, the strikers were unable to make an agreement with their employers during the Colorado Labor Wars (1903\u20131904).The mining business faltered during World War I, when workers supported the war effort. It also slowed during the Great Depression (1930s).\n\n\n== Silver and lead ==\nOre was also sent, such as from Leadville, to Colorado Springs, where was processed for silver and lead.\n\n\n== Coal ==\n\n\n=== Colorado Springs Coalfield ===\nThe Colorado Springs Coalfield is located in the southwestern part of the Denver Basin, where the lower part of the Laramie Formation ranges from 150 to 200 feet thick, and the upper part ranges from 100 to 150 feet thick. \nThe lower part of the Laramie in the Colorado Springs coal field includes alternating beds of very fine to fine-grained sandstone, claystone, and coal, whereas the upper part is composed primarily of claystone with thin interbeds of fine-grained sandstone.In 1910, Marcus I. Goldman designated three coal beds in the lower part of the formation as coal beds A\u2013C in ascending order; other unnamed thin and lenticular coal beds are also present in the area. Most of the mines in the Colorado Springs coal field produced coal from the A and B coal beds. Coal bed A is present from 30 to 65 feet above the base of the formation, and as a single bed, is as thick as 20 feet locally. Elsewhere in the coal field, coal bed A splits into two coal beds separated by about 8 feet of rock; in more extreme cases, the bed splits into a series of four to five thin coal beds separated by rock partings. Coal bed B is present from 25 to 50 feet above coal bed A, with massive sandstone typically separating the two coal beds. Coal bed B is as much as 13 feet thick locally, although the bed is more typically 5 feet thick or less throughout much of the Colorado Springs coal field. Coal bed C is lenticular and in places is absent. Where coal bed C is present, it lies from 20 to 50 feet stratigraphically above coal bed B and generally is less than 2 feet thick.By 1922, there were nine active coal mines, Pikeview, Keystone, City #1 and #2, Old Patterson, Danville, Cottonwood, Altitude, and Black Mariah. That year, workers of the  Pikes Peak Coal Company (owner of Pikeview mines) complained of working conditions, particularly the smoke generated by firing shots to clear the mines. Ths is a common problem that the state had not been able to resolve. The State Mine Inspection Department reported  that the company had found a solution; The shot firer would only fire shots when the mine had been vacated.Over the years, there was more than 16 million tons of coal mined from the Colorado Springs coal field.\n\n\n=== Mining ===\n\nBeginning about 1859, the area was mined for coal. There were 50 coal mines in the Colorado Springs, mostly in the Rockrimmon and Cragmor - Colorado Springs Country Club area. Mining in the Rockrimmon area occurred between 250 to 500 feet (76 to 152 m) below the surface, while the Cragmor mines were shallow, some only 30 feet (9.1 m) below the surface. Depending upon the depth of the coal bed, the mines were entered through vertical mine shafts or through inclined openings.The mines in the Rockrimmon area were the Corley, Columbine, Knights of Industry, three Pikeview, and the Klondike mines, the deepest of which was the Klondike mine at 500 feet. The Cragmor mines were the City Mine, the Altitude, Williamsville Mine, Curtis Mine, Patterson Mine, the Climax mines, the Conley, Busy Bee, and the Danville. The Country Club area mines were City #3, Keystone, New Keystone, Rapson, Austin Bluffs, El Paso, and Unknown mines. Even further southeast, near Academy and Constitution were City #4, Tudor, and Cardiff mines.Coal was mined using the \"room and pillar\" method, in which areas of unmined coal acted as pillars while coal was removed from the shafts, creating rooms. Sometimes, rather than leaving the pillar for support, the supporting coal was removed. The seams of coal was one to fourteen feet deep in the Colorado Springs area.\n\n\n=== Subsidence and other hazards ===\n\nOf the city's 50 abandoned mines, 22 have become hazardous because they were \"very shallow mines\"\u2014some no more than 30 feet (9.1 m) below the surface\u2014that are now subject to sinking under developed land. In a study of mine subsidence in the Colorado Springs coal field by the Dames and Moore consulting firm in 1985, trough-like subsidence over room-and-pillar mines was observed to be irregular, and the authors of that report interpreted that the interior of any given subsidence trough would likely undergo varying periods of tension and compression, depending on the timing required for failure of existing coal pillars and supports. They also suggested that as overburden above the room-and-pillar mine decreases, trough subsidence would primarily be a series of sinkholes resulting from the collapse of mine rooms with scattered larger depressions (troughs) forming from the general failure of pillars or mine floor over the larger areas.Many of the hazardous, abandoned mines are near Cragmor, such as Cragmor Country Club Estates that had about 3,000 residents in the late 1980s. There were more than 2,400 crack and sinkholes in the Cragmor Country Club Estates area, while there were only a total of seven in other areas of Colorado Springs during a 1985 study supervised by the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Division. In 2005, there was a collapse on Country Club Circle that threatened five houses. Because it is the most hazardous subsidence area in the state, a study was conducted in 2008 using Geophones to locate mining tunnels. The plan is to fill in voids with sand and gravel.Strategies for mitigating the risk due to sinkholes and subsidence include filling the voids, which can be costly due to the amount of material needed, and construction techniques so that structures are not prone to sinking. Strategies for managing the risk include insurance for subsidence and sinkholes.There are also hazards due to mine openings, drainage of metals or other pollutants from the mines into groundwater, or fires within mines or the outside waste banks. There are no known occurrences of groundwater contamination or fires, but they are ongoing risks. In April 1979, the surface plug of the 500-foot Klondike mine shaft at Woodman Road and I-25 had deteriorated and was reopened. Two mine opening hazards remain at the Cragmor-Country Club and the Wilson Ranch area.\n\n\n=== Real estate development ===\nBy the 1950s, coal was no longer mined in the Cragmor area and land was developed for the construction of about 3,500 houses, which was completed in the early 1960s. Then, the initial instances of  subsidence began, such as one on Mount View Lane in 1963. In another case, a dog died when the earth sunk in the backyard beneath a dog who became trapped in the falling dirt and died due to suffocation. In 1979, earth fell through an old mine shaft by a fourplex on Magnolia Street in the Cragmor area, forcing the evacuation of the residents and requiring a means to brace the building.  That year, subsidence resulted in a 12 by 7 feet (3.7 by 2.1 m) sinkhole in the park. It was discovered that 31 feet (9.4 m) below the surface of the park were mine shafts and the pool was slipping into a shafts. The sinkhole was filled and the pool was braced when tons of concrete were poured into the shafts.\n\n\n== Limestone ==\n\nLimestone was mined from the Pikeview Quarry, which began operations in 1905. Queens Canyon Quarry, north of Garden of the Gods, was mined for limestone from 1958 to 1990, creating a noticeable gash or scar in the Queens Canyon Quarry. A reclamation effort, led by Greg Francis, resulted in \"resculpting\" the terrain to support ongoing landscaping and tree planting efforts. On August 1, 2003, the hillside was renamed Greg Francis Bighorn Sheep Habitat in honor of Francis, who died October 2002. A statue of a bighorn sheep stands on Greg Francis Bighorn Sheep Habitat in recognition of the herd of 65 bighorns (in 2003) and Greg Francis, 100s of volunteers, and efforts by Castle Concrete to reintroduce Rocky Mountain juniper trees, native grasses, and small pi\u00f1on to the hills.\n\n\n== Cheyenne Mining District ==\nThe Cheyenne Mining District, located on Cheyenne Mountain, was the site of the Little Suzie gold mine established in the 1870s and silver and mineral mining that began in 1883. Eureka mine, Cather Springs, and Duffield near St. Peter's Dome on Gold Camp Road was mined for minerals, including Fluorite, cryolite, topaz, smoky quartz, fayalite, galena, and microcline.\n\n\n== Museums ==\n\n\n=== Western Museum of Mining & Industry ===\n\nThe Western Museum of Mining & Industry is a museum, dedicated to the mining history and industrial technology of the western United States, with antique mining equipment and steam engines.\n\n\n=== Colorado Springs Pioneers Museum ===\nThe Colorado Springs Pioneers Museum also has exhibits about the city's mining and railroad history.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKRDO staff (July 15, 2016). \"Experts: Colorado sinkholes caused by deserted mine shafts\".

          "Was pretty interesting and neat. Awesome little museum of the Wild West past. Learning about how their building were and some of how they lived back in the day.",
          "Tons of information and antiques from the late 1890s. Very educational, truly giving a feel for what life was like then.",
          "A big charge for very little. Had some neat antiques, but would have spent budget elsewhere.It took less than 30 minutes.",
          "They did have a lot of antiques from the 1700's but for the cost to walk around and see most of it didn't appeal to me.",
          "$6.50 per person is not a lot of money, but it is way too much for this experience. The museum is a warehouse type room with a makeshift western town. Lots of antiques in each \"building\". Very boring. Our group wanted to play the shootin' range, but found the guns to be",
          "Kids might like this place, but there's not a lot there if you're older. There are certainly lots of better things to do in and around the Springs.",
          "Poor selection of exhibits, extremely kitschy appearance, no historical context provided. This is about as accurate a depiction of old west life as a Disney movie and I left feeling dumber than when I got there. The museum is very small and meant for children, not adults.",
          "I felt like I wanted my money back after going here. It is in dire need of some elbow grease. The water was so chilly the kids had a hard time panning. Additionally, you are hit in the face with obnoxious political posters in the gift shop right when you walk in.",
          "This is a fun and quick little museum but worth the stop. Lots of unique, vintage items on display. Loved the old time functioning player pianos and the presidential bedroom set. Make sure to bring quarters to play the pianos. Also had very nice gift shop.",
          "We decided to visit the museum last minute to kill a few hours, and boy were we surprised! It turned out to be a most interesting afternoon, learning about the old west and how different life was for the early settlers. There are many authentic artifacts to see and even a",
          "My husband and I spent only about an hour here. The museum was smaller than what I expected, but filled with things to look at. My favorite part was the area in the back that had artifacts from homes in the Wild West era - makes you appreciate modern technology! Definitely bring",
          "It was a trip back in time. It was reasonably priced and worth it. It was neat to see the items from back them and listen to the interactive exhibits. Great for a family.",
          "Got to see a old store, saloon, blacksmith shop,hotel,jail and inside of a home.Also got to pan for gold and I found a couple nice size nuggets! There was also a old newspaper place and you could get wanted posters printed how with your name for only $3.95",
          "My husband wanted to stop here. While we were here it poured down raining. The girls in the gift shop were thankful for the rain. Inside they have it set up like a little town. We got an old fashioned newspaper cover made with our names in the headlines. It was only $3.95.",
          "This was fun as a time waster. We went here to walk around after patronizing the Colorado Mountain Brewery across the parking lot. It was fun to see all of the old west stuff.",
          "They have lots of pieces. Particularly liked their wagons/stage coaches. They had a lot in good condition.",
          "While vacationing in Colorado we found ourselves with a bit of flex time between other planned activities. We decided to give this museum a try and glad we did. We spent about 40 min there as we didn\u2019t have a lot of time to spare and could have spent another 20-30 minutes. The",
          "Some of the antique actvities (strength testing machines, old movie machines) were broken but there is a lot to look at. Really neat way to see what the old West was like. It is all in doors so good for a rainy day also. We even found gold when panning!",
          "They've done a pretty good job preserving all the exhibits. Would've been better with a guide, as the exhibits are not complete without the stories behind them. Good place to kill an hour or so of you want.",
          "Saw a billboard for this museum on our way through Colorado heading to Cheyenne. What a fun little museum to see. My older daughter and I had a great time here.",
          "The Ghost Town Museum is a great place to learn about what life was like in a western town. The shooting gallery is fun. The exhibits and memorabilia are amazing. You can even try your luck at panning for gold. Yes there are real gold pieces that are put that exhibit that",
          "My family and i visited last week and it was a fun kill of 45 minutes. Lots of artifacts and memorabillia. Laid out very well in the different sections. The gold panning was not all it was cracked up to be. The movie was very informative and well done.",
          "Just happened to see this place on a brochure and so happy we went! Quick self guided tour but what a collection of antiques from the Wild West beautifully set up to look just like an old town! Had fun panning for gold too! Feels like you were there in the old west plus the",
          "It is a little hokey but I love that! I loved seeing these artifacts preserved. I would love to see a real ghost town but since I'm a solo traveler, wouldn't want to risk being alone in the desert. Therefore, this was a nice visit for me. Don't skip it, it's worth a stop in!",
          "Absolutely stunning museum in Colorado Springs. It's like to go back to the past, in the far west. Like to live in an old city, everything is untouched, the shops, the houses, the offices. The museum is very well kept, everything cared and amazing. The ghost town is like the",
          "We enjoyed taking a stroll in the past. Very interesting displays as well as interactive activities. The price is reasonable and worth the visit.",
          "Cute little place, very easy to go by. You can get your own Wanted Poster made and there's a lot more to do/see than you would think.",
          "A very unique experience in the old wild west. There's a lot more to see than I originally imagined. There's a movie to watch and games to play and we even got wanted posters made up. Fun time!",
          "We spent 45 minutes here. Could have been done in 30. For creative story telling and explaining everything to a 5 year old, an hour would be good. Good photo opportunities.",
          "Pros: Movie was informative and interesting Rooms are neat with original items Cons: Not many hands-on activities for children Not a lot of information on the items All the music players, pianos, etc. cost money Panning was closed in mid 50 degree weather",
          "Did the Self guided tour, which lasted me about 90 minutes. I enjoyed the western exhibits. price is really affordable.",
          "Don\u2019t go, it\u2019s a true tourist trap! Much better experiences at the Pioneer Museum in town. Try the gold mining museum at the North AFA exit.",
          "you can find this kind of museum in lots of places. was nice to go to but didn't seem like something for just colorado",
          "Papa, grandma, mom and grandgirl planned a fall break day in the Springs. Since Halloween is near, we decided on a ghost town! This is located in a strip mall in an old railroad building. It is a replica of an old western town. The displays of antiques was awesome and they also",
          "The old buildings and historic items are all stored within a building. It takes about 45 minutes to see it well but it really isn't that big. What they have is very nice. I was glad to have gone.",
          "Very interesting even for my two grandson ages 5 and 6. This makes you appreciate our modern conveniences. It also made you realize how hardy the pioneers were.",
          "My expectations did not come close to what was there to see; I compare it to a few dioramas. Just not enough depth to a \"ghost town\".",
          "My husband and I stopped here on our honeymoon. I didn't expect it to have quite so much! We enjoyed the buttons you could press for a recording of what you were seeing in the display or facts about the time period. There is a little place to pan for gold, and you can even take",
          "Kind of dated. A bit hokey, almost silly. We brought a visiting family of relatives. Nobody raved. Lacks people and alive feeling. You walk about on your own. Automated displays.",
          "This was not at all what was expected. It was small and contained only one large building behind the main store front and one smaller home for viewing as the museum. Artifacts were interesting but it lacked the usual feel off a museum and did not have the feel of the era, only a",
          "When you arrive you can see by the size of the building it is not very large. At least a third is the gift shop. Adult admission was $7.50. When you enter the museum portion there are some very interesting displays of what appear to be authentic artifacts of life in the West",
          "Upon entering the \"museum\" we were very fascinated. They had a very nice player piano! Then we start our tour on the boardwalk and saw many coin operated machines and it felt like more of an arcade. The print shop was definitely nice! They was very little information on their",
          "I love museums so my view of this place may be different than others, it was a lot of old buggies and shops the way they were in the early days, its a good stop for sure!!",
          "Enjoyed going round this under-cover town mock up - think I had expected an outdoor attraction that looked a bit like a wild west street from the films but good to see all the different parts of a typical town with lots of gadgets and gizmos from the 1800's",
          "We had a little bit of time to kill one morning and decided this would be fun. We found a coupon online for one dollar off for up to four people. The museum is more about life in the late 1800s early 1900s in a mining town. It has nothing to do with ghosts. The museum is",
          "Awesome time at the museum. They created a very authentic old town. Stage coaches from back in the day, even one you could get into for photo's. They had an old phone from the party line days with a women gossiping which was so funny. There is gold panning for the kids and",
          "This is exactly the kind of touristy attraction I adore - all goofy, harmless fun with mannequins. The gift shop had everything from gun lover signs to light- up Jesus key chains. I may have purchased both. Two main areas of Old West museum relics, and yes, the talking mannequin",
          "We have visited this spot a couple of times over the years & think it could use an upgrade on it's attractions!",
          "The museum itself was neat, kinda small, but did a decent job of representing what an old town would have been like back in the 1800's during the gold rush years. A little overpriced for what it offered, but the kids enjoyed it. The customer service in the gift shop was crappy,",
          "Most of the displays are inside one large air-conditioned building, so this made a great stop for something to do in the middle of the hot afternoon. There's a lot to see and the whole place has a good energy and is pleasing as soon as you walk in, but it doesn't have to take",
          "Decided to stop here as a last second thought. Small but some neat period pieces in there. Good for kids as they have things for kids to do. Bring quarters or dollar bills because there are many machines that need quarters to work. Our kids enjoyed the museum and got to try to",
          "This is a neat idea but was a little disappointing for how much it cost. The facades from ghost towns are neat, and so are all the artifacts, but we wish there had been more explanations and more history. We spent about an hour going through the museum, going at a VERY leisurely",
          "This gold-rush era \"ghost\" town is all indoors (except for the panning for gold experience). Could be a good thing to do when it rains. Okay for little kids because they could touch things, but for teens and adults it is so-so. Glad we got a coupon from the website for a",
          "We visited with my elderly parents, my husband and our three young kids ( ages 10, 8, 5). The kids actually had quite a bit of fun- my parents and my husband and I did as well. It wasn't super big but there were some neat things to look at. There were little old school video",
          "Nice place. I liked that everything was inside. All rooms were decorated with authentic furniture and decor. Great for all ages.",
          "While this is a family owned attraction, I felt that it didn't have to be quite so expensive. My kids felt it was ho-hum, and me even more so.",
          "This place is one big room with some rooms made up to look like old stores and businesses in the old west, with a small collection of vintage buggies (one you can actually take pictures on), and aside from that an old house replica. The visit is quite short. Unless you study",
          "Loved this museum. They have a lot of great historical treasures. Enjoyed this visit. Easily accessible, and not crowded feeling like some museums.",
          "A nice museum to preserving the old west history. A great place to visit when the weather outside is not overly inviting. Parking is easy on a shared surface lot. There is a large gift shop for souvenirs. Inside there are a few preserved wagons, fire equipment and old west",
          "Very cute and neat stop while in town, me and my husband were inside for about an hour and a half. Has a nice collection of saved old towns, its been re assembled indoors to help preserve the artifacts so that is very nice.",
          "By unique, I mean..how many Ghost towns are under a roof?? This ghost town is in a huge building, so no matter what the weather you will enjoy your visit. The staff at the front desk was informative and very pleasant.",
          "We stayed here around 45 minutes. They have recreated an old town as it was before it became a ghost town. There are lots of things to look at, and you are taken back in time. There is a movie that was interesting to watch. The gift shop is nice. You can pan for gold, but it",
          "You can't expect much when you go to a place named \"Ghost Town Museum.\" BUT this place is a gem, it will not be the highlight of your trip, but if you have the time it is worth it. This 'museum' is fun and quirky, you won't learn anything mind blowing but it has a handful of",
          "Really nice museum. It is a small museum but a lot to see on it. We loved it. I really recomend going if you are near Colorado Springs.",
          "The Old Ghost Town is all under one roof, so you can browse the attraction rain or shine. The shops on display are pretty well done. The cost for adult admission was $7.50 on our visit April, 2017....and we got a $1 discount. One bonus was a bedroom suit used by President",
          "A few neat antiques to look at, but very small and not worth the time or money considering how many other neat things are in the area. If you are an old west fan maybe it is your thing.",
          "wonderful collection of old Americana. Boys enjoyed shooting ,gallery and buggy to sit in. Overflowing with memorabilia from pioneer days",
          "This is a fun place that can be visited in a few hours. It's a recreated Old West Town, easy to navigate and full of interesting history and fun facts. We enjoyed the many interesting things there and recommend it. Great for children.",
          "This place is pretty cool! I really loved all the thing what was there, everything like at this ages.. it was nice to see it",
          "There's a gift shop, area to pan for gold and an inside museum area that is FULL of back in the day machines, vehicles, clothing a saloon, and a shooting range, etc.",
          "The people were very nice, and I found some of the items on display interesting, but my 6 year old son was really bored. We aren't really old west buffs, so we aren't the target audience. I'd say only go if looking at everyday objects form the 1800's excites you.",
          "It was a Sunday after church and we had two of our grandsons for the day (22 months and 4 years old) and were looking for something to do. I have lived in Colorado Springs since 1984 and never been here! Here's the basics... it's $7.50 per adult, the boys were free. It's",
          "This is just another hwy 24 tourist trap. Come see the old west... give me a break. I checked it out last summer and it was the same old thing... not worth the money",
          "The Ghost Town Museum is, quite frankly, not worth the price of admission. I guess if you're just passing thru town and want something to do for an hour or two with little kids it would be okay, but I wouldn't make it a priority for sure. If you want more of an authentic \"ghost",
          "My kids loved it when they were younger and now my grandchildren love it. A taste of the old west, a cute gift shop, and panning for gold make this a fun destination for all ages.",
          "Old West... Very interesting all the History from Colorado State, Kids will enjoy, Staff are Great...",
          "My 10 year old Grandson absolutely loved this Ghost Town. We spent 3 hours there. I felt safe letting him roam. They have an impressive petrified log, model T Ford cars txt you can sit in and pretend to drive. They have \"mock up rooms\" with antiques, etc. He enjoyed pushing",
          "The old west street is inside an old railroad building. Its fun to peer into the storefronts BUT they are recreated and you don't get the feel that these are real ghost town relics.",
          "A look at how people lived and worked hard without modern gadgets. Man/Woman power is what they had to survive. It was fascinating and we loved all the artifacts, stagecoach, pharmacy, general store, saloon, firehouse. Great way to spend some time!!!",
          "This museum is little but is totally worth the $7.50 it totally gives you an insight of what the Wild West use to be. They have lots of things that you can actually touch so that is always great for when you have kids or in my case a dad that likes to touch everything!",
          "We expected to find some sort of Ghost story place, haunted tales etc. but when we arrived we realized our mistake....\"Ahhh, Ghost town, now I see.\" But hey, we were there, we sought it out, why not. We paid the fee and went in. There honestly was a lot to see, and neat things",
          "We've roamed around a number old western towns and ghost towns through the years, but were very much surprised at how many authentic items this museum has. The collection is fantastic and creatively displayed inside of a building. When visiting, you need to really look",
          "This was a lot smaller of a museum than what I had envisioned. It was also kinda expensive too. But, once we got in there it was unique and the kids enjoyed looking around. Not scary.",
          "Before putting my granddaughter on a plane back home to Canada she wanted to go visit this museum.I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it!!!! Good education too!!",
          "Entire exhibit is inside of an historic train depot. It is a reconstruction of an actual ghost town but some of the rooms were very crowded with artifacts that it was hard to take it all in. Gift shop is massive and fairly priced.",
          "This is not a must see activity but it was interesting they had a street set up just like an old Western town it was kind of fun to look around",
          "Historic, full of authentic artifacts that are hard to find anywhere else. Amazing gift shop. Friendly staff. Highly recommend!",
          "I really enjoyed my visit. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The collection iis extensive and the exhibits are very well done. Well done historical film to complete the tour.",
          "Nicely done re-creation of an old time \"ghost town\". Individual buildings and displays setup to look like a complete town's main street. You could go inside many of the store fronts to see more items appropriate to the building, i.e. Jail, saloon, red-light district, etc.",
          "We weren't sure what we were getting ourselves into with this museum, but were pleasantly surprised by how fun and entertaining it actually was. The super short film on Colorado's settlers' history is definitely worth the couple minutes (and is included free). We panned for gold",
          "We passed this place every day of our vacation and decided to go in. Had a local coupon and it was good for an hour. Mock up of an old ghost town in the area! Fun time!",
          "What a beautiful collection of items from the 1800s! We would have loved to have a guide or interpreter though. Panning for gold was my kids' (ages 14, 11, 10) favorite part. The gift shop was excellent.",
          "My son would say, \"No. Just No.\" Sometimes our kids know best. This place is soooooooooooo dirty and what a waste of money but my husband and I use it as our worst experience when rating things to do so there is that. A giant warehouse with walled off rooms made to look like",
          "Our 8-year old daughter can be hard to please, and she had fun here. It was inexpensive, informative (for kids) and has several unique items in the gift-store (IE - my wife found some neat things). And since my daughter both learned a lot and had fun - that's the point!",
          "Not sure what to expect when we walked in. But it was very nice. A lot of antiques to look at. It was set up nicely. It was like stepping back in time. The gift shop did not have old stuff wth dust on it. Updated trinkets. It shows how people lived back then. You can even pan",
          "Now this was fun. Yes, I know everything cost money and you could only look at some things, but we had fun here. We had an 8 and 5 yr old with us and they both gave it 2 thumbs up. In addition to being able to walk through an old west town, they also had gold panning outside.",
          "An interactive museum to get an idea of the life in the Wild West. Great for kids because a lot of the things can be tried and used. Not too much for adults but still interesting from the informative point of view.",
          "This is a view into the far west lifestyle. It is not very big but it is fun and a quick thing to do between other activities. There are items the kids can touch and play with.",
          "The coin operated piano,organ and nickelodeon worked, which was cool. Worth a quarter each to hear them play.",
          "It was fun stepping back in time and the kids were able to pan for gold. All of the sets included historical items and that was very fun.",
          "Good activity for families with younger kids (ours are 11 and 15). Still entertaining, though. We did actually find one gold flake while panning, and lots of pyrite.",
          "My husband and son absolutely loved this little museum. It\u2019s set up like an Old West town with a saloon, blacksmith, general store, jail, etc. Some of the spaces have a recording providing more information about the setting. There are also player pianos, a shooting range and",
          "This attraction was a major disappointment. It was small. all indoors, many of the exhibits had additional fees (mostly quarters to see pictures or short films) and many of those were out of service. It is the height of tourist season and you would expect to see things in",
          "We went here not expecting to much. Rather enjoyed ourselves. Neat archives to how people lived in the past. They also offer a military discount. Plus! \ud83d\ude03",
          "Turned back the clock to another era. Great time with kids and seeing all the antiques on display. Panning for gold was a hit with all the kids from 12 to 70!!",
          "We were travelling through and decided to take the kids to Ghost Town Museum. Ample parking outside and the front is an absolutely huge store with everything touristy you could imagine, I was a little worried about where the actual museum bit was, but they assured me behind the",
          "Did not expect anything more than a touristy stop, but it was much better than anticipated. The real artifacts set up in the period rooms were all quite interesting. Our 6 year old granddaughter was quite intrigued (not so the 3 1/2 year old). They all did enjoy the panning for",
          "We took our 8 and 5 year old with us on this trip. Ghost Town did not keep their attention for long. It is small and almost seems like a collector collected too many things and decided to throw them into a building and make a museum. We didn't have any quarters with us either",
          "My family very much enjoyed the Ghost Town Museum. Keep in mind that it is a museum. However, its a fantastic one! It's got all of the elements of an old timey Western civilization. For the price and the experience, you can't beat it.",
          "I visited this place because of the giant commercial billboard about this place. I was excited at the beginning. I paid some $ to get in. It was disappointing because it wasn't many things to see or do. The only thing that was cool about this place is it doesn't exist in my home",
          "cute museum it was cool to learn how to pan gold and the gift shop was nice and actually a lot less expensive than some other places",
          "This was interesting. Showed a lot of the carriages used in old times. Makes you appreciate living in the present.",
          "My whole family are history buffs do this was right up our ally. Awesome exhibits (saloon, barber shop, blacksmith, general store) lots of stagecoaches and wagons! Free gold panning! My kids had a blast. It was 7.50 for adults and kids 5 and under free. Tip: 1.00 off coupon",
          "We've driven by this museum many times and always wondered about it. Today, on a very rainy afternoon, we decided to stop. The good news for us, was that it was all indoors. I was surprised at the set-up and restoration. It was a great place to look at relics and promote",
          "The exhibits were fun to look at. Panning for \"gold\" was a little messy. Gift shop had lots of fun things.",
          "Visited this place last month while here on vacation. Although it didn't take up a lot of time it was cheap and enjoyable. Little kids enjoyed panning for Gold and was fun to see how things were in the past.",
          "Very well put together Musuem. This place has a little of everything from the old west, from stagecoachs to a general store. The self guided tour is great because you can go at your own pace. Spend extra time where you want. They have someone that will teach you how to pan for",
          "This could've been a wee bit better but it was a great rainy day activity. It was fun to look at everything and see all the older items in the museum.",
          "Great historical attraction, admittedly run down but still fun and educational. Kidas and older folks alike should enjoy it our favourite part is the little coin op shooting gallery.",
          "This is really just a waste of time. Save your money and check out something else. Anything else!!!!",
          "This was a fun little museum we decided to visit during the heat of the day! My kids were expecting spooky ghost stories, so they were a little disappointed, but they still had fun!",
          "We had about an hour before our train ride so we came here to check it out. It was neat, set up just like an old town. There was no one else there at 9:00am so we had the place to ourselves to explore. It was a fun way to spend about an hour. I think kids would really like it",
          "This was really one of the most fun museums I've ever been to. It is basically a recreated old west town, under cover. Lots and lots and lots of things to see and several fun things to do (including gold panning). It was fascinating and so glad we didn't pass it by. Well worth",
          "I love going to fun, random tourist traps like this. So, when I was up in Colorado Springs for a day on my trip to Colorado last weekend I decided to stop. It was fun to see all the authentic pieces of history that they have. I'm not sure the price of admission was really",
          "I went to a different museum on my way to this one and I would say the other one I happened to stumble upon was better but this one was good too. Rooms nicely set up, nice outdoor space, short movie to describe the times. Definitely good on a rainy day.",
          "This is basically a block of a town inside a warehouse-type building. You'll find a general store, a jail, barber shop, saloon, fire department, hotel, and others. There are several buggies (most of which you can't climb on) as well as some old appliances (washing machine,",
          "Awesome! Our family loved this place! Lots of history andante girls loved that they could get a newspaper with their name on it. Worth the time to stop and visit.",
          "My family was planning to see this museum this past week. We had planned some other activities and this was our last stop. Our 6 year old was extremely excited about going. The brochure said the last admission was 4:30. We arrived a few minutes before and the doors were locked",
          "It's a large room with old building fronts inside acting as a Wild West Main Street. The interiors have some nice displays that were well labeled. It's 7.50 for entrance pretty fair price I thought there were a couple of families there and kids all looked like they were having",
          "This looks like a tourist attraction but I recommend it! It's an interesting collection of local memorabilia and it's worth the time and fairly low admission to walk through it and enjoy.",
          "We came here and paid $7 each to enter. We were expecting a ghost town so something scary or ghostly. We were surprised it wasn't this but we had a good look round and enjoyed the museum. The attention to detail in getting it to look authentic was very good and we got some good",
          "This museum is small, but we actually spent quite a bit of time here. It's set up to look like an old western town and the staff said everything (including the buildings) are authentic from an actual town. It was very interesting! Bring lots of coins...you can look into all the",
          "It wasn't what I thought it was.it wasn't spooky but it had interesting things to look at.you can take pictures of things.sit in a old buggy.it was $7.00 to get in but we had a dollar off coupon.",
          "Ghosts were scary as hell. Popcorn was good though. Wouldn't recommend bringing nice clothes. Wanted poster smeared my car seat too.",
          "My daughter and I really enjoyed this place on our last day in the area. They say they have the actual old buildings inside the place. If so, then it's an even better attraction. Well worth the visit when in the area and good for all ages.",
          "An amazing look back at history. Seeing all the different items that are on display, and having the kids ask questions about them, really fun.",
          "This was way better than we anticipated. It was an activity we put on our list of things to do as a back up for bad weather. Well, it snowed and wind was over 40 mph. So indoor activities were a must. The museum is itself a historic building. The interior has been done so you",
          "This museum was pretty interesting. My husband and I went in March so the outside part of it wasn't open (which was a bummer) There was some neat artifacts but a lot of the coin machines didn't work and although the staff tried they couldn't fix them and did not give me my coins",
          "Enjoyed this place especially the information by video. Good place for kids, lots of hands on things. I'm thrilled with history. Great gift shop.",
          "I think this would fun for middle school age children. We took some fun pictures but I don't think I would go again unless the kids wanted to go.",
          "We visited here on a slow day, so it was great for a toddler to run around. The museum is smaller, but it was extremely interesting. They also have a huge gift shop.",
          "Loved this place! Family friendly, nice staff, great gift shop and lots to look at! Not expensive either! We definitely enjoyed our time here. It does feel like people from the past are there with you in spirit. Love these type of places!",
          "I have been here quite a few times, as a teenager and as a adult. It has always creeped me out. I have caught things on tape images and sounds, etc. If you are into that kind of thing this place definetely make the list of must sees.",
          "For $7 entry fee you get to see a nice pice of history of Colorado Pike Peacks old town. Old houses and town saloon, telegraph and a lot more are well represented. Enjoy the visit",
          "I did not know much about the museum before I visited. The kids wanted to go pan for gold. I guess I was expecting a real ghost town with large, old buildings and dwellings. This was essentially a large warehouse museum right in the middle of town. The museum itself had",
          "Tottaly worthed the money. Make sure you do goldpanning, me and my wife got like 6 little gold nuggets, very addictive.",
          "This is a great, experiential way for kids and adults to learn about history. It was so entertaining, we have gone twice.",
          "I read the reviews and was not expecting much. But this was a nice historic attraction when you know what to expect. It's not a real ghost town, and it's all recreated. But the owners have put together memorabilia and artifacts that show what life was like in a frontier town",
          "Coming from Denver, my gf and I decided to stop here before headed to the Cog Railway. It was a cute stop. The museum is small and can be done in under an hour. The museum has some exhibits about what it was like in the Wild West. I think kids might enjoy it. In the warmer",
          "Really nice glimpse into the history of the Wild West. Focus is more on history and memorabilia than a ghost town. In the words of my teenager, \"It was still really neat!\" Most reasonably priced gift shop of all the ones we visited in Colorado Springs.",
          "Fun Amusement Museum with lots to see and do! Great little indoor \"Old West Town\" that you can roam around in, with store-fronts including mechanized mannequins that tell brief stories about what they're doing when you push a button. There are quite a few old nickelodeon",
          "This place was a total surprise! It has so many artifacts and cool interactive exhibits! Cheap entry fee and worth the experience!",
          "This was a neat museum. Fun, informative, interactive. You get to pan for gold too! Gift shop had a variety of items.",
          "Not a very big place, but educational. Our kids, ages 6 and 8, loved it. Bring dollars as many things cost a quarter to play, although not necessary to enjoy the museum. They have change machines. The short video was interesting. Took us about an hour to go through it. The",
          "Was tricked into thinking this was a bunch of free standing buildings, but it's all crammed into one building. Looks like someone raided a bunch of rummage sales for old junk and stuck it into the different \"buildings\" of the ghost town. Tons of items that take quarters to play.",
          "We took our group of 4 Adults and 5 children to the Museum. There were several cute photo ops, but they also had lots of quarter machines such as the shooting gallery and to make things move in some of the exhibits. The gold in the gold panning was non-existant.",
          "This is a cool little place to visit. The kids really enjoyed seeing the old buggies and panning for gold. The museum was super neat.",
          "Very disappointing. Thought we would give it a try for a ghost town and some panning for gold. It's a true money trap, false advertisement. The \"museum\" was very short and had doorbells at several places. Most of the doorbells didn't play. The \"shooting range\" had 3 guns that",
          "I found this wonderful unique display of Michael Garman's artistic talent absolutely fascinating.The artistic architecturally beautiful buildings, the unique photographic illusions and amazing hand carved characters ar so interesting I found myself involved for a long while.",
          "I do enjoy old \"ghost towns\" and this is not one but still gives you enough of the very old stuff to see. I don't remember the cost but did not feel like I hated spending it on what we saw.",
          "DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! This is basically a collection of old stuff and a gift shop. Some interesting items but you can see those at a flea market for free. This tourist trap is seriously overpriced and we had a coupon.",
          "Visited this place a while back, but I remember it being a fun place to visit. Get an idea of how life was in the wild west. Great historical museum.",
          "This is interesting if you like old historic memorabilia and such like. But if you are looking for an open air type ghost town this is not it. I typically label things like this as a \"tourist trap\". It didn't cost a lot of money, but still you leave with the feeling of being",
          "My husband and I had some extra time, so we stopped by the Ghost Town Museum. We were very surprised by the quality and size of their historical items and displays. When walking thorough the exhibits, you can really imagine what life would have been like during the Colorado",
          "I took my two nephews here during a recent trip to Colorado. It was a total waste of time and money. First of all, it's extremely small. Secondly, it's terribly overpriced for what you get. The exhibits all had small locked gates in front of them so you couldn't really get close",
          "Fun hour stop but nothing spectacular. My husband enjoyed shooting the simulated shooting range at targets that lit up and whirled around with lights. Some of the exhibits were fun to look at.",
          "We visited while on vacation and found this place to be one of the best spots for souvenirs. The kids found it very interesting to see all the old things. As for panning for gold, it's a very small area to just to see or practice how it was done. This place isn't a must see",
          "Not worth it. I was very disappointed. I read something about panning for gold there, which they didn't have. I'm not sure if the season wasn't right yet or what but it was disappointing.",
          "We took a group of teens here and while we had fun, the place is quite small. The gift shop is great. The exhibits are neat. I loved the 8 minute documentary. I think this would be a great place to take small kids but don't plan a long trip here. You can see everything within",
          "This is easy to pass so be on the lookout for the billboards. You walk into the gift shop first and then go back to the museum. It was very informative with recorings, old movies, and of course the real deal the antiques. Take your time going through this place so you can take",
          "We loved this place. We enjoyed very much the old and real things. You can feel the atmosphere of the wild west. Children and adults can find interesting things. It is fun to walk in the street and see the style of living 150 years ago.",
          "I personally think there are better things to do in Colorado Springs and Manitou Springs. If it is raining, and you're bored, go. It is 7.50 a person, but doesn't take long to go through. My husband and I spent 30-45 minutes there and that includes the gift shop visit. I didn't",
          "This was a great place to learn about the history and the gift shop was awesome very friendly. Worth the trip since we are from oregon.",
          "PLAYER PIANO!! Fantastic and interesting for adults and little kids. It was hard for the kids to tear us adults from the huge collection of antique everything from pioneer days, print shop, jail, saloon, shooting gallery, grocery and a series of rooms showing how the city folk",
          "The museum is a nice place to stroll. really enjoyed the coin operated attractions, particularly the shooting gallery. If we'd known there were so many options to spend a quarter here and there, we'd have brought some cash and changed it up at the shooting gallery. If you want",
          "We stopped in to kill time and it was alright. The gift shop was good and the staff was friendly. It was a little over priced at $7.50/ per adult for what it has to offer. I did enjoy the .25 cent viewers and such.",
          "Stopped in while on Spring Break in Colorado Springs. Great little museum with lots to see and a good gift shop for souvenirs.",
          "Small but, very historical & cute. We enjoyed looking at ourselves in the skinny mirror, & little people mirrors. Seeing how it use to be is always something that intrigues me. The staff in the shop were very friendly & the gifts were a tad bit over priced however; I could",
          "In our last visit to Colorado we went to ghost town expecting a good experience, reality is a small place and not to much to see, if you want to go I suggest you stop at the shop store get your souvenir and do something else",
          "We visited this spot because we needed a rainy day activity on vacation. October is the slow season so it was all self guided and stations were not manned. The 2 young people running the operation were more interested in talking to each other than helping customers. I would rank",
          "The site was kind of cramped, would have liked to see things spread out more and labeled more clearly as to what the items were used for in that time period. Also, the games did not work, but had no problem taking your money and they would not refund it. Gold panning was a rip",
          "We saw brochures throughout Colorado Springs and read the description online, so we decided to give it a try. The museum has replicas of shops, a jail, a saloon, and other establishments from the Old West. Fun to walk around, take pictures, and pretend to be a character from",
          "Took my family here on an unscheduled stop and was glad we did. Lots to see and learn about our past from stage coach to carriage to first car and all the in betweens. The jail, stores, blacksmith shops, doctors office, barbers shop, and saloon all had tons of things to see and",
          "We had driven by and spotted the signs, so we stopped in. My husband and I enjoyed it, we loved the antiques and store / room setups. there's alot of cowboy humor... My husband particularly enjoyed the self-playing pianos (i think he started each of them a dozen times!) and the",
          "Lots & lots of Old West memorabilia and history facts. Don't miss the player piano for a quarter. Nice presentation for an hour. You can download a reduced rate coupon off Ghost Town website. Plenty of free parking. A good replica of the real thing.",
          "What an interesting museum! We had 6 kids with our group ages 3-12 and 4 adults. We all had a great time. We all love history and there was so much to see from old west, mining times; dust and all. If you are a person who has to have everything new and dust free, this may not",
          "See the way an old west town looked before technology. Listen to a woman complain over the phone about eggs going up to 15 cents a dozen. Try your luck at shooting a robot cowboy.",
          "Some interesting old stuff to look at set up like an old town. It is inside and out of the weather. A nice little history lesson. Fun for adults and the more intellectual teens. Little ones will be bored in minutes.",
          "My wife and I were all excited to learn more about ghost towns - Colorado is full of them. Instead, what we saw was a gussied-up warehouse set up like an overcrowded street in an anachronism-filled cowboy town. Sure, there are lots of old pieces there, but signage is minimal,",
          "The museum consisted of a warehouse size facility with the main street of a western town recreated inside. There are carriages, various stores, and lots of old equipment to look at. The place might have been nice at one time, but now it seems seedy. There were several old",
          "A little overpriced for what we got to see, but still interesting and informative. I was disappointed with the panning for gold. My daughter couldn't see into the area and there were no stools. I can only hold her for so long, and I was under the impression from the website",
          "It was interesting on seeing the Antiques and having it staged like a regular western town all inside.",
          "This museum was well run with friendly staff. Not a ghost town but a great example of a old western town. Nice that most everything was indoors with the crazy Colorado weather. The gift shop had a great selection with fair prices.",
          "It cost our family of 5 $35 to get it. It was interesting and different; however, I don't believe it's worth the money. It was very dusty and had really old stuff in it to look at and read about. But, my kids were bored.",
          "Stumbled across a great gem! Very informative of the area history. Lots of fun for our older children and the four-year old! Friendly staff and great gift store. Really well priced and fun adventure.",
          "My family was looking for something to do between other scheduled activities in the area. We had seen this museum from the road and decided to give it a shot. First, I have to say that they have done a nice job putting all of the exhibits together. There are a lot of cool",
          "Our grandsons 8 and 5 year olds. thought the museum was fun. They had never seen old wagons and old west collections. But it was more of a collection than a museum. There were coin operated things to do and most did not work, we lost about a dollar. It was $20 for the 4 of",
          "I have to say this is one of my favorite stops made on my family vacation to Colorado Springs! The lady who ran the place was very friendly, outgoing and enjoyable to talk to. As for the cost to get in, not asking for much to help keep the place updated charging under $10. You",
          "We stopped because it seemed like a fun chance for the kids to see the old west, but it turned out to be less of a \"museum\" and more of an antique collection. The different store fronts were neat, but not real, more of a reacreation. The old wagons ere neat, and the kids liked",
          "My wife and I stopped in expecting a boring tourist trap, but we were very pleasantly surprised. You first enter the gift shop that has what you would expect for a ghost town museum gift shop in Colorado. The fee for the museum is paid at the register. It was $7.00 or a little",
          "Cute little museum, but it's so much smaller than i expected, and i feel like it doesn't worth the money..",
          "We enjoyed the tour and it included a lot of authentic old items. The displays were old and dusty too and could use some sprucing. Still interesting.",
          "We spent way more time there than we thought we would. It was fun, informative, and a wonderful atmosphere. It cost very little to get in, and the gift shop is also nice. A few things need repair, but that didn't mar our experience.",
          "Was not sure how our 5 year old daughters would like this but they chose it so we went. They loved it, had so many questions I was amazed. They really thought it was neat to see the old timey things and wanted to know all about the jail and stagecoaches.",
          "There was a good collection of historic artifacts with push buttons on the displays that would give you a history of the display. Price is good. Friendly staff. I love history so this was right up my alley. The only bad thing was the panning for gold is only done in summer",
          "Some people complain that it is not a very good museum. I'll admit, some of it seems cheesy, but then I was talking to someone that worked there and learned there is a history to this old place. This is an actual ghost town from the gold rush era in the 1800's that was brought",
          "You walk through the entire place in about 10 minutes. There is a lot of old stuff and a hall of windows to view it. If you are lucky you might be able to \" pan for gold\" but there is not a lot of facts or anything about the stuff they have and why it's relevant. It was about",
          "I have visited many \"ghost/western era\" towns, but this was something I didn't expect. This \"ghost town\" is set out in a street-type, where various \"rooms\" are displayed, such as the newspaper, the dentist (along with mannequins and especially well done for a dressing room, a",
          "If you just needed something to fill in some time this would be a nice place to visit. It was a little pricey for the attraction. There are different rooms set up with displays and recordings - it was interesting but not a whole lot to see and do for the price.",
          "Use the online coupon from their website - you can show it on your phone and get $1 off. We had a good time there. There's not a ton to do, mostly just looking around at all of the old stuff. Make sure to BRING QUARTERS - a lot of the things require a quarter to watch an old",
          "It was something ok to do because it was raining when we went. The artifacts they have are very nice and interesting. The gift shop is great and has lower prices than the gift shop at Seven Falls. I give it a rating of 3 because I have been to other \"ghost towns\" that were",
          "This was our first trip to Colorado Springs, and we had a day to ourselves, before a reunion. Thought we would give this a try and were a little surprised at what we found. It is a replica of an old wild west town with the various shops. It was quite interesting to walk",
          "There's a lot to see in this museum, especially for such a low admission fee. That being said, there's really nothing here that I hadn't seen in places outside of Colorado. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I guess it wasn't what we found here.",
          "Just a bunch of old stuff sitting around, including the staff. The gold panning is a manmade table that holds water. Most fun part is the mirror that makes you short and fat.",
          "What struck me first was how the Ghost Town was actually indoors. We had hoped to walk the streets outside, in the sun. There weren't any actors walking around making it feel more authentic, but the animated characters were fun to listen to and they had many interesting rooms to",
          "It's not big but there are some fun, old things to see -- the town, carriages, cars, stagecoaches, the general store, jail, assay office, etc. You'll learn something. My two kids were free, so I thought the price was reasonable overall. The gold panning wasn't great. The gift",
          "Half of our family was having trouble with the altitude so the other half went to the Ghost Town Museum. It was a good way to spend an hour and learn something new. My 10-year old enjoyed panning for gold and it was nice not to be rushed. It it were a rainy day, this would be a",
          "Admission seems a little pricey but what isn't on vacation! Neat to see many of the old carriages, old arcade games, and antiques by building. However, it only took us less than a hour to go through everything. Panning for gold (seasonal) is definitely geared more towards the",
          "This museum is fun if you have about an hour of free time. Make sure to bring quarters because there is a lot of old viewing machines to look at. The gold panning is fun and you can find little pieces of gold if you try hard enough.",
          "For the price this is not worth it. Very small museum with antiques. It will kill some time, nice gift shop.",
          "We enjoyed the old western facades ,old time shooting gallery (50 cents), and the antiques. The portrayal of life at that time and means of transportation by way of carraiges were fun to see as well. Adults interested in history and children 6-12 would enjoy this the most. We",
          "It's a fun way to kill an hour or two. If you have anyone older in your party, they'll appreciate all of the antiques, remembering when they used to use them. It would be a nice outing for grandparents and grandchildren, to provide a teaching/learning opportunity. Their",
          "I took my four year old grandson. We were the only ones there. He wasn't that interested in the static displays that make up the inside. I assumed there would be much more to do -- my bad. After you've walked around a medium sized barn and looked in at rooms done up as they were",
          "If you have not been to a ghost town or for small children then this is ok. Great for a history lesson.",
          "Stopped here for history information on a stagecoach. The staff bent over backwards to assist me. They couldn't have been more helpful. Thanks.",
          "From outside this museum didn't look worth going into and even in the shop we had doubts. However it was very interesting to see the historical items from the Wild West. The furnishing layouts of the houses were very interesting. It was good to see the old stagecoaches. Maybe",
          "We went here and went on the tour that takes you back into the old western day's, where technology is a thing of the future. We had a blast walking threw what felt like a time change. We mined for gold and enjoyed taking pictures!!",
          "This was so-so. The little town set up was neat. Some of the \"talking\" manequinns were a little hokey. It was kinda neat to see the items they had but for the price you could probably do better.",
          "This museum is pretty neat - just really small and it seems like it's uncared for. The whole place is very dusty, but it's neat because it's like you're actually on the main street of an old town. There are some hokey things in there, but overall it's very interesting and worth",
          "This was more staged than other ghost towns I've seen. Kids might enjoy it but it was too touristy and a waste of time and money for us. Again, something kids might find fun. They have lots of gift shops, period homes, stagecoach....that kind of stuff. Just okay for us.",
          "Maybe this just isn't our family's cup of tea, but the kids (5 and 9) were bored, and the adults were disappointed. If you love the old west and seeing relics maybe this would get a 3. The panning for gold is really lame. Your kids will have a much better time doing that at the",
          "The place was fine and interesting if you're into Old West antiquities. The 7-year old son had fun, but there was nothing that held his interest for too long other than panning for gold. We figured it would be a 1.5-2 hour stop, but we were in and out in about 45 minutes. Two",
          "I wasn't impressed by this place, I would avoid it unless you're really into looking at old pieces of items from the wild west. It didn't seem worth the money paid to see the museum. So many other things to see in Colorado Springs and if you're pressed for time or on vacation,",
          "My daughter begged us to take her to Ghost Town. It's an indoor old western town that was built inside a large building. The ghost town is very small, but it does have some interesting relics and authentic items. There are several horse drawn carriages. You cannot go into",
          "The kids wanted to pan for gold so it was our last stop before leaving the area. It's small but packed full of historical items. Bring quarters for all the little things you can do inside the \"town\". Shooting gallery was fun for everyone. The self playing pianos was fun. Old",
          "I had never been before so I took my grandchildren for an educational trip. It is a small museum. The air conditioner wasn't working properly and it was hot in the building. They were able to pan for gold and attempt to shoot targets. But that was about it. It was keyed",
          "Ghost Town was a great place to spend a banking hot afternoon -- cool, indoors, lot of interactivity for the kids, and my daughter found a piece of gold when she panned! It's sort of cheesy, a little Rundown, but fun, and a good value for the price. bring quarters and one dollar",
          "It is neat but not a lot to it...just some cool old west stuff preserved really well. I am glad we went but I had more fun looking in the gift shop.",
          "This was a nice stop to get out of the hot sun. No, it isn't fancy or high-end like some big-city expensive museums, but it does give guests a glimpse into the past. While this isn't an actual preserved town of the Wild West, the museum did a good job of collecting and",
          "We enjoyed this museum. This was small but just as fun as any of the other more popular museums in the country. They pack a lot into a small space here! Panning for gold was fun, but would have been better if some gold could have been found. No one found even a speck the entire",
          "We stopped by here because of the description - walk through old time saloon, general store, etc. It's only a very short walk in an enclosed building - to their credit, they do have some nice original items from early 1800 to 1900s but if you've ever been to a quality museum,",
          "This was a nice museum, lots to look at in each of the buildings. There are lots of hands on things for the people to look at. It's indoors, so it gives you a chance to get out of the heat for awhile, and still look at real artifacts of the old west.",
          "Enjoyed the look back into time. It was fun panning for gold. Even the little ones had a good time.",
          "This museum is small--it takes about an hour or so to go through the whole thing. The gold-panning I've read about was closed (this was before Memorial Day). There are some interesting items in the displays. The stagecoach, Cadillac, and Pres. Arthur's bedroom set were pretty",
          "It is interesting. My kids (age 3-10) loved climbing on the carriages and seeing the player pianos. There is a lot to look at if you want. It is like a small western town street inside a building with a lot of antiques and items of interest inside each shop (like the saloon).",
          "Really not much to see here, was very disappointed.",
          "This little museum had a wealth of history that will amaze you if you are a regional history buff! From the player pianos, stage coaches, and Chester Arthurs Bedroom set, to all the early trinkets, and gadgets you would find in the old wild west, this was a great little place",
          "What a great museum. It actually was much larger than I expected. Some really great items like the player piano and old coin movie machines. Really fun and some very fascinating displays. Totally worth the time snd money.",
          "Lots to look at. Better for older children. My parents loved it. Lots of by gone era items that they remember. Story's to be told if your kids will listen.",
          "Lots of stuff to see how things were in the old west.",
          "This is the place to be. We don't have little ones anymore (this would be a great place to bring them) so as adults we've visited because of the store fronts and the authentic settings in each store. Worth traveling a across town on the way up or back from Woodland Park.",
          "You can pretty much see everything you need to see from the street side. If you are really desperate to find a quick outting then this will suffice. I would suggest you drive by and save your time and money.",
          "I took my children to the Ghost Town Museum in August on a day that was too hot to be outside, and we spent a lovely day looking around in all of the rooms and carriages, panning for gold, and looking at antiques. This is one of those quiet tourist attractions that doesn't boast",
          "First off, this is in some old warehouse that they turned into a museum of sorts. The cost was low, so we took our inlaws here for some Colorado history while they were in town. It was a bit disappointing just in the size and there is only one room which houses a \"town\" of",
          "I am glad they preserved the old buildings but to call this a museum and charge the high fee to get in is ridiculous. Poorly displayed and interactive displays were broken. This place would be considered a dump if a restaurant. If you want the real deal, try the Pioneer Museum",
          "I have a soft spot for player pianos and I had fun getting each one to play. I tried a few of the movies and it sounded like one worked (the others didn't) but I couldn't see anything. That was disappointing because if they had worked I would have considered those worth the trip",
          "Shold have been called some thing different. Toast town was not it. Lots of old west day exhibits but not worth the 8 bucks to get in",
          "It was all inside a building. It took us about 15 minutes to go through the muesum. The area for panning gold was so small. Most of the aracade games were out of order. Very boring and disappointing!!! Don't waste your time or money.",
          "At the end of the day, I got what I expected and my 7-year-old thought it was cool. Had my daughter been a teenager, I believe she would have thought it was lame. Lots of antiques in dioramas. If you actually look at everything and read some of the stuff in the displays, then",
          "We have lived here for a few years and finally decided to check this place out. Even with the coupon they offer online, it's just not worth the money. The place really is a museum, not a \"ghost town\" as we had expected. Some of the displays need some TLC and some are really",
          "We got a dollar off coupon off the internet, we wanted to pan for gold, and we didn't want to drive far to a mine and some in our party feared mines/going deep underground, and that's how we wound up at the ghost town museum. There was no one dressed up as Old West Characters,",
          "It was interesting, and my young son liked it for the most part. Some of the machines that you pay to play on took your money and didn't work, but most did. The staff was not overly friendly, they opened the place a few minutes late as we stood outside and waited. We had",
          "This is not a ghost town. It is a museum. And it's inside. So no, you won't be wandering in and out of old buildings. But, it's still kind of hokey and fun. The museum is made to look old and western-y, so it's a fun way to spend a few hours. They had old stage coaches on",
          "Visited with kids aged 8,7,2, and 0. They all loved the museum as did the adults. Very interesting displays with the usual souvenir shop (junk shop) on the way out. One thing of interest was the gold panning included an we all found some gold. Unlike other places that",
          "There is a coupon in the hotels' \"Colorado Springs\" tourist books and maps for a dollar off each of up to 4 admissions, or you could cite AAA membership for a dollar off everyone. There were some nice carriages and stage coaches. One of the rooms had a couple of scary-looking",
          "We should have paid attention to the reviews as this was the worst thing we have seen in The Springs. It is poorly done, poorly maintained and we are feeling poorly after the experience.",
          "Very boring. Staff not friendly, Big waste of time and money.",
          "Don't even bother giving this museum a second look! I have seen better artifacts along the side of the road, and the whole panning for gold thing is a crock! Staff was not helpful with the panning for gold and just told you to follow the directions posted on the fence.",
          "$6.50 for adults for a 5 maybe 10 minute walk through, I am from the Wichita area & I was expecting an attraction like our own Cow Town. It was almost scary to be totally honest, the mannequins look like something out of a horror show.",
          "If you like to see the old west buildings and artifacts this would be for you. I didn't think the admission fee was worth it though. $6.50 adults and $3.50 kids, in addition, you need quarters for some of the old time arcade games inside the attraction. I have to say I was"

          "A fun place to go to check out the Wild West. What the businesses and houses looked like and the clothes of that era. They have a panning for gold activity that is run during the summer and an educational movie that tells you about the life and times of the era. Definitely a must for all ages.",
          "I brought my kids here for something fun inside to do definitely didn't disappoint! The staff were friendly and helpful and were even patient with my son. Which I appreciate more than you know! Will definitely bring more family here!",
          "Cute place. BRING QUARTERS!! So many little short films I suppose you can call it? Only $25 and they have them everywhere. Had a great time!",
          "It was something that I haven't experienced in a long time. Children need to be taught about this lifestyle that has evolved into how we live, today.",
          "What a great time! Entertaining, interactive, and educational. Not many other people here when we visited which made for great pictures. So much fun to be had here. The museum is a bit small but I feel like it's well worth the price. We can't wait to come back when our son is older.",

          "This was much more fun than we expected! It\u2019s a great place to spend an hour or so soaking up some CO history.",
          "Totally cool. Short but very interesting.",
          "Loved it!  The attention to detail and care with which they have collected and displayed all in a replica of a western town under a roof was very impressive. A great way to see what life was like in the past. Be sure to visit when in Colorado Springs",
          "This place isn't very big, but it has very big ideas. I think every kid from Colorado Springs should you go here. There's a lot of local history and things that have been passed down from local families. There's a few Adventures mining for \u2026",
          "Fun little museum! Enjoyed our visit",
          "Cool place with a good cause. Also very inexpensive to visit for a fun filled hour",
          "Oh I love this place such a jackpot of information.",
          "An amazing blast to the past!! There was something to look at at every turn!",
          "Cool. Especially since those old player pianos still work. The one in the saloon with the drums was really cool. Funny mirror. Probably an hour and a half visit.",
          "Great place, but the people that work there have no compassion. They even park their plow(for weeks without snow), in the handicap unloading spot, even after being phoned and informed.",
          "Overpriced for certain. Free for kids under 6, if it hadn\u2019t been it would be a complete waste of money. The games and stories inside are additionally priced on top of the entrance fee. It was much smaller than anticipated. Two stars given \u2026",
          "Great little adventure. Took my 9 year old and she loved it. She was excited to pan for gold and even more excited to actually find some. Now she wants to learn more. I have great memories panning with my grandparents so I am happy to share the experience with her.",

          "for the price this is a good way to kill a couple hours not sure how super interesting it is for a young kid but as an adult it was pretty neat. Got to everything in about an hour and a half. We went in the beginning of March so the outside stuff was not open",
          "Somewhat small, but very interesting and educational. They have multiple little fun things to do throughout the museum too like a little shooting game, a fortune telling machine, and pianos that play if you put a quarter in. The gift shop is very nice as well.",
          "It was fun. It's a neat little stop if you're a tourist or really love antiques and ghosts. We took our girls, and they enjoyed it. Bring a roll of quarters though. We missed half the fun because we didn't know.",

          "Please go here! This was one of our favorite stops on our trip to Colorado Springs. We were able to pan for gold, play a shooting game, explore the indoor area, and watch a short video. Really cool exhibits and the staff are amazingly helpful. You HAVE to add this to your agenda.",
          "An interesting look at a western town in the mid to late 1800s. Static displays, with many period examples. Nothing \"ghost\" about it. Better for adults than children. The staff members were pleasant and accommodating. The panning for gold was a novelty, but nothing to write home about. All in all, just okay.",
          "We really enjoyed the museum. The displays were very interesting and we also loved all the 25 cent pianos that played music.",
          "Nice place to check out has souvenir shop also something to do fun",
          "The kids had a good time",
          "The gift shop in front is nicely done. The way the museum is set up flows nicely. Most of the interactive items work. For 7.50 for adults and 5.50 for little ones ... it is a nice treat.",
          "Nice experience! I did think it was a bit overpriced but my daughters really enjoyed the gold mine at the end. It would be nice to put some umbrellas over that since the sun hits that and makes it very hot.",
          "This is an interesting place. Fun place for kids too. They have a gift shop worh snacks when you first walk in. You do have to pay to get in but it is fairly priced. They have this indoor warehouse totally decked out like an old 1800's \u2026",
          "This was great! I love history.",
          "Fun place to visit.\n Enjoyed the history of the late 1800's and early 1900's",
          "A lot of history.  If you've ever wondered how a town in the old west may have looked, this place paints a pretty detailed picture.  Worth every dollar.",
          "Very cool place. You 1st enter into the store then pay for entry into the Museum. The museum has a great feeling of being on the street of an old time town. Make sure you bring some quarters with you to put into some of the old player piano and other contraptions. It was worth the experience. It was different.",
          "Nice place very friendly people and some funny stuff in the souvenir shop.",
          "Awesome place, lots of antique stuff. The price per entry is 7.50 USD.",

          "What a great little museum. My daughter in law and I had a blast!",

          "Very interesting museum, kids enjoyed it but got bored after awhile and kept trying to prod me into finishing.  Can pan for \"gold\" (really just tiny flakes or tiny nuggets of pyrite), watch a show, listen to audio information at each of the \"shops\", and visit the gift shop.  It's a small museum but has a lot of interesting items.",
          "Cute touristy diversion. The owners have spent a lot of time with collecting and the place really is pretty cool. The old buggies are neat to look at and the different rooms they have setup with historical artifacts are really fun to see.",
          "I loved it. It was amazing to see how it used to be in colorado. It was worth going it kept us occupied for almost 3 hrs. My kids loved it. I would go again.",
          "It was a good time, take the time to really look at things, and imagine back to a time when it was the newest, best. The ladies at the front desk we're friendly and engaging, and shared some stories.",
          "This place is just awesome. Stopped by on an random adventure, and was extremely pleased with what it held in store! 10/10 for a silly fun time.",
          "Went while on vacation in Colorado. It was a fun experience and the exhibits were cool but it's $7.50 a person to go in and not sure it was worth it. It was well kept and clean and all the workers were nice it was just kinda small and not much to see.",
          "Worth to go once. They could make it little more better. Also they should change the name to something else. It says Ghost Town but we didn't find any single thing related to ghost.. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude15",
          "We have been wanting to come here for quite some time and as we are getting ready to move this was our last hoo-ya. The museum was really neat and we really enjoyed the interactive displays. There were a few things we actually own that were \u2026",
          "A fun stop ,fair price, good location. I love history, so I was way into it.",
          "Our family enjoyed it. Bring lots of quarters, though. Great price, need to better the gold panning station. But other than that we spent about 2 and half hours just looking around.",
          "Amazing place!! Had so much fun looking at all the rooms and other things there! Workers are very polite as well. Would recommend if you're into the wild west and history or just looking for something fun to do.",
          "It was relatively fun for the kids! Although, it's a very quick walk through! The gold panning was slightly disappointing....due to the fact that all it really is, is a tub filled with sediment... All in all, it isn't something I would recommend.",
          "Sounds good online super dry in reality.",
          "Great little trip back in time.",
          "Nice antiques, would have been a pleasant experience if the ladies weren't so rude and they didnt quarter you to death once inside. Accidentally paid for someone who wasnt going to go in the museum, was told since we didn't get a receipt we \u2026",
          "Great gifts, and stepping in the museum is like walking into a time machine!",
          "Very intriguing museum, learned little more about the old days. There are different flip book style short movie watching stations. But you have to use quarters to play. In addition to that you also pay for tickets.",
          "Reminds me of Old times. Wildwest kind of feeling.",
          "Small but alot to view. Some of the best authentic pieces ive ever seen. Worth going to. Great gift shop, good prices as well.",
          "Pretty cool place, especially for kids. The gift shop is free to go into (of course). They do offer a military/veteran discount.",
          "Such friendly staff. Not too expensive. Cute little buildings.",
          "Very cool place. Really impressed. Far more than we expected. I had no idea what we\u2019d find inside.",
          "Was fun and informative but definitely not worth the money!",
          "An affordable and unique historical attraction. A lot of really interesting historical pieces and fun for the entire family. A nice place to rid yourself of your smart phone and imagine what life must have been like in the 1800's and early 1900's.",
          "Cool place but doesn\u2019t take long to go through",
          "Very interesting place! We are so lucky we stopped by to see it.",
          "Nice historic place.  Gift shop, not that great.",
          "Interesting but kitchy. Designed more for marketing then for history. Gift shop almost as big as exhibit. Would really benefit from guided tours and hands on interactive exhibits. Overall a fun way to spend an hour.",
          "This place is so cool! It is a great value and a lot of historical artifacts. The layout is great and the kids had a lot of fun. The gift shop is not overpriced and they had some cool things.",
          "Fun and informative self guided experience.  \"Gold\" panning and funny telephone gossip on the old phones. Decent gift shop.",
          "Staff was great and history here was really neat",
          "Great place to visit for the family. A lot more to see inside than what I expected from the outside.",
          "Very nice place to visit while you are in Colorado Springs, their gift store is much more affordable than any other we visited.",
          "There is a lot more to enjoy than you think from looking at the outside. If you enjoy old West relics, a learning video, and panning for gold then the price is worth it with their online coupon.",
          "Fun and light museum of American Life in the early 1890's. The early films are well worth watching.",
          "I went here 3 years ago and I love it. Don't ask why I am making a review 3 years later. \ud83d\ude02",
          "Pretty good and interesting but one piano machine ate up one coin when inserted and machines may not work as intended or may work intermittently. Still though, there's a lot to look at even when it doesn't seem so on the outside.",
          "This was a fun walk down the boardwalks of history! Admission was super reasonable. Self guided, so you can take as long as you like. Great informational movie at the end of the tour. I recommend it!",
          "It was fun for the kids. Most of the animated figurines and information things didn't work. But still good.",
          "Smaller museum but what they offer is great, it is a good visit for anyone from a child to an adult and I will say they do have the friendliest staff",
          "Very well done",
          "Our guests were blown away by this unexpected venue, but our budget was not! The setting is already great and required very little on my part to create a fun and inviting atmosphere for our organization's Christmas party. The kids were \u2026",
          "Was nice but quite warm. The gift shop was cool. Lots of varieties",
          "Cute little museum with lots to see.  Worth the cost of admission for the fun of free gold panning.",
          "A small layout but lots of fun.  Antiques galore and if you are a history buff, this should be on your list of places to visit in Colorado Springs",
          "It was fun for the kids too get a small taste of the 1800s",
          "It was amazing. The service was amazing as well.",
          "My family  and I stopped here, going down to Manitou Springs. Is a great place of history and nostalgia wish we had more places like it!!",
          "Very good museum and I found gold in my pan!",
          "This place is a hidden gem for those that into the Wild West on Colorado it's a must see. Prices are reasonable and don't forget to get you some gold before you leave.",
          "We enjoyed this museum. Very kid friendly. They  even have troughs were you can pan for gold!",
          "Really fun place for the entire family! They let us use the school discount because we homeschool.",
          "This was a nice little indoor replica of an old west town.  I was extremely happy to see the player piani that still worked! I liked the artifacts that were displayed and the old-timey cars and cars, all authentic. Panning for gold, I found \u2026",
          "Small but interesting look back in time, liked the displays, but since you pay admission, they shouldn't quarter you to death inside, just my thoughts!",
          "We had a lot of fun going through the ghost town museum and seeing all the relics from the wild west!",
          "Not worth the money . Inside is small and gold panning and outside was closed . Would expect more for the $ .",
          "Pretty cool place. Learned some history and had fun. Definitely a kid-friendly place too!",
          "History really interesting. You can pan for gold and play some of the games. Take quarters!",
          "American old West history came to life here and I enjoyed the exhibits. Kids need to see how people in our past lived so they can appreciate what they have now.",
          "It's has some pretty cool things but it isn't really a ghost town or a museum. Don't get me wrong the did a great job collecting and setting up an old Western style and feel to the place. But it lacks that ghost town feel.",
          "Wonderful museum.  Super fun and interactive.  Must see for kids!",
          "Its ok. Not worth the price though.",
          "Visit the past of the western frontier in Colorado Springs see a cover wagon much more to see and the gift shop to purchase souvenirs.",
          "Best for younger crowd kinda boring if your a adult. \nAnd lot of coin opt machines don't work and or eat your money. \nWon't return again",
          "I really enjoyed the displays and the people were very informative",
          "Pretty cool little departure from the outdoors - a nice indoor escape if you have been outside all day.",
          "Extremely rude employees. Didn't realize that the museum cost to view and inadvertently walked in without paying (there wasn't anyone at the entrance). We apologized but we treated like criminals afterwards.  We did feel really bad about \u2026",
          "Amazing place. Definitely worth checking out.",
          "This place brought back so many great memories from when I was a kid and lived in Colorado, still fantastic still so much history keep up the good work. \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc34\ud83d\udc7b\u26cf\ufe0f",
          "Very cool, kids enjoyed panning for gold and me and my wife enjoyed all the antiques very interesting!",
          "Great concept if you are interested in fronteir history; there are alot of artifacts. Not as hands on or engaging as I was expecting based on the website. Enjoyable for me, but my 10 year old was not interested.",
          "We enjoyed ourselves and had fun seeing history of the west",
          "Very cool, and since it is all indoors we could do it while it rained",
          "Fairly priced for the museum piece that it is, MAKE SURE TO BRING QUARTERS. There's a lot of quarter run doo-dads inside.",
          "The ladies that run the museum are always amazing.  It's a great piece of history.",
          "Amazing,  a great collection of items",
          "Really neat place, our 3 kids enjoyed it as well, lots of things to see and learn about the old west pioneers.",

          "Very fun place to go for a family",
          "So many cool things to see here",
          "It was ok, I think for a better experience bring a bunch of quarters there are a lot of machines that do things if you put them in.",
          "Pretty cool little place to visit .",
          "I feel as though there was more activity and it was busier when I was younger. Took my kids today with my husband and it seemed a little boring and dry. Best part was letting my kids pick out candy and a birthday gift fir their great great grandma.",
          "Loved this place!! Super educational with still being so interesting that a 4 yrs old wants to go back!",
          "Lovely place back in time",
          "Great place if you're into history and the days of cowboys.",
          "Fun, touristy stop.",
          "What a unique attraction! Some interesting and fun pieces in their collection. It was a bit dark, but that was part of the charm. The gift shop was surprisingly large and had a large selection of well priced merchandise! Well worth the stop if your into western/americana history and transportation.",
          "Neat stop, not as big as I thought it would be. Spent about 1.5 hrs, kids liked it.",
          "The two ladies at the front desk are very rude. Most of the interactive features had \u201cout of order\u201d signs.",
          "Loved loved loved this place, very educational! Authentic displays with actual pieces from that time! Gift shop was diverse & easily shopped!",
          "The kids had a great time and it's reasonably priced.",

          "Great museum of American west.",
          "Love it. Like all the stores.  Wish trains was there",
          "This is a fun place to visit no matter what age you are! It is all self guided. We were able to print a $ 1.00 off coupon, per person, for admission before we arrived. You can \"pan for gold\" like the old-timers used to do back in the day \u2026",
          "A very authentic old western museum. A step back in time. Also some Colorado mining and settlement history.",

          "Fun stroll through time",
          "Nicely put together and at a decent price.",
          "Pretty neat little place. They put alot of antique Americana in a unique setting. It's kind of like a walk back in time (late 1800's early 1900). My only complaint is that it was difficult to locate. It's tucked back off the main road and \u2026",
          "I recommend touring ghost town museum. Friendly staff and the price is right!",
          "Good museum set up like an old town.",

          "Highly recommend this place if you want to learn more about the old days",
          "Great experience was able to walk around and take as long as we wanted. Little one enjoyed it as well when doing the gold mining near the end.",

          "If you love the old west then it has been preserved right here. I'm glad we went I wasn't disappointed.",
          "Great information! Lots of fun",
          "This place is awesome. Take lots of quarters for interactive displays which are a blast. I wasn't too sure about when me and my 21 year old daughter pulled in. It turned out to be highly educational, entertaining, and fun!!!! Things to do for all ages. Wonderful philosophy and preservation of history.",
          "Good displays. Lots of artifacts.",
          "Daughter loved it and we even found some gold!",
          "Pretty cool little place. There were a few interactive exhibits that are kinda cute and  fun and out back they have 2 troughs you can pan for gold. \nNo guided tour, its self guided but all of the exhibits have enough signs that describe it. \u2026",
          "This place is awsome. Lots of things to look at and learn about. Bring a few extra quarters and play the old piano or old time slide show machines. It's worth the $7.50 per adult.",
          "Great historic place to stop by! If you are in to history i definitely recommend stopping in. It doesn't cost much and you will learn a lot about the history of the place. there is also interactive things do that only cost a quarter or 2. \u2026",
          "Great place to learn about our past",
          "Real old town museum where you can experience the life of the old west from panning for gold to one room jail house. Fun and entertaining!",
          "Pretty overpriced for how small it is.",
          "Love love love this place Everytime I go to Colorado I have to stop here",
          "I honestly thought this place would be hokey, because it is billed as a ghost town, but it was very nice!  Under a large building they've constructed a makeshift western town containing stage coaches, buggies, etc.  They have shops made \u2026",
          "Cool history.  Grandkids liked it.",
          "This place was cool but more just a gift shop than anything. All the same though there were some interesting things to see, and if I'd brought quarters it might have been more fun. I could see kids enjoying it though.",
          "Awesome Museum...worth your time to visit!!",
          "Awesome place, learn alot and the staff is very friendly.",
          "Pretty cool little museum in the \"tourist area\" of Colorado Springs. It is on the smaller side but the history of the buildings and how they arrived at this location was pretty fascinating to me. I'd say it's more geared towards an adult crowd but there's some cool activities like panning for gold that the kids would love as well!",
          "Great place to visit.",
          "Interesting look into what life was like in a pioneer town.",
          "Bunch of old stuff arranged to look like the period.  Typical roadside attraction.",
          "Really cool place",
          "Definitely worth the money. My 8 year old enjoyed it very much!",
          "Very cool museum! Lots of very old very interesting antiques/artifacts. Would take hours to look through everything in detail! Definitely a good place to visit. Gift shop doesn't have much related to the museum specifically, but otherwise, very cool place.",
          "Fun fact-filled place packed with antiques.",
          "Amazing!!! It is cheesy in all the right places. The exhibits were really fun I love old fashion things. Got to sit on a carriage and play with things. Very hands on. Not very informative besides just saying what the objects were. There are old fashion machines that cost a quarter but were worth it. Definitely worth the 7.50.",
          "Nice deep into earlier times",
          "All of it was fun! Loved panning for Gold!",
          "The gold panning was fun . I was able to practice my skills and found like 15 small tiny nuggets",
          "This place is so neat and such a trip to the past. I hope this place stays here forever so I can take my future grandkids here. Make sure you ask about the gold panning. I have found gold each time I come.",
          "So much to see and explore.",
          "The staff was so friendly and the exhibits were really neat!",
          "Fun place to experience western life.",
          "A bit dated and touristy. Asked the manager for some event planning and was not provided a call back. Best advice, make your way to Victor where the real ghost towns are located. Their quite a bit more accommodating to parties of 80.",
          "This is a tourist trap! The brochure made it sound very fun and exciting...it was not. No one said you should bring a pound of quarters with you to do any of the run down activities. Our family went through it in 10 minutes and were pretty bored. Wish I could get a refund.",
          "The museum is just that! A museum! I found the artifacts within to be quite extensive and somewhat unique. I have toured many museums and I find is quite interesting to see the differences in the items collected from an era gone by. Thank you for keeping the ghosts of the wild west alive.",
          "Went in with low expectations and was surprised. They have done a remarkable job of finding old memorialbilia. Even more surprising is how many of the photo machines, music players and other items work. Yes they require additional quarters \u2026",
          "Apparently the owner was initially a hoarder of Old Time paraphernalia and he flipped it to bring the masses a genuine Old West ghost town. I recommend it. Plus you can score some unique items in the gift shop.",
          "This was an amusing experience. It is a shall and very specialized collection of items from the great old west.  For a fee you can peruse as you like and as long as you should like through the museum. The longest that this could take is \u2026",
          "Fun little place...  Neat cityscape....   Awesome employees.",
          "Awesome indoor experience of a preserves ghost town.",
          "This was a fun and interesting stop on our vacation!",
          "This was such a fun discovery! The exhibits were well done and the museum was a great size for small children,  not so large they get overwhelmed.  The hands-on exhibits made it even more fun!  Ever wanted to play with antiques and see what \u2026",
          "Fun place for a group outing!",
          "We love this place, we bring all our out of town company here!!!",
          "Amazing. It is a must see for natives and tourists.",
          "Took my parents, who are in their 70s, and my kids here for something to do while they visited. Ended up spending a couple hours here and had a great time! My kids loved the shooting experience,  the various old machines and listening to the phone conversations.",
          "There was a lot of cool things to see",
          "Chincy and very touristy, loved it",
          "Took my kids here over spring break for something fun to do. It was a lot of fun and worth the price. I also found a $1.00 off coupon that I believe was applied to each admission! The staff was friendly and it wasn't too crowded. I like the \u2026",
          "I love the museum! History and entertainment all in one day.",

          "Beautiful place for whole family",
          "Good hidden gem. Really enjoyed bit and the atmosphere. Would go back.",
          "Awesome place it is a real town from the 1800s that has a building built around it a lot of cool stuff from long ago and it is indoors so you can go no matter what the weather is like would recomend to anyone.",
          "Cute place to experience a piece of old Colorado. Had fun watching the picture show of the San Francisco earthquake, and shooting at the gallery.",
          "I enjoyed my visit to Ghost Town Museum, but I would have loved it had there been more to it.  It is perfect for kids with short attention spans.  Adults will likely leave wanting more. The $7.50 admission is reasonable, though the value \u2026",
          "The person below who said there's nothing at all interactive obviously didn't bother looking around at all. This place is AWESOME! There's a beautiful old player piano as soon as you walk into the museum, with two more to find in the \u2026",
          "It was great my grandson loved it!",
          "The exhibit was interesting however the entire place was dirty. All the dioramas where very dusty not very pleasing to observe.",
          "Not bad nice for a relaxing day",
          "A sweet little Wild West themed museum with tons of curiosities. There is not much information about them, just a collection of things and a small giftshop. It's located in a convenient spot if you travel through Colorado Springs and it's totally worth visiting if you are interesting in old fashioned things.",
          "Great for the young family, interactive, fun experience. We went early and had the museum to ourselves!",
          "Awesome place to visit and the price wasn\u2019t bad at all. Great collection of items and history. There is a mining bed that kids can pan for gold and fools gold.",
          "Self-guided tour with amazing antique artifacts!",
          "I remember coming here as a kid and it was great! Anymore, things are really run down.",
          "A bit underwhelming. But a good place to take the kids for an hour or so",
          "Awesome place very educational friendly staff",
          "Not a bad place. Really good place to take children. Decent value but some.of the machines were broken. Shooter guns in the outside half work. Center one doesn't. 2 other machines didn't work but they're only a qurter. Panning for gold was fun.",
          "Interesting place to pass some time. They did an exceptional job recreating the Old West in a relatively small space. Admission was a little high for what you saw and it might not be the most fun for kids. Very little if any interactivity. Little ones may not find it as interesting as adults.",
          "Such a fun & historical place to visit!",
          "Super cool! A lot of neat little details!",
          "Ghost Town is a 100% old west city! You have to see it if you visit Colorado Springs! It's a bit of a drive, but you'll enjoy all the cute and strange things you'll see there!\nThe entrance fee is about 6$ for adults and there is also a \u2026",
          "Fun place to check out while in Manitou Springs.",

          "Great break for the baby while on an epic road trip.",
          "Pretty goood",
          "This was very nice laid out and interesting for the adults to get a look back in the days. Kids(8) were bored most of the time. There was a shooting gallery that they loved and a few interactive thing's to do but make sure you have a lot of \u2026",
          "It's a bit small, and you can go through it rather quickly. The stuff they have is neat, and everything is themed very well. Probably my fault but I was expecting it to be scary?",
          "It's a great place for families- there are A ton of hands on things to do. The only draw back is it doesn't have as much historical documents with their exhibits- a little less informative and a little more interactive.",
          "We had such a fun time with our 3 and 4 year old here. They have good panning and lots of things to look at.",
          "I really like that they recreated the old west. I always find the old West very interesting. Wife and I went through it in 10 mins. Nothing to do inside. They really need to rename their business to old town not ghost town. Nothing scary about this place. We were disappointed. Gift shop was nice and the staff were helpful and nice.",
          "Great place to step back in time",
          "Awesome place",
          "It was fun and entertaining for us and the kids!",

          "A nice add on place for a day of historical adventure, so a good swing by from Manitou or Old Colorado City.  Kid friendly.  I like the music that played from the various historic pianos. We spent about an hour in the ghost town and spent \u2026",

          "Love love love this palace",
          "This museum is little but is totally worth the $7.50 and it totally gives you an insight of what the Wild West use to be. We were pleasantly surprised by how fun and entertaining it actually was. Very nice re-creation of an old time \"ghost \u2026",

          "Cute little museum.  Very affordable!!",
          "This is such an interesting museum! My kids (ages 3 & 5) were a little bored, but my husband and I loved it. Had it not been for restless children, we could've stayed much longer than we did in order to really discover all the artifacts. \u2026",
          "My fiances son and wife moved to Colorado and we went to the museum with my fiances daughter in law. Next time we came to visit we wanted to take his son because he hadn't  gone yet. We had a good time, but there was two ladies at the front \u2026",
          "Cool kitchse museum. Lots of antique coin operated machines in working order. Make sure to bring plenty of quarters.",
          "Cute little museum which shows life in old western town. Like that some of the furniture and stuff is original. Nice stop in Colorado Springs.",

          "Interesting tour of the way it was in the 1800 hundreds.",
          "Fun place,  really interesting museum.  Not really what I thought but still a nice experience. And I found gold!",
          "I love coming here. It's a lot of fun to step back into the past and talk to my kids not only about the differences between then and now, but the amazing similarities. It's not a large museum, and if you wanted to rush through it, you \u2026",
          "I liked it alot, loved the history telling of all the specific areas in the museum. The gift shop was neat. Prices of certain things were a little high but other then that it was great.",
          "Good place to visit. I've been there twice and the past two years.",
          "Reminds me of a classic roadside attraction you'd see like 'worlds largest ball of twine' or something. Fun, small, cheesy. Wouldn't recommend going out of your way to visit but if you're in the area already had some fun for $7.",
          "I was there but did not find it did not find it it",
          "Good fun. Great history.",

          "I thought it might be bigger but it wasn\u2019t but still enjoyable to go and see.",
          "Not great but gives you a glimpse of what a town was like. Other ghost towns are far of the beaten path.",
          "My Husband and I loved it! It is kind of small but I love old stuff and it was so very interesting to look at everything. Neat gift shop with very reasonable prices! \n\nI would agree with other reviewers on the following points: \n\n(1.) Bring \u2026",

          "Nice place the people are always helpful",
          "You walk inside through the gift shop and you are back in the era of cowboys, cars and gold panning. Feels like a small town. You walk through and peek in shops such as the barber shop, a jail, a firestation, a convenience store and a room \u2026",

          "Really cool museum",
          "The Ghost Town Museum is a great place to visit. The owners ( and their parents before them) have collected many unusual artifacts and pieces of old west history and they are artfully displayed in a frontier town setting (indoors) so we can \u2026",
          "Fun but smaller than it looks.  That back fence that looks like a big ghost town is just for show.  There isn't anything back there.  Otherwise it is a cool collection of historical items from the Wild West.  Good way to kill an hour or so \u2026",
          "Great stoo",
          "Fun time.",
          "I wish I could give this 0 stars... 13 dollars to look through windows. Nothing interactive at all so boring and after 5 min my son was ready to go.. everything in there cost money just to see it work.. this should be a free thing to the \u2026",

          "Musuem is over priced but nice",
          "A must see place",

          "Neat place to visit. Not crowded during the week.",

          "Awesome displays",
          "Not bad. Cute for kids. Smaller than I expected. Good place for some photos. Not much education. Very whitewashed. Some of the souvenirs are pretty racially insensitive. Others pure offensive cultural appropriation. ",

          "I was visiting a friend that has lived in Colorado Springs for a while. He had never been there, and since I wanted to go, seem to begrudgingly go along. We both ended up being very impressed. It was much more than either one of us \u2026",
          "Good place, indoors with huge gift shop. Take lots of quarters for the various interactive things though which are extra to the 7.50 dollar admission price.",
          "Really didn't know what to think from the name.  The place is jammed full of great examples from long ago.  Inside you will find an old main street and you can peer inside and see what it was like long ago.  The video at the end of the \u2026",

          "It is small but well worth the trip. The museum has some pretty interesting stuff in it.",

          "Was skeptical at first but turned out to be neat stop. Having been to Bodie, CA it's hard to beat that historical value, but this was a little different. They brought parts of buildings inside to keep it from deterioration of the elements. \u2026",

          "I though it was going to be an actual ghost town to go visit and not a warehouse that has these buildings brought from all over the state to make an attraction as they put it. We left before we went in as it is $8 per adult to enter plus small fees to participate inside. The moose outside was cool. That was about it. Disappointed!",

          "For all you dumb peole saying it wasn\u2019t scary! It just shows you are ignorant about what a ghost town is! It\u2019s not about seeing ghosts! It\u2019s just seeing how the past was!",
          "Very nice place",
          "Geared towards families with younger children but was fun",
          "Not at all what I expected. The idea of what this place could be, overshadowed the actual experience of this \"ghost town.\" While the place had some neat displays, all in all, it was highly anticlimactic. I'd suggest not going into it with high expectations. ",
          "Fun place to experience the Old West. Lots of photo opportunities and kids of all ages were there and seemed to be enjoying themselves.",

          "Great place to go and visit a little bit of history........",
          "Cool old west stuff, some of the old machines were out of order though. Panning for gold here is not really worth it. They seed a few tiny pieces once or twice per day and the rest is fools gold. Fun for the kids, just don't expect them to find any real gold. ",
          "Their authentic German bakery items are a must! Dieter was very kind.",

          "Not very big for the price of admission. Some things are scary for younger children (there's a noose in the jail cell and the prisoner is creepy, there's also a taxidermied 2 headed calf), overall, a decent waste of an hour or so if you're in the area.",

          "We visited the museum with 3 children, ages 9, 7 and 5 and they all enjoyed it. They were very interested in everything and it kept their attention the entire time. Of course, they loved the gift store, especially the old fashioned candy. The adults enjoyed it too. If you like",
          "Beautiful building, a self guided tour with a wide mixture of history events not worth the $50 for the five of us",
          "It is worth taking a look around if you are in the area. I don't know that I would take a special trip there, but we did enjoy seeing it.",
          "You have to be really into history for this place. They do have a cute tea room but when I walked in in shorts and T-shirt and everyone else was looking like the queen of England in their hats I definitely felt out of place. I got to the tea room 2:45 they close at 3 they",
          "Loved the self guided tour. The scavenger hunt was really fun to do and learn about the castle at the same time",
          "If you're into fascinating architecture, Miramont Castle should be on your itinerary. It's fun to walk thru and take in the various features of the building. Forget about the contents, not much worth seeing if you're not into creepy old dolls, but it's an okay way to spend an",
          "I\u2019d rate this higher if it was donation only. As it was, at $10 per person, it felt like a rip off to us. Takes about 10-20 minutes to walk through, so very overpriced. Perhaps if one gets the tea and makes a day of it, it\u2019s better? Yet, high tea is $40! Anyway, I can\u2019t speak to",
          "I have visited the Museum in the past but this time I want to address the Tearoom. My sisters and I enjoyed the Tearoom during their visit this year. We all agreed this is possibly the best Afteroon High Tea we have had. Mind you, we have had tea in many famous tea rooms",
          "This is really a fun visit. Yes it is haunted but nothing scary at all. The tour is very interesting and the food in the Queen's Parlour is excellent.",
          "Nice little self guided tour through this large house now turned into a museum. Has a hodgepodge of many different subjects. Great view of the mountains from multiple large windows.",
          "This house is an example of a Victorian house. It is large and each rom is of interest to anyone who likes history. Volunteers are happy to talk about th place .",
          "went to the museum all day and enjoyed the tea house. took many hours. very quiet, and enjoyed learning about history.",
          "The woman at the front desk was very uncomfortable with young children. Children need to be capable of understanding \"don't touch.\" Had a wonderful time at tea, but also not for children until they are old enough to sit fairly still for an hour.",
          "The girls enjoyed the tea and service. The were being quite silly by the time we were finished! The staff was nice and the girls enjoyed being pampered.",
          "I don't even know where to begin. So much history and a knowledge overload. The Castle has been elaborately restored and is still undergoing renovations. Amazing piece of history. The tribute to our firefighters was incredible. Loved tea with my 2 favorite girls as well.",
          "I didn't have time to tour the castle, but I did stop for lunch in the tearoom. Since I didn't have a reservation, I didn't expect to get a table, but I was welcomed in. The service was friendly and prompt. I had a light lunch of potato soup and a pot of tea. Both were",
          "Self guided tour through the last hundred years. The castle had been restored by the people of Manitou Springs Fire museum downstairs is cool. Religious relics are good",
          "I reserved a table for 9 in the tea room to throw a baby shower for a friend. Leading up to the shower, the woman I spoke to at the museum was really helpful in answering all my questions, asking if anybody had any food allergies, and working with me and their chef to come up",
          "This place is stuffed to the brim with antiques and artifacts, and has a really neat history. It was a short walk from our hotel (Cliff House), and we really enjoyed wandering through the museum.",
          "was their during christmas its a small european like castle a catholic priest use to live their years ago.",
          "Awesome location, food and staff. We held a school event for a 100 people. All enjoyed the spectacular surrounding views and the museum. Small parking, but there ia shuttle to nearby parking.",
          "The place feels heavy I think related to it's long association with the deaths of TB patients it once housed. All the stuff on display isn't true to the building and looks like a little cheap museum with stuff perhaps collected from antique stores. Save your money on this one.",
          "If you like old Victorian homes and d\u00e9cor, you will love touring this place! It is a self guided tour and does not take very long to go through the house. We went through all of it in about an hour. The cost is $9.00 for adults. There are discounts for military, seniors, kids",
          "Wonderful architecture and castle has museum with historical items Built in 1895 as a private home. The castle is on the National Registry of Historic places. They serve Christmas dinner for the needy and give children gifts! The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable! Parking",
          "The building is gorgeous and the displays are well designed. The firefighter exhibit is particularly interesting. We enjoyed our 2 hour walk through the museum and capped it off with a relaxing lunch at the Tearoom.",
          "Happened upon the Miramont Castle Museum - it has a great background story & is a self guided tour with an explanation sheet to guide you through. Very enjoyable.",
          "When you find yourself in Manitou Springs you should visit the Miramont Castle. All the Staff was knowledgeable and very accommodating. As an admirer of structural designs, I find this Castle to be a beautiful structure. I highly recommend anyone to visit this intriguing Castle.",
          "We enjoyed this castle and was quite impressed with the museum/tribute to local firefighters and all firefighters.",
          "Planned on touring the castle then having a light Victorian tea with my 11 year old daughter. We made our reservation for 11am and got there about 10:30 giving us a little time to tour the castle (mansion with castle like attributes) before our tea. Was surprised to be able to",
          "Having been used near original restorations in other places, I was disappointed with this one. The restoration work is done in pretty disappointing quality, workmanship or using material available from local hardware stores or furniture stores. I can understand that this",
          "The weather was rainy and foggy during our trip. We found the Miramont Castle in the hotel card rack. We had a great time wondering around in this facility. We did not have time to stop by the Tea Room but heard it was excellent. The tour is self guided. It is a mix of the",
          "What a unique house - 4 stories high, connected to the mountain, and designed so that one can exit the house on any floor and be at ground level. Amazing stone fireplace that weighs 400,000 pounds and is built into the mountain. We visited after riding on the cog railway,",
          "Interesting, eclectic house (not a castle) on a steep hill a little outside Manitou. We hiked up the hill (limited parking) and discovered later that the free trolley stops nearby. Interesting house and exhibits.",
          "This is a large historic house built into the hillside overlooking Manitou Springs. The basement rooms contain a fire museum and a model of early Colorado Springs. Elsewhere was a fascinating collection about the Nuremburg Trials. It seems a mismatch, but local judge John C.",
          "Definitely worth visiting if you're interested in local history. It's not a replica of what the castle used to look like. They had an exhibit on firefighters, for example. Nice staff and cool artifacts.",
          "Good choice for a rainy day. Large house with four levels, period furnishings, art exhibit and fire fighter display. There was a gift shop on the top level and gardens outside.",
          "Spent the night in Manitou Springs mainly to visit Garden of The Gods. We accidently drove by the Miramont and it does have a WOW factor from the exterior. So we walked back from our hotel (Cliff House) which is great. Parking is limited at the site. Seems we paid $10 for",
          "The castle is a huge old house built on the side of a hill. The museum has some beautiful old pieces, including a firefighters museum. The sun room is now a small tea room. If you want the high tea you should make reservations. Otherwise, there is a sandwich and salad menu. I",
          "We found the Miramont Castle to be an excellent choice to visit. The rooms have so much history, and they are nicely decorated. This castle is hard to decribe as it was a hidden jewel to discover. We enjoyed each room and found the structure of the rooms quite interesting.",
          "We throughly enjoyed touring this historical, 1895 castle/mansion. Thanks to the Manitou Springs Historical Society for their restoration furnishings and upkeep. We liked the self tour--you can spend as much time as you want enjoying the furnishings, and views out the",
          "Ecletic mix of archives, love the old building, the people of Manitou Springs have worked hard to restore this lovely building. Lovely lady in the the gift shop happy to share her ghost stories when asked. Perfect break from the the crazy busy town!",
          "This place is amazing and the lady at the front desk was so very helpful and knowledgeable. Wish we could have tried out the tea room but need a reservation for that. Will definitely check that out next time.",
          "Our family consisted of 4 generations; ages 12 to 78. The Tea luncheon was a great experience. The food was delicious and beautifully served. Great selection of teas. The 12 year old loved the experience. There were 2 tables of period hats we could wear...great fun. Must",
          "We researched castles in Colorado. This one seemed the most child friendly and not too out of the way. We went there not really knowing what to expect. Their website is expansive but you don't get a full jist of just how big it is and how much history is there and in the area",
          "This self guided walking tour was one of our favorite stops. Upon arriving the hostess explained how the castle was built, rules of the walking tour and how the Castle is still being restored. We were also given a scavenger hunt for my 11 year old that helped us to notice many",
          "1988 on our honeymoon, this was one of our stops. Very well preserved piece of history for you and your family to enjoy. Beautiful architecture and many new exhibits added. Something here for the history buff in all of us. Thank you Miramont and staff for continuing to share",
          "The tour is an inexpensive, self-guided walk up four stories, so climbing stairs is required. Since we went at our own pace, this did not present a problem. The rooms were full of antiques, and the architecture was impressive. The windows in particular were amazing! There",
          "Pretty pricy for admission, but a neat historical place to visit. There is a tea room where you can eat. We did not have reservations, but were fortunate enough to eat there. That was worth the money spent!!",
          "My wife noticed this place on our way to the Cog Train to Pikes Peak. It has many rooms with numerous artifacts about many eras of the area and its history of occupants. there is also a garden area in the back. parking is in the back of the museum. we enjoyed the history of this",
          "This was a really cool place to tour, especially on a hot day, and a historic place of interest too. The gift shop was a trip in the Wayback machine with all the old style candies and toys from when I was a kid. Had to buy some!",
          "The castle did not take long to go through. It was interesting but my teen age kids did not enjoy it at all. This is probably more for mature individuals who can really appreciate the age and details of the castle. My husband and I enjoyed the visit.",
          "Had a self guided tour of the castle and spent almost three hours looking at all the history items. This structure being built on the side of a hill with all views looking at the surrounding mountains. A real work of engineering wonder at the variety of architectural designs.",
          "Beautiful home. A lot of local fire and military exhibits. I did a read up prior to visiting which helped understand homes history and uniqueness. Love the 9 styles of architecture and having that gorgeous piece of history still intact in beautiful Manitou Springs.",
          "Excellent museum/castle. Be sure to have lunch in the Tea Room. We highly recommend the fun experience! Food was delicious and reasonably priced",
          "Beautiful building that is being rebuilt and refurbished. The Fire Department side is well set up and interesting. The upper floors show more of the original building and history, wish we could have seen more rooms. The house itself is the star of the show. Really a great",
          "The surprise here was the unique World War II history that is tucked away in various places in this house. Very interesting for a history buff. Fun little stop for an hour or so.",
          "To start, this place was really creepy and weird....which can be good, and interesting, but it wasn't good or interesting. The entire house is so ugly, the architecture makes no sense, and there was no guided tour, so it was hard to figure out exactly what it was all about. I",
          "We visited around 12:30 on a hot June day, with a 1:00pm lunch reservation at the Tea Room. The parking is a few spots to the left of the main door, and a larger lot to the left and up around to the higher hillside (then walk back down stairs by the garden to get down to the",

          "Visited this attraction on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. They have a lot of artifacts and are doing a great job restoring it. Finding where the parking lot was proved to be a little tricky. Would recommend this for adults only. Kids will not find this interesting.",
          "Interesting place to tour, not very expensive, comfortable inside, lots of artifacts. You can tour basement firemans museum and attic area servents quarters. It's work in progress, they're working on areas of it and in some cases the descriptions on the walls don't match what's",
          "The castle has a self guided tour for a low cost. There is plenty of history to learn and lots of artifacts to see. The castle is 4 floors and very large. There are lots of rooms to visit with amazing artifacts preserved from the time period. If you have very young children,",
          "If you have time and you like history, architecture, are a fireman, or are Catholic take time out for a casual, relaxed paced, self guided tour of the castle. Oh, to see it back in the day when it was alive and before was modified. You can still just imagine what it would have",
          "Visiting my daughters, we decided to try visiting a Castle. This one was built for a French priest and his mother. It has been through a lot, so it has quite a history. I found the self-guided tour very nice, as we took our time and viewed everything we wanted. There are",
          "This attraction is definitely worth seeing while in Colorado Springs. This building has been many different things over the years and the volunteers have done a great job in trying to restore it back to the way the original owner intended. It's well worth the cost of the",
          "This was our 2nd year with our group of ladies having High Tea for Mother's Day. What a hidden gem! The 4 course meal was so delicious and filling, best scones I've ever had. Very nice selection of teas as well. The service has always been very welcoming and warm with such",
          "We have visited the castle several time and it never gets old. I love the history! As always It was a Great experience and we had a great time. Next time we will have to have tea.",
          "Miramont Castle is located just a couple blocks from the main avenue through Manitou Springs so easy walking distance from our hotel. We love museums and were pleasantly surprised by the way this home had been restored and the items within it preserved. The curator or director",
          "We did all of it and enjoyed all of it. Lunch was fabulous, delicious salads and entrees. Staff is nice everywhere. Wonderful gift store with lots of choices (mostly for women though).",
          "So, so place! I don't think it was worth the $. Interesting historical walk through. I would have liked more info about the priest that got run out of town!",
          "While we like to see Mansions and Castles I don't think this was worth the cost. The kids couldn't wait to get to the end. Although you do appreciate the work that the historical society had to do to bring this back from a fire it just failed to keep you interested.",
          "This is a pretty cool museum. Take the time to talk to the ladies that work there. Make sure to ask them if it's haunted and what they've experienced.",
          "Who knew there was a castle in Manitou?? Well this one is well restored and preserved. Surprise Fireman's museum in the basement. There is small high tea restaurant inside as well. For people with mobility issues there are motorized stair lifts and climbers that can take you to",
          "The museum is quite small, but full of those cosy little things that will make a curious visitor to stare at, read and admire. Firemen attributes, old furniture and kitchen tools, books an war history... Not sure that it alone worth driving far, but if you are visiting Manitou,",
          "At one time after sitting empty and being vandalised this home was scheduled to be demolished. Fortunately it was saved and is being repaired. Nice Fireman's museum inside. Worth the small entry fee. Imagine living there when it was built.",
          "Beautiful snapshot of history. A scavenger sheet helped us to look a bit further and see some details that we might have missed.",
          "This is a very cool attraction, my son (9 yo) really enjoyed the tour. The tour is self guided so you can take your time on the things that interested you most.",
          "This is a self-guided tour, so you can take your time and see what you want. The Fire Fighter museum room was very interesting. Not a lot to see, but still something to do. Entrance fee supports the upkeep of this historical site, so I recommend anyone enjoying history to",
          "This place is amazing! The history that this place has is amazing! The staff here are friendly and knowledgeable! The tea rooms food is amazing!",
          "My daughter and I had such a wonderful time enjoying High Tea. The service was amazing. We started with Chocolate Cherry tea and the best craisen-butterscotch scone. Beautiful fruit medley-even a little kiwi heart. Creative little crostini sandwiches followed by a pot of",

          "There's a terrific firefighter exhibit at the beginning of the self-guided tour -- read the plaques! We learned all kinds of things. The building is really interesting. I would recommend this.",
          "This was a very unique, self-guided tour of Miramont. We enjoyed the detailed descriptions for each room and item. It truly was a \"history lesson\" for the area as well as the Castle itself. The Gift Shop was wonderful and the kind woman working there pointed out the",
          "We spontaneously stopped by the castle and were able to get seated for lunch in the tea room. We had a delicious lunch and tea. My only concern was when the bill arrived and there was a $10 service charge for the gluten free bread. I am happy that they cater to those of us",
          "This is not a fancy castle I have toured many in different states and I would not consider this a grand affair. Although it had its charm and a very interesting past as well as why it was built. The tour was self guided and u could read clearly the facts of each room printed .",
          "I love old historic mansions. This one is very massive looking on the outside. It has some lovely details. We didn't understand why the fireman's exhibit was there, but walked through it. I wish I had known they had a Victorian Tea Room, but we arrived too late to partake. I was",
          "Really enjoyed this return to yesteryear. The museum and grounds the various dioramas of times past were very interesting. We really enjoyed the tour.",
          "Mansion was a perfect rainy day activity. Interesting and informative about many parts of the area. Firefighters memorial was one of the best features and worth the entire tour!",
          "A must see Castle / Mansion. First of all make reservations for Victorian Tea in the beautiful Victorian Room. Well worth the money. The pots of tea were delicious and so was the food. The tables were laid pretty and you get to choose if you would like to wear a hat. They had a",
          "It was fascinating visiting the 14,000sf Miramont Castle Museum, built in 1895 by a French Catholic priest for himself and his mother. Enjoyed the history of hands it passed through before being restored in the Victorian manner and also detailing the history of the Manitou",
          "Some friends and I went to this as a fun local activity that I'd heard hyped for years. While it was an interesting old house, it wasn't as cool as I'd been led to believe. The admission price was a tad high, and they didn't give us a group rate (despite having 20 people). I",
          "Very interesting - MASSIVE house from 1895. There were many rooms with different exhibits, but I did not feel that there was enough background information offered.",
          "there were so many things to look at. the tribute to firemen was excellent. Made it seems like an elitist club who blackballs. the furniture was exotic and the history of the owner as trial attorney at Nuremberg was extremely interesting.",
          "I recommend the tea and tour if you are heading to Colorado Springs. Miramont Castle is a beautiful building in Manitou Springs. They have an authentic tea in the afternoon, but I recommend reservations. They also have a great gift shop.",
          "Very beautiful castle in downtown Manitou. It was very interesting, easy to go thur the self guided tour and gift store.",
          "There was way more museum than castle. There were some interesting exhibits - tribute to firemen, WWII memorabilia and the rooms were well decorated with period items. There was not the grandeur that I would have expected to apply the description \"castle\".",
          "We are so pleased we found this beautiful museum. We called ahead for lunch at there tearoom. Our server Daniel was wonderful. He was helpful and friendly. We chose to do the light Victorian tea three-course meal. We had the biggest, butter-iest scone I have ever had. Then we",
          "Dusty, depressing. No guided tour. Boring. The chapel in the house was interesting. Lots of steps to parking. Go to Glen Eyre instead. Also go to Rock Ledge Park near garden of the gods. Great guided tour of historical mansion and ranch.",

          "A self guided tour that is very well done with a lot of printed information everywhere to guide you through the castle. The castle is a work in progress and has an interesting story. If you are in to architectural styles and historical buildings, the tour is for you.",
          "I wasn't able to tour the castle this time but would love to do so in the future. The ladies in my family made a reservation for light Victorian tea. We enjoyed ourselves so much! We dressed up a bit (by Colorado standards) but there were people there in all attires. Staff",

          "I love this castle! It is really neat to walk through and read all the history that this place holds. I wish they still did the tours where they walk you through and tell you the interesting tidbits, but they have informative plaques for each exhibit. The only strange thing",

          "Brought my younger daughter here for a tour. Upon arriving you'll meet a wonderful older lady with a great story. Buy her book, my daughter loved it. The tour is completely self guided, so take your time and look at everything. The firefighter museum is neat, as was the army",
          "This place was more like a regular museum with various topics covered, and not as much of the original castle as I had hoped. Few if any of the home's original furnishings are there. Self-guided tours. Be prepared for lots of stairs. Park behind and above building and walk down.",

          "The High Tea was so pleasant!! Very charismatic servers brought delicious treats and kept the tea pot full! There is a huge variety of teas, each with a detailed description of contents and benefits. The scone was the size of my face; very filling so that the petite sandwiches",
          "Overall, it was fun to visit and see/read the history of the castle and it's occupants. Everyone was very nice and welcoming. They did open about 15 minutes late. It would have been nice to have more than a two-sided page to read to learn about the castle, but realize it was",
          "Went there today and really enjoyed it. Everyone was cordi\u00e0l and informative. Margaret at front desk was a delite. Decided to have lunch at the Tea Room \u00e0nd gl\u00e0d we did.

          "The history behind this castle is very interesting. My sister and I visited and were intrigued. Definitely for adults. I don't know if children would appreciate it.",
          "The selection of tea is nice and varied from traditional greens and blacks to some inventive desert flavors. I really recommend at least going for tea and scones. The food is well priced with a sandwich running about $10. We have always been able to walk in and find a table for",

          "We took two kiddies, 8&10, both of whom were reluctant to go to a museum given their Christmas stuff. We all loved the trip. We were greeted by the loveliest woman who engaged the children right on. The castle is beautiful. If you are in the area, this is a definite stop. I",
          "I was inside their once and took a tourit was really interesting id give it a higher rating except it was a little pricie",
          "As a kid, I remembered Miramont fondly. As an adult, I was less impressed the few times I've been. The building is amazing, but there's just so much that you CAN'T see anymore. For some reason, I always leave hungry and the \"Tea Room\" is unsatisfying.",
          "I read the book the Ghost of Miramont Castle and then I had the opportunity to visit the castle. It was so fun and interesting to see the book come to life. Read the book and then visit. It is amazing how well detailed the book is and how you can just imagine all the characters.",
          "After reading the feedback on my July review of this attraction I decided to give it another try and, frankly, I am very glad that I did! I will preface my comments by saying that yes, although it is not apparent to the first time visitor it is important [in any weather I might",

          "This is hidden one block off of main street, although there is a sign. The self-guided tour for the restored mansion is easy to follow and very informative. In addition to information about the castle, there is also a small fire museum, a small section on the final Nurnberg",
          "Found this attraction while driving thru Manitou Springs and was enjoyable self guided tour of older home built by a priest and had his mother live with him. Interesting history after sold. Home is in very good condition, ? on some of the displays in this \"castle\", with WW2",

          "This castle has been re-done well and holds a lot of history. I love seeing how people used to live. The one problem is the amount of stairs you have to climb. If you have trouble going up/down stairs it might be problematic. You go up 4 flights of stairs and exit the",
          "The curiosity got the best of us so we ventured in. In the basement is a large fireman's museum and you walk through the various rooms in the castle. It was interesting but not a \"must-see.\" It is nice that the women's assoc. has restored it, so the fee helps to support",
          "What a wonderful quirky history this place has! The men in our group young and old loved the fireman's exhibit in the basement .Don't miss the garden and the gift shop!",
          "This was a nice place to take the kids and we enjoyed learning from the tour. We didn't try the restaurant/tea shop because of money but, the garden was absolutely stunning! I snapped wonderful pictures of my children.",
          "We were very disappointed in this museum. We can say our curiosity has satisfied, but that's about it. The artifacts are an odd mishmash of things, some relating to the original owner, some relating to the castle's use as a hospital, and some having no relationship to the",
          "What a great place and a must see if you in the Colorado Springs Area. The lady at the front desk is awesome, though somewhat robotic with her monologue about the property, she is quite entertaining in her own right. Anyway, it's a self guided tour and really neat. Lots' of",

          "Such an interesting place! It has so much character and history, and frankly, is just fun to be in a castle!",
          "Took a family trip and we really enjoyed the castle. The bottom level is a firefighters museum which was very nice. Then the next couple floors are the rooms. We enjoy touring old places, so we really enjoyed this. It is a self guided tour, so you are on your own to look",
          "We visited the Miramont Castle Museum today. The building is very intriguing from the outside. The tour is \"self guided\". You get a piece of paper with brief descriptions of the history of the rooms. For the price of admission . . . it was a bit lacking. The information",
          "This certainly looked like an intriguing place to visit but the trip went sour quickly! It was pouring rain when we visited, and we found that steep inclines and impossible parking almost made us abort the visit! The coup de grace was when we tried to enter from the parking",

          "but disappointing. I was not sure why the random displays such as racecar, World War II, and others were a part of the Castle Museum. To me, that took away from the Castle and information that pertained to it.",
          "This one was a disappointment. This self-guided tour starts with a tour of the basement which houses fire fighting memorabilia and toys trains. Very odd. I still have no idea what that has to do with the house. The rest of the house had some odd pieces in it as well. If",
          "It was great to look around this massive place, you have to climb stairs although there was a lift. It was just so hot and stuffy in there even though it wasn't that bad outside. They had clothes, furniture, pictures and artifacts from the period. This castle even had it's own",
          "Well Preserved & Maintained, If You are not interested in this type of attraction you won't want to pay the admission price We felt it to be too expensive for routine browsing.",
          "Proper expectations will probably help you enjoy this museum more than I did. I spent much of the tour confused. I was expecting a traditional \"Castle\" tour, but instead I just kept trying to figure out what the connection was between all these disparate exhibits and artifacts",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit, taking our time doing the self-guided tour and exploring the various exhibits. The woman at the front desk seemed surprised at the amount of time we spent there, so I am guessing most people just whiz through. Small details and interesting",
          "This place is a labor of love. It's not a professionally restored perfect example of Victorianism, but it has so many lovely pieces and places that the people of Manitou have invested their time in! There are many different displays that are not directly related to the house",
          "The variety of architectural styles in one building is the highlight of this attraction. Interesting collection of every day items from the past century as well as an exhibit of firefighter history from the area. If you are looking for anything resembling a castle or a period",
          "We were warmly welcomed as we entered the house. The lady was very nice to our grandchildren and she invited them to have a scavenger hunt throughout the tour. Once the tour was over, they were given a prize, so this kept them reading and learning about the house as we took",
          "If your on your way to take the COG railroad to Pikes Peak then you have already past this place. Not far off the main drag hidden down a side street. You wouldn't expect something like this. Once you find a place to park the parking lot is behind the castle up on the hill to",
          "My husband and I were looking forward to taking a tour through the museum and grounds. Unfortunately the castle is jammed into a small neighborhood and we were unable to find parking anywhere. Since my husband has artificial knees, we just could not walk uphill a long-distance",
          "We enjoyed the castle. Kids thought it was fun to see the old kitchen and bedrooms. Worth the stop. Great pictures outdoors.",
          "Miramont Castle has some amazing history. It was an interesting self-guided tour through this old house. You are given a fact sheet to read as you walk through each room, so you know the history. I would have liked to have seen more old furnishings, and perhaps a guided tour",
          "I enjoy touring old homes and found Miramont interesting, with its displays and photos of local historical events. We were reminded several times by a staff member not to photograph some of the artwork in the Castle. I found this rather amusing, as the artwork didn't appeal to",
          "This was an interesting family adventure. The staff was friendly and the castle was full of lots of interesting historical materials. Although the castle itself is historical, all of the exhibits are not necessarily connected to its history. For example, there is a large",

          "This was an interesting place to visit, as this house/castle was filled with rich history. An easy walk from downtown Manitou Springs. Definitely worthy of a visit.",
          "The rooms are nicely decorated and there enough items displayed to get an impression of life a hundred years ago. In the basement is an exposition of the firebrigade. I liked the museum for it's rooms and decor. The entrance fee is rather high for this museum $9.00 (6/2015)",
          "Not much to say about this museum. Firemen exhibit was informative, but the rest of the castle was just so-so. I wouldn't recommend this for children. It wasn't very interesting.",
          "Nice looking large home, self guided tour. Still needs some work but they are getting it back to it's glory days looks. A fireman's museum in the basement is interesting.",
          "If you have a chance check into the history behind Miramont Castle. Father Francolon had the home built in 1895 and left the area in Jan., 1900. We throughly enjoyed our visit. The castle is huge and given that it's usage varied from a sanitarium, to multiple apartments after",
          "We enjoyed this self guided tour inside a huge mansion. The history is sort of interesting, although not titillating or anything. Nice way to kill an hour or so if you are waiting around to do other activities. Might bore some people but if you appreciate history, its a neat",
          "not worth the money, just a big waste of time. The building needs to be better taken care of. Walked 10 blocks in the rain for this disappointment",
          "Interesting, obvious that it is not the best built place due to the Priest who decided he was an architect. The history of the Castle is fascinating.",
          "This castle has been something I have always enjoyed going to. It's such a unique building in Manitou. With the history of it being so old draws it's own special appeal. Walking around the inside and observing the museum was quite neat. The views from the inside are",
          "We went for the firefighter exhibit. The \"castle\" is overselling it a bit. They have a lot of work left in restoration, but what's there is authentically appropriate. They had a sufficient amount of information about exhibits. It was a lovely mansion in it's day.",
          "I was blessed to go visit my son and his family in Colorado Springs last February, and we took a field trip to Miramont Castle one day. I'm so glad we did because it's such a fascinating historic place. I was able to look past the tourist-y additions and trappings and focus on",
          "There is a lot to see here, but it isn't handicapped accessible and the first place to sit is on the 3rd floor. Enjoyed the firefighter display, the woodwork, glass in windows. Lots of interpretation signs and history here",
          "The architecture was awesome. My teenagers even liked it. It is very impressive. Enjoyed the gift shop on the top floor. The furnishings were amazing. If you love history, it's a must visit.",
          "This was very interesting from a historical point of view. The museum volunteer was really a wealth of knowledge that wouldn't otherwise be accessible on the self guided tour sheet. Ask questions for the real story behind this castle.",
          "Starting with the Receptionist to the gift shop, this was a good experience. The fire fighters room was excellent. The displays were thoughtful and well done. The kitchen was truely a trip back in time. We had forgotten how many labor saving advancements have been made since the",

          "It was hard for us to find, and not much parking. I feel the admission is a little steep for a self guided tour. It is a way cool building and we had it all to our selves as there wasn't any body else there. I always say guided tours are dependent on the guide and frankly we",

          "I'm glad we stopped and took the tour of this castle. I found it very interesting and enjoyed exploring the rooms very much. I think the fact that a priest and his mother used to live here made it that more intriguing. Seeing the artifacts and the architecture are well worth",

          "Great old building and lots of history. Self guided tour and they did a great job of restoring the castle to it's original state. Plenty of old photos with descriptions of what you are seeing (and when). Also lots of original furniture and settings that reproduce life back in",

          "We really liked this tour, as we always enjoy historic buildings and restored family homes. But younger people especially those with younger busy children would probably have a more difficult time here. The basement level is a fire fighter museum to honor those who worked hard",

          "I think younger kids would be bored here (except in the gardens), but for adults, this is a great tour! You get a lot of history regarding the castle's past occupants, and you're allowed to see nearly every room. The woman at the check-in desk was a bit dramatic with her",
          "The Castle has a really interesting past and they do a good job in setting it up for a self-guided tour. The Castle itself is beautiful and you can't beat the beautiful surroundings of Manitou Springs. Well worth the time spend here!",

          "This building has such a fascinating history that I had to try it out for a second time. Many new displays have been added since I was there last, AND it was a delight to see it decorated for the Christmas holidays! It is definitely worth a look whenever you are in Manitou",

It is a National Register of Historic Places listing.It was also called Colorado College Park and Cheyenne Park.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe entrance to North Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on is about 4.5 miles (7.2 km) southwest of downtown Colorado Springs, where Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on, along Cheyenne Boulevard, splits into the north and south ca\u00f1ons. Pierre Shale, the bedrock for Colorado Springs, and Sawatch Sandstone are found at the mouth of North and South Cheyenne Ca\u00f1ons.\n\n\n== History ==\nGeneral William Jackson Palmer donated land to establish the park, along with other Colorado Springs parks, such as Monument Valley Park, Bear Creek Ca\u00f1on Park, Palmer Park, Pioneer Square (South) Park, and Prospect Lake. He donated a total of 1,270 acres of land. The land donated by Palmer for North Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on Park included Silver Cascade Falls, Helen Hunt Falls, N. Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on Road and other land in North Cheyenne. The city purchased 640 acres in North Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on after citizens of Colorado Springs voted for the measure in 1885.  The ca\u00f1on was considered by the Park Commission to be \"by far the grandest and most popular of all the beautiful ca\u00f1ons near the city.\"\n\n\n== Overview ==\nNorth Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on Park is located at 2110 N. Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on Road. The 1,276.9 park includes Helen Hunt Falls, Starsmore Visitor and Nature Center, Silver Cascade Falls and the White Fir Botanical Reserve.There are 56 miles of trails for hiking, horseback riding and mountain biking and a scenic drive. Picnic areas are throughout the park with one large group shelter available by reservation.A dirt parking lot at the top of the ca\u00f1on provides access to trail heads, mountain biking paths, and Gold Camp Road. It is important to note that parking in the lot is often limited and access to Gold Camp Road and High Drive is blocked to vehicles, but hikers and bikers may pass. Leading up to the parking lot is a series of pull-offs which may be of use when the dirt lot is full.\n\n\n== Starsmore Visitor and Nature Center ==\n\nThe Starsmore Visitor and Nature Center is located on South Cheyenne Canyon Road at the entrance to North Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on Park. It is the visitor center for the North Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on Park that has hands-on exhibits, nature programs, and information about the park.  The lower columbine trails starts near Starsmore and continues on for about four miles to Helen Hunt Falls.  Starsmore is open from April to October.\n\n\n== Trails ==\nAfter passing the Helen Hunt Falls Visitor Center, N. Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on Road ends in a dirt parking lot located at the junction of Gold Camp Road and High Drive. From this point, hikers have access to a multitude of trails.\n\n\n=== Columbine Trail ===\nThe Columbine Trail is a 4 mile long trail that slowly ascends the ca\u00f1on beginning at Starsmore Visitor and Nature Center and makes its way up to the dirt parking lot at the top of the ca\u00f1on. It is important to note that this trail is not a loop and the trail crosses N. Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on Road multiple times.\n\n\n=== St. Mary's Falls Trail ===\nTo access St. Mary's Falls Trail, hikers must hike 1.2 miles along Gold Camp Road to reach the trailhead for the falls themselves. When hikers reach the third tunnel of Gold Camp Road, the trail climbs up over the tunnel and descends into Pike National Forest where it continues for another 1.6 miles to the base of the falls. The trail has multiple switchbacks, some of which may not be clearly marked, and a fork with a path to the peak of Mount Rosa.\n\n\n=== Seven Bridges Trail ===\nNot to be confused with the Seven Falls in S. Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on, this moderate trail is 1.5 miles and is accessible from the west side of Gold Camp Road. The trailhead itself isn't clearly marked from the road, but a clearing on the right coming from the dirt parking lot is where the trail begins. The trail itself crosses Cheyenne Creek multiple times in a series of wooden bridges marked from one to seven. After crossing the final bridge, the trail ends, but the more adventurous may proceed to much more difficult terrain leading to other trails in the region.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInteractive map of North Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on\nNorth Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on Park, page 1\nNorth Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on Park, page 2",

          "I trail run around the canyon at least 2 times per week. It is beautiful with great views, waterfall, abundance of trails. I'm writing this because please be warned that there are multiple car break ins. I haven't had it happen to me personally. But about 1 month ago I saw a car",
          "So many parts to this \"park\". Honestly Every time I go I find more roads and trails and sights. Go more than once if you can, take the trails you haven't been on. Stunning sights, awesome roads. I have some of the specific points of interest already reviewed so i am not going",
          "Parts of the road through the park are paved. A few blind curves that some yahoos take too fast. Road is also heavily used by cyclists. Several scenic overlooks, lots of walking and mountain biking trails, plus a nice waterfall.",

          "Visiting the town of Colorado Springs for a work jaunt, I was driving around trying to access the nearby mountains and I stumbled upon this gem. I learned that the park is owned by the city. It is extraordinary in size, scope and diversity. I'm posting a few pictures with this",
          "We hired the Columbine trail starting at the Upper Columbine trailhead near Helen Hunt Falls. The entire hike was about 7 miles. I would rate it as somewhat challenging due to both the elevation change and there is one part of the trail that was very steep with 'slippery'",
          "This is an amazing park, with an endless number of trails to explore. By far the best in the Springs. You can hike to the top of a mountain, hike along a stream with waterfalls, or just simply hike alongside the side of a mountain.",
          "Also known as Hellen Hunt Falls. The 1st falls is awesome, the 2nd was also beautiful but the 3rd part was not as expected but was a decent hike with all the steps. Make sure you keep driving up the road instead of back down really cool mine tunnels you can drive thru and then",
          "Nestled just minutes from the freeway is this lovely ca\u00f1on with spectacular mountain views and many great hiking trails. Not up to a hike, the drive up and back alone is worth it! Beautiful any time of year.",
          "The nature center is neat, and worth a look around. The best part is taking kids on a walk up along the creek. There are some great things to discover there.",
          "We kind of stumbled upon this park while driving around in the area and it is great!! We first stopped and had a small picnic next to the water that is there which was so relaxing and calm. Then up the road a little bit we explored around Helen Hunt falls! This is a free",
          "Short but steep hike past these falls to get a great view. (What view isn't great in Colorado Springs?) Trekking poles and hiking shoes not really needed as there are railings. And, no, the falls are not named for the actress but for author and conservationist Helen Hunt",
          "This is a lovely park with great visitor centers (2 different locations, very child-friendly). Because it is easy to get to, free, and has some easy hiking/walking paths it is popular and crowded. We did get good recommendations from the ranger about less-visited trails that",

          "A great place to take a hike, have a picnic or just sit by the water and enjoy the beauty. Trails are easy for families and seniors. The trip up to the Hellen Hunt Falls can be tiring so pace yourself on the stairs.",
          "This park is special in a city know for its parks. Nestled in a very narrow canyon, beautiful stream and picnic areas and topped of with Helen Hunt Falls and a path that will let you see Colorado Springs and into kansas.",
          "Nice place to have a come and a picnic! Note that all grills have been taken out so you need to bring sandwiches or of the sorts. Some of the trails are harder than others but a beautiful place to see and relax for the day!",
          "We could not believe there wasn\u2019t even a parking fee to visit this gorgeous park. It is very well maintained and the wooden and metal rails were a huge help hiking up Helen Hunt Falls this winter. It was worth the short, but steep, hike!",
          "Golly it had been a long time since we've been up Cheyenne Canyon. After breakfast today, we took a drive that led us to Helen Hunt Falls. The Canyon is just magnificent. Being winter, we just drove and took in the sights. It is amazing how the canyon walls climb to the sky.",
          "We went to the Helen Hunt Falls area of the park and took the trail (Silver Cascade Trail?) from the falls. Although the falls was frozen, the trail was well-worth the hike. The incline was a bit difficult for us as we\u2019re not used to the altitude, but it was relatively short",
          "What a gorgeous place to hike during the winter. The Ca\u00f1on has well maintained trails that explore various types of terrain. Southern and northern exposures on the same trail can vary your experience throughout your endeavor, which really make the hikes interesting. The",
          "This park is not that easy to find but is one of the largest and in the south end of the city. As most people travel to the west for other attractions, for those wanting to hike and see some of the waterfalls, seven falls ( Cutler Trail ) , this park is fabulous . IN summer,",
          "When we moved to the springs, we went to 7 falls and paid $$. Though it was fun and a fun experience, we loved going to this park better. First of all, it's free!! Also, you can continue up the mountain and circle around by the garden of the gods for a beautiful drive! The hike",
          "Helen Hunt Falls is a scenic wonder no matter the time of year. The park provides a great setting for longer hikes or roads that drivers can take directly to the falls. The road is very narrow due to being on the side of a mountain, so just drive carefully.",
          "Did Cutler trail this time with husband and teens. Beautiful hike - nice exercise - well trafficked trail with lots of dogs out on a beautiful sunny day. Folks working at Starsmore Center where we first parked were great - really gave us the details we needed for the trail",
          "We have lived in Southern Colorado 25 yrs and have never been here. The park is a gem. Pretty drive and nice hiking trails. Especially enjoyed Helen Hunt falls hike. Came in the fall on a weekday so not crowded. With limited parking space it must get crowded on weekends and",

          "I moved to the Springs in July of 2017 and North Cheyenne Canon Park quickly became my favorite spot for easy and moderate hikes. My favorite hike continues to be Mt. Muscoco early in the morning, however when friends and family are in town visiting, I make sure to take them to",
          "We stopped in at the Discovery Centre to get some help on which trails we should take. The volunteers there were great: one we spoke to was over eighty, yet he was still hiking the trails so he could give visitors the best advice he could. His advice was excellent. He put us",
          "A must do if you are in Colorado Springs. Stop at the Discovery Center to get info & map. Lots of trails & waterfalls to see. Gorgeous drive up the canyon road which continues onto Gold Camp road (if you want to do this also). Bring a picnic lunch, they have a picnic area",
          "Starsmore is worth seeing as it gives you plenty of history. parking is good. We went here after we went up hiking. All good and just a beautiful area! We were staying close by so this was a must do. Glad we did!",
          "Despite the positive reviews, we didn't know what to expect...especially when the entrance appears to be a dead-end street just behind a neighborhood of older homes. However, we were so glad we checked it out. Several trails options are offered; park roads are easy (note: if",

          "We visited on a damp day, but still managed to do the walk beside the Helen Hunt falls, its all uphill as you would expect, but a good path and we made it to the top. There was some water flowing but not too much. Beautiful drive up to the falls and down again, plus there are",

          "We stopped at North Cheyenne Canyon Park while visiting Colorado Springs to see a couple waterfalls. The water level was really low, but it was still a nice visit. Helen Hunt Falls is next to the visitor center, don't even have to get out of the car to see it. Silver Cascade",
          "This is such a great place to hike, ride your bike, or just sit in your car enjoying the peace, and quiet. If you are visiting the area then you definitely need to make time to check this place out.",
          "We took some out of state relatives through the park and they were impressed. Stopped at Helen Hunt falls and then hiked to the upper falls. There are some longer hiking trails, such as Mt. Cutler trail and Columbine trail. There are not many parking areas except at the visitor",
          "The entire canyon is beautiful to drive through (watch for bicycles) and there are many little areas where you can pull off and have a picnic along the area. Make sure you drive all the way up to Helen Hunt Falls. They just made a new little information center a few years ago",
          "My husband, 12 yo son, and I went one evening and only had time to hike a couple of trails. We chose both the Mt. Cutler and Helen Hunt Falls trails. Mt. Cutler was a moderate level hike which provided absolutely incredible panoramic views! Helen Hunt Falls was an easier trek",
          "OK, make sure to drive all the way up to the tourist center - we did not know this after speaking to a few \"hikers\" on the road. We hiked through an area off the side of the road, and thought we had found the actual waterfall. Boy, we were we wrong!!! We hiked a little further",
          "Lots of hiking trails. Cheyenne creek is spectacular. Helen Hunt Falls is mesmerizing.Silver Cascade Falls above Helen Hunt Falls is beautiful. Check out the life of Helen Hunt Jackson.",
          "Great trails, worth the visit, the only negative is the traffic on Cheyenne Boulevard from the Broadmoor's tourist trap, Seven Falls. I would recommend driving in, as the shuttles barely fit on the road, if I were a hiker or a cyclist, I'd be careful as there are no sidewalks",
          "We used a stroller on the North Cheyenne Trail, it is wide enough and flat enough to do this. There are a few areas that are close to the edge, so watch children and dogs. Pet friendly area, and a nice little stream to cool off your feel. We walked 3.5 miles to the mine",
          "Absolutely worth seeing! Not a bad hike, even for people not accustomed to the elevation. Just be sure to see it before the Broadmoor continues its takeover of the area and buys it so it can charge admission.",
          "Helen Hunt Falls Visitor center has a beautiful nature inspired kids sitting area for your kids to play. The building is so inviting and you can pan for gold along the outside of the building. Starsmore Visitor Center has a beautiful 2 mile hike along a river with a lovely",
          "Helen Hunt is a nice spot to see some falls in Colorado Springs... and it's FREE. Strenuous hike up hill passed the waterfall though.",
          "This water falls was awesome. Especialy since it is free to visit. The canyon that it is in has some beautiful places for pictures. Hiking was a blast",
          "I wish we'd spent a little more time at this site. It rained most of the day and we were only able to spend about 30-45 minutes here. It is great for all ages. They have wonderful trails.",
          "We went up for a family hike, 8 of us, and found the trail in well kept shape. Easy hike, nothing crazy, there was a great informational center at the trailhead.",
          "We spent several hours here. There is plenty to do. The falls were beautiful, we were able to see a doe and her twin fawns at the Starsmore center. The drive was beautiful as well. Definitely worth spending time here...the best part is that there is no fee to enjoy nature\u2019s",
          "Went to see Helen Hunt Falls. The drive there was stunning. Just know that the best view of the waterfall is from the trailhead. You can hike up a pretty steep incline to get to the top. You get a good view of the canyon, but not of the waterfall.",
          "North Cheyenne Canon is a fantastic way to experience the mountains by only driving a short distance. In ten or fifteen minutes you can go from the heart of Colorado Springs to mountains so deep and beautiful you'd swear you were in a different state. The canon can be",
          "This is one of my favorite places to hike. Beautiful trails for every type of hike. I hike here almost weekly and I\u2019m still finding new trails.",
          "We stopped at the main nature center around lunch time. The planned activities for the day had been cancelled but we enjoyed seeing the various exhibits and had a lot of fun watching the hummingbirds and chipmunks play while we ate our sack lunches on the back porch. We made the",
          "Cheyenne Canyon is unbelievably rugged for being right at the edge of a major city. The scenery is fantastic. The parking, not so much. Go as early as you possibly can. Helen Hunt falls is a bit overrated, but the trails that fan out from there are excellent.",
          "We visited Helen Hunt Falls and hiked the Seven Bridges Trail. Both were very beautiful but parking was limited. Also if you aren't used to the altitude, it can be a challenge. Overall, I would definitely recommend it",
          "This is a lovely place to spend some time. My family visited in 2015 and my hubby & I just visited again. This is a free park with a waterfall to view. Lots of hiking available. I honestly preferred the views and fall in 2015 beings that it rained the majority of our time \ud83d\ude02",
          "This is an absolutely wonderful hiking spot. Starsmore is very interesting and educational. Don't miss this when you visit Colorado.",
          "We just drove to the top and took picture on our way to the waterfalls. It was a pretty drive and we took a lot of pictures. There was a huge hill at the top the kids had a blast climbing.",
          "The drive through canon park is a must see. The seven bridges trail is gorgeous but not marked well. we had to walk 0.7 miles to trail head. Maybe were are not at the correct location for trail head. We took three kids ages 5,6,7 and they only made it to the first bridge",
          "There's some great trails and scenery here! They need more signage to show you exactly where to go if you want to do this or that, but thankfully there were some regulars who were very nice that helped us find the trails we wanted. There's a cool waterfall that still had snow",
          "Short drive off of I -25, this park is enormous and beautiful. Great scenic drive that winds around through trees, hills, red rocks, and along a stream. Lots of stop-offs where you can hike a trail. One stop is at Helen Hunt Falls, which is right off the parking lot. You",
          "Beautiful drive with lots of trails to hike for beginners and for the experienced. Helen Hunt Falls is very pretty and is free.",
          "This is by the Helen Hunt Falls and a very popular place for family outings. There were many folks out for hikes when we were there. Also, it is pet friendly as long as they are on a leash. There are so many trails and paths to explore.",
          "We just happened upon North Cheyenne Canon Park and ended up spending the better part of a day hiking. Trails are fairly well marked and are well groomed. Not too many people, which made for a peaceful, scenic hike.",
          "We spent about 4 hours hiking around North Cheyenne Canon Park and truly enjoyed it. Trails are not that well marked, as we managed to get lost for about 30 minutes! But it was so pretty we didn't mind it. Take hiking poles if you have them, as at times it gets rather steep!",
          "Enjoyed riding up the canon on a motorcycle. Watch out for deer and bicyclists! Very pretty area near falls to walk up over the falls.",
          "Just a short drive out of Colorado Springs and you will think you are in the heart of the Rockiedd. Great picnic spots, trails, babbling brook and a great place for watching humming birds. Be sure to visit Helen Hunt Falls and Star Kempf's Kinetic statues while you are in the",
          "We spent a morning hiking with our 7 and 8 year old children. We hiked Seven Bridges (to the 7th bridge but I believe it goes beyond there), Silver Cascade Falls Trail, and the Mt. Cutler Trail. A few areas of Mt. Cutler were a little unnerving for a mom hiking with her kids,",
          "This park is amazing! I still can't believe it is a city park. My family and I have visited Colorado Springs several times and did not know this park was here. My husband and I discovered this park after we relocated to the Springs about a month ago. We have been going a couple",
          "Gate here early to beat crowds. Our first attempt on the weekend in the late afternoon and it was packed with almost no parking. Today, we made it at noon and, although already filling up, there was still ample parking along the pull offs and at Helen Hunt Falls. By 2:30pm,",
          "This place is beautiful! What's there to say about hiking in the Mountains? The scenery is lovely, and there are a few different trail options to choose from. Skip to the bottom if you want the \"what I would do different next time\". it's a gorgeous area that really shouldn't",
          "We stopped by the park on our last morning in Colorado Springs before we had to catch flights in Denver. The park offered a variety of hiking trails for varying levels. There was great scenery on the trails. Definitely worth the hike! The problem lies with parking. Visitors were",
          "Fun place to drive and hike. We only did a couple of hikes, but all of them were great. Really close to CS too!",
          "Lots of hiking paths with various levels of difficulty. Great views from any of the paths with lots of hidden waterfalls and views to discover.",
          "Visited on our way RMNP. Beautiful park and the one hike we got to do was great. Unfortunately we did not get to do more as our window was smashed in apparent smash and grab while on the trail. At least one other car had the same thing happen at another trailhead. Apparently",
          "This is my favorite hiking spot in Colorado Springs. I'll probably hate myself for telling you about it because I prefer to keep it to myself. But too pretty not to share. Even a novice hiker will love the waterfalls, rushing river, shaded trails. It's peaceful. But also has",
          "Had a lot of fun hiking 2 different trails. I highly recommend Mt. Cutler. Great views. Can even see Helen Hunt falls on the way. On the weekend the place is crowed. Try to go during the week. To top it off it is free.",
          "The North Chenenne Canon Park is a beautiful drive with stunning views everywhere. Don't miss the chance to experience this beautiful park.",
          "We hiked on 3 trails in the park. I can't remember the names, but all 3 offered great views, and were moderate skill level. We would definitely go back. Helen Hunt Falls was closed and we would definitely want to see it.",
          "My husband was amazed with this park 2 locals in old Colorado historic district told us about it, we are so glad we listen it was amazing they have trails and a small water fall. You drive thru 2 natural tunnels. They have places were you can pull off and enjoy the scenery.",
          "My Fiance and I decided to go see the falls at the North Cheyenne Park. When we arrived, it was late morning and the sun was already warm in the sky. The Discovery Center was nice as it told about the falls, the area, and other information. The guide was polite and answered all",
          "Great hikes here, I got totally turned around & didn't find the trail I went to do but liked the one I did. Very busy, parking can be a pain or you might have to wait but it's well worth it!",
          "We drove through this park and stopped at both Helen Hunt Falls and Seven Bridges trails. This is such a beautiful area. Could have spent a lot more time here and made many more stops. A lot to do for everyone. Great photo ops and best of all--no charge for anything! If you like",
          "Great spot to drive/hike/sight see. We could have spent all day walking, including the kid, ages 3-11 who couldn't get enough teail exploring",
          "Another hidden gem in Colorado Springs is the North Cheyenne Canon Park. Filled with waterfalls and cascades with spectacular views overlooking Colorado Springs, it is another in many free attractions in the area. The hiking can be a bit challenging, especially with young",
          "North Cheyenne Canon Park is a must-see when visiting Colorado Springs. Visit Helen Hunt Falls and take a short hike with some great views, or take one of the other numerous hikes in the Canon that will not disappoint you. I visit North Cheyenne Canon on a regular basis.",
          "This is a great park for anyone that wants to get in some nature time without spending any money. There are many trails that end with some beautifull views. There is also a small waterfall to stop at on the drive up. It is small, but a nice place to spend a few minutes.",
          "We had heard so much about this park so we just had to see it for ourselves. We wanted to get to the falls and everything we read about them seemed great. When we got to the falls we were a little disappointed because it wasn't what we expected. A little small. But anyway they",
          "Beautiful, well kept park with amazing trails for all skill levels. Gorgeous views and plenty of perfect picnic spots. It will be a shame to see the Broadmoor take away the strawberry fields openspace. It's truly unbelievable that this gem was sold off to make room for a golf",
          "Amazingly-beautiful rugged mountain peaks, sheer cliffs. Only problem: a forest fire ravaged the area and you'll see that timber. Plenty of places to hike. Maybe the BEST mountain scenery in the area although I also loved Seven Falls. Everybody knows about Garden of the Gods.",
          "Came up here to hike and geocache. The drive through the canyon is gorgeous, with lots of pullouts & trailheads. Be aware that the road is steep in places. The end of the road has a huge parking lot that was nearly full in the morning (in November!), but less busy by noon. There",
          "Beautiful water falls, and I've heard the hike is great (not a hiker myself, so you can't get my opinion on that part). Even the frozen falls are cool.",
          "Very nice park. Lots of trails. Lots of waterfalls. Lots of picnic areas. Lots of photo opportunities. But, restroom facilities are not always easy to come by.",
          "What a wonderful place to visit. The hikes are challenging but so worth it!! Loved all different overlooks and Helen Falls.",
          "This is a very neat little park right in the middle of the city. The winding road takes you up through a forested canyon with jagged rock formations. There are multiple hiking trails that look fairly rigorous because of elevation gains. We didn't have much time, so we just",
          "My husband and I went here two days in a row to hike. We found the trails to be perfect for a 2-3 hour hike full of excitement and outstanding views. We would come here again if ever back in the area. We did Mt Muscoco and Seven Bridges:",
          "I was wowed by the drive through the Canyon on the way to Helen Hunt Falls. But the sun was setting, so I decided to return the next morning to check out some of the many trails along the way. I recommend starting at the top (past the lot for the Falls -- where there's a",
          "Great place to mountain bike!!! Watch out for the hikers that don't see you because their eyes are glued to their mobile devices. Why do people have to use mobile devices on the trails? Turn off your phone and enjoy the scenery :)",
          "Decided to take a morning hike alone. Drove up the mountain a long way just for the views. After getting to the top I turned around and stopped for a hike! I ended up going 3 miles in nearly all up hill! The views are amazing!! SO many trails to take and many run into each",
          "Last year after we got rained out at Helen Hunt falls we came back down the mountain and kept noticing little turn outs here and there, where the creek ran right next to the road. Since it was raining we decided that it wouldn\u2019t be a great idea to get out and explore. This year",
          "A lovely drive through the canon to Helen Hunt Falls. Parking available at the falls with many hiking trails and photographic opportunities. Great for folks of any age. We have enjoyed it many times, and hopefully will again in the future.",
          "North Cheyenne Canon Park is gorgeous. You have to look up at the canon walls while driving through. Anywhere you hike is fun and beautiful. Mt. Cutler is very popular and Helen Hunt Falls is a favorite among visitors-fairly short uphill hike. Lots to do and see. Starsmore",
          "Just completed the St. Mary's Falls hike this weekend. It had been over 20 years since I had last done it. Great hike with numerous families on the trail. My only complaint, as many others seem to agree, is that the mileage markers seem to be wrong on the distance to the",
          "Pleasant trail along the river, very easy hiking! We only did the seven bridges portion, but you can keep going further onto another trail... An enjoyable evening walk!",
          "We drove up there not knowing what to expect, we were told by a local to go there and hike up the Mt. Cutler trail, it was amazing, a bit of work hiking up there as the accents where tough (we had 4 kids with us 15,13,10 and 5). Once up there it is amazing. We also found the 622",
          "Cheyenne Canyon is a great area to visit. Beautiful views. We hiked up the trail next to Helen Hunt Falls. Well maintained stairway brings you to a beautiful view of the Colorado Springs area. Takes about an hour. Free attraction. Bring plenty of water.",
          "Beyond Helen Hunt Falls is an intersection: to the left is High Drive and to the right is Lower Gold Camp Road. This is a 6-mile long, narrow, dirt road that in 0.6 miles turns into a one-lane road with pull-offs. This road follows an old railroad bed. There are a couple of",
          "Sometimes you don't have to fork out for a beautiful vista. Instead of over-paying for the Seven Falls version, go towards Helen Hunt Falls and park up at Mt Cutler. What an excellent hike, and not too difficult for kids. The paths are fairly easy, but as the guide book said,",
          "This place little less known than Garden of the gods, but definitely more enjoyable for my family. Lots more to see overall and with being less crowded , a lot more relaxing",
          "A short drive from Colorado Springs, this quickly became one of my fave go-to spots for hiking! There are a variety of trails for different skill levels and the staff and volunteers at both visitors centers (Starsmore and The Cub up by Helen Hunt Falls) were so friendly and",
          "From the reviews on here I figured it would be nice, but not amazing. There are many many trails. We did the Silver Cascade Falls hike. It provided nice views and was relatively easy and short. We then did most of the Mt. Cutler trail. Tihs was longer, but still rather easy. The",
          "Took my family up the trail to mount cutler. The trail head is about 1.5 miles from the Starsmore discovery center. There is space for about 15-20 parked cars on the side of the road by the trail head. It is a little over a mile up to the top. The hike isn't too strenuous,",
          "One of my favorite places for hiking. Trail difficulty ranges from easy to difficult. I especially liked the Cheyenne Creek trail which parallels the water and has many mini waterfalls.",
          "This canyon is ideal for daily hikes or for morning training like jogging or biking or walking. The geology is amazing and it's one of the few places in the world where to see really rare rocks: ignetites, but you need the guidance of an expert! Anyway visiting this canyon is",
          "I was in town for the week for work and couldn't wait to do some afternoon hiking. Plus I love waterfalls! I drove through the park to Helen Hunt Falls and was a little underwhelmed. The falls were pretty, but the hike up the stairs was fairly short. BUT after stopping inside",
          "This is a must see when you are in Colorado Springs. Within minutes you are in a beautiful canyon full of nature. The Stars more center is a great learning experience for kids. Ask about the climbing wall",
          "Took the family here to stretch our legs after driving Pikes Peak. Great friendly advice at Helen Hunt visitors center. Took the trail to the top of the falls and admired the view down the Canyon to CS. Then drove to the old Gold Camp train bed coming down from Cripple Creek.",
          "We picnic in the rain here. Thankful for the larger trees that made that possible. We had lots of fun looking around here before heading up the mountain to Helen hunt falls and seven bridges. This park has some other stops located inside the bigger park like Helen hunt and seven",
          "Very nice area, steep cliffs, beautiful stream. Drive up until you get to the visitor center. Then walk to the top past several water falls. The view at the top is worth it. We have an 11 and 13 yr girls and they did great and werr excited about the scenery.",
          "Oh my gosh. We loved this place!!! First of all it's free! The drive is so easy. Lots of places to pull over and take in the view, take lots of pictures, have a picnic, go hiking on a trail, or put your feet in a cold stream! No scary cliffs to avoid like going up pikes peak. It",
          "Nice hike with 1100 foot elevation change. Cross over running creek seven times during this two mile hike (1 way). Not real challenging but great views and small falls add to the beauty.",
          "After reading reviews we came here rather than Seven Falls and I'm so glad we did! The road into the park winds through and there was a lot to see! We went later in the afternoon so we were able to park right by the Helen Hunt Falls (fantastic) and hike up from there. The trail",
          "This is a great place to get out of your car and enjoy the great doors.. We hike many of the trails in the park. They all have great views. We also have a few special picnic areas. I know you find your own. Get out and explore.",
          "For the Colorado Springs area, this was one of the more enjoyable hikes for me. I would call it a low moderate hike (easy if I would lose 25 pounds like I need to). Not overly green and colorful, but the creek coming down from the higher elevation made it enjoyable. We did not",
          "Seniors visiting from UK. A beautiful drive up to the Helen Hunt Falls - others were hiking (I wasn't well that day and couldn't manage it) but we went for a little walk part way up the falls. Lovely wildlife and flowers. Don't miss it if you are in the area.",
          "My kids and I attempted to enter the park, but upon getting there, one of the streets was closed due to construction, with no detour signs posted. This was frustrating because I had checked online before heading out. After driving around a bit, we did find a parking lot and sign",

          "This is our go to spot for hiking! It is my absolute favorite. Many different trails for different skill levels. A drive down Gold Camp Road is the perfect way to end a day of hiking! Beautiful views and a couple of tunnels. The road is pretty scary though, so if you are scared",
          "If your a little out of shape like myself......take it slow. We got there late evening and a storm was brewing, but it was worth every step to reach the top.!",
          "This park has so much to offer. The views are great. Defiantly would go back and hike more of it if I had time. The water fall by the visitor center was beautiful.",
          "One minute you're on a city street. The next minute you're virtually alone as you wind around mountains and climb ever higher to great overlooks.",
          "Spent a couple hours here, short hike to waterfall well worth it with spectacular scenery. Took the dirt road back down which was much better than the one we came up on!",
          "First time visit and must have seen 50 hummingbirds during my 2 hour stay. Fun waterfall and great place for a walk in the woods. Recommend going during the week because crowded during the weekend.",
          "A beautiful and remote area with all the levels of hiking trail one could ask for along with rushing streams and water falls.",
          "Easily one of the most stunning sights in the area. If you're in town take an hour out of your day and check out the park. The area is beautiful and its a must see.",

          "Found this park while vising the area. - what a surprise! Although there was a large snowstorm the day before, the roads were clear and accessible. The waterfall was easy to get to and the trails were well marked. The views of the city on the drive down were spectacular.",
          "We love all of these trails. The kids enjoy 7 Bridges. In the summer, it is a wonderful hike because of the fresh air from the trees, the shaded forest, and the creek running through.",
          "We stopped at the Discovery Center on the way back from Helen Hunt Falls (which was beautiful!). Inside the discovery center is lots of interactive things for kids. Our daughter had the place to herself on a Saturday afternoon! Maybe nobody knows about this place or what's",

          "This park is so nice and there are different trails you can take. As a non local I was unaware of the car break ins at the popular hiking trails. If you have anything bulky or that looks valuable in your car leave it at the hotel/home or place it in your trunk before you get to",
          "Many hiking trails from beginner to expert. The scenery is beautiful. It's also a perfect place to have a picnic or a wedding. The Discovery center is fun for kids of all ages, lots to learn about the local wildlife.",

          "This is a great area to hike around. There are massive rock formations and even some boulders. I saw chalk on some, so some people must climb out here. It's a pretty easy drive even in a compact car. Definitely worth the trip.",
          "Everybody plans on completing the grueling \"Incline\" in Manitou Springs (C/S). Yes, the Incline is a must do, but plan on crowds. If you prefer sunrise without a crowd, take a nice stroll, jog or run around some of the many trails offered in this free and beautiful location.",
          "Absolutely stunning scenery with hikes, waterfalls and even a dirt road drive. So glad we came - views were amazing.",
          "Another place you think you are 100 miles away...but it is a City Park right outside the community. 10 minute drive and you are in the mountains along a nice stream. Lots of places to hike and picnic.",
          "There are beautiful trails here as far back into Colorado as you care to go. Have a care - watch your back trail to get back home. These are beautiful multi-use (cycle, dirt bike, hikers, runners) trails of several lengths. All are fun with great views, good surfaces.",
          "Great trails that parallel the creek. Watch out for the Middle Columbine trail though its a killer but well worth the energy to get up tot he top.",
          "One of the easier hikes for young and old. The view of Helen Hunt Falls at the base may be enough to make the easy drive but if you wander up the trail 30 - 40 minutes you will be glad you did.",
          "If you want to feel like you're in the mountains but don't want to go too far up or too far in, this is a great place. We went to see Helen Hunt Falls (a destination in its own right) and do some hiking, but were surprised at this ruggedly beautiful canyon just beyond the",
          "This park offers a variety of hiking opportunities that you are sure to love. My personal favorite was the Mt. Cutler trail. It's a gorgeous area with babbling brooks, cool rock formations and waterfalls, and more. I have not been to the Starsmore Discovery Center but hear",
          "If you want somewhere not packed with tourists during the summer this I the place to go. It has all the same beauty as popular places like Pikes Peak or Red Rocks or Garden of the Gods, but much more quiet. You can also get to some off road trails so make sure you have 4x4",
          "This park is FREE to visit. The hike along North Cheyenne Creek, behind Starsmore is easy and good for kids. They can put their feet into the water too. Picnic tables are scatted along the creekside trail. After the easy hike, drive up to Helen Hunt Falls and hike up the hill",
          "The park rangers were so friendly and the Helen Hunt Falls were spectacular! We really loved hiking to the top as a family! I wouldn't take small kids up to the top..we met a few coming and going..all crying! It is hard to reach the summit. The park rangers told us of other",
          "This park is very different from the Garden of the Gods as there are more trees and mountains here. Makes it cooler for sure during summer months. The Starsmore discovery center is nice as well so stop by to gather information and trail maps. We did two hikes here with our kids",
          "Beautiful hiking in an uncrowded setting. There are some wonderful views but there is also a lot of altitude change which is not for you if you are out of shape.",
          "We lucked on to this gem trying to head home after a disappointing trip to rampart reservoir. ( Love rampart, just received poor advice that the trails where stroller friendly) have a 4 year old boy and a 7 month old girl, that joined us on this hike. Our boy did not stuggle",
          "We came here to visit Helen Hunt Falls with our 8 year old which you can drive up to and park. It was pretty and then from there we just up the road at parked and walked to the Seven Bridges trail. You cross a creek seven times over the bridges. It was a fairly easy hike. The",
          "We stopped and got hiking advice at eh welcome center. It was time well-spent to focus our visit in a large and diverse park. We hiked a little over one mile to see the Seven Falls overlook, and we stopped at the Helen Hunt Falls. It took 2.5 hours, and it was an adequate",
          "Beautiful park! We could have stayed all day here and more. Impossible for even the worst photographer to take a bad picture. Disappointed that Seven Falls was closed however. Don't miss hiking the various trails in this park.",
          "Helen Hunt Falls is simply amazing. My daughter and I were on our way to Seven Bridges trail when we stopped here. She was thrilled to see rushing water in an area she considered too dry for such a fall. Beautiful!!",
          "Mt Cutler is highly recommended, as is Columbine trail. Free parking, can get hectic at times. Go up the road slow because there are hikers, bikers and tourists on the road. Be careful turning into some of the parking areas. Bring water and pay attention - people have died on",
          "Helen Hayes falls were very pretty. Walk to top was not too bad, but should have shoes with soles that grip. Steep walls along canyon so not the best place for casual hiking. Lots of climbers there.",
          "We tried to visit the park on a weekend and it was so crowded that we couldn't find parking so we went back during the week and had a great visit. The canyon is beautiful but my favorite was the hike to The Seven Bridges.",
          "I think part of going on vacation is to find free entertainment. Along with the Garden of the Gods, this fits the bill for great trails, long or short. Friendly staff at the visitor center.",
          "We hiked the Seven Bridges/Jones park trail, and it was a great hike. The bridges portion wound through a beautiful forest, crossing the stream seven times. Continuing up to Jones Park was a tougher trek, but resulted in some stellar views. It would be nice if there had been",
          "There are a number of trails in the park. The parking lots are relatively small, but that also help to limit the number of people that are on the trail with you. The views were well worth the hike up to the top and long the trails. Remember to bring water with you!",
          "During our early morning sunrise visit the park was nearly deserted. Its a beautiful park with a great mix of trail lengths and grades. The hike up to the waterfalls is short but especially good.",
          "We parked at the Starsmore Discovery Center and walked the Columbine trail (lower, middle, and upper) to Helen Hunt Falls, then turned around and came back (about 8 miles in total, I believe). It is simply beautiful, and the views are spectacular along the way. The trails appear",
          "Very interesting displays regarding history of the region and its people as well as information on flora and fauna. Be sure to drive up to waterfalls up the road.",
          "Interesting, a bit intimidating. Worth watching the introductory video and information in the visitor center. Nice chapel.",
          "We walked the short trail (1 mi. up and 1 mi. back) with our 4 pre/teenage kids. Took about an hour round trip - perfect for our \"non-hikers\". The views were absolutely amazing - overlooking the Broadmoor and 7 falls - beautiful! Definitely worth taking time to do. Trail",
          "Falls were beautiful even in the bad weather and threat of rain; hummingbirds everywhere; many hiking trails which we did not visit this time.",

          "Came to this beautiful park today and did the Mount Cutler trailhead. Most of the trail is a steady elevation up. Immediately you'll begin to see some spectacular views. At every turn the trail path was gorgeous. This Florida girl is not used to high terrain so some parts of",
          "After you finish at Helen Hunt Falls head down to a picnic area in the canon and get near the creek for a peaceful experience. From there head to Starsmore and view the gardens, try a hiking trail or visit the Discovery Center. Depending on your interest, there are lots of",
          "We came across this place by chance having had a frustrating day in Canon on Easter Sunday (nothing much was open there). Great place to visit for hiking and walking, cycling and running or just taking a BBQ and lazing around. Great views, nice drive up through the mountain",

          "Great place for seeing hummingbirds in the spring and just being with nature. My son's senior photos were taken here professionally and they are great. The area is well kept and the river close by is really nice. There's a bridge over the river, a building of stone - all really",
          "North Cheyenne Canon Park has the best set of easy to moderate hiking trails close to the Springs. Get a map at the Discovery Center at the base of the park. The Mt. Cutler trail is a short trail to the top of, well, Mt. Cutler. Great views along the way. You can see the Seven",

          "I took the main trail from the discovery center to the waterfall. This is well-maintained trail with good footing that goes up and down through canyon with several good lookouts. The first part of trail is easy and appropriate even for novice hikers, the main climb is over 1000",
          "We did various trails, including the Seven Bridges Trail which I found long but it was still enjoyable. We also got lost along the way so I would recommend getting a map of the trails. You get good views of the city and you can see some falls as well. From the Seven Bridges",
          "The Discovery Center closes early and we were not able to get in. The Seven Falls area has been closed due to damage and will not open until next year. However, Helen Hunt Falls was accessible and a nice quiet, serene spot. The drive up the pass to the falls is awesome. Make",

          "Our daughter took me and the wife there and I was not disappointed, the view's from different locations of the trail are breathtaking. The trail it self is a bit of a challenge but well worth it. A must see if in the area, Especially if you like water falls.",

          "I hiked with 10 adults and 6 kids from ages 2 to 14. The hike is not that difficult up the the seventh bridge. We did not climb higher due to time restraints. The scenery is amazing and I highly recommend the hike. However, do not park away from designated areas. My brothers",

          "We visited on the 4th of July (Park was packed) so besides the crowds it was a great experience! I imagine on a non holiday it's more serene. Crowds or no crowds this is a must stop if your in the area. There is no cost to enter the park or for Helen Hunt Falls. Stop by",

        "wiki": "Spencer Penrose (November 2, 1865 - December 7, 1939) was an American entrepreneur and philanthropist. He made his fortune from mining, ore processing, and real estate speculation in Colorado and other parts of the West. He founded the Utah Copper Company in 1903, and also established mining operations in Arizona, New Mexico and Nevada.\nHe settled with his fortune in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he and partner Charles L. Tutt had a road constructed to the top of Pikes Peak. They initiated an annual motor car race to the top. In 1918 Penrose opened an opulent resort hotel known as The Broadmoor, built outside the city which was a \"dry\" community. In 1937 he and his wife Julie established a foundation named El Pomar, to support activities to improve Colorado. In 2001, Penrose was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nSpencer \u201cSpec\u201d Penrose was born on November 2, 1865, as the fifth of seven sons of a prominent Philadelphia family. The family traces its paternal line to immigrant ancestor Bartholomew Penrose, who arrived in Philadelphia in 1698. Spencer's father, Richard Alexander Fullerton Penrose, was a doctor, who in 1854 founded the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.  Spencer's mother, Sarah Hannah (Boies) Penrose, promoted a simple life of austerity for her family. The first son died in infancy, leaving Boies Penrose, Charles Bingham, Richard Alexander Fullerton Jr., Spencer, Francis Boies, and Phillip Thomas. The Penrose men attended Harvard University, and Boies, Charles, and Richard graduated from there with high honors. Unlike them, Spencer graduated from Harvard at the bottom of his class, but his ambitions were to travel west and make his career on the frontier, rather than as a doctor, lawyer or politician like his brothers.\n\n\n== Western travels and enterprises ==\nAfter Harvard, Spencer Penrose migrated to Las Cruces, New Mexico. He established several businesses, selling each for enough to cut his losses and try his next venture. In 1892 his brother, Richard \u2013 by then a successful geologist \u2013 and Philadelphia friend, Charles L. Tutt wrote to him about a potential gold rush in Cripple Creek, Colorado. \nTutt had gone to Colorado Springs, Colorado in 1884, where he found initial success in real estate in the developing city. Tutt and Penrose had been childhood friends; both their fathers were doctors at the children's hospital. Tutt loaned Penrose the money to purchase a half stake in his Cripple Creek real estate business, which included the Cash on Delivery (C.O.D.) Mine. This was the beginning of a long-lasting partnership between the two men. The C.O.D. Mine was one of the most successful in Cripple Creek but, as Penrose and Tutt continued their partnership and operations, they began to realize the value of opening a new business in ore processing. \nTutt and Penrose sold the C.O.D. mine in 1895 for $250,000 and invested the money in their new venture: the Colorado-Philadelphia Reduction Company, an ore-processing facility in Old Colorado City. The two men knew they would need someone with expertise in ore processing, so they brought on tenured miner and miller, Charles Mather MacNeill. The new partnership among Tutt, Penrose, and MacNeill resulted in increased business at the Colorado-Philadelphia Reduction Company; by 1899 its plant was treating over $3 million worth of Cripple Creek ore annually. The three men would create a mining, milling, and real estate empire in the years that followed. \nAs their interests in Cripple Creek dwindled, Tutt, Penrose, and MacNeill followed a suggestion of metallurgist Daniel C. Jackling, who believed that a massive copper deposit located in Bingham Canyon, Utah could be successfully mined. Jackling had been a metallurgist for the Bingham Canyon Gold & Silver Mine, and was the chief engineer at the US Reduction Plant Company in Florence, Colorado. A survey revealed the Bingham Canyon ore deposit contained only 2% copper. After consulting both Jackling and geologist Richard Penrose, Spencer's brother, the men determined that the copper could yield high profits if they could efficiently extract the copper from the ore. \nPenrose formed the Utah Copper Company in 1903. He worked with others to design a mill to extract the copper at a rate generally considered impossible by other mining and milling experts. Their gamble paid off, and the men developed a fast-growing enterprise that mined and milled more copper than they had imagined was possible. Penrose's success in Utah encouraged him to invest and begin copper mining operations across the Southwest in Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada. The works in Cripple Creek and Utah Copper generated an immense fortune for Penrose, which he brought with him to Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n\n\n== Colorado Springs and The Broadmoor ==\nPenrose returned to Colorado Springs as a successful entrepreneur. During this time, he met his future wife, widow Julie Villiers (Lewis) McMillan. Spencer and Julie met and became friends through overlapping social circles in the city. Although Penrose had formerly pledged to stay a bachelor, he changed his mind. The two married in London, England, on April 28, 1906, and traveled in Europe for their honeymoon. Inspired by his stays in grand European hotels and resorts, Penrose returned to Colorado Springs intending to build his own hotel. \nA few years later, the Penroses bought the residence of their close friend, Grace Goodyear Potter, who had the Spanish-style villa constructed in 1910. The house was built on the site of the Dixon Apple Orchard, for which where the estate was named \u201cEl Pomar\u201d (colloquial Spanish for \u201cthe orchard\u201d). The Penroses renovated the house, adding two stories, corona marble tiles, carved wood panels, and crystal chandeliers. They hired the Olmsted Brothers to design the surrounding grounds.Later the house changed ownership. Known as the Penrose House, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Now it is owned and operated as a conference and meeting space. It is available at no charge to Colorado's nonprofit organizations.Together with his longtime partner Charles Tutt, Penrose completed a plan to build a road to the 14,115-foot summit of Pikes Peak, to promote tourism in the area. At a cost of $283,000, the highway was completed on August 1, 1916.  The same year, Penrose organized the first motor race to the summit; established annually, it is the second-oldest motor car race in the US. It still runs in the early 21st century, and is known as the Broadmoor Pikes Peak International Hill Climb.\nPenrose began work on his project, The Broadmoor Hotel. He reportedly wanted to buy the Antlers Hotel from Colorado Springs founder William Jackson Palmer, who had it rebuilt in 1901 after a fire, but Palmer wouldn't sell. Palmer had established Colorado Springs as a \"dry city\", and Penrose had different ideas for what would be offered at his hotel.In 1916 Penrose purchased a site outside the boundaries of the city for $90,000, from Prussian Count James Pourtales. Penrose commissioned architects to design the hotel of his dreams. After reviewing several designs, Penrose selected the design of the firm Warren and Wetmore, known for their work in New York City, including Grand Central Terminal. The contractors broke ground in April 1917 and a grand opening was held at the hotel on June 29, 1918. Its cost exceeded $3 million. The Broadmoor attracted numerous visitors. Targeting Midwesterners, Penrose placed advertisements in notable publications and invited celebrities to pose for photos and provide testimonials to the opulence of the Broadmoor. The accompanying golf course also attracted wealthy visitors from across the country.\n\n\n== Philanthropy and legacy ==\nSpencer and Julie Penrose acted as philanthropists, giving strong financial support to major civic projects in Colorado Springs.  Their legacy projects include the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun, Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center, Pikes Peak Highway, and the Glockner-Penrose Hospital (now Penrose-St. Francis Health Services). \nThey founded El Pomar Foundation on December 17, 1937. With a mission \u201cto enhance, encourage, and promote the future and current well-being of the people of Colorado,\u201d El Pomar Foundation continues as a grantmaking organization. From an initial combined gift of $21 million, the assets of the Foundation now exceed $600 million. Its grants have yielded more than $1.2 billion in results for the state of Colorado. El Pomar also operates community stewardship programs, including: Awards for Excellence, Regional Partnerships, and a two-year Fellowship for young leaders.The Foundation also operates two properties of the Penrose family: The Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun, where the Penroses are entombed; and the Penrose Heritage Museum, which showcases the Penrose's collection of carriages, as well as artifacts from their travels. Penrose died in 1939, two years after founding El Pomar Foundation. He was survived by Julie, who served as President of the Foundation until her death in 1956.\nIn 2001, Penrose was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\"El Pomar\".

          "I take my vacation the last two weeks of each year to enjoy Halloween and the haunted attractions in Denver. Each attraction has it's own flavor if you will. I really enjoy the Haunted Mines because it has an old vintage feel. When you pull up, there are festive orange lights",
          "Truly enjoyed seeing all the vintage cars, trucks, and trackers. The only problem was that I am temporarily in a wheelchair and there was no pathway of any sort for my wheelchair to traverse. We ended up leaving earlier than we wanted to because it just got too difficult trying",
          "This is a wonderful museum of the history of mining in the area, but it is a bit quirky to find the entrance! The docents are friendly and very helpful; they have a guided tour, especially nice for children, with hands-on activities like panning for gold. When possible, they",

          "I am a 4th grade teacher and we study Colorado History. This was great field trip for that. It was active and informational. Our guide had a sense of humor and the students really had a great time. BONUS, the Haunted Mines also go on at this time, and my son and his friends",
          "over priced for boring, out of the way, and at 50 letters im done why is there a minimum, if you have nothing else to do.",
          "The tour of the Mining Museum is great and you will learn a lot about the history of mining. A walk through a reconstructed mine is informative. The kids will like it.",
          "This is a museum of mining. Upon our entering we were charged $7 per person for the tour, which we thought was a guided tour. Little did we know we were put with a group of fourth graders on a filed trip. Horror from the start! Not worth the time so we decided to leave shortly",
          "This museum was a last minute decision. We literally almost missed it because although it is well marked, you feel like you are entering someones private drive. Once we got there and got past the snarky employee who drove the red VW, we learned a LOT about mining. A woman",
          "The tour was very informative. The machines actually worked and the tour guide did a great job at explaining everything. Well worth stop!!",
          "We took our granddaughters for the tour. They loved the panning for gold/other stones in the museum. The docent was good and kept the kids busy with questions. We were also able to feed the donkeys at the outside pens which was a hit. Not recommended for the toddler age",
          "This museum is a gem. It only takes about 1 1-2 hours to tour and read everything, but what it has is very informative. A good place to take out of town visitors, including children above age 6.",
          "The mining museum is a pretty good museum just off I-25 near Colorado Springs. The tour is a bit long, but covers quite a lot of information. The museum isn't particularly large, and there is no active mine here, so if you are looking for more history you'll want to go into",
          "My sister and I went in expecting a tour. we paid the fee and they sent us in we had no one to ask questions to. We walked through and had to try to decipher all the exhibits on our own, while the staff sat in the front room talking about the wedding that was taking place",
          "Take the tour. There is one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The attendant will turn on all the old equipment and show you how they work. I have never been to a museum where the machines still run. Fascinating!",

          "This museum is interesting not only for people who like mining history, but also for people who are into machines in general. My husband and adult son (who like machines) really enjoyed the museum. I found it interesting too, just not as much as they did. We tagged along part",
          "This is a small museum but if you plan to arrive in time to take a guided tour you will enjoy it and learn a lot.. My grandsons ages 8 and 12 liked the movie, panning for gold and seeing the mining equipment demonstrations. Worth it if you are in the area.",
          "If you get with the tour you can see all the big and loud machines they used back in the day start up. Not that big but it was good if you want to kill a hr or so. If Mining is interesting to you, you should check it out!",
          "If you are interested in the history or technology of mining, or if you just like to look at beastly machines, this museum is worth a couple hours of your time.",
          "The museum is in an unimpressive building,but the people who work there love what they do. Out tour guide died a great job including the children in the tour. hands on and demonstrations of the big machines. Kids panned for gold",
          "My sister, my nephew, my niece and I planned a field trip to the museum because she'd discovered it while doing some research before traveling to visit me in Colorado Springs. We had the best time ! It was our favorite field trip. We took the tour, which started with a short",
          "Seems like an unusual place to tuck away a mining museum, but the WMMI is a great place to take kids who want to see large machinery running (make sure you have them fire up the equipment in the main building), pan for some gold, and have fun in the mine tunnel reenactment. This",

          "This has been just down the highway from my mother-in-law's house and we passed by it for 20+ years. On a recent family visit, we decided to stop in to see what it was all about. Be sure to take the guided tour so you can better understand what you see. The working equipment",
          "This little museum is a gem. It is especially sized for kids to understand the mining history of Colorado, with hands on exhibits and machinery. The museum often hosts special exhibits of rocks, minerals or meteorites and, for the geology buff, has an amazing library. The",
          "Haunted Mines, presented on behalf of the Mining Museum each Fall, is, by far, the best for Halloween fright in Colorado. Each year has a different theme, 2013 - Demons, and each year it is better. Not for the faint of heart or young children. This is the primary fundraiser",
          "This is a great place to spend half a day. They have great mining exhibits, including old machinery. We enjoyed taking time to read and study old photos after the tour and learned quite a lot about mining. Very important to the history of the Pikes Peak area. Interesting",
          "We attended WMMI's Steampunk Symposium and just enjoyed the bejeebers out of it! Brad, the marketing director and his merry troupe of adventurers made the day so much fun! Even without the special events, this charming find is worth five stars--maybe six if you get the right",
          "Very interesting and fun exhibits both inside and outside. Great for kids. Gives everyone a feel for the mining history of Colorado.",
          "What was it like to be a pioneer? Or seeking to make your fortune in them thar hills? Be sure to join one of the tours, our guide was super!",
          "We were glad we found this place. Great exhibits and very educational. Tour guide was great as was the rest of the staff. We were lucky to go for the outside machinery days when the steam shovel and grammar were started up. Allow plenty of time to see all exhibits and read",
          "This is such an interesting place. The staff is very informative and welcoming, and the museum itself is very educational. Try to visit when they are putting on events as these are often very neat for all ages. I was there during a Halloween program that included scary stories",
          "The tour guide is fabulous and so is the tour!!! My 10 year old son and I enjoyed this museum! I am a school principal and I am planning on recommending it to my teachers as am option for a school field trip",
          "I had been wanting to come here for quite a few years after my son visited during a homeschool field trip. I had relatives come into town and my cousin wanted to visit also so we made a day of it. Currently they offer two guided tours a day 10AM and 1PM. We arrived at 11 so",
          "We just happened to go during a once a year festival called the Pikes Peak Gem & Mineral Show. They ran a few of the mining machines they normally don't show. It was really informative and interesting. We took the tour which you get to see any time they were open and our guide",
          "Great quick stop for calm kids and adults. Easy to get around donkeys are nice. Parking is good easy to find off the interstate highway",
          "When you first pull in you think is this worth it. When you leave you say it was worth it. Lots of interactive exhibits and old equipment that still works. We took the self guided tour but they do offer guided tours. Great place for kids!",
          "This place rocks. Literally. They have many specimens of rocks, as well as samples of the products in which we are most likely to encounter them. They have working mining machinery and tours that explain what's what. I've been several times and will undoubtedly go back.",
          "Be sure to take the guided tour, it add so much to the trip. They turn on the machines for you and give you insights you wouldn't otherwise have. It's the best part of the tour... that and the burros.",
          "Our family thoroughly enjoyed this museum,it might be the first museum we've been to where everything is still in working order,everyone enjoyed the mine inside.",
          "Not only is this an interesting and informative tourist attraction near the Air Force Academy, it's a GREAT place for kids!",
          "We recently visited the Western museum of Mining and Industry in Colorado Springs. The experience was highly informative and interesting. We saw on their website they have guided tours at 11 am and 1 pm each day, so we made sure we showed up in time for one of those. We",
          "Lived near this place for many years until I received a tour of this museum, I was impressed with the interesting things I learned. Don't be intimidated with the small atmosphere, its much bigger then it looks",
          "This museum is a must see if you are in the area! Great hands on exhibits, staff and grounds. Check their website because through out the year they have different events on the weekends and during the week. Don'r forget to check out the burros outside also! I can't wait to go",
          "The displays and tour are outstanding. This is a must see if you are in the area. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but it is a really interesting place. They have many hands-on items for those who need to touch. They have many functioning items they will demonstrate.",
          "We were fortunate to have gotten to this museum just as a tour was starting. Very educational & entertaining. Would recommend anyone going here to be in time for the tour.",
          "Great perspective on mining history in the area...folks there do a great job of filling in gaps and taking care of the people who tour. VERY interesting and worth the trip a little way north..hit this along with the USAFA",
          "It didn't look like much from the outside, but this place was amazing. There was a very thought-provoking video at the beginning of the tour. Our tour guide, Alex, was knowledgable, enthusiastic and engaging. Our kids (ages four and six) were never bored! We all loved panning",
          "This is a museum not a real mining operations. Lots of equipment used in the minining industry are on display and actually work. The tour guide(Audrey) was very knowledgeable and explained all phases of mining and actually started several of the large pieces of heavy",
          "Fun museum with nice grounds to walk. A little bit of everything. Nice hands-on items for the kids (and adults).",
          "It's a great museum, but it's a small one. There's a lot of hands on activities. There also a field outside for the kids to run around in. Also it's close to the Air Force Academy so would recommend a stop there as well.",
          "This museum is a \"working\" museum in that the old steam engines work - and the guides run them. Some are noisy, all are old and it is just cool to see them still in operation. There are great displays and interactive exhibits. There is a section that is made to feel like you",
          "Every aspect about the history of mining is included in the exhibits and displays. There are a lot of displays that children will enjoy. There are also tours that are very informative and interesting.",
          "learned a lot and it looked like the kids were having fun",

          "I wasn't sure what to expect when my dad wanted to visit this place, but it turned out to be pretty cool. The mining artifacts are kind of redundant around the place, but the steam engine displays and demonstrations are excellent. It is amazing how they used these engines to",
          "A small museum with working equipment and knowledgeable guides. The short film presentation is well done. The exhibits are well selected and tell a story. A taste, without being overwhelming, of what it is like in a mine, likewise tells a story. Check their schedule for",
          "We've passed this museum on the interstate several times and decided last week to stop and see what they have to offer. It's well worth the stop. I think it was 8 bucks an adult, but worth it if you enjoy seeing machinery of the mining and hearing from a lady very much",
          "This place is a real showroom of history. I learned a great deal that I had never seen before. The museum had antique steam equipment functioning on air and it worked just great. Really worth going to see.",
          "We visit WMMI several times a year and are never disappointed. Docents are knowlegeable and friendly. Lots of activities both indoors and out. I have arranged school and Scout tours and have always been pleased with how the tours are tailored to our needs. Don't miss the",
          "If you are driving on I-25 and need a break pull off where the sign for the Museum indicates. If you have children all the better. You will be able to play with mining equipment, pan for gold, and see some amazing videos. Just try and imagine how many of these working mining",
          "A great museum of mining artifacts and big machines... some not related to mining but great to see. Several working models and a nice walk-through replica of a hard-rock mine.",
          "The staff is very friendly and noise is welcome. Our seven month old started laughing when they turned on the huge engines and liked pressing the buttons for the working scale models. Fun interactive displays and facts everywhere. There are lots of spaced out things to see",
          "Entertaining and hands on stuff for the kids. Very nice staff. This is a hidden gem in Colorado Springs area. Thanks!",
          "Interesting and educational. If you happen by this hidden gem its worth a stop. Average experience for the kids but fun for the family.",
          "Lots of old mining equipment. Sometimes they even get the old steam engine running.",
          "I absolutely loved this museum, but not everyone will. On our tour, the husbands were enthralled, the wives bored. I went on a guided tour with a wonderful young woman as our guide who has an immense knowledge of geology, mining and mining equipment. She demonstrated a great",
          "We took our 8 year old because of the 1920's steam shovel which operates in June and July. The tour guide was very knowledgable and really kept the tour interesting. The tour lasted over 2 and 1/2 hours which was about 1 hour too long but if you are interested in mining and",
          "The tour was short but sweet. You were able to see many old machines operate as well as many large machines that were kept outside. You can also pan for gold after the tour is over. Not the most exciting tour but it was worth the money.",
          "My daughter was learning about the gold rush and mining at the time we were in Colorado Springs for spring break. I found this on a quick internet search. Our tour guide was fabulous. She was great with the kids. She showed how to patiently pan for gold while explaining the",
          "Despite having a background in geology, I didn't think I would find this museum particularly interesting. But, as a brand new resident of Colorado Springs (COS), I'm exploring everything. The museum is directly off of I-25 to the north of COS. It doesn't look that",
          "I live in the area & have driven past this museum countless times. I didn't think it would be worth going in, but I was wrong. My family & I decided to check it out when my sister was in town visiting. They were having \"Burro Days.\" They have 2 super cute Burros - Oro and Nugget",
          "We found this museum very interesting & enjoyable. The tour was very informative- teaching us how to gold pan, visiting the mining drift. There were a number of hands-on exhibits, and our tour guide was very knowledgeable about the history of mining. In the foyer of the Museum-",

        "wiki": "Rock Ledge Ranch Historic Site is a living history museum (sometimes called an open-air museum) and farm located in Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States. Restored buildings and period-appropriate attired museum guides depict life in the Pikes Peak region in four time periods and in four different households: American Indian life in 1775; an 1860s cabin (Galloway Homestead); an 1880s farm (Chambers Home and Ranch); and a 1907 Edwardian Country Estate. Each residence (teepee, log cabin, farm house, mansion) reflects the construction and contents of homes of those periods.  It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== Museum ==\nMuseum guides, each wearing clothing specific to the time period and type of residence, explain and demonstrate activities of daily life of those who lived in the region.  Visitors see and participate to learn how people from different time periods lived during the eras: clothing, meal prep and cooking, cleaning, laundry, mowing, games and entertainment, and how they made their living.Template:Citation directly from Rock Ledge Ranch Historic Site\nThere is a working 19th Century blacksmith shop, barn, horses, and chickens. Sheep and a cow graze around the farm. At one time, peacocks were resident. The historical interpreters demonstrate daily living skills, and encourage visitors to participate. The museum hosts over 100,000 people on an annual basis. Template:Citation directly from Rock Ledge Ranch Historic Site\nBecause of the City of Colorado Spring's economic difficulties in 2009, its funding and continued existence was threatened  however an aggressive fundraising campaign has generated huge public support as well as additional opportunities to experience this setting due to themed special events such as Fiddles, Vittles, and Vino and a Shakespeare festival.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

We got there late, but the actors (many of whom were children) who work there took time to make cornhusk dolls with my kids and to show us so many different aspects of the olden days.  My son even got to play the organ in one of the houses.  I wish we could have spent more time there.",

I do try to avoid any event open free to the public due to the amount of people.\nThe buildings are fun to explore. Each house is fully furnished as it would have been back in the day.\nGreat people full of all sorts of information.",

          "It was really cool seeing GoG and Pikes Peak from a new angle. It's a privilege getting to see these iconic landscapes everyday, and the stunning views from this vantage point renewed my appreciation to them. \n\nIt was secluded and quiet. \u2026",

          "When there are events there needs to be someone directing traffic or more than one exit to avoid the people walking.",

          "Recommend going there during the day. It's really dark at night. If you like looking at old homes-1800's, you'll like it. Crafts for the kids.",

          "Rock Ledge is one of the best kept secrets. It's not grandiose like some of our other attractions, but is so peaceful and serene. It's my favorite place to go with small kids. They love the space to run and the animals. I live in fear of it being loved to death!",

      "name": "Cheyenne Mountain State Park",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Cheyenne Mountain is a triple-peaked mountain in El Paso County, Colorado, southwest of downtown Colorado Springs. The mountain serves as a host for military, communications, recreational, and residential functions. The underground operations center for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) was built during the Cold War to monitor North American airspace for missile launches and Soviet military aircraft. Built deep within granite, it was designed to withstand the impact and fallout from a nuclear bomb. Its function broadened with the end of the Cold War, and then many of its functions were transferred to Peterson Air Force Base in 2006.\nHomesteading on the mountain began in 1867 and the mountain was the site of resorts and retreats beginning in the 1880s. Spencer Penrose, who built The Broadmoor in 1918, bought many of the properties on the mountain and built the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, Cheyenne Mountain Highway, Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun, a lodge on one of the mountain peaks, and a retreat at Emerald Valley. The site of the lodge has become a wilderness Cloud Camp and Emerald Valley is now the site of The Broadmoor's Ranch at Emerald Valley. Land on Cheyenne Mountain that had once been owned by The Broadmoor is now the site of luxury homes. A community, Overlook Colony, that began in 1911 still resides on the mountain.\nThe two parks on and at the base of Cheyenne Mountain are Cheyenne Mountain State Park and North Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on Park. A noticeable feature on the top of one of Cheyenne Mountain's peaks is an antenna farm with transmitters for cellular phone, radio, television, and law enforcement transmitters.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nCheyenne Mountain has three peaks. The southern peak is Cheyenne Mountain's summit at 9,200 feet (2,800 m) in elevation. It was formerly called Mount Albrecht. The antenna farm sits on the middle peak. The northern peak, The Horns, may look to some like the head of a dragon or horns. The peak is 9,200 feet (2,800 m) in elevation.The mountain's boundaries are Rock Creek, which flows from Mount Big Chief through Cheyenne Mountain to the town of Fountain, to the south and Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on to the north. The western side of Cheyenne Mountain is in Pike National Forest, within the Pikes Peak Ranger District. Colorado Springs' skyline features Cheyenne Mountain and Pikes Peak. Other mountain peaks are Mount Arthur, Mount Baldy, Mount Rosa, Cameron's Cone, and Mount Garfield.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nCheyenne Mountain was named for the Cheyenne people. Native Americans found that Cheyenne Mountain was a good source of wood for teepee poles. It was visited by Cheyenne and Arapaho people, who may have sought spiritual inspiration from the mountain's waterfalls. Cheyenne Mountain was used by Ute Native Americans to cross from the plains and benefit from the \"steep slopes and hidden valleys\" to safely travel from enemy tribes that had their horses stolen by the Utes.\n\n\n=== Late 19th century ===\nWilliam Dixon, a rancher, claimed a homestead in the Cheyenne Mountain foothills in 1867. He built a tavern along a trail up Cheyenne Mountain and turned the trail into a toll road, now called Old Stage Road, to Cripple Creek. The road begins as a paved road and is then a dirt road through Pike National Forest. His homestead ultimately became part of The Broadmoor resort.\nThe Cheyenne Mining District was located on Cheyenne Mountain. The Little Suzie gold mine was built by a group of prospectors in the 1870s. Silver and minerals were mined on Cheyenne Mountain in 1883. Towns or resorts built on Cheyenne Mountain included the original Bruin Inn (1884), Watsonville (town named in 1884) and Wade City, also called Wade's Resort, (1885). The first mining claims granted for El Paso County were for the Manganese and Rio Grande lodes on Cheyenne Mountain by January 31, 1885.\n\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\nThe Colorado Springs and Cripple Creek District Railway (Short Line) traversed Cheyenne Mountain\nduring the trip between Cripple Creek and Colorado Springs by 1905. It transported coal, mined ore, and passengers. Also at that time, a carriage road went to Seven Lakes and the summit of Pikes Peak from Cheyenne Mountain.Grace Lutheran Church built a retreat in Emerald Valley in 1904. It is now The Broadmoor's Ranch at Emerald Valley. In 1905, Dr. August McKay homesteaded on 120 acres on the east slope of Cheyenne Mountain. He developed a series of trails and rest houses that led to The Sunshine Inn that he built as a health resort above Old Stage Road. The property was purchased by Spencer Penrose, who had the inn torn down.The Overlook Colony was started in 1911 by a group of Colorado College professors. It first started as a summer retreat for the educators, and grew to include musicians, doctors, artists, generals, oilmen, and an ambassador to India. The Cheyenne Mountain Zoo was built just below and the Will Rogers Shrine built just above this community. Residents manage the Overlook Colony Mutual Water Company that governs water conservation, maintenance, and testing of the water supply from deep within the former Little Susie gold mine.Bert Swisher and Thomas Dixon homesteaded on Cheyenne Mountain in 1917. Dixon resided with his family in a cabin near the top of the mountain in the middle of three valleys. Swisher's cabin was near the present site of the antenna farm at the top of the mountain, which was accessed by Old Stage Road.\n\n\n=== Spencer Penrose and The Broadmoor ===\nCheyenne Mountain became a successful recreational and resort area when Spencer Penrose developed The Broadmoor resort in 1918. The Cheyenne Mountain Cog Railroad provided narrow gauge cog railway service to South Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on from the Broadmoor Casino beginning in 1918. It later offered service from The Broadmoor to the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. Service ended in 1974.In the 1920s, Penrose began to develop on Cheyenne Mountain property on the northern peak that he bought in 1915. He built the Cheyenne Mountain Highway in 1925. In 1926, the Cheyenne Mountain Lodge opened at the top of Cheyenne Mountain. It had a restaurant, a suite for Penrose on the third floor, four guest rooms, and living quarters for servants. Visitors could make the trip up the Cheyenne Mountain Highway on the backs of elephants. The lodge closed in 1961. It was razed in 1976 following years of destruction by vandals. It is now the site of The Broadmoor's Cloud Camp lodge and cabins.\n\nPenrose developed the country's highest zoo at 6,800 feet (2,100 m) in elevation, the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo (1926) on the mountain and Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun (1937) on the northern promontory of the mountain. The Cheyenne Mountain Highway was built for transport to the zoo, shrine, and top of the mountain. The Broadmoor built a ski area on Cheyenne Mountain in 1959. In 1986, the resort closed Ski Broadmoor, but the city of Colorado Springs and Ski Vail stepped in to keep it open. It closed in 1991. The land was sold to the Broadmoor Resort Community Association. Land that had once been owned by The Broadmoor on the mountain was sold and is now the site of luxury homes.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== NORAD operations center ==\n\nIn the 1950s, during the Cold War, the interior of the mountain became a site for the operations center for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). The center, deep within Cheyenne Mountain, was completed in 1966 after spending $142 million and using 500 tons of explosives. The result was an underground city operated by the Air Force. Popular Science wrote in 1965, before the dedication of the facility, that Cheyenne Mountain is the only mountain known to have buildings constructed on the inside of a mountain. It was built to withstand being bombed: eleven multiple-story buildings stand on coil springs to absorb the shock of a blast and it was designed so that up to 800 people could survive fall-out of a nuclear bomb. The buildings are encased in steel, surrounded by granite, and the facility is behind blast-proof doors. It was designed to be the \"nerve center\" for NORAD.The NORAD center has been staffed by Canadian and United States military personnel to monitor North American air space for intercontinental ballistic missiles and incoming Soviet military aircraft. Locally, this military boom during the Cold War included the establishment of the United States Air Force Academy, Peterson Air Force Base, and Fort Carson. After the Cold War, NORAD monitored objects orbiting the earth and aircraft without flight plans. It is also known for monitoring the Christmas Eve orbit of Santa Claus.NORAD used to offer public tours, but due to security concerns they were suspended in 1999. The off-ramp on NORAD road has been staffed by Air Force Security Police since September 11, 2001. Most of the center's operations were moved to Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs in 2006, then in April 2015, the Pentagon reported that a few operations would be moving back in.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Antenna farm ==\nDuring the 1950s, an antenna farm was built on the middle peak of the mountain when Bert Swisher deeded ten acres to Bud Edmonds and several backers and Swisher signed a non-compete agreement. Edmonds, John Browne, and Buck Ingersoll agreed to replace the trails to the area with a real road, which was opened in 1960 by the Cheyenne Propagation Company. There are 700 cell phone, television, radio, and law enforcement transmitters on the antenna farm. The Cheyenne Mountain radio site 145.160 repeater covers south central and southeast Colorado along the Interstate 25 corridor from Monument nearly to the New Mexico border. In 2002, it was operated by the Cheyenne Propagation Company.\n\n\n== Parks and recreation ==\n\n\n=== Cheyenne Mountain State Park ===\nThe City of Colorado Springs and Colorado State Parks purchased 1,680 acres of land to preserve the \"southeastern flank\" of the mountain and its wildlife habitat in 2000. The land, originally the JL Ranch, was slated for development of 2,500 houses. The land was purchased to create the Cheyenne Mountain State Park, which is the only state park in El Paso County. An additional 1,021 acres at the top and east side of Cheyenne Mountain were acquired from 2007 to 2009. The park is now a total of 2,701 acres, part of which is at the base of the mountain and part of which is on Cheyenne Mountain. It has 20 miles of trails.\n\n\n=== Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on ===\nThe 1,600 acre North Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on Park, Starsmore Discovery Center, Seven Falls, and some of Colorado Spring's \"most exclusive neighborhoods\" are located in Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on.  The source of North Cheyenne Creek is in Teller County. South Cheyenne Creek's source, also in Teller County, is Mount Big Chief, near St. Peter's Dome. The flows through Seven Falls in South Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on.North Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on Park was started when the city of Colorado Springs bought 640 acres in North Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on from Colorado College in 1885. An additional 480 acres was donated by General William Jackson Palmer. That land included High Drive, Silver Cascade Falls, and Helen Hunt Falls.  In 1909 the Park Commission called it \"by far the grandest and most popular of all the beautiful ca\u00f1ons near the city\" for its evergreen trees, waterfalls, Cheyenne Creek, and rock formations. Moderate hikes in the canon include Mount Cutler and Columbine trails.The two creeks meet and form Cheyenne Creek near the intersection of North Cheyenne Canyon Road, South Cheyenne Canyon Road, and Cheyenne Boulevard.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Historic trails ===\nTwo historic trails, only shown on the Pikes Peak Atlas, lead to the summit top of Cheyenne Mountain: the unofficial and faintly visible Swisher and the McNeil trails. At the top of the Swisher trail is a meadow and ruins of an old cabin.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nHelen Hunt Jackson's poem, Cheyenne Mountain was published by 1893.\nIn Robert Heinlein's 1966 The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, a lunar colony's revolt against rule from Earth included the complete destruction of Cheyenne Mountain by rocks catapulted from the moon.\nA fictionalized Cheyenne Mountain NORAD base was the setting for the 1983 movie WarGames.\nCheyenne Mountain is the base of the fictional SGC (Stargate Command) and the location of the stargate in the military science fiction show Stargate SG-1.\nThe Mountain was featured in the 2016 film, Independence Day: Resurgence.\nIt is an early command center for the human resistance in L. Ron Hubbard's \"Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000\" (1982, ISBN 1-59212-007-5).\nThe Mountain is a possible choice for the location of XCOM HQ in XCOM Long War, which offers the benefit of already being partially developed.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCheyenne Mountain Country Club, in the Broadmoor neighborhood\nCheyenne Mountain School District 12, which includes Cheyenne Mountain Middle School and Cheyenne Mountain Elementary School\nCheyenne Mountain Charter Academy\nCheyenne Mountain High School\nList of Colorado mountain ranges\nList of Colorado mountain summits\nList of Colorado county high points\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAlbertype Co.

        "wiki": "Palmer Park is a regional park in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Located at 3650 Maizeland Road, the park is several miles northeast of the downtown area. Elevation Outdoors Magazine named it Best Urban Park in its Best of Rockies 2017 list. One of Best of the Springs Expert Picks - Sports & Recreation by The Gazette, Seth Boster states that it may have the city's best views of Pikes Peak and a place \"where an escape into deep nature is easy. It is strange and marvelous to look out at urban sprawl while perched on some high rock ledge, surrounded by rugged wilderness.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area that is now Palmer Park was once owned by Matt France, the earliest recorded owner. In 1873, France sold his property to Henry Austin who used this property to raise sheep. The general area became known as Austin Bluffs.In 1902, William Jackson Palmer the founder of Colorado Springs, donated the 692 acres to Colorado Springs for the park. It was one of many parks established due to land donations by Palmer. As reported in The New York Times in 1907, Palmer also provided the land for Monument Valley Park, North Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on Park, and Dorchester Park. Palmer donated the land for three formal parks in downtown Colorado Springs, including Alamo Square, Acacia Park, and Antlers Park. He improved the roads to the park, Paseo Drive and Palmer Park Boulevard.The area is now a Colorado Springs Regional Park, and the largest park inside of the metro area.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe park has a variety of geologic formations, including tall rock spires or hoodoos and steep cliffs, as well as open fields. Scenic overlooks include views of Pikes Peak. Within the park is a geological point of interest, Seven Castles, and a botanical reserve for yucca plants. Paseo Drive runs through the park to the horse stables.\n\nAt 730.7 acres in size, the park contains over 25 miles of trails for horseback riding, mountain biking, and hiking. On the mesa overlooking the city, are interconnected trails are generally single track, but there are also doubletrack trails and dirt road trails. The terrain is rocky and hard-packed dirt. One of the trails is the Edna Mae Bennet Nature trail, a 2.6 miles (4.2 km) trail in the rocky bluffs of the park with views of ravines, canyons, and rock formations. Other noted trails are Templeton Trail and Yucca Flats. There is a dog run, like Bear Creek Dog Park.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun, also known as Will Rogers Shrine, is a commemorative tower and chapel on Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado Springs, Colorado. It is named after Will Rogers, the American humorist, who died in a plane crash in Alaska in 1935 during construction of the shrine. It is also a tomb for the remains of Spencer Penrose \u2013 who built many of the city's prominent properties, including the neighboring Cheyenne Mountain Zoo and The Broadmoor resort \u2013 and his wife Julie.  Completed by Penrose in 1937, the shrine is a 100 feet (30 m), five story observation tower that overlooks The Broadmoor, Colorado Springs, and Garden of the Gods.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994 for its artistic and architectural qualities.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun is located at 8,136 feet (2,480 m) in elevation. It is about 1,500 feet (460 m) in elevation above Colorado Springs, and is also above the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo on the side of Cheyenne Mountain. Views of the  Rampart Range, Colorado Springs, and the plains can be seen from the site on a promontory on the mountain, which is accessed via the Cheyenne Mountain Highway. The road to the shrine is restricted at the toll gate to individuals who have purchased Cheyenne Mountain Zoo tickets.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\nThe five-story commemorative monument and an adjoining one-story building with the chapel was designed by local architect, Charles E. Thomas, who was hired by Julie and Spencer Penrose, the philanthropist and developer who built The Broadmoor resort and Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. The monument is made of Romanesque Revival architecture with buttresses, an ornately decorated iron and brass door, and narrow leaded windows. It is 100 feet (30 m) tall. The shrine is partly named for the views of the rising and setting sun. Will Rogers, who died in 1935 in an airplane crash, is memorialized in images of his life displayed throughout the interior of the monument and in the name of the shrine. The shrine is also a memorial to the lives of Julie and Spencer Penrose, whose tombs are in the monuments lower level. The Pikes Peak Region's history is depicted in a 340 square feet (32 m2) mural by Randall Davey, an artist from Santa Fe, New Mexico.The Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun site is entered through a stone gateway. The grounds are encircled by a stone wall made from the same single block of pink granite quarried from Cheyenne Mountain used to make the tower. Within the stone walls, there are Jo Davidson's statue of Will Rogers, Chinese sculptures, and landscaping with plants native to the region. Avard Fairbanks made a bronze bust of Spencer Penrose.The building is constructed of granite, steel, cement, iron and brass. Its roof was built of ceramic tile. There were no wood or nails in its construction. The interior has terrazzo floors, marble, and ironwork. Stairs lead to the upper floors.It was completed in 1937 and dedicated on September 6, 1937. The total construction cost was about $250,000 (equivalent to $4,446,181 in 2019).\n\n\n=== Monument ===\nThe sections of the monument are a one-story building with the chapel, the five-story tower, and a staircase connecting the two. Randall Davey painted murals on the first floor of the monument and the first two levels of the stairway depicting the area's historical people and events. The murals, restored in 1994 by Eric Bransby, illustrate scenes of Native Americans; Zebulon Pike's travels; Cripple Creek Mining; William Jackson Palmer, founder of Colorado Springs; and Spencer Penrose. The next three floors contain a photographic history of Will Rogers from his early childhood days in Oklahoma through his time on stage, screen and radio. The last mural is of Will and Wiley Post taken just prior to the fatal crash.\nA set of Westminster chimes are played on a vibraharp every quarter-hour or every hour. The sounds of the chimes can be heard 20 miles (32 km) away, due to what was a state-of-the-art amplification system when it was built.  Songs like Home on the Range and classical music has been broadcast from the tower over the years. At night, the shrine is illuminated by floodlights and the walkway is lighted. Visible below, Cheyenne Lake at The Broadmoor reflects the nearby lights.\n\n\n=== Chapel ===\nThe chapel is below the first level. It contains European works of art from the 15th and 16th centuries, including a 16th-century Baroque painting of the Madonna. Furniture from the 16th century includes choir stalls, a Classical Baroque altar, and carved Monk benches. The chapel's crucifix is a German woodcarving. The remains of Spencer and Julie Penrose are interred in the chapel along with two friends, Spencer's social secretary, Horace Devereaux, and Larry Leonard. Eastern works of art include a standing bronze statue of Bodhisattva Guanyin wearing rosary beads and three Buddha statues.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in El Paso County, Colorado\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWill Rogers Shrine of the Sun official site",

          "After the curviest narrow road to the top you could see the whole city! The memorial was beautiful and well kept. You wouldn't have to go to the top of the memorial building to see the views, they had a lovely viewing area and also a history center!",
          "With your zoo admission you can drive up to Will Rogers Shrine. I would recommend doing it on a clear day. The history on each floor is very amazing. There are many stairs.",

          "This wonderful place is quiet and beautiful, with areas to sit and relax, a small climb to view from the top, but you can see forever from the top.",
          "This shrine is a little hidden gem. Once you pay for your entrance to the zoo you have access to drive up to the Will Rogers Shrine which is very high in elevation but well worth it. Who would've ever thought there would be a memorial to Will Rogers in Colorado Springs?? Be sure",
          "Located about 1 1/2 miles along a windy road up the side of the mountain from the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo lies this must visit gem! You can climb up several flights of stairs to the top and see a MAGNIFICENT view of Colorado Springs and beyond. Along the way to the top are",

          "The view from the shrine is great...out onto the Eastern Plains, and it's fun to be so close when the chimes peal. There's some Will Rogers interest inside, ( he is actually buried at Forest Lawn) but you MUST enter through The Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, and pay the Piper ( better",
          "If your stopping into the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, make sure you add this to your list! You'll take a windy road up past the zoo to the shrine, then soak in the view! You can take the stairs inside the tower to get the best view.",
          "This is a must see if not for anything else but the view! It is simply breath taking. If you get a chance to visit with the ranger so he can explain what it took to build this site and to show you where the stones came from will amaze you!!!!",
          "This attraction is definitely worth the drive up the road that goes thru the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. If you're visiting the zoo, at the end of your visit, be sure to take advantage of the free admission to the shrine. Shoot, I've gone to the Shrine as a standalone trip without",
          "If you like historical this is a neat place to visit. If you pay to get into the zoo admission is free for the day. The road is in need if repair but go slow and you will be fine. Beautiful views of the city!",
          "This is a great place to see Colorado Springs. The downside is you must purchase tickets to the zoo to get there. Then there is a climb up the hill to the shrine. It\u2019s a shrine to Will Rogers who died during construction and also to the sun. The chapel houses the tombs of",
          "Very interesting shrine. Learned a lot about Will Rogers and also the Colorado Springs area. Definitely climb the stairs. The attendant was very informative.",
          "The Will Rogers Memorial Shrine of the Sun, also known as the Will Rogers Shrine, is a magnificent piece of architecture, a 100-foot, five-story, observation tower on Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado Springs, Colorado, that overlooks Colorado Springs, the Broadmoor resort and the",
          "We have a zoo pass so the mysterious shrine is part of the package. The drive right THROUGH the zoo, right through, very slowly , then up the semi steep, semi freakishly high( yet beautiful )road . Just when you aren\u2019t sure if you wanna drive any higher there awaits the mini",
          "If you're looking for an interesting piece of history and great views, this is the spot to be. This shrine is simply that\u2014a shrine. It's not exactly a museum, although it's full of photos of Will Rogers and murals from the early days of Colorado Springs. There's a chapel in the",
          "We expected a lot of cool things to see but really it's just a monument you can climb and look out over. It wasn't worth the extra hassle to get to the top.",
          "after spending time in the zoo we wanted to see Will Rogers Shrine, not knowing we literally drive thru the zoo; after driving through the spectators it is a steep drive up with wonderful views.",
          "Pick a day with good weather or combine this with a trip to the zoo (it is included with zoo admission). Try and time your visit so that you are at the Shrine at the turn of the hour so you get the full effect!",
          "An unexpected plus included with our Zoo pass. We drove slowly up through the Zoo around the multiple curves to finally ascend the monument. Very impressive with remarkable views looking across the State nearly 150 miles on a clear day. Lots of stairs, but no need to climb",
          "To get to the Will Rogers Shrine you will have to pay admission at the entrance of the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. The drive up the mountain is spectacular and a little scary. The road is narrow and edges the side of the mountain. There is a stairway to the top of the Shrine that",
          "We weren't even sure how to get up to the shrine at first after we were done at the zoo. But quickly figured it out with the help of an employee. It's included with your ticket so why not take a short drive up and check it out. It really is a remarkable building. You can't help",
          "So we decided to drive up after a day at the Cheyenne Zoo and we were glad we did. Such amazing views and a wonderful tribute to the Penrose family and Will Rogers.",
          "Don't miss out on this cool attraction when visiting the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo! Beautiful view with some interesting historical significance and photos. Shrine expert was willing to answer any questions you may have. There is a small visitors' center with more information,",
          "Built on the side on Cheyenne Mountain, above the Zoo, it is free with your zoo admission. Built from one huge piece of granite, the building consists of 94 steps to the top, with pictures along the way of the great American humorist, Will Rogers. The view from the top is",

          "The Will Rogers Shrine is located a lot of steps and a zig-zag drive above the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. Admission to the zoo also covers your admission to the Shrine. Once at the shrine, you can walk about it and see the beautiful sites of the CO Springs area. There is a",
          "Very impressive piece of architecture. Learning about Will Rogers through the photos on the wall very interesting. Fantastic views of Colorado Springs and surrounding area. Glad this was included in the zoo fee should not miss if you are visiting the zoo.",
          "You can see for miles and miles. The photos in the shrine are wonderful to see and read about. Easy climb up to the top and worth the trip.",
          "With the admission to Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, you can drive up to the shrine. You actually drive through the zoo to start. The shrine offered amazing overlooks of the area. There are also plaques naming what you are looking at in each direction. You can climb to the top of the",
          "We didn't realize this was included with the zoo entrance until we had already left the zoo. I just happened to read something online about it, so we went back (same day) and went to the shrine. So glad we went back. It was neat and the views were amazing.",
          "Took the family up in the evening, after a long day at the zoo, but IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT! Scenic drive up the side of Cheyenne Mountain. Well kept grounds. Extremely polite and knowledgeable staff. Small museum with lots of information. And a wonderful Chapel/Shrine.",
          "The Will Rogers Memorial Shrine of the Sun is included in the price of admittance to the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. You drive your vehicle through a road thru the zoo and up a mountain, where you park and walk up the steps to visit the memorial. It has five floors, plus a Chapel",

          "I have seen this shrine from below, but this is the first time going to the top. We rode our motorcycle after viewing the zoo, which gives you a free pass to the shrine, at over 8000 ft elv. Great view and history of Will Rogers and Penrose. It was also cooler than in",
          "Only accessible with Cheyenne Mtn. Zoo admission, we went up after our visit to the zoo. Just show your receipt and they'll open the gate and you'll drive through the zoo. My daughter and husband walked all the way to the top of the shrine, but the view from the base was high",

          "This attraction is included with admission to the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo and is well worth the mile and a half drive up the switch back filled road. Wonderful vistas and a glimpse into teh history of the area.",
          "We visited in conjunction with a zoo visit. The drive up was scary because I am scared of heights. The shrine is breathtaking though. I really have no words. We could see for miles and miles! There are a LOT of stairs though. It was a little sad that the family who built the",
          "We traveled up here after our zoo trip. Although we did not stop in the visitor center, we did go all the way up the tower. The view will make your knees wobble and give you a greater appreciation of what it must be like to see like a bird in flight. It is truly gorgeous and you",
          "We went through the zoo in order to get here. Some great views up and down the winding road that leads to the top of the mountain. Once you get to the top, there's a nice Welcome Center and then it's a short climb/walk to the actual shrine. This is definitely off the beaten",
          "This is a great shrine, near the zoo up on Cheyenne Mountain. We dropped by here on the way back from rappelling.",
          "Very cool building! The climb isn't bad and it gets you to one of the most amazing views of the mountains and Colorado Springs. The Will Rogers pictures are neat to see and they reflect a very different time period. The chapel was probably the prettiest part of the structure.",
          "This is an excellent monument and worth the drive and even the required admission to the Zoo, which is certainly not a favorite of mine. The monument is very impressive and is the final resting place of Penrose who built The Broadmoor. The site has terrific views.",
          "Amazing the vision of some people. This Shrine is definitely something to visit. Be careful, always windy way up there. Pretty narrow inside.",
          "This is a really beautiful memorial with absolutely incredible views of the Colorado Springs area! It feels really peaceful when walking through the grounds with lots of little flowers and well kept sitting areas. It is a shame that the only way to visit is by paying for zoo",
          "A fabulous view of the Broadmoor Resort, Colorado Springs and the surrounding mountains. The tower climb is a series of steep stairs, and each landing has an adjoining room with photos and history about Will Rogers.",
          "This little treasure is above the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo and is a good way to end your day. You actually drive slowly through the zoo to reach this and get amazing views over the plains. We chose this with young children as an alternative to making the queasy trek up Pikes Peak.",
          "From our visit to the zoo, we were able to drive to this amazing structure at the top of the cliffs above the zoo. It's an interesting drive in itself, but once you get to the shrine it's spectacular. You are so high up with beautiful picture taking opportunities. In the shrine",
          "Access to the Shrine of the Sun is included included in your Cheyenne Mountain Zoo fees and well worth the 10-15 minutes it takes you drive up to it. Stunning views of Colorado Springs and the drive up the twisting turning road was fun for the kids. One of my favorite features",
          "I knew a little about Will Rogers but became a fan because of my visit to the shrine. This is an amazing place on a sunny Colorado day and Will Rogers wit and common sense are as applicable today as when this interesting man was alive.",
          "Will Rogers was an American pundit, newspaperman, and actor back in the 20s and 30s and had many clever things to say which garnered him a substantial following. He died in a plane crash in Alaska--but not before he made friends with some of the locals here in Colorado Springs.",
          "Interesting place, the view is perfect. It is a little odd that it a memorial built for a man that was not from CO and that is not burried there but hey ! still a cool place !",
          "Will Rogers was a rare talent, this memorial shows some of his lifes work and how he was a great entertainer. Also the tower has a viewpoint where you can see most of the geographic and man made infrastructure features in Colorado Springs, you are at 8,000 feet in the tower! The",
          "The Will Rogers Shrine is included in your admission to the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. Picturesque views from the top! Several picnic tables at the top to enjoy a picnic lunch. Great tribute to a great man!",
          "Such a stunning tribute to Will Rogers. The climb up the stairs is worth it as each level has so much to share, but it is hard if you can't do stairs well. and worth it if you can. The view at the top is well worth the steps!",

          "With your park admission you will gain access to the drive up the mountain to the Memorial. Nice view of CO Springs and the surrounding valley. Hike up the 94 steps to the top of the memorial to have a greater view and a little history of Will Rogers.",
          "With the price of our ticket to the zoo, this attraction is free. If you are afraid of heights like me, I didn't realize how far up this shrine is, while looking up at it at the zoo! We were already on our way up to the shrine, when I figured it out. Needless to say, I wasn't",
          "We were told it's a full day commitment to do the zoo and the shrine. From others we heard it was nice to visit however at the end of our 10 days here we didn't have time to do the zoo.",
          "This is definitely worth the walk to the lower portions for the overlook and to see the interesting details inside. Walking to the top is not necessary to enjoy the shrine unless you just want to climb some stairs.",
          "This monument to Will Rogers belies its real purpose -- it's meant to honor philanthropist Spencer Penrose and his wife Julie. Mr. Penrose, who was still living when the monument was built, dedicated it to the humorist Will Rogers. The Penroses lie in quiet repose beneath the",
          "The Memorial is set back from the rest of Lookout Mt. It's a shame the local authorities placed so many microwave, cell phone towers, and even high tension electrical transmission lines right in front of the memorial. But worth the view on the other side. A difficult drive on a",

          "We didn't know anything about this and could see it while in the Zoo and wondered what it was. On the back of the Zoo map it tells you its a historic monument and only 1.4 miles up Cheyenne Mountain and include in your zoo admission. It was a nice added bonus and had good views",
          "Great views up a switch back mountain. Absolutely beautiful drive and shrine. You will be hard pressed to find better viwes",
          "We drove up after a zoo visit. The drive is steep and slow but the shrine is a must see. Excellent views of the City and lots of historical photos and information about Will Rogers and Mr. Primrose. The building design was cool. Only wish we could have gone all the way to the",
          "The Shrine, what it stands for and what it was built for, and the view are all outstanding . The one real drawback is the fact that to access the shrine you have to drive through the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo and are forced to pay the zoo entrance fees, even if you are not",
          "The Will Rogers Memorial Shrine is a special place. The views from the shrine of the steep side of Cheyenne Mountain is spectacular. A must visit site while in Colorado Springs.",
          "After visiting the zoo we drove up to the Shrine and we are so glad we did. Such a beautiful shrine to Will Rogers and the Penrose family. Many pictures of Mr. Rogers are displayed in the shrine. The chapel where the Penroses are buried is very beautiful.",
          "After visiting the zoo, you can visit the Will Rogers Shrine free with your zoo admission receipt. Beautiful shrine and some interesting history about Will Rogers and the couple that built the shrine and Broadmore. Climb the tower to see the very best view of Colorado Springs!",
          "We liked it the view at the top of course is the best and just hearing the wind in the trees is so amazing and peaceful",
          "Hold on to your kids peeps! This place is a fun little adventure for an hour or so. It is WAY up the mountain after you pass through the Zoo gates but worth the death defying turns. Intersesting history, unbelievable views and the whole place felt like a secret little castle up",
          "When you finish your Cheyenne Mountain Zoo visit, take your free token and drive up Cheyenne mountain to see this stunning memorial Shrine of Will Rogers. The views up there are amazing and its quite relaxing. It's a quick drive and a short trip that is well worth your time. Get",
          "You will have to purchase a ticket to the Zoo to get to this one. It is part of the Zoo complex now. It is an interesting tribute to one of America's most famous humorists.",
          "If you have time and willingness to see Colorado Springs from the top, good place to go! Dont be afraid to claim up!",
          "If you visit the zoo you must drive up to the shrine. The view is absolutely amazing. The park ranger was very friendly and let the kids use the restroom in his office. We talked with him for quite awhile finding out he used to live 20 miles from us in central Wisconsin.",
          "Amazing views but it's a bit scary driving there. Free admission with zoo entrance fee. Restrooms are available",
          "This is part of the zoo admission and you drive up a curvy road to get to the top of the mountain. It's well worth seeing both for the view and the tower itself",
          "And just when you thought that you had seen everything in the Colorado Springs area, you got to this little spot - beautiful!!!",
          "If you go to the zoo, you really ought to do the little additional drive (through the zoo) up to this memorial. It offers a great view of Colorado Springs and a little bit of history about Will Rogers and the Penroses. You can do the drive and visit in 30 minutes to an hour,",
          "We always wondered what the Will Rogers' shrine was all about, so one day we drove up from the zoo and visited the really large house. It was nice, great views of the city, but that's about it. Worth going for free on a clear day when you pay admission to the zoo.",
          "Nice but small! A tall tower to climb, even higher than the zoo, but within its limits. A place to visit if you're on the zoo!",
          "Awesome view of Colorado Springs! Only need to go every 5-10 years though because the Shrine does not change. You can get a package deal with the zoo entry.",
          "As we walked through the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, my eyes kept being drawn up to the large stone tower sitting high up on the side of the hill. I finally saw a picture of it on the zoo map we were given and realized we could visit it for free with our zoo admission. All you have",
          "This would be an excellent BUT you have to buy a ticket to the zoo to go to the shrine, we did NOT go to the zoo so the price is way too high. The shrine is very nice too bad more people can't see it",
          "We have always seen the Shrine standing so tall on the mountain while we visited the zoo and we finally had a chance to take the drive up. Such a beautiful Shrine. The stone work is amazing. The view was incredible with breathe taking views from Garden of the Gods to across the",
          "The road up to the the shrine is very steep and curvy. drive slow and be careful of the cars coming down it is hard to see around the curves. The shrine it self is small but it has lots of stuff to look at. The view from the top is amazing.",
          "This is an awesome site that is included in your admission to the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. You drive through the gate and zoo and drive about 10 minutes to the top where they have a small building that includes the history of the shrine. Our teenagers loves the architecture and",
          "We have always seen this tower but never knew how to get there....., well, your zoo ticket allows you to drive right up. It is a beautiful building with an even more amazing view!",

          "We saw this building as we were driving around Springs and wondered what it was. We found out when we went to the Cheyenne Mtn. Zoo. You get admission to the road up to the shrine included with your Zoo admission and it is worth the drive up the mountain. They views are",
          "My husband and I drove up to the shrine early one morning and were the first and only ones up there. The docent/ranger visited with us and we learned a lot about the shrine and its history. The drive through the zoo and up the mountain is easy. We enjoyed seeing Colorado",
          "Such a beautiful place. It is well worth the drive through the zoo to get to it. I can't say enough about how beautiful it is! A must see when visiting Colorado Springs! ! !",
          "A wonderful view of the Springs from an unusual and fascinating little tower on the side of Cheyenne Mountain! Imagine Coit Tower in Colorado and you'll have something like this...except instead of the parrots at Coit, you have the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo.",
          "Worth the drive up the mountain, and the climb to the top of the shrine! The photos on display on each floor of the shrine are thought-provoking; the view of colorado Springs is great!",

          "We went here three years ago. We do go here every three or four years it seems like, It sits right behind the Cheyenne mtn zoo, so when your done at the zoo go check it out. I don't believe it costs anything to visit. The building has some awesome views of the city, well worth",
          "had to tell the kids everything. likly my fault they don't know who will rogers is. a drive up but a nice overlook view",
          "Free with zoo admission, absolutely worth the drive up! Breathtaking views of the area and beautiful building / shrine.",
          "Hardly anyone was there on a day where the zoo was crowded. Its worth the 10 minute drive up if you've already paid for the zoo. Drive is steep but not scary at all. There are picnic benches at the top if you want a picnic. Shrine is pretty neat, an old stone tower with photos",
          "We went after morning in the zoo. At 11:30 on a Saturday we arrived to find only one other family in the entire place! Great views, three year old daughter liked it (lots of stairs to climb)",
          "If you're already at the zoo, I would recommend taking the time to drive up to the Will Rogers Memorial Shrine of the Sun. If for nothing else, the view is terrific from the shine.",
          "If you pay for the zoo, you get to drive up to this shrine for free. Even though we had gone to the zoo for many years, I never took the trip up there and this place is beautiful. It only takes about 10 minutes to get to the top and then its a quick walk to the shrine. The view",
          "If you want to learn about Will Rogers and the things he did, go see this. If you just want to see a view of the whole city, go here. Such a beautiful view.",
          "Great view and the shrine is beautiful. You can see it lit up at night. Not too bad of a drive up. Glad we did it after the zoo.",
          "If you go to the zoo you can get in free and it's well worth the trip. You can go to the top and get a beautiful over view of Colorado. There are pictures of Will Rogers life on every floor.",
          "If you go to the zoo you can get in here for free. It is a place to relax and read about Will Rogers. You can climb to the top of the tower for a beautiful view. They have a very loud chime that chimes on the hour. You can also read about the family that dedicated this to Will.",
          "Because we were going to the zoo, and the Shrine is included in the ticket, we drove up to take a look. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much. But, we had a delightful visit. Even the children enjoyed our time. The views are great and the Will Rogers exhibit is very nice. It's",
          "Got to go here for free with our zoo tickets. Had seen this from the Broadmoor, but had no idea how to get there. Unbelievable views, and you can climb to the top of the tower, which is not for the faint of heart- most in our group didn't go all the way up.",
          "Great views of Colorado Springs. Slow drive up through Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. Steep stairs up the shrine and then the great views.",

          "You have to purchase a ticket to Cheyenne Mountain Zoo to get up to the shrine. The Penrose family built it as a tribute to Will Rogers who died during it's construction. The Penrose's are buried there. The view over the area is wonderful",
          "Interesting place to go. We bought the season pass to the zoo, which was a fantastic deal, and drove up to the shrine. Very cool piece of history, and the kids loved it!",
          "Nice hour visit after the zoo. Peaceful area. Some photos and tombs. Stairs up tower to view of Broadmoor and Airport, and Fort Carson",
          "Visitors must drive up to the top of Lookout Mountain. The road is steep and winding. There were many bikers and also skateboarders. The view from the top is great. The museum is wonderful and packed with memorabilia.",
          "Great place to see Colorado Springs from up high. Be aware that the elevation is about 8000 ft so walk slowly if you are not used of altitude. Be sure to talk to the caretaker for history Q&A. The information center is a must see also. Lots of history to read about and a video",
          "A WIll Rogers Shrine was placed on the side of Cheyenne Mountain, just above the wonderful Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. Both are behind the exclusive Broadmoore Hotel/resort. The setting is wonderful. A small road switches back and forth, hugging the side of this mountain. Will",
          "With your entrance ticket to the Cheyenne Zoo your entrance to the Memorial is included. The place is very serene, and the views of the town are well worth the short drive up the hill. The shrine has a small chapel as well.",
          "The views were fabulous and the gentleman who was the caretaker was very friendly and informative. The drive up was quite steep but stunning.",
          "Interesting place to see skyline of Colorado springs. Not much to see at shrine except graves of Broadmore Hotel owners. You have to go through zoo to get to shrine. Great chimes play from top of hill.",
          "great view of the city with, lots and lots of stairs..lol, not much else to see , driving by car is the best, bring your own drinks nother up there to eat or drink, short visit",
          "From my house I can see the shrine lit up every night. It is a beautiful beacon on a hill. I have been up to it several times because the views of the city and the eastern plains is spectacular. Spencer Penrose and his wife Julie are buried there but he built the shrine in",
          "Part of zoo admission. If you have never been it is a nice drive to get a view of the city. One can walk to the top to really see the lights etc. However if a choice between time at zoo and here, would stay at zoo.",
          "We were at the Broadmoor for a conference and saw the Memorial lit up on Friday night when we asked what it was from the staff we decided to venture up there on Sat afternoon during a break. It is not far from the Broadmoor at all but it is interesting you must travel through",
          "A winding road takes you to an interesting structure that is not only worthy of being explored, but a chance to see Colorado Springs from an angle not seen from many places. If you have a fear of heights, this might not be the place for you!",
          "just being there is like being in heaven. the views and the atmosphere are wonderful. there is nothing to dislike. I loved the serenity.",
          "Oddly, this is part of a trip to the Zoo. You have to drive through the zoo itself, go up a winding road and walk up some more. On a clear day, the view is well worth the effort.",
          "You have to drive up through the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo on a very narrow road, but it is well worth the trip! The Memorial is very interesting and the view of Colorado Springs is stunning!",
          "Besides the beautiful artwork, architecture and great celebration of a wonderful human being, the shire is also an excellent way to get your bearings and plan your day. Not only can you see EVERYTHING around the shrine, but they have put plaques around the shrine to indicate",
          "one of the best spot to see the town of Colorado Springs, and a plus at the zoo, the little museum is a perfect link to the Broadmoor story, and the foundation of Colorado Springs , early morning is a good time as the sun goes down fast behind the mountains in the wet side!",
          "I like the place so much. Historic and beautiful. We bought the zoo ticket and were able to visit the shrine. My husband has a knee injury but he was able to take the stairs all the way to the top he was exhausted later on and in slight pain. The selfies there are unbeatable.",
          "Don't miss driving up to and going to the top of the shrine, after enjoying the zoo, for great views of Colorado Springs and the plains beyond! Wow!",
          "Absolutely beautiful view. So neat to see back into the past thru pictures of his life. Construction of the tower is amazing. The view is so worth the burn of the thighs.",
          "Free entrance with zoo admission. Great for anyone age 10 and in good health. Unique drive to & from Shrine. Lovely place. Stay as long as you can. Amazing memories. Take lots of Photos!!",

          "We drove to the shrine after our visit to the zoo. We climbed the 99 stairs only to find the door to the lookout padlocked. There are some great panoramic views form some of the lower decks, but we were disappointed that we could not walk out on the top observation deck. If you",

          "Be sure to visit this memorial as part of your zoo admission - you take your car and drive through the zoo to get to it, and there are lots of stairs once you get up there, so it's not for everyone....but great for the generation that remembers Will Rogers and Wiley Post.",
          "interesting, but strange. It is a shrine to a rich guy and his burial place (along with his wife and friends). It has nothing to do with will rogers except the builder wanted to memorialize him. good view and price is included with zoo admission, so if you go to the zoo, you",

          "First, to get to this beauty you have to purchase a ticket to the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. The road to the the memorial can be scary to some but is well worth it. How they managed to build this tower here is unbelievable. We did not have the energy to climb the 99 stairs to the",

          "To quote Will Rogers, \"Being a hero is about the shortest-lived profession on earth\" and one might wonder if he could appreciate the irony of being permanently enshrined above the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. While it's free to visit the shrine itself, you'll need to pay zoo",

          "The shrine built by and for Spencer and Julia Penrose from 1934-1937 is an impressive engineering feat standing 114ft tall near the top of Cheyenne Mountain. As we drove up the winding road through hairpin turns, we asked ourselves how the road was engineered in the early 20th",
          "I only see this shrine to Will Rogers from a distance at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, but I want to go there next time i'm in the area from seeing what I am able! It would be so cool to read the tributes, see him in stone and just revere a little more this giant of a man who",
          "The shrine is a fascinating attraction that not only gives you a great view of Colorado Springs, it also teaches you a lot about the life of Will Rogers (the shrine's namesake), and Spencer Penrose (the shrine's builder, who is currently entombed in the shrine). Unfortunately,",

          "This may be an exercise in flamboyant egoism, but ya gotta love Spec Penrose's eye for a view. The ride up from the Penrose's Zoo (Cheyenne Mountain) is pretty spectacular, given that the most impressive thing you'll see is the Broadmoor Resort (also a Penrose property). The air",

          "It was fun taking the kids to see this and nice of the zoo staff to let us drive up there even though our zoo tickets were from a couple days prior to that. It is a nice drive; less scary than some of the crazy skinny-road mountain drives we had been on. The tower is neat and",

          "Or even if you are not at the zoo. This is really a cool Shrine and the view from up there is spectacular. Try to go early, so you don't have to leave if there is a thunderstorm. NOT a place to be when lightening starts! Really a unique shrine and well worth the time.",

          "After spending 1/2 day at the zoo we went up to the shrine. So glad we did as it is absolutely gorgeous. The song lyrics, \"I can see for miles and miles\" is so true of this place. The tower itself is pretty but quite a few steps for those with knee problems. Still well worth",

          "We went here after our visit to the zoo. There is no admission. beautiful drive up there and beautiful views. The shrine it self has wonderful photos and tell the history of Will Rogers and his Friends. Kids loved it! ( ages 7 &n 10)",
          "We took the drive up to the shrine after spending a fun day at the Zoo. This was one of my favorite things that we did on vacation. You drive right up to the gate and have to drive through some of the zoo crowds before heading up the road to the shrine. Just turn your four ways",

        "wiki": "Before it was founded, the site of modern-day Colorado Springs, Colorado, was part of the American frontier. Old Colorado City, built in 1858 during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush was the Colorado Territory capital. The town of Colorado Springs, was founded by General William Jackson Palmer as a resort town. Old Colorado City was annexed into Colorado Springs. Railroads brought tourists and visitors to the area from other parts of the United States and abroad. The city was noted for junctions for seven railways: Denver and Rio Grande (1870), Denver and New Orleans Manitou Branch (1882), Colorado Midland (1886-1918), Colorado Springs and Interurban (1887-1932 horse/electric tram), Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe (1889), Rock Island (1889), and Colorado Springs and Cripple Creek (1900-22 Short Line) Railways. It was also known for mining exchanges and brokers for the Cripple Creek Gold Rush.Palmer, Spencer Penrose, and Winfield Scott Stratton provided land and funding for parks, buildings, and non-profit organizations. It was a home to successful mine owners, artists, and writers. The climate and mountain setting made it a popular tourist destination and health resort. A dry climate supported resorts for people with weak lungs or tuberculosis, including the 19th and 20th century Colorado Springs sanatoria.\nIn 1928\u201329, Alexander Aircraft Company was \"the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world.\" The city supported three World War II and Cold War military installations. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) center was located within the city before relocating to Cheyenne Mountain.\n\n\n== Geological history ==\n\nNotable landforms, such as the Cheyenne Mountain on the city's southwest, were formed of Precambrian Pikes Peak granite uplifted in the Ancestral Rocky Mountains.  Formation of the city's hills\u2014including the Mesa, Institute Heights, and Knob Hill\u2014created valleys for the Camp, Cheyenne, and Fountain creeks which enter the city on the west; Monument Creek from the north; and Cottonwood & Sand creeks (east).  Bluffs formed with American Lower Eocene coal deposits of the Colorado Springs lignite field. Eponymic mineral springs, which flowed in 1912 from aquifers under the elevated landforms, included Horn's Mineral Springs at 1210 Lincoln, Monument Springs on Monument Creek's west bank in Monument Valley Park, and Jimmy's Camp Springs. There were also other springs located at that time on Bijou, Kiowa, 7th, and Cucharra streets and West Cheyenne Road.\n\n\n== Before founding ==\n\n\n=== Native American settlements ===\n\nUte people have believed that the Pikes Peak region is their home. Their name for Pikes Peak is Tavakiev, meaning sun mountain. They lived a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Summers were spent in the mountains, which was considered by other tribes to be the domain of the Utes.  In the fall they would travel down Ute Pass and visited the springs where they \"made offerings to the spirits of the springs for good health and good hunting\". From there they began a journey eastward to hunt buffalo. They spent winters in mountain valleys where they were protected from the weather. Garden of the Gods artifacts from up to 3,500 years ago, such as grinding stones, \"suggest the groups would gather together after their hunt to complete the tanning of hides and processing of meat.\" For instance, grinding stones found there from c.\u20091330 B.C. were used by the Ute people.Arapaho, Cheyenne, and other tribes also gathered in the Manitou Springs and Garden of the Gods areas. Cheyenne Mountain, named after the Cheyenne people was considered a great source of timber for teepee poles. Waterfalls were believed by the Cheyenne and Arapaho to be a spiritual place where one might gain inspiration, which may have been why they visited the local Ca\u00f1ons.By 1882, Utes were forced to live on reservations in southwestern Colorado and eastern Utah.\n\n\n=== Treaties and settler exploration ===\nPart of the American frontier, Colorado Springs land was in New France (1682 treaty), New Spain (1762 treaty), and the United States' Louisiana Purchase beginning in 1803. When the region was bought by the United States with the Louisiana Purchase, explorers entered the area. Zebulon Pike explored the region in November 1806. The land including the current city was designated part of the 1854 Kansas Territory and on June 24, 1857, a team of Major John Sedgwick's Column camped at the mouth of Jimmy Camp Creek. In 1858, a subsequent April US Army camp was near Soda Spring in Manitou Springs, and the Lawrence Party camped at Garden of the Gods in July before establishing a town in or after September of that year at Montana City, which is now part of Denver, Colorado.\n\n\n== Foundation ==\n\n\n=== Gold rush settlement ===\nColorado City, now called Old Colorado City, was founded at the confluence of Fountain and Camp creeks on August 13, 1859, making it the first Pikes Peak region settlement. The Colorado City area became part of the Jefferson Territory on October 24 and of El Paso County on November 28, 1859. From November 5, 1861, until August 14, 1862 (including one legislative session), the city was the Colorado Territory capital. It then moved to Golden, before it was finally moved to Denver in 1867.\nRoads into the area included a toll road that connected to the northeast with the Overland's 1865 \"Despatch Express Route\". Southward out of Colorado City a stage road (now Old Stage Road) traversed through South Cheyenne Creek's canyon to Cripple Creek, and a carriage road through North and South  Cheyenne Canyons and westward was the Ute Pass Wagon Road. Another route into the area was the north\u2013south Cherokee Trail / Jimmy Camp Trail, which was near the Goodnight\u2013Loving Trail. The Jimmy Camp Trail was one branch of the Trapper's Trail, a trail used by trappers and explorers from 1820 and during the gold rush. Trapper's Trail ran north\u2013south from Fort Laramie to the El Pueblo trading post in the present Pueblo County, and from there branched off to Bent's Old Fort or Taos, New Mexico.\n\n\n=== Colorado Springs founding and incorporation ===\nCivil War General William Jackson Palmer came to the Colorado Territory as a surveyor with the Kansas Pacific Railway in search of possible railroad routes.  Dr. William Abraham Bell from England was also part of the survey party. Having viewed the valley in the shadow of Pikes Peak as an ideal town site in July 1869, Palmer and Bell founded Fountain Colony, downstream of Colorado City, on July 31, 1871, and it was laid out by the Colorado Springs Company that year.  The town was named Colorado Springs by 1879. It was named for springs found along Monument Creek as early as 1871. Four chalybeate mineral springs were later discovered along Monument Creek in October 1880.The El Paso County seat transferred from Colorado City in 1873 to the Town of Colorado Springs.  Early infrastructure included 60 mi (97 km) of irrigation canals along streets and a drinking water supply from Manitou's Ruxton Creek by 1879. Water was diverted to the Ruxton Creek Basin from the Middle Beaver Creek basin in 1889.The town was \"Little London\" for the many English tourists and settlers actively recruited by Palmer's English associate Dr. William Abraham Bell and Palmer's English financial backers who provided the capital for his railroad, Denver and Rio Grande Railroad served the city beginning October 1871. In 1873 Colorado Springs became the county seat for the county; Previously, Old Colorado City was the county seat.\n\nThe Pikes Peak region was one of the most popular travel destinations in the late 19th century United States. The town saw an influx of writers, artists and people from England in the late 1870s, some of whom made their home in the town. Some of the key attractions were Garden of the Gods, Glen Eyrie, Pikes Peak, and Cheyenne Canyon.Domestic and international travelers were drawn to the high altitude, sunshine, mineral waters, and dry climate. The town was described as \"a veritable Eden for consumptive invalids\". At the peak of its period as a health resort for tuberculosis treatment in Colorado Springs, there were 17 tuberculosis hospitals in the area. The permanent residents fear of catching the highly contagious disease nearly resulted in a state bill that would have required tubercular patients to wear bells to announce their presence.The Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind and Colorado College were founded in 1874. Palmer opened the Antlers Hotel in 1882. Colorado Springs incorporated on June 19, 1886,\n\n\n== After settlement ==\n\n\n=== Late 19th century and early 20th century ===\n\nColorado Midland Railroad began service in the town in 1885. Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad service began in 1889. Trolleys ran to Manitou Springs the following year. Colorado Springs grew by 164% when 11,140 people settled in the town between 1880 and 1890.After the Cripple Creek gold discovery in 1891, the people who made a fortune from the gold rush and industry built large houses on Wood Avenue, then in the undeveloped downtown area of Colorado Springs. Several large stone buildings like Colorado College, St. Mary's Church, the first Antlers Hotel, the library, and the county courthouse were built on wide streets, in anticipation of significant population growth. By 1898, the city that had grown through annexations of Old Colorado City, Ivywild, Roswell and other towns was designated into quadrants by the north\u2013south Cascade Avenue and the east\u2013west Washington/Pike's Peak avenues, along with voting precincts 27-41 and five wards with the fire alarm zones.Inventor Nikola Tesla built and operated his wireless power experimental station in 1899 on Knob Hill, near the current intersection of Foote and Kiowa Streets. Governor James Hamilton Peabody sent troops to Colorado City in 1903 to settle a miner's strike. They set up Camp Peabody at what became the 1903 Colorado Labor War. According to Mrs. Gilbert McClurg, reported in the Colorado Springs Gazette, General Palmer visited the west bank of Monument Creek and located a lost mineral spring so that it was included in his plans for Monument Valley Park. By 1905, the lake at Monument Valley Park was built at a cost of US$750,000 (equivalent to $21,342,000 in 2019), the YMCA building was built for $100,000 (equivalent to $2,846,000 in 2019), and Broadmoor Country Club built one of the city's two polo fields.There was a plan in 1911 plan to build a Colorado Springs Union Depot to consolidate the two railroad passenger depots, but it was never completed. A zoological park was built along Cheyenne Creek, near Bear Creek Road (now Eighth Street), by 1916 and the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo was built in 1925 above The Broadmoor resort on the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo Road. In 1919, William Kennon Jewett deeded the Colorado Springs Golf Club's golf course to the City of Colorado Springs.  Aircraft flights to the Broadmoor neighborhood fields began in 1919, the Alexander Airport (later called Nichols Field) north of the city opened in 1925 and land was purchased in 1927 for the first Colorado Springs Municipal Airport.\nSuccessful mine owner Winfield Scott Stratton funded the Myron Stratton Home for housing itinerant children and the elderly, donated land for City Hall, the main post office, the Courthouse, and a park; he also greatly expanded the city's trolley car system and built the Mining Exchange building. Spencer Penrose and his wife, over the course of their lives, financed construction of The Broadmoor resort (1918), Pikes Peak Highway, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo (1921), Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun (1937), made a significant donation to what is now known as Penrose-St Francis Health Services, and established the El Pomar Foundation, which still oversees many of his contributions in Colorado Springs today. A bronze sculpture of Palmer on a horse was unveiled in 1929. To many residents who lived in Colorado Springs in the years since, Palmer became known as \"the man on the iron horse\".Many of the large homes in Colorado Springs were made into apartment houses or became boarding houses during the Depression of the 1930s and when there was a housing shortage during World War II. Some homes were also converted into office space.\n\n\n=== Land purchases and annexation ===\n\nColorado Springs annexed Roswell in 1880.  The city purchased 640 acres in North Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on after citizens of Colorado Springs voted for the measure in 1885.Between 1889 and 1890 Seavey's Addition, West Colorado Springs, East End, and another North End addition were annexed to the city.  In 1891, the Broadmoor Land Company began developing the Broadmoor suburb and built the Broadmoor Casino. By December 12, 1895, the city had \"four Mining Exchanges and 275 mining brokers.\" Silver Cascade Falls, Helen Hunt Falls, N. Cheyenne Canyon Road and other land in North Cheyenne were purchased and donated to the city in 1907 by William Jackson Palmer. The ca\u00f1on was considered by the Park Commission to be \"by far the grandest and most popular of all the beautiful ca\u00f1ons near the city.\" Several areas near downtown, such as North End and Wood Avenue were annexed by 1912 and Colorado City (now called Old Colorado City) was annexed in 1917. After a lull between 1917 and 1946, annexation began in earnest. Some examples of annexed areas are: Pleasant Valley (1950), Knob Hill (1952), Austin Bluffs (1958-1965), Pike View (1962), Papeton (1968), Woodmen Valley (1969), and Stratton Additions (1966-1971).Between 1960 and 1970 divisions of Cheyenne Mountain, Elmere, Black Forest-Peyton, Fountain, Pikes Peak and Monument were annexed into Colorado Springs, resulting in an increased population of 37,500 by 1970. Broadmoor and Skyway were annexed, without a vote of its residents, before the state's Poundstone Amendment (1974) was enacted. Briargate was annexed in 1982.\n\n\n==== Parks ====\n\nThe first city park in Colorado Springs, included in the initial town plans in 1871, is Acacia Park. It was initially called Acacia Square or North Park. General William Jackson Palmer donated land to establish Acacia and additional parks, including: Antlers Park, Monument Valley Park, North Cheyenne Ca\u00f1on, Palmer Park, Pioneer Square (South) Park, Prospect Lake and Bear Creek Ca\u00f1on Park. He donated a total of 1,270 acres of land, some of which was also used for scenic drives, tree-lined roadways and foot and bridle paths. The Perkins heirs donated Garden of the Gods to the city in 1909.\n\n\n=== Military installations ===\n\nThe city purchased land at the southern border of the city and donated it to the War Department. After the Pearl Harbor attack, the U.S. Army established Camp Carson, named for General Kit Carson, near the southern borders of the city as a training facility in preparation for World War II. Colorado Springs Municipal Airport was used by the Colorado Springs Army Air Base and was assigned to the Air Force in 1942 for photo reconnaissance training. It was renamed Peterson Field for Lt. Edward J. Peterson who died during a takeoff from the field.After World War II there was little military presence in the city. Camp Carson had only 600 soldiers. When the Korean War began there was an influx of military personnel. Over time, Camp Carson grew and became a significant industry within the city. In 1951, the United States Air Defense Command moved to Colorado Springs and opened Ent Air Force Base.In 1954 Camp Carson became Fort Carson. That year the United States Air Force Academy was established.\n\nNORAD's main facility was built in Cheyenne Mountain, which permanently secured the city's military presence and as a result increased the city's revenue, and opened in 1966. Ent Air Force Base was shut down and in 1977 was converted into the United States Olympic Training Center.  Peterson Field was renamed Peterson Air Force Base and was permanently activated.In 1983 Falcon Air Force Base, (later Schriever Air Force Base), was founded as a missile defense and satellite control center. Air Force Space Command is located on Peterson AFB.\n\n\n=== Late 20th and early 21st century ===\nBetween 1965 and 1968 the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, Pikes Peak Community College and the Colorado Technical University were established in the city.In 1972, the city's first National Register of Historic Places designation was the 1903 El Paso County Courthouse. The first designated historic district was the 1979 Rock Ledge Ranch Historic Site.  In 1977, most of the former Ent Air Force Base became the first US Olympic Training Center, and the US Olympic Committee moved there in 1978.\nIn 2012, the Waldo Canyon fire destroyed 346 homes and killed two people in the city.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nCommercial and public buildings\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to History of Colorado Springs, Colorado at Wikimedia Commons\n\nColorado Springs Pioneer Museum",

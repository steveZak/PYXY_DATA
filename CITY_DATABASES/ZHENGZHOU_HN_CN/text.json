        "wiki": "Zhengzhou is the capital and largest city of Henan Province in the central part of the People's Republic of China. It is one of the National Central Cities in China, the centre of Central Plains area, and serves as the political, economic, technological, and educational center of the province. The Zhengzhou metropolitan area (including Zhengzhou and Kaifeng) is the core area of the Central Plains Economic Zone.The city lies on the southern bank of the Yellow River. Zhengzhou is a major hub of China's national transportation network, with railways connecting Zhengzhou to Europe and an international airport. Zhengzhou is a National Civilized City, State-list Famous Historical and Culture City, and the birthplace of the Yellow Emperor. As of 2020, there are two World Cultural Heritage Sites in Zhengzhou. The Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (ZCE) is China's first futures exchange, Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone is China's first Airport Economy Zone.Zhengzhou has a population of 10,120,000 inhabitants, and had a GDP of 1.014 billion (RMB) in 2018. The city is one of the main built-up areas of Henan region. Greater Zhengzhou was named as one of the 13 emerging mega-cities in China in a July 2012 report by the Economist Intelligence Unit, and officially named as the eighth National Central City in 2017 by the central government in Beijing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Shang dynasty established Aodu (\u969e\u90fd) or Bodu (\u4eb3\u90fd) in Zhengzhou. This prehistorical city had become abandoned as ruins long before the First Emperor of China in BC 260. Since 1950, archaeological finds in a walled city in Eastern Zhengzhou have provided evidence of Shang dynasty settlements in the area. Outside this city, remains of large public buildings and a complex of small settlements have been discovered. The site is generally identified with the Shang capital of Ao and is preserved in the Shang dynasty Ruins monument in Guanchen District. The Shang, who continually moved their capital due to frequent natural disasters, left Ao at around 13th century BC. The site, nevertheless, remained occupied; Zhou (post-1050 BC) tombs have also been discovered. Legend suggests that in the Western Zhou period (1111\u2013771 BC) the site became the fief of a family named Guan. From this derives the name borne by the county (xian) since the late 6th century BC\u2014Guancheng (City of the Guan). The city first became the seat of a prefectural administration in AD 587, when it was named Guanzhou. In 605 it was first called Zhengzhou\u2014a name by which it has been known virtually ever since.The name Zhengzhou came from the Sui dynasty (AD 582), even though it was located in Chenggao, another town. The government moved to the contemporary city during the Tang dynasty. It achieved its greatest importance under the Sui (AD 581\u2013618), Tang (618\u2013907), and early Song (960\u20131127) dynasties, when it was the terminus of the New Bian Canal, which joined the Yellow River to the northwest. There, at a place called Heyin, a vast granary complex was established to supply the capitals at Luoyang and Chang'an to the west and the frontier armies to the north. In the Song period, however, the transfer of the capital eastward to Kaifeng robbed Zhengzhou of much of its importance.In 1903 the Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway arrived at Zhengzhou, and in 1909 the first stage of the Longhai Railway gave it an east\u2013west link to Kaifeng and Luoyang; it later was extended eastward to the coast at Lianyungang, Jiangsu, and westward to Xi'an (Chang'an), Shaanxi, as well as to western Shaanxi. Zhengzhou thus became a major rail junction and a regional center for cotton, grain, peanuts, and other agricultural produce. Early in 1923 a workers' strike began in Zhengzhou and spread along the rail line before it was suppressed; a 14-story double tower in the center of the city commemorates the strike. On June 10, 1938, Chiang Kai-shek's National Revolutionary Army opened up the dikes retaining the Yellow River at Huayuankou between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, in an effort to stem the tide of invading Japanese; however, the ensuing 1938 Yellow River flood also killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese.Zhengzhou also has a locomotive and rolling-stock repair plant, a tractor-assembly plant, and a thermal generating station. The city's industrial growth has resulted in a large increase in the population, coming predominantly from industrial workers from the north. A water diversion project and pumping station, built in 1972, has provided irrigation for the surrounding countryside. The city has an agricultural university.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLocated just north of the province's centre and south of the Yellow River, Zhengzhou borders Luoyang to the west, Jiaozuo to the northwest, Xinxiang to the northeast, Kaifeng to the east, Xuchang to the southeast, and Pingdingshan to the southwest. With the land within its administrative borders generally sloping down from west to east, Zhengzhou is situated at the transitional zone between the North China Plain to the east and the Song Mountains and Xionger Mountains to the west, which are part of the greater Qinling range. The city centre is situated to the south of the middle reach of the Yellow River, where its valley broadens into the great plain. Zhengzhou is at the crossing point of the north\u2013south route skirting the Taihang Mountains and the mountains of western Henan. The prefecture spans 34\u00b0 16' ~ 34\u00b0 58 N latitude and 112\u00b0 42' ~ 114\u00b0 14' E longitude, covering a total area of 7,446.2 square kilometres (2,875.0 sq mi), including the metropolitan area, which covers 1,013.3 km2 (391.2 sq mi), and the city centre, which occupies 147.7 square kilometres (57.0 sq mi).\nThe section of the Yellow River flowing through the prefecture extends 150.4 km (93.5 mi). Mountains loom over the western counties of Gongyi and Dengfeng while the easternmost county of Zhongmu is a vast, fertile floodplain, with the counties in between being hilly transitions.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZhengzhou experiences a monsoon-influenced, four-season humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cwa), with cool, dry winters and hot, humid summers. Spring and autumn are dry and somewhat abbreviated transition periods. The city has an annual mean temperature of 14.73 \u00b0C (58.5 \u00b0F), with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from 0.5 \u00b0C (32.9 \u00b0F) in January to 27.1 \u00b0C (80.8 \u00b0F) in July. The frost-free period lasts on average 220 days. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221217.9 \u00b0C (0 \u00b0F) on 2 January 1955, 27 December 1971 and 1 February 1990 to 43.0 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) on 19 July 1966.Rainfall is primarily produced by the monsoonal low during summer; in winter, when the vast Siberian High dominates due to radiative cooling from further north, the area receives little precipitation. During the summer season, the city is also often affected by tropical depressions, which bring additional amounts of rain. The annual precipitation is about 630 millimetres (25 in). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 45 percent in February and March to 54 percent in May, the city receives 2,182 hours of sunshine per year, which is just under half the possible total.\n\n\n== Administration and demography ==\n\nZhengzhou is divided into 6 urban districts, 5 county-level cities and 1 county. These subdivisions are likely to undergo significant changes in the near future due to increasingly rapid urban expansion and urban planning.\nThe municipality is home to 8,626,505 inhabitants (2010 census) and 6,35 million in its built up area made of 6 urban and suburban districts, Xingyang and Xinzheng cities and now Zhongmu county largely being urbanized, making the city one of the main built-up areas of the province.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nZhengzhou was the capital of China during the Shang dynasty.

        "wiki": "Zhengzhou is the capital and largest city of Henan Province in the central part of the People's Republic of China. It is one of the National Central Cities in China, the centre of Central Plains area, and serves as the political, economic, technological, and educational center of the province. The Zhengzhou metropolitan area (including Zhengzhou and Kaifeng) is the core area of the Central Plains Economic Zone.The city lies on the southern bank of the Yellow River. Zhengzhou is a major hub of China's national transportation network, with railways connecting Zhengzhou to Europe and an international airport. Zhengzhou is a National Civilized City, State-list Famous Historical and Culture City, and the birthplace of the Yellow Emperor. As of 2020, there are two World Cultural Heritage Sites in Zhengzhou. The Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (ZCE) is China's first futures exchange, Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone is China's first Airport Economy Zone.Zhengzhou has a population of 10,120,000 inhabitants, and had a GDP of 1.014 billion (RMB) in 2018. The city is one of the main built-up areas of Henan region. Greater Zhengzhou was named as one of the 13 emerging mega-cities in China in a July 2012 report by the Economist Intelligence Unit, and officially named as the eighth National Central City in 2017 by the central government in Beijing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Shang dynasty established Aodu (\u969e\u90fd) or Bodu (\u4eb3\u90fd) in Zhengzhou. This prehistorical city had become abandoned as ruins long before the First Emperor of China in BC 260. Since 1950, archaeological finds in a walled city in Eastern Zhengzhou have provided evidence of Shang dynasty settlements in the area. Outside this city, remains of large public buildings and a complex of small settlements have been discovered. The site is generally identified with the Shang capital of Ao and is preserved in the Shang dynasty Ruins monument in Guanchen District. The Shang, who continually moved their capital due to frequent natural disasters, left Ao at around 13th century BC. The site, nevertheless, remained occupied; Zhou (post-1050 BC) tombs have also been discovered. Legend suggests that in the Western Zhou period (1111\u2013771 BC) the site became the fief of a family named Guan. From this derives the name borne by the county (xian) since the late 6th century BC\u2014Guancheng (City of the Guan). The city first became the seat of a prefectural administration in AD 587, when it was named Guanzhou. In 605 it was first called Zhengzhou\u2014a name by which it has been known virtually ever since.The name Zhengzhou came from the Sui dynasty (AD 582), even though it was located in Chenggao, another town. The government moved to the contemporary city during the Tang dynasty. It achieved its greatest importance under the Sui (AD 581\u2013618), Tang (618\u2013907), and early Song (960\u20131127) dynasties, when it was the terminus of the New Bian Canal, which joined the Yellow River to the northwest. There, at a place called Heyin, a vast granary complex was established to supply the capitals at Luoyang and Chang'an to the west and the frontier armies to the north. In the Song period, however, the transfer of the capital eastward to Kaifeng robbed Zhengzhou of much of its importance.In 1903 the Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway arrived at Zhengzhou, and in 1909 the first stage of the Longhai Railway gave it an east\u2013west link to Kaifeng and Luoyang; it later was extended eastward to the coast at Lianyungang, Jiangsu, and westward to Xi'an (Chang'an), Shaanxi, as well as to western Shaanxi. Zhengzhou thus became a major rail junction and a regional center for cotton, grain, peanuts, and other agricultural produce. Early in 1923 a workers' strike began in Zhengzhou and spread along the rail line before it was suppressed; a 14-story double tower in the center of the city commemorates the strike. On June 10, 1938, Chiang Kai-shek's National Revolutionary Army opened up the dikes retaining the Yellow River at Huayuankou between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, in an effort to stem the tide of invading Japanese; however, the ensuing 1938 Yellow River flood also killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese.Zhengzhou also has a locomotive and rolling-stock repair plant, a tractor-assembly plant, and a thermal generating station. The city's industrial growth has resulted in a large increase in the population, coming predominantly from industrial workers from the north. A water diversion project and pumping station, built in 1972, has provided irrigation for the surrounding countryside. The city has an agricultural university.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLocated just north of the province's centre and south of the Yellow River, Zhengzhou borders Luoyang to the west, Jiaozuo to the northwest, Xinxiang to the northeast, Kaifeng to the east, Xuchang to the southeast, and Pingdingshan to the southwest. With the land within its administrative borders generally sloping down from west to east, Zhengzhou is situated at the transitional zone between the North China Plain to the east and the Song Mountains and Xionger Mountains to the west, which are part of the greater Qinling range. The city centre is situated to the south of the middle reach of the Yellow River, where its valley broadens into the great plain. Zhengzhou is at the crossing point of the north\u2013south route skirting the Taihang Mountains and the mountains of western Henan. The prefecture spans 34\u00b0 16' ~ 34\u00b0 58 N latitude and 112\u00b0 42' ~ 114\u00b0 14' E longitude, covering a total area of 7,446.2 square kilometres (2,875.0 sq mi), including the metropolitan area, which covers 1,013.3 km2 (391.2 sq mi), and the city centre, which occupies 147.7 square kilometres (57.0 sq mi).\nThe section of the Yellow River flowing through the prefecture extends 150.4 km (93.5 mi). Mountains loom over the western counties of Gongyi and Dengfeng while the easternmost county of Zhongmu is a vast, fertile floodplain, with the counties in between being hilly transitions.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZhengzhou experiences a monsoon-influenced, four-season humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cwa), with cool, dry winters and hot, humid summers. Spring and autumn are dry and somewhat abbreviated transition periods. The city has an annual mean temperature of 14.73 \u00b0C (58.5 \u00b0F), with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from 0.5 \u00b0C (32.9 \u00b0F) in January to 27.1 \u00b0C (80.8 \u00b0F) in July. The frost-free period lasts on average 220 days. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221217.9 \u00b0C (0 \u00b0F) on 2 January 1955, 27 December 1971 and 1 February 1990 to 43.0 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) on 19 July 1966.Rainfall is primarily produced by the monsoonal low during summer; in winter, when the vast Siberian High dominates due to radiative cooling from further north, the area receives little precipitation. During the summer season, the city is also often affected by tropical depressions, which bring additional amounts of rain. The annual precipitation is about 630 millimetres (25 in). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 45 percent in February and March to 54 percent in May, the city receives 2,182 hours of sunshine per year, which is just under half the possible total.\n\n\n== Administration and demography ==\n\nZhengzhou is divided into 6 urban districts, 5 county-level cities and 1 county. These subdivisions are likely to undergo significant changes in the near future due to increasingly rapid urban expansion and urban planning.\nThe municipality is home to 8,626,505 inhabitants (2010 census) and 6,35 million in its built up area made of 6 urban and suburban districts, Xingyang and Xinzheng cities and now Zhongmu county largely being urbanized, making the city one of the main built-up areas of the province.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nZhengzhou was the capital of China during the Shang dynasty. Parts of the Shang-era capital city wall that were built 3,600 years ago still remain in Downtown Zhengzhou (see Zhengzhou Shang City). Zhengzhou maintains abundant cultural heritages that reflect its glorious history as well as the culture of Henan Province. Zhengzhou Confucius Temple, initially built during the Eastern Han dynasty 1900 years ago, is one of the oldest Confucian Temples in China. Other important architectural heritage sites in the city center include Town God Temple and Erqi Memorial Tower.\nThe internationally known tourist attraction is the Shaolin Monastery, which is in Dengfeng, about 90 kilometres (56 miles) southwest of downtown Zhengzhou (1.5 hours by coach). The Shaolin Monastery is not only known as one of China's most important Buddhist shrines, but also as the ancient center of Chinese Kung-fu. Shaolin Monastery and its famed Pagoda Forest were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010.The Henan Museum is one of China's most important museums. It has a collection of more than 130,000 pieces of cultural relics includes exhibitions from prehistoric times, including dinosaur fossils and prehistoric human remains, up through the modern eras.\nZhengzhou's most developed and modern area is the Zhengdong New Area, which is in the eastern part of the city. It is home to some of the tallest skyscrapers in Zhengzhou, including the 280 metres (918.6 ft) tall Zhengzhou Greenland Plaza (\"Big Corn\"), which is one of the most prominent landmarks in Zhengzhou, and the twin towers of Zhengzhou Greenland Central Plaza (285 metres (935.0 ft)), which are currently the tallest skyscrapers in the city. The tallest structure in Zhengzhou is the 388-meter height Zhongyuan Tower, located on Hanghai East Road in the south of Zhengdong New Area. It is used as a television tower, with a revolving restaurant and an observation deck. The tower is among the tallest towers in the world.\nZhengzhou Zoo (\u90d1\u5dde\u52a8\u7269\u56ed) is located on Huayuan Road (\u82b1\u56ed\u8def).\nThe newly built Zhengzhou Botanic Garden is at the western edge of Zhengzhou city.\nMain attractions of Zhengzhou include:\n\nMount Song (UNESCO Global Geopark)\nShaolin Monastery and Pagoda Forest (UNESCO World Heritage Site)\nDengfeng Observertory (UNESCO World Heritage Site)\nSongyue Pagoda (UNESCO World Heritage Site)\nYellow River Scenic Area\nMausoleums of the Song dynasty\nKang Baiwan's Mansion\nthe birthplace of Yellow Emperor\nErqi Memorial Tower\nHenan Museum\nZhongyuan Tower\nZhengzhou Shang City\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nZhengzhou, along with Xi'an, Chengdu, Chongqing and Wuhan, is one of the most important cities in inland China. It is the economic center of the province and the surrounding areas such as southeastern Shanxi and southwestern Shandong. Due to its strategic location in one of the most populous areas in the world (nearly 100 million people in Henan alone) and in China's railway, road and aviation transport networks, Zhengzhou is increasingly attracting domestic and international investment as well as migrants from other areas, transforming the city into one of the largest economic centers in China. In 2018, total GDP of Zhengzhou was \uffe5 1020 billion, ranked 17th in China.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nBy the end of 2006, Zhengzhou had a total population of over 7 million, of which 2.88 million lived in rural areas.  Its main products include apples, paulownia, tobacco, maize, cotton, and wheat.  In addition, Zhengzhou also produces Yellow River carp, Zhengzhou watermelons, Xinzheng jujube, Xingyang dried persimmons, Guangwu Pomegranate and Zhongmu garlic, all of which are specialties that are rarely found outside the region.\n\n\n=== Mining and manufacturing ===\nZhengzhou and the surrounding area have large reserves of coal and other minerals. Coal mining and electricity generation are traditionally important in the local economy.\nZhengzhou has been one of the major industrial cities in The People's Republic of China since 1949.  The city's staple industry is textiles. Others manufactured items include tractors, locomotives, cigarettes, fertilizer, processed meats, agricultural machinery, and electrical equipment.

        "wiki": "The Han dynasty (Chinese: \u6f22\u671d; pinyin: H\u00e0nch\u00e1o) was the second imperial dynasty of China (206 BC\u2013220 AD), preceded by the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013280 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history. To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to themselves as the \"Han Chinese\" (Han Zu) and the Chinese script is referred to as \"Han characters\". It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han, and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (9\u201323 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han or Former Han (206 BC\u20139 AD) and the Eastern Han or Later Han (25\u2013220 AD).\nThe emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society. He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class. The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government using an innovation inherited from the Qin known as commanderies, and a number of semi-autonomous kingdoms. These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence, particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States. From the reign of Emperor Wu (r. 141\u201387 BC) onward, the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics, synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu. This policy endured until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912 AD.\nThe Han dynasty saw an age of economic prosperity and witnessed a significant growth of the money economy first established during the Zhou dynasty (c. 1050\u2013256 BC). The coinage issued by the central government mint in 119 BC remained the standard coinage of China until the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907 AD). The period saw a number of limited institutional innovations. \nTo finance its military campaigns and the settlement of newly conquered frontier territories, the Han government nationalized the private salt and iron industries in 117 BC, but these government monopolies were repealed during the Eastern Han dynasty. Science and technology during the Han period saw significant advances, including the process of papermaking, the nautical steering ship rudder, the use of negative numbers in mathematics, the raised-relief map, the hydraulic-powered armillary sphere for astronomy, and a seismometer employing an inverted pendulum that could be used to discern the cardinal direction of distant earthquakes.\nThe Xiongnu, a nomadic steppe confederation, defeated the Han in 200 BC and forced the Han to submit as a de facto inferior and vassal partner for several decades, but continued their military raids on the Han borders. Emperor Wu launched several military campaigns against them. The ultimate Han victory in these wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as Han tributaries. These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty and control into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations, and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road, which reached as far as the Mediterranean world. The territories north of Han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation. \nEmperor Wu also launched successful military expeditions in the south, annexing Nanyue in 111 BC and Dian in 109 BC, and in the Korean Peninsula where the Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies were established in 108 BC. After 92 AD, the palace eunuchs increasingly involved themselves in court politics, engaging in violent power struggles between the various consort clans of the empresses and empresses dowager, causing the Han's ultimate downfall. Imperial authority was also seriously challenged by large Daoist religious societies which instigated the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion. \nFollowing the death of Emperor Ling (r. 168\u2013189 AD), the palace eunuchs suffered wholesale massacre by military officers, allowing members of the aristocracy and military governors to become warlords and divide the empire. When Cao Pi, King of Wei, usurped the throne from Emperor Xian, the Han dynasty ceased to exist.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAccording to the Records of the Grand Historian, after the collapse of the Qin dynasty the hegemon Xiang Yu appointed Liu Bang as prince of the small fief of Hanzhong, named after its location on the Han River (in modern southwest Shaanxi). Following Liu Bang's victory in the Chu\u2013Han Contention, the resulting Han dynasty was named after the Hanzhong fief.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Western Han ===\n\nChina's first imperial dynasty was the Qin dynasty (221\u2013207 BC). The Qin united the Chinese Warring States by conquest, but their regime became unstable after the death of the first emperor Qin Shi Huang. Within four years, the dynasty's authority had collapsed in the face of rebellion. Two former rebel leaders, Xiang Yu (d. 202 BC) of Chu and Liu Bang (d. 195 BC) of Han, engaged in a war to decide who would become hegemon of China, which had fissured into 18 kingdoms, each claiming allegiance to either Xiang Yu or Liu Bang. Although Xiang Yu proved to be an effective commander, Liu Bang defeated him at Battle of Gaixia (202 BC), in modern-day Anhui. Liu Bang assumed the title \"emperor\" (huangdi) at the urging of his followers and is known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu (r. 202\u2013195 BC). Chang'an (known today as Xi'an) was chosen as the new capital of the reunified empire under Han.\n\nAt the beginning of the Western Han (traditional Chinese: \u897f\u6f22; simplified Chinese: \u897f\u6c49; pinyin: X\u012bh\u00e0n), also known as the Former Han (traditional Chinese: \u524d\u6f22; simplified Chinese: \u524d\u6c49; pinyin: Qi\u00e1nh\u00e0n) dynasty, thirteen centrally controlled commanderies\u2014including the capital region\u2014existed in the western third of the empire, while the eastern two-thirds were divided into ten semi-autonomous kingdoms. To placate his prominent commanders from the war with Chu, Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed some of them as kings. \nBy 196 BC, the Han court had replaced all but one of these kings (the exception being in Changsha) with royal Liu family members, since the loyalty of non-relatives to the throne was questioned. After several insurrections by Han kings\u2014the largest being the Rebellion of the Seven States in 154 BC\u2014the imperial court enacted a series of reforms beginning in 145 BC limiting the size and power of these kingdoms and dividing their former territories into new centrally controlled commanderies. Kings were no longer able to appoint their own staff; this duty was assumed by the imperial court. Kings became nominal heads of their fiefs and collected a portion of tax revenues as their personal incomes. The kingdoms were never entirely abolished and existed throughout the remainder of Western and Eastern Han.\n\nTo the north of China proper, the nomadic Xiongnu chieftain Modu Chanyu (r. 209\u2013174 BC) conquered various tribes inhabiting the eastern portion of the Eurasian Steppe. By the end of his reign, he controlled Manchuria, Mongolia, and the Tarim Basin, subjugating over twenty states east of Samarkand. Emperor Gaozu was troubled about the abundant Han-manufactured iron weapons traded to the Xiongnu along the northern borders, and he established a trade embargo against the group.In retaliation, the Xiongnu invaded what is now Shanxi province, where they defeated the Han forces at Baideng in 200 BC. After negotiations, the heqin agreement in 198 BC nominally held the leaders of the Xiongnu and the Han as equal partners in a royal marriage alliance, but the Han were forced to send large amounts of tribute items such as silk clothes, food, and wine to the Xiongnu.\n\nDespite the tribute and a negotiation between Laoshang Chanyu (r. 174\u2013160 BC) and Emperor Wen (r. 180\u2013157 BC) to reopen border markets, many of the Chanyu's Xiongnu subordinates chose not to obey the treaty and periodically raided Han territories south of the Great Wall for additional goods. In a court conference assembled by Emperor Wu (r. 141\u201387 BC) in 135 BC, the majority consensus of the ministers was to retain the heqin agreement. Emperor Wu accepted this, despite continuing Xiongnu raids.However, a court conference the following year convinced the majority that a limited engagement at Mayi involving the assassination of the Chanyu would throw the Xiongnu realm into chaos and benefit the Han. When this plot failed in 133 BC, Emperor Wu launched a series of massive military invasions into Xiongnu territory. The assault culminated in 119 BC at the Battle of Mobei, where the Han commanders Huo Qubing (d. 117 BC) and Wei Qing (d. 106 BC) forced the Xiongnu court to flee north of the Gobi Desert.After Wu's reign, Han forces continued to prevail against the Xiongnu. The Xiongnu leader Huhanye Chanyu (r. 58\u201331 BC) finally submitted to Han as a tributary vassal in 51 BC. His rival claimant to the throne, Zhizhi Chanyu (r. 56\u201336 BC), was killed by Chen Tang and Gan Yanshou (\u7518\u5ef6\u58fd/\u7518\u5ef6\u5bff) at the Battle of Zhizhi, in modern Taraz, Kazakhstan.In 121 BC, Han forces expelled the Xiongnu from a vast territory spanning the Hexi Corridor to Lop Nur. They repelled a joint Xiongnu-Qiang invasion of this northwestern territory in 111 BC. In that year, the Han court established four new frontier commanderies in this region: Jiuquan, Zhangyi, Dunhuang, and Wuwei. The majority of people on the frontier were soldiers. On occasion, the court forcibly moved peasant farmers to new frontier settlements, along with government-owned slaves and convicts who performed hard labor. The court also encouraged commoners, such as farmers, merchants, landowners, and hired laborers, to voluntarily migrate to the frontier.Even before Han's expansion into Central Asia, diplomat Zhang Qian's travels from 139 to 125 BC had established Chinese contacts with many surrounding civilizations. Zhang encountered Dayuan (Fergana), Kangju (Sogdiana), and Daxia (Bactria, formerly the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom); he also gathered information on Shendu (Indus River valley of North India) and Anxi (the Parthian Empire). All of these countries eventually received Han embassies. These connections marked the beginning of the Silk Road trade network that extended to the Roman Empire, bringing Han items like silk to Rome and Roman goods such as glasswares to China.From roughly 115 to 60 BC, Han forces fought the Xiongnu over control of the oasis city-states in the Tarim Basin. Han was eventually victorious and established the Protectorate of the Western Regions in 60 BC, which dealt with the region's defense and foreign affairs. The Han also expanded southward. The naval conquest of Nanyue in 111 BC expanded the Han realm into what are now modern Guangdong, Guangxi, and northern Vietnam. Yunnan was brought into the Han realm with the conquest of the Dian Kingdom in 109 BC, followed by parts of the Korean Peninsula with the Han conquest of Gojoseon and colonial establishments of Xuantu Commandery and Lelang Commandery in 108 BC. In China's first known nationwide census taken in 2 AD, the population was registered as having 57,671,400 individuals in 12,366,470 households.To pay for his military campaigns and colonial expansion, Emperor Wu nationalized several private industries. He created central government monopolies administered largely by former merchants. These monopolies included salt, iron, and liquor production, as well as bronze-coin currency. The liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to 81 BC, and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early Eastern Han. The issuing of coinage remained a central government monopoly throughout the rest of the Han dynasty.The government monopolies were eventually repealed when a political faction known as the Reformists gained greater influence in the court. The Reformists opposed the Modernist faction that had dominated court politics in Emperor Wu's reign and during the subsequent regency of Huo Guang (d. 68 BC). The Modernists argued for an aggressive and expansionary foreign policy supported by revenues from heavy government intervention in the private economy. The Reformists, however, overturned these policies, favoring a cautious, non-expansionary approach to foreign policy, frugal budget reform, and lower tax-rates imposed on private entrepreneurs.\n\n\n=== Wang Mang's reign and civil war ===\n\nWang Zhengjun (71 BC\u201313 AD) was first empress, then empress dowager, and finally grand empress dowager during the reigns of the Emperors Yuan (r. 49\u201333 BC), Cheng (r. 33\u20137 BC), and Ai (r. 7\u20131 BC), respectively. During this time, a succession of her male relatives held the title of regent. Following the death of Ai, Wang Zhengjun's nephew Wang Mang (45 BC\u201323 AD) was appointed regent as Marshall of State on 16 August under Emperor Ping (r. 1 BC\u20136 AD).When Ping died on 3 February 6 AD, Ruzi Ying (d. 25 AD) was chosen as the heir and Wang Mang was appointed to serve as acting emperor for the child. Wang promised to relinquish his control to Liu Ying once he came of age. Despite this promise, and against protest and revolts from the nobility, Wang Mang claimed on 10 January that the divine Mandate of Heaven called for the end of the Han dynasty and the beginning of his own: the Xin dynasty (9\u201323 AD).Wang Mang initiated a series of major reforms that were ultimately unsuccessful. These reforms included outlawing slavery, nationalizing land to equally distribute between households, and introducing new currencies, a change which debased the value of coinage. Although these reforms provoked considerable opposition, Wang's regime met its ultimate downfall with the massive floods of c. 3 AD and 11 AD. Gradual silt buildup in the Yellow River had raised its water level and overwhelmed the flood control works. The Yellow River split into two new branches: one emptying to the north and the other to the south of the Shandong Peninsula, though Han engineers managed to dam the southern branch by 70 AD.The flood dislodged thousands of peasant farmers, many of whom joined roving bandit and rebel groups such as the Red Eyebrows to survive. Wang Mang's armies were incapable of quelling these enlarged rebel groups. Eventually, an insurgent mob forced their way into the Weiyang Palace and killed Wang Mang.\n\nThe Gengshi Emperor (r. 23\u201325 AD), a descendant of Emperor Jing (r. 157\u2013141 BC), attempted to restore the Han dynasty and occupied Chang'an as his capital. However, he was overwhelmed by the Red Eyebrow rebels who deposed, assassinated, and replaced him with the puppet monarch Liu Penzi. Gengshi's distant cousin Liu Xiu, known posthumously as Emperor Guangwu (r. 25\u201357 AD), after distinguishing himself at the Battle of Kunyang in 23 AD, was urged to succeed Gengshi as emperor.Under Guangwu's rule the Han Empire was restored. Guangwu made Luoyang his capital in 25 AD, and by 27 AD his officers Deng Yu and Feng Yi had forced the Red Eyebrows to surrender and executed their leaders for treason. From 26 until 36 AD, Emperor Guangwu had to wage war against other regional warlords who claimed the title of emperor; when these warlords were defeated, China reunified under the Han.The period between the foundation of the Han dynasty and Wang Mang's reign is known as the Western Han (traditional Chinese: \u897f\u6f22; simplified Chinese: \u897f\u6c49; pinyin: X\u012bh\u00e0n) or Former Han (traditional Chinese: \u524d\u6f22; simplified Chinese: \u524d\u6c49; pinyin: Qi\u00e1nh\u00e0n) (206 BC\u20139 AD). During this period the capital was at Chang'an (modern Xi'an). From the reign of Guangwu the capital was moved eastward to Luoyang. The era from his reign until the fall of Han is known as the Eastern Han or Later Han (25\u2013220 AD).\n\n\n=== Eastern Han ===\n\nThe Eastern Han (traditional Chinese: \u6771\u6f22; simplified Chinese: \u4e1c\u6c49; pinyin: D\u014dngh\u00e0n), also known as the Later Han (traditional Chinese: \u5f8c\u6f22; simplified Chinese: \u540e\u6c49; pinyin: H\u00f2uh\u00e0n), formally began on 5 August 25, when Liu Xiu became Emperor Guangwu of Han. During the widespread rebellion against Wang Mang, the state of Goguryeo was free to raid Han's Korean commanderies; Han did not reaffirm its control over the region until AD 30.The Tr\u01b0ng Sisters of Vietnam rebelled against Han in AD 40. Their rebellion was crushed by Han general Ma Yuan (d. AD 49) in a campaign from AD 42\u201343. Wang Mang renewed hostilities against the Xiongnu, who were estranged from Han until their leader Bi (\u6bd4), a rival claimant to the throne against his cousin Punu (\u84b2\u5974), submitted to Han as a tributary vassal in AD 50. This created two rival Xiongnu states: the Southern Xiongnu led by Bi, an ally of Han, and the Northern Xiongnu led by Punu, an enemy of Han.During the turbulent reign of Wang Mang, China lost control over the Tarim Basin, which was conquered by the Northern Xiongnu in AD 63 and used as a base to invade the Hexi Corridor in Gansu. Dou Gu (d. 88 AD) defeated the Northern Xiongnu at the Battle of Yiwulu in AD 73, evicting them from Turpan and chasing them as far as Lake Barkol before establishing a garrison at Hami. After the new Protector General of the Western Regions Chen Mu (d. AD 75) was killed by allies of the Xiongnu in Karasahr and Kucha, the garrison at Hami was withdrawn.At the Battle of Ikh Bayan in AD 89, Dou Xian (d. AD 92) defeated the Northern Xiongnu chanyu who then retreated into the Altai Mountains. After the Northern Xiongnu fled into the Ili River valley in AD 91, the nomadic Xianbei occupied the area from the borders of the Buyeo Kingdom in Manchuria to the Ili River of the Wusun people. The Xianbei reached their apogee under Tanshihuai (\u6a80\u77f3\u69d0) (d. AD 180), who consistently defeated Chinese armies. However, Tanshihuai's confederation disintegrated after his death.Ban Chao (d. AD 102) enlisted the aid of the Kushan Empire, occupying the area of modern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan, to subdue Kashgar and its ally Sogdiana. When a request by Kushan ruler Vima Kadphises (r. c. 90\u2013c. 100 AD) for a marriage alliance with the Han was rejected in AD 90, he sent his forces to Wakhan (Afghanistan) to attack Ban Chao. The conflict ended with the Kushans withdrawing because of lack of supplies. In AD 91, the office of Protector General of the Western Regions was reinstated when it was bestowed on Ban Chao.\n\nForeign travelers to Eastern-Han China include Buddhist monks who translated works into Chinese, such as An Shigao from Parthia, and Lokaksema from Kushan-era Gandhara, India. In addition to tributary relations with the Kushans, the Han Empire received gifts from the Parthian Empire, from a king in modern Burma, from a ruler in Japan, and initiated an unsuccessful mission to Daqin (Rome) in AD 97 with Gan Ying as emissary.A Roman embassy of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (r. 161\u2013180 AD) is recorded in the Weil\u00fce and Hou Hanshu to have reached the court of Emperor Huan of Han (r. AD 146\u2013168) in AD 166, yet Rafe de Crespigny asserts that this was most likely a group of Roman merchants. In addition to Roman glasswares and coins found in China, Roman medallions from the reign of Antoninus Pius and his adopted son Marcus Aurelius have been found at \u00d3c Eo in Vietnam. This was near the commandery of Rinan (also Jiaozhi) where Chinese sources claim the Romans first landed, as well as embassies from Tianzhu (in northern India) in the years 159 and 161. \u00d3c Eo is also thought to be the port city \"Cattigara\" described by Ptolemy in his Geography (c. 150 AD) as lying east of the Golden Chersonese (Malay Peninsula) along the Magnus Sinus (i.e. Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea), where a Greek sailor had visited.\n\nEmperor Zhang's (r. 75\u201388 AD) reign came to be viewed by later Eastern Han scholars as the high point of the dynastic house. Subsequent reigns were increasingly marked by eunuch intervention in court politics and their involvement in the violent power struggles of the imperial consort clans. In 92 AD, with the aid of the eunuch Zheng Zhong (d. 107 AD), Emperor He (r. 88\u2013105 AD) had Empress Dowager Dou (d. 97 AD) put under house arrest and her clan stripped of power. This was in revenge for Dou's purging of the clan of his natural mother\u2014Consort Liang\u2014and then concealing her identity from him. After Emperor He's death, his wife Empress Deng Sui (d. 121 AD) managed state affairs as the regent empress dowager during a turbulent financial crisis and widespread Qiang rebellion that lasted from 107 to 118 AD.When Empress Dowager Deng died, Emperor An (r. 106\u2013125 AD) was convinced by the accusations of the eunuchs Li Run (\u674e\u958f) and Jiang Jing (\u6c5f\u4eac) that Deng and her family had planned to depose him. An dismissed Deng's clan members from office, exiled them and forced many to commit suicide. After An's death, his wife, Empress Dowager Yan (d. 126 AD) placed the child Marquess of Beixiang on the throne in an attempt to retain power within her family. However, palace eunuch Sun Cheng (d. 132 AD) masterminded a successful overthrow of her regime to enthrone Emperor Shun of Han (r. 125\u2013144 AD). Yan was placed under house arrest, her relatives were either killed or exiled, and her eunuch allies were slaughtered. The regent Liang Ji (d. 159 AD), brother of Empress Liang Na (d. 150 AD), had the brother-in-law of Consort Deng Mengn\u00fc (later empress) (d. 165 AD) killed after Deng Mengn\u00fc resisted Liang Ji's attempts to control her. Afterward, Emperor Huan employed eunuchs to depose Liang Ji, who was then forced to commit suicide.\n\nStudents from the Imperial University organized a widespread student protest against the eunuchs of Emperor Huan's court. Huan further alienated the bureaucracy when he initiated grandiose construction projects and hosted thousands of concubines in his harem at a time of economic crisis. Palace eunuchs imprisoned the official Li Ying (\u674e\u81ba) and his associates from the Imperial University on a dubious charge of treason. In 167 AD, the Grand Commandant Dou Wu (d. 168 AD) convinced his son-in-law, Emperor Huan, to release them. However the emperor permanently barred Li Ying and his associates from serving in office, marking the beginning of the Partisan Prohibitions.Following Huan's death, Dou Wu and the Grand Tutor Chen Fan (d. 168 AD) attempted a coup d'\u00e9tat against the eunuchs Hou Lan (d. 172 AD), Cao Jie (d. 181 AD), and Wang Fu (\u738b\u752b). When the plot was uncovered, the eunuchs arrested Empress Dowager Dou (d. 172 AD) and Chen Fan. General Zhang Huan (\u5f35\u5950) favored the eunuchs. He and his troops confronted Dou Wu and his retainers at the palace gate where each side shouted accusations of treason against the other. When the retainers gradually deserted Dou Wu, he was forced to commit suicide.Under Emperor Ling (r. 168\u2013189 AD) the eunuchs had the partisan prohibitions renewed and expanded, while also auctioning off top government offices. Many affairs of state were entrusted to the eunuchs Zhao Zhong (d. 189 AD) and Zhang Rang (d. 189 AD) while Emperor Ling spent much of his time roleplaying with concubines and participating in military parades.\n\n\n=== End of the Han dynasty ===\n\nThe Partisan Prohibitions were repealed during the Yellow Turban Rebellion and Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion in 184 AD, largely because the court did not want to continue to alienate a significant portion of the gentry class who might otherwise join the rebellions. The Yellow Turbans and Five-Pecks-of-Rice adherents belonged to two different hierarchical Daoist religious societies led by faith healers Zhang Jue (d. 184 AD) and Zhang Lu (d. 216 AD), respectively. \nZhang Lu's rebellion, in modern northern Sichuan and southern Shaanxi, was not quelled until 215 AD. Zhang Jue's massive rebellion across eight provinces was annihilated by Han forces within a year, however the following decades saw much smaller recurrent uprisings. Although the Yellow Turbans were defeated, many generals appointed during the crisis never disbanded their assembled militia forces and used these troops to amass power outside of the collapsing imperial authority.General-in-Chief He Jin (d. 189 AD), half-brother to Empress He (d. 189 AD), plotted with Yuan Shao (d. 202 AD) to overthrow the eunuchs by having several generals march to the outskirts of the capital. There, in a written petition to Empress He, they demanded the eunuchs' execution. After a period of hesitation, Empress He consented. When the eunuchs discovered this, however, they had her brother He Miao (\u4f55\u82d7) rescind the order. The eunuchs assassinated He Jin on September 22, 189 AD. \nYuan Shao then besieged Luoyang's Northern Palace while his brother Yuan Shu (d. 199 AD) besieged the Southern Palace. On September 25 both palaces were breached and approximately two thousand eunuchs were killed. Zhang Rang had previously fled with Emperor Shao (r. 189 AD) and his brother Liu Xie\u2014the future Emperor Xian of Han (r. 189\u2013220 AD). While being pursued by the Yuan brothers, Zhang committed suicide by jumping into the Yellow River.\n\nGeneral Dong Zhuo (d. 192 AD) found the young emperor and his brother wandering in the countryside. He escorted them safely back to the capital and was made Minister of Works, taking control of Luoyang and forcing Yuan Shao to flee. After Dong Zhuo demoted Emperor Shao and promoted his brother Liu Xie as Emperor Xian, Yuan Shao led a coalition of former officials and officers against Dong, who burned Luoyang to the ground and resettled the court at Chang'an in May 191 AD. Dong Zhuo later poisoned Emperor Shao.Dong was killed by his adopted son L\u00fc Bu (d. 198 AD) in a plot hatched by Wang Yun (d. 192 AD). Emperor Xian fled from Chang'an in 195 AD to the ruins of Luoyang. Xian was persuaded by Cao Cao (155\u2013220 AD), then Governor of Yan Province in modern western Shandong and eastern Henan, to move the capital to Xuchang in 196 AD.Yuan Shao challenged Cao Cao for control over the emperor. Yuan's power was greatly diminished after Cao defeated him at the Battle of Guandu in 200 AD. After Yuan died, Cao killed Yuan Shao's son Yuan Tan (173\u2013205 AD), who had fought with his brothers over the family inheritance. His brothers Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi were killed in 207 AD by Gongsun Kang (d. 221 AD), who sent their heads to Cao Cao.After Cao's defeat at the naval Battle of Red Cliffs in 208 AD, China was divided into three spheres of influence, with Cao Cao dominating the north, Sun Quan (182\u2013252 AD) dominating the south, and Liu Bei (161\u2013223 AD) dominating the west. Cao Cao died in March 220 AD. By December his son Cao Pi (187\u2013226 AD) had Emperor Xian relinquish the throne to him and is known posthumously as Emperor Wen of Wei. This formally ended the Han dynasty and initiated an age of conflict between three states: Cao Wei, Eastern Wu, and Shu Han.\n\n\n== Culture and society ==\n\n\n=== Social class ===\n\nIn the hierarchical social order, the emperor was at the apex of Han society and government. However the emperor was often a minor, ruled over by a regent such as the empress dowager or one of her male relatives. Ranked immediately below the emperor were the kings who were of the same Liu family clan. The rest of society, including nobles lower than kings and all commoners excluding slaves belonged to one of twenty ranks (ershi gongcheng \u4e8c\u5341\u516c\u4e58).\nEach successive rank gave its holder greater pensions and legal privileges. The highest rank, of full marquess, came with a state pension and a territorial fiefdom. Holders of the rank immediately below, that of ordinary marquess, received a pension, but had no territorial rule. Officials who served in government belonged to the wider commoner social class and were ranked just below nobles in social prestige. The highest government officials could be enfeoffed as marquesses.By the Eastern Han period, local elites of unattached scholars, teachers, students, and government officials began to identify themselves as members of a larger, nationwide gentry class with shared values and a commitment to mainstream scholarship. When the government became noticeably corrupt in mid-to-late Eastern Han, many gentrymen even considered the cultivation of morally grounded personal relationships more important than serving in public office.The farmer, or specifically the small landowner-cultivator, was ranked just below scholars and officials in the social hierarchy. Other agricultural cultivators were of a lower status, such as tenants, wage laborers, and in rare cases slaves. Artisans, technicians, tradespeople and craftsmen had a legal and socioeconomic status between that of owner-cultivator farmers and common merchants.State-registered merchants, who were forced by law to wear white-colored clothes and pay high commercial taxes, were considered by the gentry as social parasites with a contemptible status. These were often petty shopkeepers of urban marketplaces; merchants such as industrialists and itinerant traders working between a network of cities could avoid registering as merchants and were often wealthier and more powerful than the vast majority of government officials.Wealthy landowners, such as nobles and officials, often provided lodging for retainers who provided valuable work or duties, sometimes including fighting bandits or riding into battle. Unlike slaves, retainers could come and go from their master's home as they pleased. Medical physicians, pig breeders, and butchers had a fairly high social status, while occultist diviners, runners, and messengers had low status.\n\n\n=== Marriage, gender, and kinship ===\n\nThe Han-era family was patrilineal and typically had four to five nuclear family members living in one household. Multiple generations of extended family members did not occupy the same house, unlike families of later dynasties. According to Confucian family norms, various family members were treated with different levels of respect and intimacy. For example, there were different accepted time frames for mourning the death of a father versus a paternal uncle.Marriages were highly ritualized, particularly for the wealthy, and included many important steps. The giving of betrothal gifts, known as bridewealth and dowry, were especially important. A lack of either was considered dishonorable and the woman would have been seen not as a wife, but as a concubine. Arranged marriages were normal, with the father's input on his offspring's spouse being considered more important than the mother's.Monogamous marriages were also normal, although nobles and high officials were wealthy enough to afford and support concubines as additional lovers. Under certain conditions dictated by custom, not law, both men and women were able to divorce their spouses and remarry. However, a woman who had been widowed continued to belong to her husband's family after his death. In order to remarry, the widow would have to be returned to her family in exchange for a ransom fee. Her children would not be allowed to go with her.\n\nApart from the passing of noble titles or ranks, inheritance practices did not involve primogeniture; each son received an equal share of the family property. Unlike the practice in later dynasties, the father usually sent his adult married sons away with their portions of the family fortune. Daughters received a portion of the family fortune through their marriage dowries, though this was usually much less than the shares of sons. A different distribution of the remainder could be specified in a will, but it is unclear how common this was.Women were expected to obey the will of their father, then their husband, and then their adult son in old age. However, it is known from contemporary sources that there were many deviations to this rule, especially in regard to mothers over their sons, and empresses who ordered around and openly humiliated their fathers and brothers. Women were exempt from the annual corv\u00e9e labor duties, but often engaged in a range of income-earning occupations aside from their domestic chores of cooking and cleaning.The most common occupation for women was weaving clothes for the family, sale at market or for large textile enterprises that employed hundreds of women. Other women helped on their brothers' farms or became singers, dancers, sorceresses, respected medical physicians, and successful merchants who could afford their own silk clothes. Some women formed spinning collectives, aggregating the resources of several different families.\n\n\n=== Education, literature, and philosophy ===\n\nThe early Western Han court simultaneously accepted the philosophical teachings of Legalism, Huang-Lao Daoism, and Confucianism in making state decisions and shaping government policy. However, the Han court under Emperor Wu gave Confucianism exclusive patronage. He abolished all academic chairs or erudites (b\u00f3sh\u00ec \u535a\u58eb) not dealing with the Confucian Five Classics in 136 BC and encouraged nominees for office to receive a Confucian-based education at the Imperial University that he established in 124 BC.Unlike the original ideology espoused by Confucius, or Kongzi (551\u2013479 BC), Han Confucianism in Emperor Wu's reign was the creation of Dong Zhongshu (179\u2013104 BC). Dong was a scholar and minor official who aggregated the ethical Confucian ideas of ritual, filial piety, and harmonious relationships with five phases and yin-yang cosmologies. Much to the interest of the ruler, Dong's synthesis justified the imperial system of government within the natural order of the universe.The Imperial University grew in importance as the student body grew to over 30,000 by the 2nd century AD. A Confucian-based education was also made available at commandery-level schools and private schools opened in small towns, where teachers earned respectable incomes from tuition payments.\n\nSome important texts were created and studied by scholars. Philosophical works written by Yang Xiong (53 BC\u201318 AD), Huan Tan (43 BC\u201328 AD), Wang Chong (27\u2013100 AD), and Wang Fu (78\u2013163 AD) questioned whether human nature was innately good or evil and posed challenges to Dong's universal order. The Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Tan (d. 110 BC) and his son Sima Qian (145\u201386 BC) established the standard model for all of imperial China's Standard Histories, such as the Book of Han written by Ban Biao (3\u201354 AD), his son Ban Gu (32\u201392 AD), and his daughter Ban Zhao (45\u2013116 AD). There were dictionaries such as the Shuowen Jiezi by Xu Shen (c. 58\u2013c. 147 AD) and the Fangyan by Yang Xiong.Biographies on important figures were written by various gentrymen. Han dynasty poetry was dominated by the fu genre, which achieved its greatest prominence during the reign of Emperor Wu.\n\n\n=== Law and order ===\nHan scholars such as Jia Yi (201\u2013169 BC) portrayed the previous Qin dynasty as a brutal regime. However, archaeological evidence from Zhangjiashan and Shuihudi reveal that many of the statutes in the Han law code compiled by Chancellor Xiao He (d. 193 BC) were derived from Qin law.Various cases for rape, physical abuse and murder were prosecuted in court. Women, although usually having fewer rights by custom, were allowed to level civil and criminal charges against men. While suspects were jailed, convicted criminals were never imprisoned. Instead, punishments were commonly monetary fines, periods of forced hard labor for convicts, and the penalty of death by beheading. Early Han punishments of torturous mutilation were borrowed from Qin law. A series of reforms abolished mutilation punishments with progressively less-severe beatings by the bastinado.Acting as a judge in lawsuits was one of many duties of the county magistrate and Administrators of commanderies. Complex, high-profile or unresolved cases were often deferred to the Minister of Justice in the capital or even the emperor. In each Han county was several districts, each overseen by a chief of police. Order in the cities was maintained by government officers in the marketplaces and constables in the neighborhoods.\n\n\n=== Food ===\nThe most common staple crops consumed during Han were wheat, barley, foxtail millet, proso millet, rice, and beans. Commonly eaten fruits and vegetables included chestnuts, pears, plums, peaches, melons, apricots, strawberries, red bayberries, jujubes, calabash, bamboo shoots, mustard plant and taro. Domesticated animals that were also eaten included chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, cows, sheep, pigs, camels and dogs (various types were bred specifically for food, while most were used as pets). Turtles and fish were taken from streams and lakes. Commonly hunted game, such as owl, pheasant, magpie, sika deer, and Chinese bamboo partridge were consumed. Seasonings included sugar, honey, salt and soy sauce. Beer and wine were regularly consumed.\n\n\n=== Clothing ===\n\nThe types of clothing worn and the materials used during the Han period depended upon social class. Wealthy folk could afford silk robes, skirts, socks, and mittens, coats made of badger or fox fur, duck plumes, and slippers with inlaid leather, pearls, and silk lining. Peasants commonly wore clothes made of hemp, wool, and ferret skins.\n\n\n=== Religion, cosmology, and metaphysics ===\n\nFamilies throughout Han China made ritual sacrifices of animals and food to deities, spirits, and ancestors at temples and shrines. They believed that these items could be utilized by those in the spiritual realm. It was thought that each person had a two-part soul: the spirit-soul (hun \u9b42) which journeyed to the afterlife paradise of immortals (xian), and the body-soul (po \u9b44) which remained in its grave or tomb on earth and was only reunited with the spirit-soul through a ritual ceremony.In addition to his many other roles, the emperor acted as the highest priest in the land who made sacrifices to Heaven, the main deities known as the Five Powers, and the spirits (shen \u795e) of mountains and rivers. It was believed that the three realms of Heaven, Earth, and Mankind were linked by natural cycles of yin and yang and the five phases. If the emperor did not behave according to proper ritual, ethics, and morals, he could disrupt the fine balance of these cosmological cycles and cause calamities such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, epidemics, and swarms of locusts.\n\nIt was believed that immortality could be achieved if one reached the lands of the Queen Mother of the West or Mount Penglai. Han-era Daoists assembled into small groups of hermits who attempted to achieve immortality through breathing exercises, sexual techniques and use of medical elixirs.By the 2nd century AD, Daoists formed large hierarchical religious societies such as the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice. Its followers believed that the sage-philosopher Laozi (fl. 6th century BC) was a holy prophet who would offer salvation and good health if his devout followers would confess their sins, ban the worship of unclean gods who accepted meat sacrifices and chant sections of the Daodejing.Buddhism first entered China during the Eastern Han and was first mentioned in 65 AD. Liu Ying (d. 71 AD), a half-brother to Emperor Ming of Han (r. 57\u201375 AD), was one of its earliest Chinese adherents, although Chinese Buddhism at this point was heavily associated with Huang-Lao Daoism. China's first known Buddhist temple, the White Horse Temple, was constructed outside the wall of the capital, Luoyang, during Emperor Ming's reign. Important Buddhist canons were translated into Chinese during the 2nd century AD, including the Sutra of Forty-two Chapters, Perfection of Wisdom, Shurangama Sutra, and Pratyutpanna Sutra.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\n\n=== Central government ===\n\nIn Han government, the emperor was the supreme judge and lawgiver, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and sole designator of official nominees appointed to the top posts in central and local administrations; those who earned a 600-bushel salary-rank or higher. Theoretically, there were no limits to his power. \nHowever, state organs with competing interests and institutions such as the court conference (tingyi \u5ef7\u8b70)\u2014where ministers were convened to reach majority consensus on an issue\u2014pressured the emperor to accept the advice of his ministers on policy decisions. If the emperor rejected a court conference decision, he risked alienating his high ministers. Nevertheless, emperors sometimes did reject the majority opinion reached at court conferences.Below the emperor were his cabinet members known as the Three Councillors of State (San gong \u4e09\u516c). These were the Chancellor or Minister over the Masses (Chengxiang \u4e1e\u76f8 or Da situ \u5927\u53f8\u5f92), the Imperial Counselor or Excellency of Works (Yushi dafu \u5fa1\u53f2\u5927\u592b or Da sikong \u5927\u53f8\u7a7a), and Grand Commandant or Grand Marshal (Taiwei \u592a\u5c09 or Da sima \u5927\u53f8\u99ac).The Chancellor, whose title was changed to 'Minister over the Masses' in 8 BC, was chiefly responsible for drafting the government budget. The Chancellor's other duties included managing provincial registers for land and population, leading court conferences, acting as judge in lawsuits and recommending nominees for high office. He could appoint officials below the salary-rank of 600 bushels.The Imperial Counselor's chief duty was to conduct disciplinary procedures for officials. He shared similar duties with the Chancellor, such as receiving annual provincial reports. However, when his title was changed to Minister of Works in 8 BC, his chief duty became oversight of public works projects.\n\nThe Grand Commandant, whose title was changed to Grand Marshal in 119 BC before reverting to Grand Commandant in 51 AD, was the irregularly posted commander of the military and then regent during the Western Han period. In the Eastern Han era he was chiefly a civil official who shared many of the same censorial powers as the other two Councillors of State.Ranked below the Three Councillors of State were the Nine Ministers (Jiu qing \u4e5d\u537f), who each headed a specialized ministry. The Minister of Ceremonies (Taichang \u592a\u5e38) was the chief official in charge of religious rites, rituals, prayers and the maintenance of ancestral temples and altars. The Minister of the Household (Guang lu xun \u5149\u797f\u52f3) was in charge of the emperor's security within the palace grounds, external imperial parks and wherever the emperor made an outing by chariot.The Minister of the Guards (Weiwei \u885b\u5c09) was responsible for securing and patrolling the walls, towers, and gates of the imperial palaces. The Minister Coachman (Taipu \u592a\u50d5) was responsible for the maintenance of imperial stables, horses, carriages and coach-houses for the emperor and his palace attendants, as well as the supply of horses for the armed forces. The Minister of Justice (Tingwei \u5ef7\u5c09) was the chief official in charge of upholding, administering, and interpreting the law. The Minister Herald (Da honglu \u5927\u9d3b\u81da) was the chief official in charge of receiving honored guests at the imperial court, such as nobles and foreign ambassadors.The Minister of the Imperial Clan (Zongzheng \u5b97\u6b63) oversaw the imperial court's interactions with the empire's nobility and extended imperial family, such as granting fiefs and titles. The Minister of Finance (Da sinong \u5927\u53f8\u8fb2) was the treasurer for the official bureaucracy and the armed forces who handled tax revenues and set standards for units of measurement. The Minister Steward (Shaofu \u5c11\u5e9c) served the emperor exclusively, providing him with entertainment and amusements, proper food and clothing, medicine and physical care, valuables and equipment.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nIn the Han dynasty, excluding kingdoms and marquessates, was divided, in descending order of size, into political units of provinces (zhou), commanderies (jun), and counties (xian). A county was divided into several districts, the latter composed of a group of hamlets, each containing about a hundred families.The heads of provinces, whose official title was changed from Inspector to Governor and vice versa several times during Han, were responsible for inspecting several commandery-level and kingdom-level administrations. On the basis of their reports, the officials in these local administrations would be promoted, demoted, dismissed or prosecuted by the imperial court.A governor could take various actions without permission from the imperial court. The lower-ranked inspector had executive powers only during times of crisis, such as raising militias across the commanderies under his jurisdiction to suppress a rebellion.A commandery consisted of a group of counties, and was headed by an Administrator. He was the top civil and military leader of the commandery and handled defense, lawsuits, seasonal instructions to farmers and recommendations of nominees for office sent annually to the capital in a quota system first established by Emperor Wu. The head of a large county of about 10,000 households was called a Prefect, while the heads of smaller counties were called Chiefs, and both could be referred to as Magistrates. A Magistrate maintained law and order in his county, registered the populace for taxation, mobilized commoners for annual corv\u00e9e duties, repaired schools and supervised public works.\n\n\n=== Kingdoms and marquessates ===\n\nKingdoms\u2014roughly the size of commanderies\u2014were ruled exclusively by the emperor's male relatives as semi-autonomous fiefdoms. Before 157 BC some kingdoms were ruled by non-relatives, granted to them in return for their services to Emperor Gaozu. The administration of each kingdom was very similar to that of the central government. Although the emperor appointed the Chancellor of each kingdom, kings appointed all the remaining civil officials in their fiefs.However, in 145 BC, after several insurrections by the kings, Emperor Jing removed the kings' rights to appoint officials whose salaries were higher than 400 bushels. The Imperial Counselors and Nine Ministers (excluding the Minister Coachman) of every kingdom were abolished, although the Chancellor was still appointed by the central government.With these reforms, kings were reduced to being nominal heads of their fiefs, gaining a personal income from only a portion of the taxes collected in their kingdom. Similarly, the officials in the administrative staff of a full marquess's fief were appointed by the central government. A marquess's Chancellor was ranked as the equivalent of a county Prefect. Like a king, the marquess collected a portion of the tax revenues in his fief as personal income.\n\nUp until the reign of Emperor Jing of Han, the Emperors of the Han had great difficulty bringing the vassal kings under control, as kings often switched their allegiance to the Xiongnu Chanyu whenever threatened by Imperial attempts to centralize power. Within the seven years of Han Gaozu's reign, three vassal kings and one marquess either defected to or allied with  the Xiongnu. Even imperial princes in control of fiefdoms would sometimes invite the Xiongnu to invade in response to threats by the Emperor to remove their power. The Han emperors moved to secure a treaty with the Chanyu to demarcate authority between them, recognizing each other as the \"two masters\" (\u5169\u4e3b), the sole representatives of their respective peoples, cemented with a marriage alliance (heqin), before eliminating the rebellious vassal kings in 154 BC. This prompted some vassal kings of the Xiongnu to switch their allegiance to the Han emperor from 147 BC. Han court officals were initially hostile to the idea of disrupting the status quo and expanding into the Xiongnu steppe territory. The surrendered Xiongnu were integrated into a parallel military and political structure under the Han Emperor, and opened the avenue for the Han dynasty to challenge the Xiongnu cavalry on the steppe. This also introduced the Han to the interstate networks in the Tarim Basin (Xinjiang), allowing for the expansion of the Han dynasty from a limited regional state to a universalist and cosmopolitan empire through further marriage alliances with another steppe power, the Wusun.\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nAt the beginning of the Han dynasty, every male commoner aged twenty-three was liable for conscription into the military. The minimum age for the military draft was reduced to twenty after Emperor Zhao's (r. 87\u201374 BC) reign. Conscripted soldiers underwent one year of training and one year of service as non-professional soldiers. The year of training was served in one of three branches of the armed forces: infantry, cavalry or navy. The year of active service was served either on the frontier, in a king's court or under the Minister of the Guards in the capital. A small professional (paid) standing army was stationed near the capital.During the Eastern Han, conscription could be avoided if one paid a commutable tax. The Eastern Han court favored the recruitment of a volunteer army. The volunteer army comprised the Southern Army (Nanjun \u5357\u8ecd), while the standing army stationed in and near the capital was the Northern Army (Beijun \u5317\u8ecd). Led by Colonels (Xiaowei \u6821\u5c09), the Northern Army consisted of five regiments, each composed of several thousand soldiers. When central authority collapsed after 189 AD, wealthy landowners, members of the aristocracy/nobility, and regional military-governors relied upon their retainers to act as their own personal troops (buqu \u90e8\u66f2).During times of war, the volunteer army was increased, and a much larger militia was raised across the country to supplement the Northern Army. In these circumstances, a General (Jiangjun \u5c07\u8ecd) led a division, which was divided into regiments led by Colonels and sometimes Majors (Sima \u53f8\u99ac). Regiments were divided into companies and led by Captains. Platoons were the smallest units of soldiers.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Currency ===\n\nThe Han dynasty inherited the ban liang coin type from the Qin. In the beginning of the Han, Emperor Gaozu closed the government mint in favor of private minting of coins. This decision was reversed in 186 BC by his widow Grand Empress Dowager L\u00fc Zhi (d. 180 BC), who abolished private minting. In 182 BC, L\u00fc Zhi issued a bronze coin that was much lighter in weight than previous coins. This caused widespread inflation that was not reduced until 175 BC when Emperor Wen allowed private minters to manufacture coins that were precisely 2.6 g (0.09 oz) in weight.In 144 BC Emperor Jing abolished private minting in favor of central-government and commandery-level minting; he also introduced a new coin. Emperor Wu introduced another in 120 BC, but a year later he abandoned the ban liangs entirely in favor of the wuzhu (\u4e94\u9296) coin, weighing 3.2 g (0.11 oz). The wuzhu became China's standard coin until the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907 AD). Its use was interrupted briefly by several new currencies introduced during Wang Mang's regime until it was reinstated in 40 AD by Emperor Guangwu.Since commandery-issued coins were often of inferior quality and lighter weight, the central government closed commandery mints and monopolized the issue of coinage in 113 BC. This Central government issuance of coinage was overseen by the Superintendent of Waterways and Parks, this duty being transferred to the Minister of Finance during Eastern Han.\n\n\n=== Taxation and property ===\nAside from the landowner's land tax paid in a portion of their crop yield, the poll tax and property taxes were paid in coin cash. The annual poll tax rate for adult men and women was 120 coins and 20 coins for minors. Merchants were required to pay a higher rate of 240 coins. The poll tax stimulated a money economy that necessitated the minting of over 28,000,000,000 coins from 118 BC to 5 AD, an average of 220,000,000 coins a year.\n\nThe widespread circulation of coin cash allowed successful merchants to invest money in land, empowering the very social class the government attempted to suppress through heavy commercial and property taxes. Emperor Wu even enacted laws which banned registered merchants from owning land, yet powerful merchants were able to avoid registration and own large tracts of land.The small landowner-cultivators formed the majority of the Han tax base; this revenue was threatened during the latter half of Eastern Han when many peasants fell into debt and were forced to work as farming tenants for wealthy landlords. The Han government enacted reforms in order to keep small landowner-cultivators out of debt and on their own farms. These reforms included reducing taxes, temporary remissions of taxes, granting loans and providing landless peasants temporary lodging and work in agricultural colonies until they could recover from their debts.In 168 BC, the land tax rate was reduced from one-fifteenth of a farming household's crop yield to one-thirtieth, and later to a one-hundredth of a crop yield for the last decades of the dynasty. The consequent loss of government revenue was compensated for by increasing property taxes.The labor tax took the form of conscripted labor for one month per year, which was imposed upon male commoners aged fifteen to fifty-six. This could be avoided in Eastern Han with a commutable tax, since hired labor became more popular.\n\n\n=== Private manufacture and government monopolies ===\n\nIn the early Western Han, a wealthy salt or iron industrialist, whether a semi-autonomous king or wealthy merchant, could boast funds that rivaled the imperial treasury and amass a peasant workforce of over a thousand. This kept many peasants away from their farms and denied the government a significant portion of its land tax revenue. To eliminate the influence of such private entrepreneurs, Emperor Wu nationalized the salt and iron industries in 117 BC and allowed many of the former industrialists to become officials administering the state monopolies. By Eastern Han times, the central government monopolies were repealed in favor of production by commandery and county administrations, as well as private businessmen.Liquor was another profitable private industry nationalized by the central government in 98 BC. However, this was repealed in 81 BC and a property tax rate of two coins for every 0.2 L (0.05 gallons) was levied for those who traded it privately. By 110 BC Emperor Wu also interfered with the profitable trade in grain when he eliminated speculation by selling government-stored grain at a lower price than demanded by merchants. Apart from Emperor Ming's creation of a short-lived Office for Price Adjustment and Stabilization, which was abolished in 68 AD, central-government price control regulations were largely absent during the Eastern Han.\n\n\n== Science and technology ==\n\nThe Han dynasty was a unique period in the development of premodern Chinese science and technology, comparable to the level of scientific and technological growth during the Song dynasty (960\u20131279).\n\n\n=== Writing materials ===\nIn the 1st millennium BC, typical ancient Chinese writing materials were bronzewares, animal bones, and bamboo slips or wooden boards. By the beginning of the Han dynasty, the chief writing materials were clay tablets, silk cloth, hemp paper, and rolled scrolls made from bamboo strips sewn together with hempen string; these were passed through drilled holes and secured with clay stamps.The oldest known Chinese piece of hempen paper dates to the 2nd century BC. The standard papermaking process was invented by Cai Lun (AD 50\u2013121) in 105. The oldest known surviving piece of paper with writing on it was found in the ruins of a Han watchtower that had been abandoned in AD 110, in Inner Mongolia.\n\n\n=== Metallurgy and agriculture ===\nEvidence suggests that blast furnaces, that convert raw iron ore into pig iron, which can be remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron by means of a cold blast and hot blast, were operational in China by the late Spring and Autumn period (722\u2013481 BC). The bloomery was nonexistent in ancient China; however, the Han-era Chinese produced wrought iron by injecting excess oxygen into a furnace and causing decarburization. Cast iron and pig iron could be converted into wrought iron and steel using a fining process.\n\nThe Han dynasty Chinese used bronze and iron to make a range of weapons, culinary tools, carpenters' tools and domestic wares. A significant product of these improved iron-smelting techniques was the manufacture of new agricultural tools. The three-legged iron seed drill, invented by the 2nd century BC, enabled farmers to carefully plant crops in rows instead of casting seeds out by hand. The heavy moldboard iron plow, also invented during the Han dynasty, required only one man to control it, two oxen to pull it. It had three plowshares, a seed box for the drills, a tool which turned down the soil and could sow roughly 45,730 m2 (11.3 acres) of land in a single day.To protect crops from wind and drought, the grain intendant Zhao Guo (\u8d99\u904e) created the alternating fields system (daitianfa \u4ee3\u7530\u6cd5) during Emperor Wu's reign. This system switched the positions of furrows and ridges between growing seasons. Once experiments with this system yielded successful results, the government officially sponsored it and encouraged peasants to use it. Han farmers also used the pit field system (aotian \u51f9\u7530) for growing crops, which involved heavily fertilized pits that did not require plows or oxen and could be placed on sloping terrain. In southern and small parts of central Han-era China, paddy fields were chiefly used to grow rice, while farmers along the Huai River used transplantation methods of rice production.\n\n\n=== Structural and geotechnical engineering ===\n\nTimber was the chief building material during the Han dynasty; it was used to build palace halls, multi-story residential towers and halls and single-story houses. Because wood decays rapidly, the only remaining evidence of Han wooden architecture is a collection of scattered ceramic roof tiles. The oldest surviving wooden halls in China date to the Tang dynasty (AD 618\u2013907). Architectural historian Robert L. Thorp points out the scarcity of Han-era archaeological remains, and claims that often unreliable Han-era literary and artistic sources are used by historians for clues about lost Han architecture.Though Han wooden structures decayed, some Han-dynasty ruins made of brick, stone, and rammed earth remain intact. This includes stone pillar-gates, brick tomb chambers, rammed-earth city walls, rammed-earth and brick beacon towers, rammed-earth sections of the Great Wall, rammed-earth platforms where elevated halls once stood, and two rammed-earth castles in Gansu. The ruins of rammed-earth walls that once surrounded the capitals Chang'an and Luoyang still stand, along with their drainage systems of brick arches, ditches, and ceramic water pipes. Monumental stone pillar-gates, twenty-nine of which survive from the Han period, formed entrances of walled enclosures at shrine and tomb sites. These pillars feature artistic imitations of wooden and ceramic building components such as roof tiles, eaves, and balustrades.The courtyard house is the most common type of home portrayed in Han artwork. Ceramic architectural models of buildings, like houses and towers, were found in Han tombs, perhaps to provide lodging for the dead in the afterlife. These provide valuable clues about lost wooden architecture. The artistic designs found on ceramic roof tiles of tower models are in some cases exact matches to Han roof tiles found at archaeological sites.\n\nOver ten Han-era underground tombs have been found, many of them featuring archways, vaulted chambers, and domed roofs. Underground vaults and domes did not require buttress supports since they were held in place by earthen pits. The use of brick vaults and domes in aboveground Han structures is unknown.From Han literary sources, it is known that wooden-trestle beam bridges, arch bridges, simple suspension bridges, and floating pontoon bridges existed in Han China. However, there are only two known references to arch bridges in Han literature, and only a single Han relief sculpture in Sichuan depicts an arch bridge.Underground mine shafts, some reaching depths over 100 metres (330 ft), were created for the extraction of metal ores. Borehole drilling and derricks were used to lift brine to iron pans where it was distilled into salt. The distillation furnaces were heated by natural gas funneled to the surface through bamboo pipelines. These boreholes perhaps reached a depth of 600 m (2000 ft).\n\n\n=== Mechanical and hydraulic engineering ===\n\nHan-era mechanical engineering comes largely from the choice observational writings of sometimes-disinterested Confucian scholars who generally considered scientific and engineering endeavors to be far beneath them. Professional artisan-engineers (jiang \u5320) did not leave behind detailed records of their work. Han scholars, who often had little or no expertise in mechanical engineering, sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described. Nevertheless, some Han literary sources provide crucial information. \nFor example, in 15 BC the philosopher and writer Yang Xiong described the invention of the belt drive for a quilling machine, which was of great importance to early textile manufacturing. The inventions of mechanical engineer and craftsman Ding Huan are mentioned in the Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital. Around AD 180, Ding created a manually operated rotary fan used for air conditioning within palace buildings. Ding also used gimbals as pivotal supports for one of his incense burners and invented the world's first known zoetrope lamp.Modern archaeology has led to the discovery of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. As observed in Han miniature tomb models, but not in literary sources, the crank handle was used to operate the fans of winnowing machines that separated grain from chaff. The odometer cart, invented during Han, measured journey lengths, using mechanical figures banging drums and gongs to indicate each distance traveled. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century.Modern archaeologists have also unearthed specimens of devices used during the Han dynasty, for example a pair of sliding metal calipers used by craftsmen for making minute measurements. These calipers contain inscriptions of the exact day and year they were manufactured. These tools are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.\n\nThe waterwheel appeared in Chinese records during the Han. As mentioned by Huan Tan about AD 20, they were used to turn gears that lifted iron trip hammers, and were used in pounding, threshing and polishing grain. However, there is no sufficient evidence for the watermill in China until about the 5th century. The Nanyang Commandery Administrator and mechanical engineer Du Shi (d. 38 AD) created a waterwheel-powered reciprocator that worked the bellows for the smelting of iron. Waterwheels were also used to power chain pumps that lifted water to raised irrigation ditches. The chain pump was first mentioned in China by the philosopher Wang Chong in his 1st-century Balanced Discourse.The armillary sphere, a three-dimensional representation of the movements in the celestial sphere, was invented in Han China by the 1st century BC. Using a water clock, waterwheel and a series of gears, the Court Astronomer Zhang Heng (AD 78\u2013139) was able to mechanically rotate his metal-ringed armillary sphere. To address the problem of slowed timekeeping in the pressure head of the inflow water clock, Zhang was the first in China to install an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel.Zhang also invented a device he termed an \"earthquake weathervane\" (houfeng didong yi \u5019\u98a8\u5730\u52d5\u5100), which the British biochemist, sinologist, and historian Joseph Needham described as \"the ancestor of all seismographs\". This device was able to detect the exact cardinal or ordinal direction of earthquakes from hundreds of kilometers away. It employed an inverted pendulum that, when disturbed by ground tremors, would trigger a set of gears that dropped a metal ball from one of eight dragon mouths (representing all eight directions) into a metal toad's mouth.The account of this device in the Book of the Later Han describes how, on one occasion, one of the metal balls was triggered without any of the observers feeling a disturbance.  Several days later, a messenger arrived bearing news that an earthquake had struck in Longxi Commandery (in modern Gansu Province), the direction the device had indicated, which forced the officials at court to admit the efficacy of Zhang's device.\n\n\n=== Mathematics ===\n\nThree Han mathematical treatises still exist. These are the Book on Numbers and Computation, the Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven and the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art. Han-era mathematical achievements include solving problems with right-angle triangles, square roots, cube roots, and matrix methods, finding more accurate approximations for pi, providing mathematical proof of the Pythagorean theorem, use of the decimal fraction, Gaussian elimination to solve linear equations, and continued fractions to find the roots of equations.One of the Han's greatest mathematical advancements was the world's first use of negative numbers. Negative numbers first appeared in the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art as black counting rods, where positive numbers were represented by red counting rods. Negative numbers were also used by the Greek mathematician Diophantus around AD 275, and in the 7th-century Bakhshali manuscript of Gandhara, South Asia, but were not widely accepted in Europe until the 16th century.The Han applied mathematics to various diverse disciplines. In musical tuning, Jing Fang (78\u201337 BC) realized that 53 perfect fifths was approximate to 31 octaves while creating a musical scale of 60 tones, calculating the difference at 177147\u2044176776 (the same value of 53 equal temperament discovered by the German mathematician Nicholas Mercator [1620\u20131687], i.e. 353/284).\n\n\n=== Astronomy ===\n\nMathematics were essential in drafting the astronomical calendar, a lunisolar calendar that used the Sun and Moon as time-markers throughout the year. During the spring and autumn periods of the 5th century BC, the Chinese established the Sifen calendar (\u53e4\u56db\u5206\u5386), which measured the tropical year at 3651\u20444 days. This was replaced in 104 BC with the Taichu calendar (\u592a\u521d\u66c6) that measured the tropical year at 365385\u20441539 days and the lunar month at 2943\u204481 days. However, Emperor Zhang later reinstated the Sifen calendar.Han Chinese astronomers made star catalogues and detailed records of comets that appeared in the night sky, including recording the 12 BC appearance of the comet now known as Halley's Comet.Han dynasty astronomers adopted a geocentric model of the universe, theorizing that it was shaped like a sphere surrounding the earth in the center. They assumed that the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical and not disc-shaped. They also thought that the illumination of the Moon and planets was caused by sunlight, that lunar eclipses occurred when the Earth obstructed sunlight falling onto the Moon, and that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon obstructed sunlight from reaching the Earth. Although others disagreed with his model, Wang Chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds.\n\n\n=== Cartography, ships, and vehicles ===\n\nEvidence found in Chinese literature, and archaeological evidence, show that cartography existed in China before the Han. Some of the earliest Han maps discovered were ink-penned silk maps found amongst the Mawangdui Silk Texts in a 2nd-century-BC tomb. The general Ma Yuan created the world's first known raised-relief map from rice in the 1st century. This date could be revised if the tomb of Emperor Qin Shi Huang is excavated and the account in the Records of the Grand Historian concerning a model map of the empire is proven to be true.Although the use of the graduated scale and grid reference for maps was not thoroughly described until the published work of Pei Xiu (AD 224\u2013271), there is evidence that in the early 2nd century, cartographer Zhang Heng was the first to use scales and grids for maps.Han dynasty Chinese sailed in a variety of ships differing from those of previous eras, such as the tower ship. The junk design was developed and realized during the Han era. Junk ships featured a square-ended bow and stern, a flat-bottomed hull or carvel-shaped hull with no keel or sternpost, and solid transverse bulkheads in the place of structural ribs found in Western vessels. Moreover, Han ships were the first in the world to be steered using a rudder at the stern, in contrast to the simpler steering oar used for riverine transport,  allowing them to sail on the high seas.Although ox-carts and chariots were previously used in China, the wheelbarrow was first used in Han China in the 1st century BC. Han artwork of horse-drawn chariots shows that the Warring-States-Era heavy wooden yoke placed around a horse's chest was replaced by the softer breast strap. Later, during the Northern Wei (386\u2013534), the fully developed horse collar was invented.\n\n\n=== Medicine ===\n\nHan-era medical physicians believed that the human body was subject to the same forces of nature that governed the greater universe, namely the cosmological cycles of yin and yang and the five phases. Each organ of the body was associated with a particular phase. Illness was viewed as a sign that qi or \"vital energy\" channels leading to a certain organ had been disrupted. Thus, Han-era physicians prescribed medicine that was believed to counteract this imbalance.For example, since the wood phase was believed to promote the fire phase, medicinal ingredients associated with the wood phase could be used to heal an organ associated with the fire phase. Besides dieting, Han physicians also prescribed moxibustion, acupuncture, and calisthenics as methods of maintaining one's health. When surgery was performed by the Chinese physician Hua Tuo (d. AD 208), he used anesthesia to numb his patients' pain and prescribed a rubbing ointment that allegedly sped the process of healing surgical wounds. Whereas the physician Zhang Zhongjing (c. AD 150\u2013c. 219) is known to have written the Shanghan lun (\"Dissertation on Typhoid Fever\"), it is thought that both he and Hua Tuo collaborated in compiling the Shennong Ben Cao Jing medical text.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\nFurther Readings\n\nYap, Joseph P, (2019).

        "wiki": "Henan (\u6cb3\u5357; alternatively Honan) is a landlocked province of the People's Republic of China, located in the central part of the country. Henan is often referred to as Zhongyuan or Zhongzhou (\u4e2d\u5dde), which literally means \"central plain\" or \"midland\", although the name is also applied to the entirety of China proper. Henan is a birthplace of Chinese civilization, with over 3,000 years of recorded history and remained China's cultural, economical and political center until approximately 1,000 years ago.\nHenan Province is home to many heritage sites which have been left behind, including the ruins of Shang dynasty capital city Yin and the Shaolin Temple. Four of the Eight Great Ancient Capitals of China, Luoyang, Anyang, Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, are located in Henan. The practice of tai chi also began in Chen Jia Gou Village (Chen style), as did the later Yang and Wu styles.Although the name of the province (\u6cb3\u5357) means \"south of the [Yellow] river\", approximately a quarter of the province lies north of the Yellow River, also known as the Huang He. With an area of 167,000 km2 (64,479 sq mi), Henan covers a large part of the fertile and densely populated North China Plain. Its neighboring provinces are Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui and Hubei. Henan is China's third most populous province with a population of over 94 million. Henan is also the world's seventh-most populous subnational entity, and if it were a country by itself, Henan would be the 14th most populous country in the world, ahead of Egypt and Vietnam.\nHenan is the 5th largest provincial economy of China and the largest among inland provinces. However, per capita GDP is low compared to other eastern and central provinces.\nHenan is considered to be one of the less developed areas in China economically. The economy continues to grow based on aluminum and coal prices, as well as agriculture, heavy industry, tourism and retail. High-tech industries and service sector is underdeveloped and is concentrated around Zhengzhou and Luoyang.\n\n\n== History ==\nWidely regarded as one of the Cradles of Chinese civilization along with Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, Henan is known for its historical prosperity and periodic downturns. The economic prosperity resulted from its extensive fertile plains and its location at the heart of the country. However, its strategic location also means that it has suffered from nearly all of the major wars in China. In addition, the numerous floods of the Yellow River have caused significant damage from time to time. Kaifeng, in particular, has been buried by the Yellow River's silt seven times due to flooding.\n\n\n=== Ancient Era ===\n\nArchaeological sites reveal that prehistoric cultures such as the Yangshao Culture and Longshan Culture were active in what is now northern Henan since the Neolithic Era. The more recent Erlitou culture has been controversially identified with the Xia dynasty, the first and largely legendary Chinese dynasty that was established, roughly, in the 21st century BC. Virtually the entire kingdom existed within what is now north and central Henan.\nThe Xia dynasty collapsed around the 16th century BC following the invasion of Shang, a neighboring vassal state centered around today's Shangqiu in eastern Henan. The Shang dynasty (16th\u201311th centuries BC) was the first literate dynasty of China. Its many capitals are located at the modern cities of Shangqiu, Yanshi, and Zhengzhou. Their last and most important capital, Yin, located in modern Anyang, is where the first Chinese writing was created.\n\nIn the 11th century BC, the Zhou dynasty of Shaanxi arrived from the west and overthrew the Shang dynasty. The capital was moved to Chang'an, and the political and economical center was moved away from Henan for the first time. In 722 BC, when Chang'an was devastated by Xionites invasions, the capital was moved back east to Luoyang. This began the Spring and Autumn period, a period of warfare and rivalry. What is now Henan and all of China was divided into a variety of small, independent states, constantly at war for control of the central plain. Although regarded formally as the ruler of China, the control that Zhou king in Luoyang exerted over the feudal kingdoms had virtually disappeared. Despite the prolonged period of instability, prominent philosophers such as Confucius emerged in this era and offered their ideas on how a state should be run. Laozi, the founder of Taoism, was born in northern Chu, part of modern-day Henan.\nLater on, these states were replaced by seven large and powerful states during the Warring States period, and Henan was divided into three states, the Wei to the north, the Chu to the south, and the Han in the middle. In 221 BC, state of Qin forces from Shaanxi conquered all of the other six states, ending 800 years of warfare.\n\n\n=== Imperial Era ===\nYing Zheng, the leader of Qin, crowned himself (220 BCE) as the First Emperor. He abolished the feudal system and centralized all powers, establishing the Qin dynasty and unifying the core of the Han Chinese homeland for the first time. The empire quickly collapsed after the death (210 BCE) of Ying Zheng and was replaced by the Han dynasty in 206 BC, with its capital at Chang'an. Thus, a golden age of Chinese culture, economy, and military power began. The capital moved east to Luoyang in 25 AD, in response to a coup in Chang'an that created the short-lived Xin dynasty. Luoyang quickly regained control of China, and the Eastern Han dynasty (25\u2013220) began, extending the golden age for another two centuries.\nThe late Eastern Han dynasty saw war and rivalry between regional warlords. Xuchang in central Henan was the power base of Cao Cao, who eventually succeeded in unifying all of northern China under the Kingdom of Wei. Wei then moved its capital to Luoyang, which remained the capital after the unification of China by the Western Jin dynasty. During this period Luoyang became one of the largest and most prosperous cities in the world, despite being repeatedly damaged by warfare.\n\nWith the fall of the Western Jin dynasty in the 4th and 5th centuries, nomadic peoples from the north invaded northern China and established many successive regimes in northern China, including Henan. These people were gradually assimilated into the Chinese culture in a process known as sinification.\nThe short-lived Sui dynasty reunified China again in 589 with its capital back in Chang'an. It collapsed due to Sui Emperor Yang's costly attempt to relocate the capital from Chang'an to Luoyang and the construction of many extravagant palaces there. The succeeding Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) kept its capital in Chang'an, marking the beginning of China's second golden age, with Henan being one of the wealthiest places in the empire.\nThe Tang dynasty lasted for three centuries before it eventually succumbed to internal strife. In the Period of Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms (907\u2013960) that followed, Kaifeng in eastern Henan became the capital of four dynasties. The Song dynasty that reunified China in 982 also had its capital at Kaifeng. Under Song rule, China entered another era of culture and prosperity, and Kaifeng overtook Luoyang and Chang'an as the largest city in China and in the world. In 1127, however, the Song dynasty succumbed to Jurchen (Jin dynasty) invaders from the north in the Jin\u2013Song war, and in 1142 ceded all of northern China, including Henan. The Song government moved its capital to Hangzhou in Southern China, which, under the Southern Song dynasty (1127\u20131279) continued to enjoy relative economic and culture prosperity. A prolonged period of peace and cultural and economic prosperity in the Yangtze River delta Jiangnan region (modern southern Jiangsu, northern Zhejiang, and Shanghai) made this the new center of Chinese culture and economy.\nKaifeng served as the Jurchen's \"southern capital\" from 1157 (other sources say 1161) and was reconstructed during this time. But the Jurchen kept their main capital further north, until 1214, when they were forced to move the imperial court southwards to Kaifeng in order to flee the Mongol onslaught. In 1234 they succumbed to combined Mongol and Song dynasty forces. Mongols took control, and in 1279 they conquered all of China, establishing the Yuan dynasty and set up the equivalent of modern Henan province, with borders very similar to the modern ones. Neither its territories nor its role in the economy changed under later dynasties. Henan remained important in the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) and Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911) that followed, though its economy slowly deteriorated due to frequent natural disasters.\n\n\n=== Modern Era ===\nThe Qing dynasty was overthrown by the 1911 Revolution and then the Republic of China was established in 1912, during which a man from Henan, Yuan Shikai, played an important role and thus he became the first president of Republic of China. The construction and extension of the Pinghan Railway and Longhai Railway had turned Zhengzhou, a minor county town at the time, into a major transportation hub. Despite the rise of Zhengzhou, Henan's overall economy repeatedly stumbled as it was the hardest hit by the many disasters that struck China in its modern era.\nHenan suffered greatly during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In 1938, when the Imperial Japanese Army captured Kaifeng, the government led by Chiang Kai-shek bombed the Huayuankou dam in Zhengzhou in order to prevent the Japanese forces from advancing further. However, this caused massive flooding in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. In 1942 Henan was hit by a great famine resulting from a mix of drought, locusts and destruction caused by the war. Grain requisition policies were continued by Chinese and Japanese authorities despite the shortage of food, making the death toll far greater than it might have been otherwise.\nIn 1954, the new government of the People's Republic of China moved the capital of Henan from Kaifeng to Zhengzhou, as a result of its economic importance. The PRC had earlier established a short-lived Pingyuan Province consisting of what is now northern Henan and western Shandong with Xinxiang as its capital. This province was abolished in 1952.\nIn 1958, Yashan in Suiping County, Henan, became the first people's commune of China, heralding the beginning of the \"Great Leap Forward\". In the subsequent famines of the early 1960s popularly attributed to the Great Leap Forward, Henan was one of the hardest hit and millions of lives were lost.A destructive flooding of the Huai River in the summer of 1950 prompted large-scale construction of dams on its tributaries in central and southern Henan. \nUnfortunately, many of the dams were not able to withstand the extraordinarily high levels of rainfall caused by Typhoon Nina in August 1975. Sixty-two dams, the largest of which was the Banqiao Dam in Biyang County collapsed; catastrophic flooding, spread over several counties throughout Zhumadian Prefecture and further downstream, killed at least 26,000 people. Unofficial human life loss estimates, including deaths from the ensuing epidemics and famine, range as high as 85,600, 171,000 or even 230 000. This is considered the most deadly dam-related disaster in human history.By the early 1970s, China was one of the poorest countries in the world, and Henan was one of the poorest provinces in China. In 1978, however, when the communist leader Deng Xiaoping initiated the open door policy and embraced capitalism, China entered an economic boom that continues today. The boom did not reach inland provinces such as Henan initially, but by the 1990s Henan's economy was expanding at an even faster rate than that of China overall.\nIn November 2004, martial law was declared in Zhongmou County, Henan, to quell deadly ethnic clashes between Han Chinese and the Muslim Hui Chinese. The reported number of deaths ranged between 7 and 148.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHenan has a diverse landscape with floodplains in the east and mountains in the west. Much of the province forms part the densely populated North China Plain, an area known as the \"breadbasket of China\". The Taihang Mountains intrude partially into Henan's northwestern borders from Shanxi, forming the eastern edge of Loess Plateau. To the west the Xionger and Funiu Mountains form an extensive network of mountain ranges and plateaus, supporting one of the few remaining temperate deciduous forests which once covered all of Henan. The renowned Mount Song and its Shaolin Temple is located in the far east of the region, near the capital city Zhengzhou. To the far south, the Dabie Mountains divides Hubei from Henan. The Nanyang Basin, separated from North China Plain by these mountains, is another important agricultural and population center, with culture and history distinct from the rest of Henan and closer to that of Hubei's. Unlike the rest of northern China, desertification is not a problem in Henan, though sandstorms are common in cities near the Yellow River due to the large amount of sand present in the river. At 2413.8 meters above sea level, the highest point in Henan province is Laoyachanao (\u8001\u9e26\u5c94\u57b4).The Yellow River passes through central Henan. It enters from the northwest, via the Sanmenxia Reservoir. After it passes Luoyang, the mountains gave way to plains. Excessive amount of sediments are formed due to the silt it picks up from the Loess Plateau, raising the riverbed and causing frequent floods which shaped the habitat of the region. More recently however, construction of dams and levees, as well as the depletion of water resources have ended the floods. The Huai River in southern Henan is another important river, and has been recognized as part of the boundary dividing northern and southern Chinese climate and culture.\nHenan shares borders with six other provinces. It is bordered to the west by Shaanxi, to the south by Hubei, and to the north by Shanxi (northwest) and Hebei (northeast). To the east lie Shandong (northeast) and Anhui (southeast), whose borders meet at a narrow strip of land which separates Henan from Jiangsu to the east.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHenan has a temperate climate that is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cwa or Cfa) to the south of the Yellow River and bordering on humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dwa) to the north. It has a distinct seasonal climate characterised by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and generally cool to cold, windy, dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone. Temperatures average around the freezing mark in January and 27 to 28 \u00b0C in July.  A great majority of the annual rainfall occurs during the summer.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nHenan is divided into seventeen prefecture-level divisions: all prefecture-level cities; along with one directly administered county-level city (a sub-prefecture-level city):\n\nThese 17 prefecture-level cities and one directly administered county-level city of Henan are in turn subdivided into 158 county-level divisions (52 districts,21 county-level cities, and 85 counties; the sub-prefecture-level city of Jiyuan is counted as a county-level city here). Those are in turn divided into 2440 township-level divisions (866 towns, 1234 townships, twelve ethnic townships, and 328 subdistricts).\n\n\n=== Urban areas ===\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nWith a population of approximately 93.6 million, Henan is the third most populous Chinese province after Guangdong and Shandong. It is also the fifth most populous sub-national division in the world. If it were a country by itself, it would be the twelfth most populous in the world, just behind Mexico and ahead of the Philippines. However, the hukou system shows Henan as the most populous province in China with over 103 million people, as it counts the migrant Henanese laborers as residents of Henan, instead of the province they currently reside in. On the other hand, Guangdong is shown as having only 81 million people, though the actual population is 95 million due to the influx of migrants from other provinces.\nThe population is highly homogeneous with 98.8% of the population being Han. Small populations of Mongols and Manchus exists in scattered rural communities as well as major urban centers. \nAlong with Jiangxi, Henan has one of the most unbalanced gender ratios in China. As a result of the Chinese government's one-child policy (many parents do not want the only child to be female and abort the fetus), the gender ratio was 118.46 males for 100 females in 2000. Subsequently, aborting fetuses due to their female sex was banned in Henan and heavy fines are issued for those who violate the law. In addition, daughter-only families receive an annual allowance from the government. Despite these efforts the problem seems to have become far worse. Based on a 2009 British Medical Journal study, the ratio is over 140 boys for every 100 girls in the 1\u20134 age group; this might be a strong exaggeration, as many families with more than one child do not register their daughters to the hukou in order to escape fines.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nAccording to a 2012 survey only around 13% of the population of Henan belongs to organised religions, the largest groups being Buddhists with 6.4%, followed by Protestants with 5.6%, Muslims with 1.3% and Catholics with 0.5%. Henan has some important centres of Chinese Buddhism, the White Horse Temple and the famous Shaolin Monastery.\nHenan has also the largest Christian population by numbers and percentage of any province of China, 6.1% of the province's population as of 2012, corresponding to approximately 7 million Christians. A 2009 survey reported the share of Christians to be 9.33%.  In 2019, Communist officials demolished the True Jesus Church near Zhumadian city in Henan province.The reports didn't give figures for other types of religion; 86% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in worship of nature deities, Confucianism, Taoism and folk religious sects (for example, a sect that is endogenous to Henan is the Tianxian miaodao). According to a 2007 survey, approximately 8% of the Henanese believe in and are involved in ancestor veneration, the traditional Chinese religion of the lineages organised into lineage churches and ancestral shrines.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe Government of Henan is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.\nThe Governor of Henan is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Henan. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Henan Communist Party of China Provincial Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the \"Henan CPC Party Chief\".\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nHenan has seen rapid development in its economy over the past two decades, and its economy has expanded at an even faster rate than the national average of 10%. This rapid growth has transformed Henan from one of the poorest provinces to one that matches other central provinces, though still relatively impoverished on a national scale. In 2011, Henan's nominal GDP was 3.20 trillion RMB (US$427 billion), making it the fifth largest economy in China, although it ranks nineteenth in terms of GDP per capita.\nHenan is a semi-industrialized economy with an underdeveloped service sector. In 2009, Henan's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth 277 billion RMB (US$40 billion), 1.097 trillion RMB (US$160 billion), and 563 billion RMB (US$82 billion), respectively. Agriculture has traditionally been a pillar of its economy, with the nation's highest wheat and sesame output and second highest rice output, earning its reputation as the breadbasket of China. Henan is also an important producer of beef, cotton, maize, pork, animal oil, and corn. Food production and processing makes up more than 14% of the output from the province's secondary industry, and it is said that 90% of Chinese McDonald's and KFC ingredients comes from Henan.Although Henan's industry has traditionally been based on light textiles and food processing, recent developments have diversified the industry sector to metallurgy, petrol, cement, chemical industry, machinery and electronics. Henan has the second largest molybdenum reserves in the world. Coal, aluminum, alkaline metals and tungsten are also present in large amounts in western Henan. Henan houses some of the biggest limestone reserves in China estimated over 24 billion tons. Export and processing of these materials is one of the main sources of revenues.\nHenan is actively trying to build its economy around the provincial capital of Zhengzhou, and it is hoped that the province may become an important transportation and manufacturing hub in the years to come. In 2008, the total trade volume (import and export) was US$17.5 billion, including US$10.7 billion for exports.  Since 2002, 7,111 foreign enterprises have been approved, and foreign funds (FDI) of US$10.64 billion have been used in contracts with a realized FDI of US$5.3 billion. Foreign exchanges are increasing continuously. Friendly provincial relationships have been established with 16 states (districts) in the United States, Japan, Russia, France, Germany, and others.  Some cities of Henan have established friendly relationships (sister city) with thirty-two foreign cities.\nHenan's service sector is rather small and underdeveloped. Finance and commerce are largely concentrated in urban centers such as Zhengzhou and Luoyang, where the economy is fueled by a large and relatively affluent consumer base. In order to make the economy more knowledge- and technology-based, the government established a number of development zones in all of the major cities, promoting industries such as software, information technologies, new materials, bio-pharmaceutical and photo-machinery-electronics. Henan is a major destination for tourists, with places such as Shaolin Temple and Longmen Grottoes attracting millions of tourists each year.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nHenan has some of the most advanced transportation system in China due to its flat terrain and its location at the heart of central China's construction boom. The Jingguang and Longhai Railway, the nation's two most important railways, run through much of the province and intersects at Zhengzhou. Other railway hubs such as Shangqiu, Xinxiang, and Luohe have also become important centers of trade and manufacturing as a result. A high-speed railway links Zhengzhou with Xi'an. Henan's expressway system is highly developed and the total length is approximately 5,000 km (3,100 mi), the highest total for any Chinese province. The state of air transport is less stellar, the only 3 public airports are located in Xinzheng (near Zhengzhou), Luoyang, and Nanyang.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nMost of Henan speaks dialects of the Mandarin group of dialects spoken in northern and southwestern China. Linguists put these dialects into the category of \"Zhongyuan Mandarin\". The northwestern corner of Henan is an exception, where people speak Jin dialects instead. The dialects of Henan are collectively called \"the Henan dialect\" in popular usage, with easily identifiable stereotypical features.\nYu opera (Yuju) is the local form of Chinese opera; it is also well-known and popular across the rest of China. Henan Quju and Henan Yuediao are also important local opera forms.\nHenan cuisine is the local cuisine, with traditions such as the Luoyang Shuixi (Luoyang \"Water Table\", consisting entirely of various soups, etc.); Xinyang Duncai (Xinyang brewed vegetables), and the traditional cuisine of Kaifeng.\nImportant traditional art and craft products include: Junci, a type of porcelain originating in Yuzhou noted for its unpredictable colour patterns; the jade carvings of Zhenping; and Luoyang's Tangsancai (\"Tang Three Colours\"), which are earthenware figurines made in the traditional style of the Tang dynasty.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nHenan is located in the Yellow River valley where ancient people lived. Intricate pottery, writing and musical instruments of the Peiligang Culture and Yangshao Culture arose during neolithic times. Three of the Seven Ancient Capitals of China are in Henan: Luoyang, Kaifeng and Anyang. 16 historical sites in Henan are protected at the national level and 267 more at the provincial level.\n\nMount Jigong, on the southern border.\nMount Song, near Dengfeng, one of the Five Sacred Mountains of China.\nShaolin Temple, on Mount Song.\nGaocheng Astronomical Observatory in Dengfeng, the oldest astronomical observatory in China.\nLongmen Grottoes, near Luoyang, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2000.\nSongyue Pagoda\nYinxu in Anyang, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nYouguo Temple with the Iron Pagoda\nWhite Horse Temple in Luoyang\nBaligou in Xinxiang\nMount Mangdang in Shangqiu\nYuntai Mountain in Jiaozuo\n\n\n== Colleges and universities ==\n\nZhengzhou University\nHenan University of Economics and Law\nHenan University\nHenan Agricultural University\nHenan Polytechnic University\nHenan University of Science and Technology\nHenan Normal University\nNorth China Institute of Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric Power\nZhongyuan Institute of Technology\nZhengzhou University of Light Industry\nHenan University of Technology\nZhengzhou Institute of Aeronautical Industry Management\nHenan Medical University\nHenan College of Traditional Chinese Medicine\nXinxiang College\nHuanghe Science and Technology University\nNanyang Institute of Technology\nSias University\nShangqiu College\nShangqiu Normal College\nAnyang Institute of Technology\nZhengzhou Grain College\nZhengzhou University of Technology\nZhengzhou Textile Institute\nLuoyang Institute of Technology\nPingdingshan Normal College\nXinxiang Medical University\nNanyang Teachers College\n\n\n== Notable individuals ==\nSun Tiantian (born 12 October 1981), tennis player\nZhao Ziyang (17 October 1919 \u2212 17 January 2005), former Premier and CCP Secretary\nDeng Yaping (born 5 February 1973), four-time Olympic gold medalist.\nDu Wei (born 9 February 1982), professional football player\nGe Xin'ai (born 30 June 1953) Table Tennis World Champion (1975, 1977, 1979)\nChen Zhong, Olympic gold medalist in Taekwondo\nLiu Guoliang, member of the Chinese ping pong team\nSu Zhibo, the first Chinese gold medalist in the Asian Games\nShang Tang, the first ruling king of the Shang dynasty\nHui Shi (380 BC\u2212?), philosopher\nXu Shen (c.58\u2212c. 147), editor of the Shuowen Jiezi\nRuan Ji (210\u2013263), poet\nDu Fu (712\u2013770), considered one of the greatest of Chinese poets\nHan Yu (768\u2013824), one of China's best known prose writers and poets\nLi Shangyin (813\u2013858), poet\nCheng Hao (1032\u20131085) and brother Cheng Yi (1033\u20131107), Neo-Confucian philosophers\nLi Tang (c. 1080\u2212c. 1130), painter\nYuan Shikai (1859\u20131916), second President of the Republic of China\nFeng Youlan (1895\u20131990), philosopher\nLao Zi (Lao Tzu: dates uncertain), founder of Daoism\nChuang Tzu (born 369 BC), Daoist philosopher\nGao Yaojie, medical doctor\nMo Zi, founder of Mohism\nLie Yukou (c. 4th century BC), Daoist philosopher\nLi Pei Yun, Member of Henan Professional Wushu Team and winner of the gold medal every year from 1977 through 1982 in the Henan Province Kung-Fu competition in four different events;

          "The dinosaurs in this museum were excellent!! I spent the majority of my time marveling at the dinosaurs and skipped the rest as most of it is in Chinese. I would highly recommend stopping by this musuem, even if it's just to see the dinosaurs. The museum is free if you bring",

          "I took the picture at the Calcite Springs. I liked it with the mountains nearby. I stood there enjoying the whole. My wife did the same. \"This is so beautiful! Wow! This is must see!",
          "The \u201cYellow River Scenic Spots\u201d are an odd collection of attractions just north of Zhengzhou. First, you can ride a hovercraft out to a low muddy island in the river, where a group of elderly women nicely try to convince you to rent their ATV or go for a pony ride until it\u2019s",
          "One of the marvel of China culture examples. We had walked nearly 5Km and seen so many (1000s) Lord Buddha and work. You feel something different and you feel vibrations. Truly amazing. Olden days, many Indian monks travelled to China SJ settled and I had seen many and many",
          "we had an organised activity on hovercrafts, although it poured with rain trip was still well worth it,",
          "My hubby and I visited the yellow river and did all the tourist offerings available. Our cab driver who drove us from the hotel to the Yellow river scenic sight shared with us that we should take the tram (added cost) as the place was just really huge. The tram would take us",
          "Again, like the Scenic spots, Huang-he is a must see spot if you are in Zhengzhou. I thought I only go down and touch it with my bare hands. But no, there is a full hour cruise for 80 RMB and you go by with a hovercraft! It was a great fun, I never sit inside only read about",
          "We took the boat ride on the Yellow River and walked around the land in the middle of it. Such an interesting experience.",
          "Although the Yellow River is the 6th longest in the world, there is nothing to suggest its claim to fame when visiting the designated look-out. Like most of China's tourists spots, there is something not quite right about it. There is a board walk over muddy reeds but the area",
          "Took a taxi to get there. It is a waste of time and money. There is nothing special of the scenic area. It\u2019s not even yellow but brown because of the mud. At least, I can now say I saw the famous yellow river...",
          "I saw it a couple of times when in and around Zhengzhou and it is wide and it's muddy however while you are out and about in Zhengzhou you may as wrell see the river that is part of China's mythology.",
          "Was talked into shelling out for a hovercraft trip on the yellow river by the tour guide. This cost 90 yuan pp.. don\u2019t waste your money. Trip lasts about 25 mins including a 10 min stop on a muddy island where locals wait with quad bikes and ponies to rip you off again for a",
          "Ticked another item off my bucket list! Heard about the Yellow River but never visited before, also my first ride in a hovercraft, which was a plus! Also a chance to ride a horse on the banks of the river, or even try the quad bikes!",
          "I would avoid a stand alone visit. It is a pleasant choice but not with great views. The water is muddy and very turbulent.",
          "I can think of hundreds of rivers and waterfalls that are a lot more scenic, easier to get to and a lot less expensive.",
          "Lunch was over 400 yuan. Normally, I would pay 40-50 yuan for a similar type meal in Zhengzhou city. Basic meat, rice, and vegetables. I should have checked the menu prices. The vegetables were apparently the most expensive item, because it was special to the Yellow River. Yeah,",
          "It is about two hours each way from Zhengzhou, but the place is a must see. Totally worth the drive and the visit.",
          "We passed by the Yellow river on several occasions during our stay in China. On each occasions it just looked like a big strech of filthy and dirty water. Really not worth seeing.",
          "Invited with friends to drive there. An hour from town. The water was popular with many people. I 4WD Jeep invited us Laowai (foreigners) to join in the river crossing. A tight squeeze but fun. Lunch on a boat moored to the river's edge, caught a fresh fish from the river.",
          "Always wanted to see the river but its disappointing after taking the long ride there. There is nothing special to see, just a river as usual.",
          "While in Zhengzhou, it is worthwhile to visit the famous Yellow River, one of the most famous rivers in China. You ride a hovercraft to the centre of the river just to view the landscape. Not visually astounding, just a look to see what it is like Nearby is the Yang Huang",
          "We visited Yellow river in summer. Nice architecture, beautiful scenery, picturesque views. Strongly advise to go there.",
          "Nice view, was on a hovercraft ride on the yellow river. Very magnificent view, peaceful view. The ride even stopped half way for us to take a camel ride or motobike ride at 20 yuan",
          "I went to the yellow river scenic area and paid for the cable car to get a good view of the river. What I saw was not impressive. The air pollution made it difficult to see much of anything, but what was visible were power lines, pipes, and other construction zone images.",
          "Only worth a visit because this an important area for the start of the Chinese civilization. There was not much to see other than taking the hovercraft to reach the sand bar in the middle of the river. The interior of the hovercraft had seen its better days. Upon arrival, there",
          "Love the song Yellow River since my teenage days, at last on 15April 2016, I boarded a hovercraft to travel across the Yellow River of Zhengzhou. Wow, the hovercraft was fun and thrilling. It travelled both on land and water. We stopped at a sand bar where we could look at the",
          "Its a good time there. Good photo shoot angles plus the flowers in the spring are heart striking. A nice ride in hovercraft, cable car, speed boat is a good experience over there. This place is more good for kids because the installed many kids rides like bumper cars. There",
          "Unless you find used condoms sanitary napkins, beer bottles, and the filthiest bathrooms in China (and that is saying a lot) skip this one. It is basically a landfill with a shallow, doubtless polluted as hell, river flowing through it. Do not recommend.",

          "Shaolin Temple is the birth of Shaolin Kung Fu as well as the first place to welcome Budhism in China by the presence of a monk from India. The place is a bit commercialized and takes away the magic that many of us were expecting to feel. There's a kung fu show several times a",
          "We visited this site from Zhengzhou as an optional tour with Trip a Deal and very glad we did. The show is quite commercialised but fun nevertheless. The children were practising on the arenas for the upcoming Winter Olympic Games so cant wait to see the opening/closing",
          "Set in a pretty and mountainous area, the Shaolin Temple is not a peaceful escape from daily life as, like most Chinese tourist sites, it will be very busy with tourists and locals alike. Seeing the whole site involves a lot of walking (and dodging cigarette smoke) as it covers",
          "Picturesque landscape all the way up to Temple. On arrival I was stunned by number of visitors ... we could hardly find our way among literally thousands of (mostly) locals and other visitors. Some parts were practically inaccessible because of too many people. Definitely wrong",
          "Outside zhengzhou city in henan province, this is the real shaolin temple we see from novels, tv and movies. Nice surroundings and they have a show for tourists too. Don\u2019t go during winter, it\u2019ll be freezing",
          "Travelled here as part of a tour with my kung Fu school. This is the spiritual home of martial arts and particularly kung Fu. It is truely an amazing place and worth visiting for anyone with a serious interest in either martial arts or Buddhism.",
          "Got to Shaolin Temple but missed the first martial arts show so I walked to the temple first. Costs 100 RMB to watch the show afterwards. Read my review on Mount Song",
          "Was in Xian and took a side trip to Shaolin Temple. Took the early train, my driver picked me up at the station and drove me to the temple, one one road up and be prepared for some me jam due to heavy trucks taking the same route. Entrance fee to temple is Rmb 100. One have to",
          "If you try to meditate yourself out of the crowds of tourists you will really enjoy this place and what it represents. The temple is just part of a beautiful scenic area (bring an umbrella for sun / rain and good walking shoes). The site is surrounded by spectacular mountain and",
          "As many other reviewers note, the way the place has been commercialized is unbecoming. It has basically been made into a theme park. Not very respectful of the ancient heritage the place holds. What makes it worth while is the impressive youngsters performing the kong fu show",
          "As a long time practitioner of martial arts and having studied the Japanese form of Shorinji Kempo which originated from this temple. I was saddened to see that this place of peace and tranquility had been sold out to commercial gain. Was disgusted to hear that the rich of today",
          "Nice place rich in history. Do take the cable car up songshan. Highly recommend that you get a guide.",
          "The Shaolin Temple is an amazing place with a lot of history and beautiful mountain scenery. Definitely a must see on any visit to China.",
          "Honestly, Shaolin Temple is not a scenic place to visit, but for its historical reputation, then it's worth to come visit once. Nothing to view much but you can see many young to adult students who are learning kungfu there. Next to it is Song Mt, where you can take a cable car",
          "This is a Kung fu place and no. of schools are running. Temple is very old said to be around 1500 years. Temple is good . We visited it as a part of group tour.",
          "I visited after hiking song mountain. I visited during a chinese holiday so crowds were heavy and I only spent about 15 minutes in the temple. If you have a chance try to get a tour guide to help explain more of the specifics but the temple itself is not unique in china, it\u2019s",
          "If you are a kung fu fan, this is the place to be. Ideally, come ad early as possible and get to the temple before the crowd. Yes it is commercial but see beyond this and soak up the Zen my friends.",
          "Absolutely worth the bus ride up the mountain, it was chilly & a little damp, the experience was great. We were part of an organised tour group via Tripadeal - I would recommend that you visit the Pegoda Forest. We were not asked for any donations , we were shown thru sections",
          "This was supposed to be the highlight of our trip. After visiting many temples in Wudangshan, Shaolin temple is definitely more colorful. It was also much more crowded with mainland Chinese tour groups as well as foreign tour groups. Considering its history, it is a \u2018must-see\u2019.",
          "Disgusted by how the monks try to give you blessings and tell you that donations MUST be in RMB 300, 600 or 900, totally baffled by how the teachings of the Buddha have changed so adversely as portrayed by them, skipped the martial arts performance all due to the lousy incident",
          "I took a cab from my hotel, 30rmb, to the main entrance where the ticketing office is. Entrance fee is 100rmb. About 100m from the entrance is the Shaolin Martial Arts Hall, recommended to watch the performance. Please see my separate review. Walk another 800m is the Shaolin",
          "It isn't easy to reach. It is far away from big cities, but it's worth it. I don't particularly like martial arts, but this was interesting. The buildings are wonderful and people keep studying Kung fu in these walls. You will see many of them in traditional clothes going from a",
          "If you are remotely interested in Martial arts and/or Buddhism then this is the place for you. You pay 100 yuan entry, there is a ticket office directly opposite, and you enter via the main door. There are limited English descriptions of the halls and monuments but there are",
          "Absolutely recommend it. Watching all the young people and small children practicing Kung fu was awesome and so cute watching the little ones. And they put on a an excellent performance!",
          "Amazing history and the roots of all martial arts. Everywhere you look, is something out of old Chinese Gung Fu movies. Very peaceful and serene as you walk around. Plan on spending a full day there.",
          "We were excited to learn about the Shaolin way and see some martial arts. Unfortunately we didn't. Basically we walked through a temple complex, peering into buildings with very little explanation (our guide was pretty useless). We saw some basic acrobatics by the martial arts",
          "It is indeed one place you have to visit when in Luoyang if you have the time. I was so looking forward to this visit but in the end it didn\u2019t really impress me from a historical perspective especially after having visited the Longmen Grottoes, White Horse Temple and Ming Tan.",
          "We only spent 3 hours there and it wasn't enough if you want to explore all points of interest inside of Shaolin Temple complex, especially if you want to see the Monk Da-Mo's cave. It requires a long hike to get there. If you just want to hit the main points like kung fu show,",
          "It was fascinating to learn the history of the monks and to see all the children learning the art their dedication is amazing, the show was good fun too, most of these youngsters go on to join the forces and the police force Etc which makes them a force to be reckoned with",
          "Took about a one hour drive out of Luoyang to reach the grounds of the Shaolin temple, loved it. Main attractions are the temple structures, the burial grounds, and the Kung fu exhibition. I found it extremely relaxing walking through the beautiful grounds. They have motor",
          "Amazing place to visit, if you are interested in the martial arts, this is the place of Kung fu, take the tour in the mountain Songshan, and be amazed with the views.",
          "We visited the Shaolin Temple and Kung Fu school as part of a 1-day CTrip tour from Xian. It took about an hour for our driver to get from the Longmen Grottoes to the Temple. You drive through some pretty rural areas to get there, but once your there, the mountains are really",
          "This is a another Disneyland. Masterpiece of Chinese marketing and promotion. Almost everything there is artificial. The temple itself was built in 2005 on the site of 495 A.D. structure. There are very few real things left from the past. The place is a typical tourist trap. The",
          "If you are in a nearby city such as Luoyang I would recommend a visit but I would not make a special trip. It is a nice temple but very similar to many temples in China. If you are especially interested in Kung Fu that will make it more worthwhile for you. The pagoda forest is",
          "At the bottom of the mountain, it's a small temple, very busy in peak time and slippery in rain, be careful. No dress code. Next to it there is a monk cemetery and way to the mountain - that's a must to go up as high as you can (cablecar helps to skip 2-hour climbing).",
          "This destination has all that I would normally love but, despite a miserable chilly rain, it was overcrowded with visitors, making it far less enjoyable and rewarding.",
          "The site is quite big, specially if you plan to go to the scenic area, on top of the mountain. if that is the case, take a full day for that; if it is not, you will still need around 3/4h to explore the whole temple area. It\u00b4s more interesting if you get the chance to see some",
          "The temple itself is like any other temple in China. The Llama temple in Beijing is an architectural twin to this one. The history here is impressive and if you like martial arts it is more interesting. The live show is worth seeing. Make sure to take the cable car to the top of",
          "If you are visiting with spiritual bend of mind, it is best avoided. It is too touristy, too crowded and at best an average scenic area. The martial arts show is catered to the tourists.",
          "Shaolin Temple in Dengfeng is situated in a very picturesque valley with majestic mountains as the backdrop. There is a theatre where Kung Fu shows are held every hour. The temple itself is very old and mysterious. The temple is 2 kilometer from the road entrance so take walking",
          "This large complex is worth a whole day trip! (Including pagoda forest). Very beautiful and busy walk up to the temple. Got to witness a kung fu show outside and one inside of children. We had already visited a small school that did a private show for us where we got to meet the",
          "An eye opening for me to see many students practicing in the big space. Was really excited when waiting for the performance. They were really good and was enjoying their real 'kongfu' but towards the end of the show, it snowed unexpectedly as it shouldn't be in March. Kind of",
          "The temple is about 1.5 hours away from Luoyang. We hired a private driver from Luoyang to take us to the Shaolin Temple & Longmen Grottoes for 500CNY. The temple is very touristy now but still nice to walk around the see the original temple. Nice scenery around and nice walk",
          "If you ignore the trappings of the modern day tourist-destination, you will find glimpses of the monastery's past here and there. Truth to be told, the abundance of over-priced tourist-shops selling the same merchandise was a bit jarring. The martial-arts show was entertaining",
          "It was my dream to visit Shaolin Temple since my childhood. I took a trip this year and I guess my wait was not a waste. The temple was maintained well (except for permitting people to smoke inside the temple), The kung fu show was excellent. Took a long walk inside the temple",
          "This attraction is full of ancient Chinese culture and history. Not a lot of walking. There are a couple of concession booths nearby. Not totally wheelchair accessible.",
          "Well if you know who David Carradine is this is a place worth seeing. Firstly there is only one original building left standing, the others are still over 100 years old and very ornate according to traditional architecture. Once you have seen that the rest is a commercially run",
          "I have always been interested to visit the Shaolin Temple as there are so many stories and movies made about this place. It holds a certain mystery for me and many people as well. It's stuff made of legends. Although I read so many comments about the place being over",
          "I grew up with Shaolin temple movies ( made in Hongkong,mostly) and always wished to see it by myself for once in my lifetime. We made it to DengFeng and took another bus to Shaolinsi , stayed in the Shaolin hostel for 2 nights, food up there was overpriced ( 10 Jiaosi for 20",
          "This place is not authentic anymore. It's become a commercial organization. Even before you arrive at the temple, you need to walk probably 1-2 km across a street filled with tourist shops. We turned around when we saw some monks smoke cigarettes and talking loudly on cell",
          "So much to see here. From the Kung Fu \"academy\" to the monastery, it's a beautiful place to take pictures and relax. Be prepared to spend a day and do a lot of walking. We were there for 4 hours and only covered a third.",
          "I went Shaolin temple three time, the first time from 1995, it impressed me a lot since everything was original and nothing commercial related. But other two times, i felt very sorry about the Buddhism, although it is not my religion. Now Shaolin temple is similar as other",
          "The air was cleaner at the temple. Bus trip from town. It was so inspiring to see the masters, students and others showing what they could do. Resembled a school for discipline and mastery of the mind & body. We enjoyed ourselves greatly.",
          "It's a day trip from Luoyang which i was tricked by the lady at the bus station to pay 15rmb more for a ride to shaolin temple. It was too expensive to use a cab (250 Rmb). The temple was crowded by tourists and was not as quiet as it should be. The temple and halls are quite",
          "First, go to the temple, it is a great place to take photos, if possible have monk show you around. But stay until sunset and see the Kungfu show! well worth it!",
          "We really didn't have much time, and were tired, so that might have colored my experience, but of all the things I saw in my short week in China, this had the least impact on me. I was hoping for more, but also knew that it had become rather commercialized, and it was one of",
          "Be prepared to walk this large park. Monks are everywhere, arrived at 11.30am, managed to get permission to have lunch with the monks.",
          "Our 13 year old is a devotee of the martial arts and this is why we came. For him, it was a great and spiritual experience. He loved being there, seeing the monks, seeing the show, etc. Kind of like a Kung Fu dream come true. As it was winter - it was very cold but also it",
          "First of all, it was a bit surprising that one can now drive right up to the entrance of the Shaolin Temple. It is only at 1300 meters, the lowest altitude among the three famous wushu grounds of origin. (The other being Wudang and Emei). The temple is a bit smaller than",
          "Well the truth is Shaolin Temple has turned to a company. It's too commercial and got a CEO! They got overseas branch's in expensive cities. To take picture with monks they might ask you for money. We had to pay around 13usd. But the hill near Temple is great, you can climb it",
          "An hour drive outside Luoyang. Worth a visit for the martial arts, religion temple and forest of burials.",
          "Getting to the temple is quite easy by public transportation. I took the bus from Luoyang central bus station. A tip: get your hotel write down the bus number/route. This really make things a lot easier. I'm not completely sure, but I think it was a 1.5~2hrs drive. At the",
          "This was my first visit to Shaolin Temple which is around 1 hr drive from Zhengzhou City in Henan Province of China. Beautiful landscape, historical temples. The greatest attraction is Kung Fu Show. The vegetarian food is also must try. I thoroughly enjoyed the trip to the",
          "I kind of knew what to expect but wanted to visit the temple anyway since I was in the area. The location of the temple is fantastic, surrounded by mountains. Pity there was enough haze to block that out. The martial arts show by students is nice because it is realistic. One of",
          "The Shaolin Temple is immensely popular with Chinese tour groups and families. This place will be crowded with people whenever you come, making it seem like a bit of a tourist circus. The bad news doesn't end there. The temple was badly damaged at various points in history and",
          "The temple was described online as the best in Henan but it was actually a dirty dump. The path was dusty and also there was only one bathroom in the area that was called a five-star restroom but it was a fake and it charged you real money",
          "The Shaolin Temple is located at Snow Mountain in Dengfeng County, Hennan Province. It is quite a distance from Zhengzhou, the capital of Hennan. Can be reached by bus and taxi. The entrance fee is \u00a5100 and you also have for the cable rides if you want the mountain sceneries.",
          "Visited the temples during a month of prayer. Vegetarian restaurant for meals. Good basic food with the expectation of quick turn over. Toilets terrible, take plenty of tissues with you. Was raining a lot during our time there which did not help. Overall very awe inspiring when",
          "As a Chinese, I grew up watching the movie Shaolin Temple. As such it's a must-do for me when I am in Luoyang. I took the direct bus from the bus station opposite Luoyang Train Station and it cost just 20CNY. When entering the bus station, just ignore all the touts and go",
          "This place has great reputation and has been included on UNESCO's World Cultural & Natural Heritage List in 2010, it is the cradle of the Chinese Zen Buddhism and the Shaolin Martial Arts. Besides the temple, one should also visit the Pagoda Forest, a graveyard for Buddhist",
          "For kungfu disciples and followers Shaolin Temple is one of the must visit place.For me 2 events were outstanding during my visit.....the kungfu show and watching some of the students praticing the art in the grounds.Like other top touristic attractions,it is crowded with",
          "Came here as part of a g-adventures tour, it was probably the part of the tour that I was least interested in. It was very touristy, with piped music but the kung-fu demo was a little interesting. There was plenty of tat for sale and seeing the kids training around the village",
          "There is a lot of hype around the Shaolin temple and it is deserved, however actually visiting the site isn't spectacular. It's interesting and a good place to see, but it's kind of like visiting so many other temples in China.. I preferred a temple I saw in Luoyang. There is",
          "The temple is beautiful and rich with history! Go early in the morning and avoid weekends if you want to take in the serene environment.",
          "I'm sure this place was once fascinating, but I feel it has just become a tourist trap and far too commercial. However, there are 2 good points - 1. The martial arts show, 2. Mount Song, where the scenery is beautiful. General information: The Songshan Shaolin Scenic Area",
          "Nothing much to see except, some Shaolin show which you might want to get the information before going further up to Shaolin Temple from the entrance. There are Shaolin monks being the shopkeepers at set-up stalls but had a very bad customer service hence, they turned off our",
          "The temple is huge. So be prepared to walk a bit. There are many different buildings of various age and importance (some have been destroyed and later restored). Info is rather weak (not much english) so get a guide who can tell you the history of the place. Keep an eye out for",
          "The Shaolin temple is awesome! Set it the green hills of Shaolin, there you will find the history of Kung Fu. You can go see a neat kung fu show or watch as the students display the art. The Pagoda Forest was my favorite, really beautiful. We also rode on a gondola which was",
          "The place is worth the visit if you have interest in Shaolin martial arts, some historical background to the place too!",
          "The temple itself is good although very like others throughout China. The show was impressive with good displays of strength and flexibility, although very much aimed at tourists. Walking around the grounds you can see some of the children practising. The pagodas towards the",
          "Cool history and fun show. Yes, Shaolin is a bit touristy (and really crowded), but well worth a visit in any case. Beyond the kung fu show, the functional temple and \"Pagoda Forest\" cemetery are worth a visit of themselves. Set beneath the immortal Mount Song, Shaolin is nice",
          "This is one on the great point of Zen Buddhism. Master Damo, the first Zen Master in the East, made this his home, and His presence is profound for Zen practitioners. Literally, behind the fighting monk tourist stuff is Master Damo's temple. Tiny and modest, the nuns farm their",

          "Where It was not so long ago that the Chinese were destroying some of their antiquities they now present many of them beautifully, and the Shaolin Monastery is a prime example of that. Although there are some of the very old original bits left most has had to be renovated, but",
          "One of the best places in my life, very good experience of Chinese martial arts show, also a lot of attractive areas and a big history",
          "The show was the highlight of our visit, really worth it. The walk in the vast yard was also very nice, we looked at the little boys training. I recommend it.",
          "I stayed inside the beautiful park surrounding this famous temple for two nights with my family (kids are 11 and 6). We simply had a great adventure. Though we are travelling throughout China and expect to have more fun and visit other interesting places, I suspect this will",
          "I was very excited to visit the Shaolin Temple (part of my teenage years and pop culture). It is a large place with many temples and mountains. It is also very popular with CHinese tourist groups, so can get very crowded. The Shaolin Temple is interesting but not different than",
          "We came to Henan just to see the Shaolin Temple and were sorely disappointed. First we went to see the kung fu demonstration which involved sitting in a room with a stage while a woman shouted into a microphone for half an hour about what we were seeing. We were impressed by",
          "I knew about Shaolin temple from reading wuxia stories and watching wuxia movies. Visiting the temple on a recent China visit was a wonderful feeling. The place has a wonderful aura which reflects its rich past history. It is definitely worth a visit and while you are at it,",
          "This was an all around great trip....from seeing the temple, to watching the performances, to just wandering around and speaking with the monks. Easily spent an entire day there, and it simply flew by. As an avid martial artist, this was definitely on my bucket list. But even",
          "Very intensely marketed, the number of both foreign and local tourists indicate the success of such a blitz! Don't be put off by the obvious glitz - the base is real and the levels of preparedness of the actors/monks of an incredible level. Very well organized programme which",
          "Don't get me wrong, I do not want to diminish the historical significance of this place. The geographical setting is stunning, and many of the temple buildings themselves (although mostly renovated or recently constructed) are impressive as well. But there is actually little to",
          "This is a popular working temple, attracting martial arts enthusiasts as well as devotees. Monks can be seen going about their daily tasks as well as selling traditional Chinese medecine herbal remedies. Make sure you book the show, which gets very crowded. Allow plenty of time",
          "As a Martial Arts practitioner I was a little disappointed with the Kung Fu demonstration. It was good but I was expecting WOW. It was just as exciting watching all the students training at their schools. This is the home of Kung Fu and Zen Buddhism so it is certainly worth the",
          "Quite amazing to see the place where Martial Arts originated from. As you can expect it is very touristy (mainly Chinese tourists) who will pester you for a picture but other than that I enjoyed a tour of the temple, learning about the history. There would not be any other",
          "I expected a bit different but it was great place to visit. Better to expect long long walk from the car park to the actual temples. Shaolin Temple consists of numbers of buildings and places inside of Shaolin Temple, so better to have walking shoes, water bottle, and",

          "While the temple is like so many other Buddhist and Taoist temples throughout China, it does have the unique distinction of being used in a few Shaolin Kungfu movies. So you can recognize some of the buildings when you watch these movies. I stayed at a hostel inside of the",

          "I wasted two days of my holiday to China visiting this place. Was expecting a much different experience to the one I had. In a nutshell, for a Buddhist temple, this was a huge disappointment. Firstly, there were monks INSIDE the temple putting pressure on us to buy their",

          "If you are in the Zhengzhou area, this is well worth the visit. The grounds are huge. There is a lot to see and do. One of the things not to miss is the gong-fu demonstration. It is quite amazing to see one of the monks throw a needle through a pane of glass to burst a",
          "We had made a specific visit to this area to visit the Shaolin Temple and were sadly disappointed. Basically we wasted two nights of our holiday. The Kung Fu show, while the performers from one of the local schools were very impressive, was really not worth it. After already",

          "Quite an extraordinary place really. The temple itself is stunning with China's largest pagoda forrest and some beautiful mountain treks nearby in the scenic area. Amazing to see the lifestyle and dedication to Kung fu training that the monks go through. Not to mention the",

          "Owning a Kung Fu club, I may be bias but It is an amazing place! The grounds are spectacular! You can feel the energy all around you. Yes, the locals can be \"direct\". Little if any English is spoken so learn a few simple phrases and the locals will treat you better. Shaolinshi",
          "Cool place to come and the gondola is worth the 80RMB to get up into the beautiful mountains. The English sign said 60 years or older were half off and they were super rude when telling our group that even though the sign didnt say it, the rule was just for Chinese People. So",
          "We visited Shaolinshi by following day trip tour on Sept 2015. The ticket cost RMB100/head. There is a show on certain time and we need to queue up outside the theater. If you don't want to wait in the long queue, you can pay extra RMB20 and they will let you go into theater",
          "Went as part of a group tour, great day out and the performance was amazing, especially as one of my friends was asked to participate. The rest of the day was spent exploring and climbing up Dong mountain, which had an incredible view - definitely worth the walk.",

          "I didn't have as much time as I would have liked because of transportation issues, so perhaps I'm being a little harsh with three stars. It's certainly a good brag to say you've been to the home of monastic kung fu, but the temple itself isn't that impressive compared to others",
          "We drove to the Temple from Luoyang, spent a couple of hours there, and then drove back; I'm not sure the 3 hours' drive was warranted for this site alone. It might be better use of time to stay in the area at least one night and visit other local attractions as well as the",
          "Shaolin Temple and Monastery are so steeped in history that this is definitely worth a visit if you are in the area. But it seemed a little like Disneyland the way everything was built around the famous temple and Pagoda Forest. We went to the Kung Fu show, which showed off",
          "Homegrown Taoist philosophy imported from India marks the spot of this temple known for its Kung Fu Martial Arts as practiced by Jet Li and other movie stars. This Temple and the surrounding Martial Arts institutes in Dengfend are well worth a visit for a memorable excursion",

          "Can't deny, I learned about Shaolin mostly from the kungfu movies. The visit to the real temple of Shaolin gave me different perspective about it. Shaolin is not all about kungfu, but is about practice and meditation (\u7985\u6b66). It is not a kind of wushu or fighting skill. Shaolin",
          "The Shaolin Temple ground are very large. The terrain is so diverse from temples, to kitchens for the monks and sleeping areas, to Gardens and places of worship. The Pegoda Forest just outside the Temple grounds are worth the visit, also. A short walk takes you to a cable car",
          "My son and I took the 6:10am bus from Luoyang to the Shaolin Temple. The bus picked up many passengers on the way, and the time of travel was two hours. Travelling the local bus is a great way to experience the culture of China. There was also an option for the 7am express bus,",
          "There are some good things about a visit to Shaolin Temple. It is the birthplace of Zen Buddhism and the home of Kung Fu. The setting in the mountains SE of Luoyang is a welcome change to the crowded polluted city, though I would not say that you get fresh mountain air at",

          "I am not a big connoisseur of temples, so I can\u2019t describe how this one compares with other historic temples of China. We came mainly because we thought the kids would enjoy the Kung Fu demonstration. Some of the things I liked were being able to visit some of the areas",
          "A lot of history on the origin of Shaolin temple located on a multi-storeyed location. Saw many groups practising kungfu there too.",
          "Nice site but unfortunately over commercialized - limited opportunity to get decent lunch - the kongfu show is only presenting very few highlights but lots of merchandising stuff which nobody needs",

          "Heard so much about the temple in so many kung fu shows. Finally got the opportunity to visit the temple recently. Frankly, it was not as impressive as what I would have imagine it to be. Having to pay entrance of RMB100 was quite a hefty sum to visit a temple. Perhaps they",
          "It is indeed commercialized and many things inside are overpriced and profit orientated. Nevertheless, if you turn a blind eye on those things, and are passionate about kungfu, or even to be here to see the temple on the hills, it will be worth it. You definitely need a whole",
          "Just wish we had allowed more time for our visit. We were late leaving luoyang and its a good 90 mins by van there. The attraction itself is commercialized but is vast and would loved to have had time to walk up to the quieter spots - i.e. away from the temple and the kungfu",
          "The temple is well maintained. They built special highway just for the temple, also built a huge park outside the temple. Just don't buy anything inside the temple from the monks, they will tell you whatever you buy will to go to the HIV kids in the HIV village, in fact they",
          "Many tourists visited Shaolin Temple as a day trip from Luoyang (a side trip from Xi'an). Instead , I went to the temple from Zhengzhou. The distance is about the same as from Luoyang but with lesser crowd. Shaolin Temple had a significant role in past history of China in",
          "We all know Shaolin Temple through all those Kungfu movies, but Shaolin is more than Kungfu, so it isn't fair just to limited it to that. The Shaolin Temple is a spiritual place and the birth place of Buddha in China after this Religion were imported from India. Although, Li",
          "The trip from Luoyang takes a little over an hour. There is lots of rubble on the way, some sort of brick works, so not very scenic. The temple itself is a packed with tourists and so are the grounds. This is more of a Monk theme park than anything else. Never seen so many monks",

          "4* is the average of my views: From Luoyang it took us 90 minutes to reach the temple. The overall so called Shaolin Temple has three major attractions: 1 - Shaolin Temple, that in my point of view, it is not more attractive than many other temples in China 3* 2 - pagoda",

          "Maybe for great kung fu lovers it's exciting, but I didn't find anything special about this place. The landscape is mediocre (every Chinese geopark with mountains, rivers and waterfalls is much more beautiful). And above all there is huge crowd everywhere. The area consists of",
          "It was a nice and peaceful day away from the hustle and bustle and pollution of Xi'an. Kids were very entertained by the Kung Fu show, and the pagoda forest was really cool! At sunset the colours are lovely. we went to the Longmen Grottoes first then to the shaolin temple in one",

          "Wonderful architecture and history! When we stayed we were lucky enough to be invited by a monk for kung fu lessons. Receiving lessons, even basic ones, in that temple under the guidance of a monk was incredible! We also got to see some of the other groups that come to study",

          "It was a great experience to visit the area - after paying the entrance fee there is more than just the Shaolin Temple to see. The temple itself is great, and very historic - although quite touristy with a lot of people. If you are adventurous and don't mind a bit of stair",
          "We were happy as Shaolin Temple was included in our tour itinerary as one of the must-see attractions in China. Shaolin Temple, a UNESCO's World Cultural & Natural Heritage site, is the birthplace of Chinese Zen Buddhism and Shaolin Martial Arts. It is situated in the Song",
          "The Shaolin temple has been opened to visitors in a beautiful yet discreet manner. It is easy to find, has well thought through travel assistance including buses and cable cars. If you want to appreciate the full impact you should spend a night in one of the hotels there or in",
          "I wasn't very impressed with the temple, it is ok but the commercial attitude of the monks kind of ruins the experience. There is a kung fu show that is ok, but in the end they try to sell you stuff (again). The temple itself is pretty, but rebuilt a couple of times so looks",
          "Very large area ,which deserve a short visit. A short Shaolin Kongfu Performance is also interesting. There is an important site nearby:The Forest of Dagobas: a cemetery of 246 dagobas for noted monks dating from AD 791 to 1995, with different Buddhist patterns and inscriptions",
          "Shaolin temple has been destroyed and rebuilt many times. It was also set on fire back in 1928.Many dynasties have rebuilt it. So most of the original structures were gone, what you see will be a restoration work. Some of the wall paintings of the un-burnt segment remained",
          "Visited October 8. Not as crowded as anticipated. Must see unique kungfu performance but be aware of performance schedule on the hour for half an hour and go for a seat early! Historic groups of tombs are spectacular. If you know Chinese history, you will be even more",

          "Visited on a day when the weather wasn't it's best, but had a great day. Was shown around by a personal guide and informed of the history behind the temple. Met several monks and even practiced some Kungfu. There is plenty to see and do, but be prepared for a lot of walking and",

          "Interesting place. A bit commercialized. Remember that you are not Bruce Lee so do not come out with a robe, shaved head and a sword and collars of all types! But if in the area, well worth a visit. The temple is far from the city center and traffic jams in or out are",
          "Apart from the fact it was pouring rain, and we had to walk miles from the bus, then line up with thousands of local tourists, I don't think it was worth the visit for the show - which was 2nd rate and very touristy. Scenery however was beautiful and if the weather had been",

          "I watched wuxia films while growing up, which is primarily why I wanted to visit the shaolin temple, the birth place of wushu! As expected, it was nothing like the films/novels/shows and very similar to every other temple in China. The highlight was the 30 min indoor wushu show",
          "Awesome Temple, though very touristic and noisy. Be humble, and follow your steps to paths that not many tourists visit, around multiple centres. Expensive souvenirs, but you need something to remember. You may be lucky enough to taste sweet grapes, freshly cut, sold by monks.",
          "Intrigue, mystery. Quiet yet full of agression. Must visit if you are in Zhengzhou. About 70-80 minutes from Zhengzhou.",
          "It is a spectacular place to visit! Not only by the temple itself but the whole area. The 2 cable cars available are worth to go as they provide you a very good sightseeing of the entire area. A lot of small souvenir stands all over the place, if you need to buy souvenirs I",
          "Oh dear. They have turned this into a tourist attraction and moved the real temple up the mountain. There are however several reasons to visit. Firstly, there are some genuine kung fu schools a few miles down the road. We were invited in for a look around and they showed us some",
          "I agree with previous reviews that the place is very touristy. But stil,l I enjoyed it, especially the scenery which was beautiful - I love mountains. Shaolin Temple is extraordinary and I was excited when I saw monks. Generally speaking, it's very expensive to go there, but",
          "If you want to learn more about kung fu this is not a place to go. We didn't get to see any kung fu apart from the tacky touristy show, which was nothing more that touristy tat. The temple it'self is very beautiful. Pagoda forest is also nice and most unique piece inside this",
          "I have a vivid imagination. Combined with various movies about China and Shaolin Temple I had already a picture of this place in my mind but it turned to be compeletly differet. It's true what people say - commercialism is everywhere. Or maybe it's just a fact that this place",
          "if you like kung-fu, then you are probably happy. but the 30minute-show (ca. yuan 350)we have seen was not so exciting to us. the temple has no atmosphere. we would not do that again",
          "Really looking forward to out day at the Shaolin Temple but left feeling a little deflated and ripped off. The Shaolin temple did not seem any more impressive then any other temple in china, there was also little information about the history and culture. BE WARNED there is a",

          "As everywhere in China the temple is far away from the entrance so prepare for a long walk or catch the bus ( service for charge ). I recommend to take the bus on the way and you can come back on foot. The organized kung fu show isn't worth the time or money. If you are lucky",
          "I was really excited to see the Shaolin Temple and ended up quite disappointed with the whole thing. It was over-priced for what you get in the experience. There were also way too many people!! The kung fu show was pretty cool, but they filled a lot of the time having the",

        "wiki": "Zhengzhou is the capital and largest city of Henan Province in the central part of the People's Republic of China. It is one of the National Central Cities in China, the centre of Central Plains area, and serves as the political, economic, technological, and educational center of the province. The Zhengzhou metropolitan area (including Zhengzhou and Kaifeng) is the core area of the Central Plains Economic Zone.The city lies on the southern bank of the Yellow River. Zhengzhou is a major hub of China's national transportation network, with railways connecting Zhengzhou to Europe and an international airport. Zhengzhou is a National Civilized City, State-list Famous Historical and Culture City, and the birthplace of the Yellow Emperor. As of 2020, there are two World Cultural Heritage Sites in Zhengzhou. The Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (ZCE) is China's first futures exchange, Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone is China's first Airport Economy Zone.Zhengzhou has a population of 10,120,000 inhabitants, and had a GDP of 1.014 billion (RMB) in 2018. The city is one of the main built-up areas of Henan region. Greater Zhengzhou was named as one of the 13 emerging mega-cities in China in a July 2012 report by the Economist Intelligence Unit, and officially named as the eighth National Central City in 2017 by the central government in Beijing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Shang dynasty established Aodu (\u969e\u90fd) or Bodu (\u4eb3\u90fd) in Zhengzhou. This prehistorical city had become abandoned as ruins long before the First Emperor of China in BC 260. Since 1950, archaeological finds in a walled city in Eastern Zhengzhou have provided evidence of Shang dynasty settlements in the area. Outside this city, remains of large public buildings and a complex of small settlements have been discovered. The site is generally identified with the Shang capital of Ao and is preserved in the Shang dynasty Ruins monument in Guanchen District. The Shang, who continually moved their capital due to frequent natural disasters, left Ao at around 13th century BC. The site, nevertheless, remained occupied; Zhou (post-1050 BC) tombs have also been discovered. Legend suggests that in the Western Zhou period (1111\u2013771 BC) the site became the fief of a family named Guan. From this derives the name borne by the county (xian) since the late 6th century BC\u2014Guancheng (City of the Guan). The city first became the seat of a prefectural administration in AD 587, when it was named Guanzhou. In 605 it was first called Zhengzhou\u2014a name by which it has been known virtually ever since.The name Zhengzhou came from the Sui dynasty (AD 582), even though it was located in Chenggao, another town. The government moved to the contemporary city during the Tang dynasty. It achieved its greatest importance under the Sui (AD 581\u2013618), Tang (618\u2013907), and early Song (960\u20131127) dynasties, when it was the terminus of the New Bian Canal, which joined the Yellow River to the northwest. There, at a place called Heyin, a vast granary complex was established to supply the capitals at Luoyang and Chang'an to the west and the frontier armies to the north. In the Song period, however, the transfer of the capital eastward to Kaifeng robbed Zhengzhou of much of its importance.In 1903 the Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway arrived at Zhengzhou, and in 1909 the first stage of the Longhai Railway gave it an east\u2013west link to Kaifeng and Luoyang; it later was extended eastward to the coast at Lianyungang, Jiangsu, and westward to Xi'an (Chang'an), Shaanxi, as well as to western Shaanxi. Zhengzhou thus became a major rail junction and a regional center for cotton, grain, peanuts, and other agricultural produce. Early in 1923 a workers' strike began in Zhengzhou and spread along the rail line before it was suppressed; a 14-story double tower in the center of the city commemorates the strike. On June 10, 1938, Chiang Kai-shek's National Revolutionary Army opened up the dikes retaining the Yellow River at Huayuankou between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, in an effort to stem the tide of invading Japanese; however, the ensuing 1938 Yellow River flood also killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese.Zhengzhou also has a locomotive and rolling-stock repair plant, a tractor-assembly plant, and a thermal generating station. The city's industrial growth has resulted in a large increase in the population, coming predominantly from industrial workers from the north. A water diversion project and pumping station, built in 1972, has provided irrigation for the surrounding countryside. The city has an agricultural university.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLocated just north of the province's centre and south of the Yellow River, Zhengzhou borders Luoyang to the west, Jiaozuo to the northwest, Xinxiang to the northeast, Kaifeng to the east, Xuchang to the southeast, and Pingdingshan to the southwest. With the land within its administrative borders generally sloping down from west to east, Zhengzhou is situated at the transitional zone between the North China Plain to the east and the Song Mountains and Xionger Mountains to the west, which are part of the greater Qinling range. The city centre is situated to the south of the middle reach of the Yellow River, where its valley broadens into the great plain. Zhengzhou is at the crossing point of the north\u2013south route skirting the Taihang Mountains and the mountains of western Henan. The prefecture spans 34\u00b0 16' ~ 34\u00b0 58 N latitude and 112\u00b0 42' ~ 114\u00b0 14' E longitude, covering a total area of 7,446.2 square kilometres (2,875.0 sq mi), including the metropolitan area, which covers 1,013.3 km2 (391.2 sq mi), and the city centre, which occupies 147.7 square kilometres (57.0 sq mi).\nThe section of the Yellow River flowing through the prefecture extends 150.4 km (93.5 mi). Mountains loom over the western counties of Gongyi and Dengfeng while the easternmost county of Zhongmu is a vast, fertile floodplain, with the counties in between being hilly transitions.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZhengzhou experiences a monsoon-influenced, four-season humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cwa), with cool, dry winters and hot, humid summers. Spring and autumn are dry and somewhat abbreviated transition periods. The city has an annual mean temperature of 14.73 \u00b0C (58.5 \u00b0F), with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from 0.5 \u00b0C (32.9 \u00b0F) in January to 27.1 \u00b0C (80.8 \u00b0F) in July. The frost-free period lasts on average 220 days. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221217.9 \u00b0C (0 \u00b0F) on 2 January 1955, 27 December 1971 and 1 February 1990 to 43.0 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) on 19 July 1966.Rainfall is primarily produced by the monsoonal low during summer; in winter, when the vast Siberian High dominates due to radiative cooling from further north, the area receives little precipitation. During the summer season, the city is also often affected by tropical depressions, which bring additional amounts of rain. The annual precipitation is about 630 millimetres (25 in). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 45 percent in February and March to 54 percent in May, the city receives 2,182 hours of sunshine per year, which is just under half the possible total.\n\n\n== Administration and demography ==\n\nZhengzhou is divided into 6 urban districts, 5 county-level cities and 1 county. These subdivisions are likely to undergo significant changes in the near future due to increasingly rapid urban expansion and urban planning.\nThe municipality is home to 8,626,505 inhabitants (2010 census) and 6,35 million in its built up area made of 6 urban and suburban districts, Xingyang and Xinzheng cities and now Zhongmu county largely being urbanized, making the city one of the main built-up areas of the province.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nZhengzhou was the capital of China during the Shang dynasty. Parts of the Shang-era capital city wall that were built 3,600 years ago still remain in Downtown Zhengzhou (see Zhengzhou Shang City). Zhengzhou maintains abundant cultural heritages that reflect its glorious history as well as the culture of Henan Province. Zhengzhou Confucius Temple, initially built during the Eastern Han dynasty 1900 years ago, is one of the oldest Confucian Temples in China. Other important architectural heritage sites in the city center include Town God Temple and Erqi Memorial Tower.\nThe internationally known tourist attraction is the Shaolin Monastery, which is in Dengfeng, about 90 kilometres (56 miles) southwest of downtown Zhengzhou (1.5 hours by coach). The Shaolin Monastery is not only known as one of China's most important Buddhist shrines, but also as the ancient center of Chinese Kung-fu. Shaolin Monastery and its famed Pagoda Forest were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010.The Henan Museum is one of China's most important museums. It has a collection of more than 130,000 pieces of cultural relics includes exhibitions from prehistoric times, including dinosaur fossils and prehistoric human remains, up through the modern eras.\nZhengzhou's most developed and modern area is the Zhengdong New Area, which is in the eastern part of the city.

        "wiki": "Zhengzhou is the capital and largest city of Henan Province in the central part of the People's Republic of China. It is one of the National Central Cities in China, the centre of Central Plains area, and serves as the political, economic, technological, and educational center of the province. The Zhengzhou metropolitan area (including Zhengzhou and Kaifeng) is the core area of the Central Plains Economic Zone.The city lies on the southern bank of the Yellow River. Zhengzhou is a major hub of China's national transportation network, with railways connecting Zhengzhou to Europe and an international airport. Zhengzhou is a National Civilized City, State-list Famous Historical and Culture City, and the birthplace of the Yellow Emperor. As of 2020, there are two World Cultural Heritage Sites in Zhengzhou. The Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (ZCE) is China's first futures exchange, Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone is China's first Airport Economy Zone.Zhengzhou has a population of 10,120,000 inhabitants, and had a GDP of 1.014 billion (RMB) in 2018. The city is one of the main built-up areas of Henan region. Greater Zhengzhou was named as one of the 13 emerging mega-cities in China in a July 2012 report by the Economist Intelligence Unit, and officially named as the eighth National Central City in 2017 by the central government in Beijing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Shang dynasty established Aodu (\u969e\u90fd) or Bodu (\u4eb3\u90fd) in Zhengzhou. This prehistorical city had become abandoned as ruins long before the First Emperor of China in BC 260. Since 1950, archaeological finds in a walled city in Eastern Zhengzhou have provided evidence of Shang dynasty settlements in the area. Outside this city, remains of large public buildings and a complex of small settlements have been discovered. The site is generally identified with the Shang capital of Ao and is preserved in the Shang dynasty Ruins monument in Guanchen District. The Shang, who continually moved their capital due to frequent natural disasters, left Ao at around 13th century BC. The site, nevertheless, remained occupied; Zhou (post-1050 BC) tombs have also been discovered. Legend suggests that in the Western Zhou period (1111\u2013771 BC) the site became the fief of a family named Guan. From this derives the name borne by the county (xian) since the late 6th century BC\u2014Guancheng (City of the Guan). The city first became the seat of a prefectural administration in AD 587, when it was named Guanzhou. In 605 it was first called Zhengzhou\u2014a name by which it has been known virtually ever since.The name Zhengzhou came from the Sui dynasty (AD 582), even though it was located in Chenggao, another town. The government moved to the contemporary city during the Tang dynasty. It achieved its greatest importance under the Sui (AD 581\u2013618), Tang (618\u2013907), and early Song (960\u20131127) dynasties, when it was the terminus of the New Bian Canal, which joined the Yellow River to the northwest. There, at a place called Heyin, a vast granary complex was established to supply the capitals at Luoyang and Chang'an to the west and the frontier armies to the north. In the Song period, however, the transfer of the capital eastward to Kaifeng robbed Zhengzhou of much of its importance.In 1903 the Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway arrived at Zhengzhou, and in 1909 the first stage of the Longhai Railway gave it an east\u2013west link to Kaifeng and Luoyang; it later was extended eastward to the coast at Lianyungang, Jiangsu, and westward to Xi'an (Chang'an), Shaanxi, as well as to western Shaanxi. Zhengzhou thus became a major rail junction and a regional center for cotton, grain, peanuts, and other agricultural produce. Early in 1923 a workers' strike began in Zhengzhou and spread along the rail line before it was suppressed; a 14-story double tower in the center of the city commemorates the strike. On June 10, 1938, Chiang Kai-shek's National Revolutionary Army opened up the dikes retaining the Yellow River at Huayuankou between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, in an effort to stem the tide of invading Japanese; however, the ensuing 1938 Yellow River flood also killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese.Zhengzhou also has a locomotive and rolling-stock repair plant, a tractor-assembly plant, and a thermal generating station. The city's industrial growth has resulted in a large increase in the population, coming predominantly from industrial workers from the north. A water diversion project and pumping station, built in 1972, has provided irrigation for the surrounding countryside. The city has an agricultural university.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLocated just north of the province's centre and south of the Yellow River, Zhengzhou borders Luoyang to the west, Jiaozuo to the northwest, Xinxiang to the northeast, Kaifeng to the east, Xuchang to the southeast, and Pingdingshan to the southwest. With the land within its administrative borders generally sloping down from west to east, Zhengzhou is situated at the transitional zone between the North China Plain to the east and the Song Mountains and Xionger Mountains to the west, which are part of the greater Qinling range. The city centre is situated to the south of the middle reach of the Yellow River, where its valley broadens into the great plain. Zhengzhou is at the crossing point of the north\u2013south route skirting the Taihang Mountains and the mountains of western Henan. The prefecture spans 34\u00b0 16' ~ 34\u00b0 58 N latitude and 112\u00b0 42' ~ 114\u00b0 14' E longitude, covering a total area of 7,446.2 square kilometres (2,875.0 sq mi), including the metropolitan area, which covers 1,013.3 km2 (391.2 sq mi), and the city centre, which occupies 147.7 square kilometres (57.0 sq mi).\nThe section of the Yellow River flowing through the prefecture extends 150.4 km (93.5 mi). Mountains loom over the western counties of Gongyi and Dengfeng while the easternmost county of Zhongmu is a vast, fertile floodplain, with the counties in between being hilly transitions.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZhengzhou experiences a monsoon-influenced, four-season humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cwa), with cool, dry winters and hot, humid summers. Spring and autumn are dry and somewhat abbreviated transition periods. The city has an annual mean temperature of 14.73 \u00b0C (58.5 \u00b0F), with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from 0.5 \u00b0C (32.9 \u00b0F) in January to 27.1 \u00b0C (80.8 \u00b0F) in July. The frost-free period lasts on average 220 days. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221217.9 \u00b0C (0 \u00b0F) on 2 January 1955, 27 December 1971 and 1 February 1990 to 43.0 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) on 19 July 1966.Rainfall is primarily produced by the monsoonal low during summer; in winter, when the vast Siberian High dominates due to radiative cooling from further north, the area receives little precipitation. During the summer season, the city is also often affected by tropical depressions, which bring additional amounts of rain. The annual precipitation is about 630 millimetres (25 in). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 45 percent in February and March to 54 percent in May, the city receives 2,182 hours of sunshine per year, which is just under half the possible total.\n\n\n== Administration and demography ==\n\nZhengzhou is divided into 6 urban districts, 5 county-level cities and 1 county. These subdivisions are likely to undergo significant changes in the near future due to increasingly rapid urban expansion and urban planning.\nThe municipality is home to 8,626,505 inhabitants (2010 census) and 6,35 million in its built up area made of 6 urban and suburban districts, Xingyang and Xinzheng cities and now Zhongmu county largely being urbanized, making the city one of the main built-up areas of the province.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nZhengzhou was the capital of China during the Shang dynasty. Parts of the Shang-era capital city wall that were built 3,600 years ago still remain in Downtown Zhengzhou (see Zhengzhou Shang City). Zhengzhou maintains abundant cultural heritages that reflect its glorious history as well as the culture of Henan Province. Zhengzhou Confucius Temple, initially built during the Eastern Han dynasty 1900 years ago, is one of the oldest Confucian Temples in China. Other important architectural heritage sites in the city center include Town God Temple and Erqi Memorial Tower.\nThe internationally known tourist attraction is the Shaolin Monastery, which is in Dengfeng, about 90 kilometres (56 miles) southwest of downtown Zhengzhou (1.5 hours by coach). The Shaolin Monastery is not only known as one of China's most important Buddhist shrines, but also as the ancient center of Chinese Kung-fu. Shaolin Monastery and its famed Pagoda Forest were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010.The Henan Museum is one of China's most important museums. It has a collection of more than 130,000 pieces of cultural relics includes exhibitions from prehistoric times, including dinosaur fossils and prehistoric human remains, up through the modern eras.\nZhengzhou's most developed and modern area is the Zhengdong New Area, which is in the eastern part of the city. It is home to some of the tallest skyscrapers in Zhengzhou, including the 280 metres (918.6 ft) tall Zhengzhou Greenland Plaza (\"Big Corn\"), which is one of the most prominent landmarks in Zhengzhou, and the twin towers of Zhengzhou Greenland Central Plaza (285 metres (935.0 ft)), which are currently the tallest skyscrapers in the city. The tallest structure in Zhengzhou is the 388-meter height Zhongyuan Tower, located on Hanghai East Road in the south of Zhengdong New Area. It is used as a television tower, with a revolving restaurant and an observation deck. The tower is among the tallest towers in the world.\nZhengzhou Zoo (\u90d1\u5dde\u52a8\u7269\u56ed) is located on Huayuan Road (\u82b1\u56ed\u8def).\nThe newly built Zhengzhou Botanic Garden is at the western edge of Zhengzhou city.\nMain attractions of Zhengzhou include:\n\nMount Song (UNESCO Global Geopark)\nShaolin Monastery and Pagoda Forest (UNESCO World Heritage Site)\nDengfeng Observertory (UNESCO World Heritage Site)\nSongyue Pagoda (UNESCO World Heritage Site)\nYellow River Scenic Area\nMausoleums of the Song dynasty\nKang Baiwan's Mansion\nthe birthplace of Yellow Emperor\nErqi Memorial Tower\nHenan Museum\nZhongyuan Tower\nZhengzhou Shang City\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nZhengzhou, along with Xi'an, Chengdu, Chongqing and Wuhan, is one of the most important cities in inland China. It is the economic center of the province and the surrounding areas such as southeastern Shanxi and southwestern Shandong. Due to its strategic location in one of the most populous areas in the world (nearly 100 million people in Henan alone) and in China's railway, road and aviation transport networks, Zhengzhou is increasingly attracting domestic and international investment as well as migrants from other areas, transforming the city into one of the largest economic centers in China. In 2018, total GDP of Zhengzhou was \uffe5 1020 billion, ranked 17th in China.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nBy the end of 2006, Zhengzhou had a total population of over 7 million, of which 2.88 million lived in rural areas.  Its main products include apples, paulownia, tobacco, maize, cotton, and wheat.  In addition, Zhengzhou also produces Yellow River carp, Zhengzhou watermelons, Xinzheng jujube, Xingyang dried persimmons, Guangwu Pomegranate and Zhongmu garlic, all of which are specialties that are rarely found outside the region.\n\n\n=== Mining and manufacturing ===\nZhengzhou and the surrounding area have large reserves of coal and other minerals. Coal mining and electricity generation are traditionally important in the local economy.\nZhengzhou has been one of the major industrial cities in The People's Republic of China since 1949.

        "wiki": "The Shaolin Monastery (Chinese: \u5c11\u6797\u5bfa; pinyin: Sh\u00e0ol\u00edn s\u00ec), also known as the Shaolin Temple, is a Chan (\"Zen\") Buddhist temple in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, China.  Believed to have been founded in the fifth century, the Shaolin Temple is the main temple of the Shaolin school of Buddhism to this day.\nLocated 90 kilometres (56 miles) west of the city of Zhengzhou, the Shaolin Monastery and its Pagoda Forest were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010 as part of the \"Historic Monuments of Dengfeng\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Establishment ===\nThe name refers to the woods of Shaoshi (\u5c11\u5ba4; Sh\u01ceo Sh\u00ec) mountain, one of the seven peaks of the Song mountains. The first Shaolin Monastery abbot was Batuo (also called Fotuo or Buddhabhadra), a dhy\u0101na master who came to ancient China from ancient India or from Central Asia in 464 AD to spread Buddhist teachings.\nAccording to the Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks (645 AD) by Daoxuan, Shaolin Monastery was built on the north side of Shaoshi, the central peak of Mount Song, one of the Sacred Mountains of China, by Emperor Xiaowen of the Northern Wei dynasty in 477 AD, to accommodate the Indian master beside the capital Luoyang city. Yang Xuanzhi, in the Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang (547 AD), and Li Xian, in the Ming Yitongzhi (1461), concur with Daoxuan's location and attribution. The Jiaqing Chongxiu Yitongzhi (1843) specifies that this monastery, located in the province of Henan, was built in the 20th year of the Taihe era of the Northern Wei dynasty, that is, the monastery was built in 495 AD.\nAs the center of Chan Buddhism, the Shaolin Temple attracted many emperors\u2019 attention in China\u2019s history. During the Tang dynasty 618\u2013907 AD Empress Wu Zetian (AD 625\u2013705) paid several visits to the Shaolin Temple discussing Chan philosophy with high monk Tan Zong. According to legend, Emperor Taizong granted the Shaolin Temple extra land and a special \"imperial dispensation\" to consume meat and alcohol during the Tang dynasty. If true, this would have made Shaolin the only temple in China that did not prohibit alcohol. Regardless of historical veracity, these rituals are not practiced today. This legend is not corroborated in any period documents, such as the Shaolin Stele erected in 728. The stele does not list any such imperial dispensation as reward for the monks' assistance during the campaign against Wang Shichong, only land and a water mill are granted. The founder of the Yuan dynasty, Kublai Khan (AD 1215\u20131294) ordered all Buddhist temples in China to be led by the Shaolin Temple; eight princes during the Ming dynasty turned themselves into Shaolin monks.\n\nTraditionally Bodhidharma is credited as founder of the martial arts at the Shaolin Temple. However, martial arts historians have shown this legend stems from a 17th-century qigong manual known as the Yijin Jing.The authenticity of the Yi Jin Jing has been discredited by some historians including Tang Hao, Xu Zhen and Ryuchi Matsuda. This argument is summarized by modern historian Lin Boyuan in his Zhongguo wushu shi:\n\nAs for the \"Yi Jin Jing\" (Muscle Change Classic), a spurious text attributed to Bodhidharma and included in the legend of his transmitting martial arts at the temple, it was written in the Ming dynasty, in 1624, by the Daoist priest Zining of Mt. Tiantai, and falsely attributed to Bodhidharma. Forged prefaces, attributed to the Tang general Li Jing and the Southern Song general Niu Gao were written. They say that, after Bodhidharma faced the wall for nine years at Shaolin temple, he left behind an iron chest; when the monks opened this chest they found the two books \"Xi Sui Jing\" (Marrow Washing Classic) and \"Yi Jin Jing\" within. The first book was taken by his disciple Huike, and disappeared; as for the second, \"the monks selfishly coveted it, practicing the skills therein, falling into heterodox ways, and losing the correct purpose of cultivating the Real. The Shaolin monks have made some fame for themselves through their fighting skill; this is all due to having obtained this manuscript\". Based on this, Bodhidharma was claimed to be the ancestor of Shaolin martial arts. This manuscript is full of errors, absurdities and fantastic claims; it cannot be taken as a legitimate source.\nThe oldest available copy was published in 1827. The composition of the text itself has been dated to 1624. Even then, the association of Bodhidharma with martial arts only became widespread as a result of the 1904\u20131907 serialization of the novel The Travels of Lao Ts'an in Illustrated Fiction Magazine:\nOne of the most recently invented and familiar of the Shaolin historical narratives is a story that claims that the Indian monk Bodhidharma, the supposed founder of Chinese Chan (Zen) Buddhism, introduced boxing into the monastery as a form of exercise around a.d. 525. This story first appeared in a popular novel, The Travels of Lao T\u2019san, published as a series in a literary magazine in 1907. This story was quickly picked up by others and spread rapidly through publication in a popular contemporary boxing manual, Secrets of Shaolin Boxing Methods, and the first Chinese physical culture history published in 1919. As a result, it has enjoyed vast oral circulation and is one of the most \u201csacred\u201d of the narratives shared within Chinese and Chinese-derived martial arts. That this story is clearly a twentieth-century invention is confirmed by writings going back at least 250 years earlier, which mention both Bodhidharma and martial arts but make no connection between the two.\nOther scholars see an earlier connection between Da Mo and the Shaolin Monastery. Scholars generally accept the historicity of Da Mo (Bodhidharma) who arrived in China from his country India around 480. Da Mo (Bodhidharma) and his disciples are said to have lived a spot about a mile from the Shaolin Temple that is now a small nunnery.\nIn the 6th century, around 547, The Record of the Buddhist Monasteries says Da Mo visited the area near Mount Song. In 645 The Continuation of the Biographies of Eminent Monks describes him as being active in the Mount Song region. Around 710 Da Mo is identified specifically with the Shaolin Temple (Precious Record of Dharma's Transmission or Chuanfa Baoji)  and writes of his sitting facing a wall in meditation for many years. It also speaks of Huike's many trials in his efforts to receive instruction from Da Mo.  In the 11th century a (1004) work embellishes Da Mo legends with great detail. A stele inscription at the Shaolin Monastery dated 728 reveals Da Mo residing on Mount Song. Another stele in 798 speaks of Huike seeking instruction from Da Mo. Another engraving dated 1209 depicts the barefoot saint holding a shoe according to the ancient legend of Da Mo.  A plethora of 13th- and 14th-century steles feature Da Mo in Various roles. One 13th-century image shows him riding a fragile stalk across the Yangtze River. In 1125 a special temple was constructed in his honor at the Shaolin Monastery.\n\n\n=== Destructions and renovations ===\nThe monastery has been destroyed and rebuilt many times. During the Red Turban Rebellion in the 14th century, bandits ransacked the monastery for its real or supposed valuables, destroying much of the temple and driving the monks away. The monastery was likely abandoned from 1351 or 1356 (the most likely dates for the attack) to at least 1359, when government troops retook Henan. The events of this period would later figure heavily in 16th-century legends of the temple's patron saint Vajrapani, with the story being changed to claim a victory for the monks, rather than a defeat.In 1641, rebel forces led by Li Zicheng sacked the monastery due to the monks' support of the Ming dynasty and the possible threat they posed to the rebels. This effectively destroyed the temple's fighting force. The temple fell into ruin and was home to only a few monks until the early 18th century, when the government of the Qing dynasty patronized and restored the temple.Perhaps the best-known story of the Temple's destruction is that it was destroyed by the Qing government for supposed anti-Qing activities. Variously said to have taken place in 1647 under the Shunzhi Emperor, in 1674, 1677, or 1714 under the Kangxi Emperor, or in 1728 or 1732 under the Yongzheng Emperor, this destruction is also supposed to have helped spread Shaolin martial arts through China by means of the five fugitive monks. Some accounts claim that a supposed southern Shaolin Temple was destroyed instead of, or in addition to, the temple in Henan: Ju Ke, in the Qing bai lei chao (1917), locates this temple in Fujian province. These stories commonly appear in legendary or popular accounts of martial history, and in wuxia fiction.\nWhile these latter accounts are popular among martial artists, and often serve as origin stories for various martial arts styles, they are viewed by scholars as fictional. The accounts are known through often inconsistent 19th-century secret society histories and popular literature, and also appear to draw on both Fujianese folklore and popular narratives such as the classical novel Water Margin. Modern scholarly attention to the tales is mainly concerned with their role as folklore.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nThere is evidence of Shaolin martial arts being exported to Japan since the 18th century. Martial arts such as Okinawan Sh\u014drin-ry\u016b (\u5c0f\u6797\u6d41) style of Karate, for example, has a name meaning \"Shaolin School\" and the Japanese Shorinji Kempo   (\u5c11\u6797\u5bfa\u62f3\u6cd5) is translated as \"Shaolin Temple Fist Method\". Other similarities can be seen in centuries-old Chinese and Japanese martial arts manuals.In 1928, the warlord Shi Yousan set fire to the monastery, burning it for over 40 days, destroying a significant percent of the buildings, including many manuscripts of the temple library.The Cultural Revolution launched in 1966 targeted religious orders including the monastery. The five monks who were present at the monastery when the Red Guards attacked were shackled and made to wear placards declaring the crimes charged against them. The monks were jailed after publicly being flogged and paraded through the street as people threw rubbish at them. The government purged Buddhist materials from within the monastery walls, leaving it barren for years.The film crew for the Jet Li movie Martial Arts of Shaolin was shocked to find that there were no remaining monks when they filmed at the monastery complex in 1986.Martial arts groups from all over the world have made donations for the upkeep of the temple and grounds, and are subsequently honored with carved stones near the entrance of the temple. In the past, many have tried to capitalise on Shaolin Monastery fame by building their own schools on Mount Song. However, the Chinese government eventually outlawed this; the schools were moved to the nearby towns.A dharma gathering was held from 19 August to 20 August 1999, in Shaolin Monastery for Shi Yongxin's assumption of office as abbot. Over the next two decades the Monastery grew into a global business empire. In March 2006, Russian President Vladimir Putin became the first foreign leader to visit the monastery. In 2007, the Chinese government partially lifted the 300-year ban of the Jieba, the ancient ceremony of the nine marks which are burned onto the head with sticks of incense. The ban was lifted only for those who were mentally and physically prepared to participate in the tradition.Two modern bathrooms were recently added to the temple for use by monks and tourists. The new bathrooms reportedly cost three million yuan to build. Films have also been released like Shaolin Temple and more recently, Shaolin starring Andy Lau.In 1994 the temple registered its name as a trademark. In the late 2000s, Shi Yongxin began authorizing Shaolin branches outside of mainland China in what has been called a franchise scheme. The branches are run by current and former monks and allow dispersion of Shaolin culture and study of Shaolin kung fu around the world. As of January, 2011, Yongxin and the temple operated over 40 companies in cities across the world, including London and Berlin, which have purchased land and property.In 2018, for the first time in its 1500-year history, the Shaolin Monastery raised the national flag as a part of a \"patriotism drive\" under the new National Religious Affairs Administration, a part of the United Front Work Department which \"oversees propaganda efforts as well as relations with the global Chinese diaspora\". Senior theology lecturer Sze Chi Chan of Hong Kong Baptist University analyzes this move as General Secretary Xi Jinping making an example of the Shaolin Monastery to send a message to other temples and the Chinese Catholic Church.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nThe Shaolin Monastery was historically led by an abbot, but the communist era restrictions on religious expression and independence have since changed this ancient system. The monastery is currently led by a committee composed primarily of government officials. The treasurer is appointed by the government, and as such the abbot has little control over finances. Profits are split with Dengfeng; the municipality takes two thirds of the profits and the monastery retains one third.\n\n\n== Shaolin temple buildings ==\nThe temple's inside area is 160 by 360 meters (520 ft \u00d7 1,180 ft), that is, 57,600 square meters (620,000 sq ft). It has seven main halls on the axis and seven other halls around, with several yards around the halls. The temple structure includes:\n\nMountain Gate (\u5c71\u95e8; shan men) (built 1735; The entrance tablet written with golden characters \"Shaolin Temple\" (\u5c11\u6797\u5bfa; shao lin si) in black background by the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty in 1704).\nForest of Steles (\u7891\u6797; bei lin)\nCiyun Hall  (\u6148\u96f2\u5802; ci yun tang) (built 1686; changed 1735; reconstructed 1984).

There has also been a Northern Shaolin monastery in northern China. Associated with stories of the supposed burning of Shaolin by the Qing government and with the tales of the Five Elders, this temple, sometimes known by the name Changlin, is often claimed to have been either the target of Qing forces or a place of refuge for monks displaced by attacks on the Shaolin Monastery in Henan. Besides the debate over the historicity of the Qing-era destruction, it is currently unknown whether there was a true southern temple, with several locations in Fujian given as the location for the monastery. Fujian does have a historic monastery called Changlin, and a monastery referred to as a \"Shaolin cloister\" has existed in Fuqing, Fujian, since the Song dynasty, but whether these have an actual connection to the Henan monastery or a martial tradition is still unknown. The Southern Temple has been a popular subject of wuxia fiction, first appearing in the 1893 novel Shengchao Ding Sheng Wannian Qing, where it is attacked by the Qianlong Emperor with the help of the White Eyebrow Taoist.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nShaolin Temple UK\nYuekong\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nHenning, Stanley (1994), \"Ignorance, Legend and Taijiquan\" (PDF), Journal of the Chenstyle Taijiquan Research Association of Hawaii, 2 (3): 1\u20137\nHenning, Stan; Green, Tom (2001), Folklore in the Martial Arts.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Longmen Grottoes (simplified Chinese: \u9f99\u95e8\u77f3\u7a9f; traditional Chinese: \u9f8d\u9580\u77f3\u7a9f; pinyin: L\u00f3ngm\u00e9n Sh\u00edk\u016b; lit.: 'Dragon's Gate Grottoes') or Longmen Caves are some of the finest examples of Chinese Buddhist art. Housing tens of thousands of statues of Shakyamuni Buddha and his disciples, they are located 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) south of present-day Luoyang in Henan province, China. The images, many once painted, were carved as outside rock reliefs and inside artificial caves excavated from the limestone cliffs of the Xiangshan (\u9999\u5c71) and Longmenshan, running east and west. The Yi River (Chinese: \u4f0a\u6cb3) flows northward between them and the area used to be called Yique (\u4f0a\u9619; 'The Gate of the Yi River'). The alternative name of \"Dragon's Gate Grottoes\" derives from the resemblance of the two hills that check the flow of the Yi River to the typical \"Chinese gate towers\" that once marked the entrance to Luoyang from the south.\nThere are as many as 100,000 statues within the 2,345 caves, ranging from 1 inch (25 mm) to 57 feet (17 m) in height. The area also contains nearly 2,500 stelae and inscriptions, hence the name \u201cForest of Ancient Stelae\", as well as over sixty Buddhist pagodas. Situated in a scenic natural environment, the caves were dug from a 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) stretch of cliff running along both banks of the river. 30% date from the Northern Wei and 60% from the Tang dynasty, caves from other periods accounting for less than 10% of the total. Starting with the Northern Wei Dynasty in 493 AD, patrons and donors included emperors, Wu Zetian, members of the royal family, other rich families, generals, and religious groups.In 2000 the site was inscribed upon the UNESCO World Heritage List as \u201can outstanding manifestation of human artistic creativity,\u201d for its perfection of an art form, and for its encapsulation of the cultural sophistication of Tang China.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThis complex is one of the three notable grottoes in China.  The other two grottoes are the Yungang Caves near Datong in Shanxi Province, and the Mogao Caves near Dunhuang in Gansu Province. The valley formed by the Yi River enclosed by two hills ranges of Xiangshan (to the east) and Longmenshan (to the west) hills have steep slopes on the western and eastern slopes along the river. Yi is a north flowing tributary of the Luo River. The grottoes are formed in 1 km of the stretch of this river and were carved on both banks, in limestone formations creating the Longmen Caves.  Most of the work was done on the western bank, while the eastern bank caves, of smaller numbers, served as residences for the large groups of monks.Within the approximately 1,400 caves, there are 100,000 statues, some of which are only 1 inch (25 mm) high, while the largest Buddha statue is 57 feet (17 m) in height. There are also approximately 2500 stelae and 60 pagodas.  The grottoes are located on both sides of the Yi River. Fifty large and medium-sized caves are seen on the west hill cliffs which are credited to the Northern, Sui, and Tang Dynasties, while the caves on the east hill were carved entirely during the Tang Dynasty. The plethora of caves, sculptures and pagodas in Longmen Grottoes depict a definite \"progression in style\" with the early caves being simple and well shaped with carvings of statues of Buddha and religious people. The change of style is more distinct in the Tang Dynastic periods which are \u201cmore complex and incorporate women and court figures as well\u201d. The caves have been numbered sequentially from north to south along the west bank of the Yi River. Entry to the caves is from the northern end.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe earliest history of the creation of Longmen Grottoes is traced to the reign of Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei dynasty when he shifted his capital to Luoyang from D\u00e0t\u00f3ng; Luoyang's symbolic value is borne by the fact that it served as the historic capital for 13 dynasties. The grottoes were excavated and carved with Buddhist subjects over the period from 493 AD to 1127 AD, in four distinct phases. The first phase started with the Northern Wei dynasty (493\u2013534). The second phase saw slow development of caves as there was interruption due to strife in the region, between 524 and 626, during the reign of the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618) and the early part of the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907). The third phase, was during the reign of the Tang dynasty when Chinese Buddhism flourished and there was a proliferation of caves and carvings from 626 to the mid 8th century. The last phase, which was the fourth, was from the later part of the Tang dynastic rule extending to the Northern Song Dynasty rule, which saw a decline in the creation of grottoes.  It came to an end due to internecine war between the Jin and Yuan dynasties.Guyangdong or the Shiku Temple, credited to Emperor Xiaowen, was the first cave temple to be built at the center of the southern floor of the West Hill. Emperor Xuanwu of Northern Wei followed up this activity and excavated three more caves, two in memory of his father, Emperor Xiaowen, and one in memory of his mother; all three caves are grouped under the title of the \"Three Binyang Caves\" (Binyangsandong), which were built by the emperor over a 24-year period. Over 30% of the caves seen now were built during this period.In 527, the Huangfugong or Shikusi grottoes, a major cave, was completed. It is a well conserved cave located to the south of the West Hill.In 675, Fengxiansi Cave, on the southern floor of the West Hill was completed during the Tang dynasty rule. This marked the third phase of creation and the peak period of the gottoes' creation.  It is estimated that 60% of the caves seen at Longmen came about in this period from 626 till 755. During this period, in addition to the caves which housed Buddha statues of various sizes, some Buddhist temples were also built in open spaces with scenic settings in the same complex.  However, these are now mostly in ruins. During this phase, Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu Zetian were instrumental in intensifying the activity when they were ruling from Luyong.\n\n\n=== Later history ===\nDuring the period of 1368 to 1912, when two dynasties ruled in China, namely the Ming dynasty from 1368 to 1644, and the Qing dynasty from 1644 to 1912, there was cultural revival and the Longmen Grottoes received recognition both at the national and international level.\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese looted the site and took many of the statues back to Japan. Many of these relics are now in Japanese museums.\nVandalism occurred in the 1940s, a result of political unrest.  With the establishment of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949, the grottoes have been declared as protected area and are being conserved. The Constitution of China, under Article 22, which among other issues also provides for protection of the natural heritage sites, has been further defined under various legal instruments enacted to protect and conserve this cultural heritage of China.The Longmen Relics Care Agency was established in 1953 under the Ministry of Culture. A 1954 site inventory was undertaken by the newly established Longmen Caves Cultural Relics Management and Conservation Office.  The State Council declared the Longmen Grottoes as a national cultural monument needing special protection in 1961. In 1982, it was declared as one of the first group of scenic zones to be protected at the state level.  The Management and Conservation Office was renamed the Longmen Grottoes Research Institute in 1990; and the People\u2019s Government of Luoyang City became responsible for the management of the heritage monuments. The governing organization was renamed the Longmen Grottoes Research Academy in 2002.During the Warring States period, the general Bai Qi of Qin once defeated the allied forces of Han and Wei at the site. The site was subjected to significant vandalism at several points in its history. Major artifacts were removed by Western collectors and souvenir hunters during the early 20th century. The heads of many statues were also destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. Two murals taken from the grottoes are reported to be displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\n\n== Panorama ==\n\n\n== Grottoes ==\n\nThere are several major grottoes with notable displays of Buddhist sculptures and calligraphic inscriptions. Some of the main caves and the year when work began within them include: Guyang-dong (493), Binyang-dong (505), Lianhua-dong (520s), Weizi-dong (522), Shiku-si (520s), Weizi-dong (520s), Shisku (520s), Yaofang-dong (570), Zhaifu-dong (ca. 636), Huijian-dong (630s), Fahua-dong (650s), Fengxian-si (672), Wanfo-si (670-680s), Jinan-dong (684), Ganjing-si (684), and Leigutai-dong (684). The Guyang, Binyang, and Lianhua caves are horseshoe-shaped.\n\n\n=== Guyangdong ===\nGuyangdong, or Guyang Cave, or Old Sun Cave, is recorded as the oldest Longmen cave with carvings in the Northern Wei style. It is also the largest cave, located in the central part of the west hill. It was carved under the orders of Emperor Xiaowen. The earliest carving in this limestone cave has been now dated at 478 AD, during the period when Emperor Xiaowen is thought to have been moving his capital from Datong to Luoyang. The Buddhist statues in the niches of this cave are very well sculpted.  Also found here are 600 inscriptions in fine calligraphy of writings in the Northern Wei style. Many of the sculptures inside the cave were contributed by royalty; religious groups supported this activity. The cave has three very large images \u2013 the central image is of Sakyamuni Buddha with Bodhisattvas on either side. The features of the images are indicative of the Northern Wei style, typically of slim and emaciated figures. There are about 800 inscriptions on the walls and in the niches inside the cave, the most in any cave in China. There are two rows of niches on the northern and southern walls of the cave, which house a very large number of images; the artists have recorded their names, the dates, and the reasons for carving them.\n\n\n=== Binyang ===\nBinyang has three caves, North Binyang Cave, Middle Binyang Cave and South Binyang Cave, of which the Middle Binyang Cave is the most prominent.\n\nBinyangzhongdong\nBinyangzhongdong (Chinese: \u5bbe\u9633\u4e2d\u6d1e) or the Middle Binyang Cave, is carved in the Datang style on the west hill, on the northern floor.  It was built by Emperor Xuanwun to commemorate his father Xiaowen, and also his mother. It is said that 800,000 workers created it over the period from 500 to 523. In the main wall of this cave, five very large Buddhist statues are carved all in Northern Wei style The central statue is of Sakyamuni Buddha with four images of Bodhisattvas flanking it. Two side walls also have Buddha images flanked by Bodhisattva. The Buddhas, arranged in three groups in the cave, are representative of Buddhas of the past, the present, and the future. The canopy in the roof is designed as a lotus flower. There were two large bas-reliefs of imperial processions, that included Emperor Xiaowen, Empress Dowager Wenzhao, and the emperor's late parents in worship. The reliefs were stolen completely in the mid-1930s. The emperor's procession is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and two thirds of the empress's is in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City. While a few statues are sculpted with \"long features, thin faces, fishtail robes and traces of Greek influence\", others are in Tang period natural style and heavily built.\nBinyangnandongBinyangnandong (\u5bbe\u9633\u5357\u6d1e), or the South Binyang Cave, has five very large images which were carved by Li Tai, the fourth son of Emperor Taizong of Tang, the first Tang Emperor. He made them in 641 AD in memory of his mother Empress Zhangsun. The central image in a serene appearance is that of Amitabha Buddha seated on a pedestal surrounded by Bodhisattvas, also serene looking in a blend of the Northern Wei and the Tang Dynasty styles.\n\n\n=== Fengxian ===\n\nFengxian, or Feng Xian Si (\u5949\u5148\u5bfa), or Li Zhi cave is the Ancestor Worshipping Cave, which is the largest of all caves carved on the west hill built between 672 and 676 for Empress Wu Zetian. The carvings are claimed to be the ultimate in architectural perfection of the Tang dynasty. The shrine inside the cave measures 39 m x35m. It has the largest Buddha statue at the Longmen Grottoes. Of the nine huge carved statues, the highly impressive image of Vairocana Buddha is sculpted on the back wall of the Fengxian. The image is 17.14m high and has 2 m long ears. An inscription at the base of this figure gives 676 as the year of carving. The Bodhisattva on the left of the main image of Buddha is decorated with a crown and pearls. Also shown is a divine person trampling an evil spirit. The main Vairocana image's features are plumpish and of peaceful and natural expression. Each of the other large statues are carved with expressions matching their representative roles. These were carved at the orders of Empress Wu Zetian, and are considered uniquely representative of the Tang dynasty's \"vigorous, elegant and realistic style.\" The huge Vairocana statue is considered as \"the quintessence of Buddhist sculpture in China.\"The Vairocana statue also provides at its base the names of the artisans who worked here, the name of the Emperor Gaozong, who was the donor, and also honors Wu Zetian. It is said that Wu Zetian donated \"twenty-thousand strings of her rouge and powder money\" to complete this edifice. Hence, it is conjectured that the Vairocana Buddha was carved to resemble the Empress herself and termed a \"Chinese Mona Lisa, Venus or as the Mother of China\". All the images here, which remain undamaged, project character and animation. Statues of Kasyapa and Ananda, the two principal disciples of Vairocana, and of two Bodhisattvas with crowns flank the main statue, in addition to numerous images of \"lokapalas (guardians or heavenly kings), dvarapalas (temple guards), flying devas and numerous other figures.\"\n\n\n=== Others ===\nHuangfugongHuangfugong, or Shikusi, a three-wall, three-niche cave, is situated south of the west hill, was carved out in 527.  It was completed at one stretch as a single unit and is very well preserved. There are seven Buddhas carved on the lintel which give the appearance of a wood finish. Seven very large images are seen in the main hall with the Buddha image flanked by two Bodhisattvas and two disciples. Also seen are images of Buddhist groups in the niches of the cave. A very large design of a lotus flower is carved in the roof, flanked by eight musical apsaras (water spirits or nymphs). It was created by Huangfu Du, uncle of Empress Hu.\nWan-fo-dungWan-fo-dung (\"Cave of Ten Thousand Buddhas\"\u4e07\u4f5b\u6d1e), or Yung-lung-tung, was built in 680 by Gaozong and Wu Zetian. It houses 15,000 Buddhas carved in small niches, different from each other, with the smallest Buddha being 2 centimetres (0.79 in) in height.\nYaofangdongYaofangdong (\u836f\u65b9\u6d1e), or the Medical Prescription Cave, has small inscriptions of 140 medical prescriptions for a wide range of medical problems from the common cold to insanity. These are seen carved right at the entrance on both walls. These carvings are dated from the late Northern Wei period to the early Tang Dynasty.\nQianxisi\nReached by modern, concrete stairs up the face of a cliff, Qianxisi, or Hidden Stream Temple Cave, is a large cave on the northern edge of the west hill. Made during Gaozong's reign (653\u201380), the cave has a statue of a huge, seated, early Tang Buddha (Amitabha Buddha), flanked by statues of the Bodhisattvas Avalokitesvara and Mahasthamaprapta.  The statues are carved with a sophisticated expression typical of Tang style. It may have been sponsored by the Nanping princess, with the beneficiary being Gaozong, her recently deceased father.\nLianhuaThe Lianhua or the Lotus Flower Cave (\u83b2\u82b1\u6d1e), dated to 527, belongs to the Northern Wei period. The Grotto has a large lotus flower carved in high relief on its ceiling. Several small Buddhas are carved into the south wall. Also seen are shrines in the south and north wall in the niches.\nLaolongThe Laolong or the Old Dragon Cave (\u8001\u9f99\u6d1e) created during the Tang Dynasty period, named after the Old Dragon Palace, has many niches dated to Gaozong\u2019s reign.\n\n\n== Temples ==\n\nThere are the several temples at Longmen Grottoes. Some important ones include Xiangshan Temple, Bai Garden temple, and the Tomb of Bai Juyi. Others are Tongle temple, begun under Emperor Mingyuan; Lingyan and Huguo temples, under Emperor Wencheng; Tiangong temple, under Xiaowen; and Chongfu temple, under Qianer.\n\n\n=== Xiangshan Temple ===\nXiangshan Temple is one of the earliest of the ten temples at Longmen. It is located in the midsection of the east hill. The name 'Xiangshan' is derived from the name of the spices \"Xiangge\" found extensively on these hill slopes. It was reconstructed some time in 1707, during the reign of the Qing Dynasty, patterned on an old temple that existed there. Longmen Grottoes Administration, expanded the temple in 2002, by adding the \"Belfry, the Drum Tower, the Wing Room, the Hall of Mahavira and Hall of Nine Persons, Eighteen Arhats, the Villa of Chiang Kai-shek and Soong Mei-ling\". New additions included board walks, compound wall and a new gate from the southern end of the temple.\n\n\n=== Bai Garden temple ===\n\nBai Garden is temple situated on the Pipa peak, to the north of the east hill (Xiangshan Hill). It was re-built in 1709 by Tang Youzeng of the Qing Dynasty. The temple is surrounded by thick vegetation of pine and cypress trees.\n\n\n=== Tomb of Bai Juyi ===\nThe Tomb of Bai Juyi on the east bank is that of the well-known poet during the Tang Dynasty who lived in Luoyang during his later years. The tomb is located on the hill top. It is approached from the west bank after crossing a bridge across the Yi River. The tomb is a circular mound of earth of 4 meters height with a circumference of 52 meters. The tomb is 2.80 meters high and has the poet's name inscribed on it as Bai Juyi.\n\n\n== Preservation and restoration ==\n\nOne of the major achievements in this direction is the recognition given to the monuments by UNESCO in declaring the Longmen Grottoes a heritage monument, after due evaluation over a period, and inscribing it in the World Heritage List. The recognition is based on Criteria (i), (ii), and (iii): \"Criterion (i), the sculptures of the Longmen Grottoes are an outstanding manifestation of human artistic creativity; Criterion (ii) the Longmen Grottoes illustrate the perfection of a long-established art form which was to play a highly significant role in the cultural evolution of this region of Asia; and Criterion (iii), the high cultural level and sophisticated society of Tang Dynasty China is encapsulated in the exceptional stone carvings of the Longmen Grottoes.\" This also enjoins the Government of China to take adequate steps to preserve the monument in its heritage status according to guidelines issued from time to time after frequent inspections of the site.The Longmen Grottoes have undergone many concerted efforts of identifying, demarcating, planning, and implementing restoration works since 1951. To start with, a weather monitoring station was established near the grottoes to assess the environmental conditions prevailing in the area and to plan appropriate restoration measures. This was followed by intensive restoration works, initially in the form of strengthening the rock bases to arrest seepage of water from the roofs and sides of the grottoes. Overgrown vegetation with roots was cleared. Means of access to the caves were newly installed in the form of railings, footpaths and walkways with steps. All the efforts taken by the government of China over the last nearly six decades has ensured that the grottoes are preserved in a fairly presentable state of conservation.  All this has been achieved by the integrated action of three institutions, namely: the China Institution of Cultural Relics Protection, who provided the professional scientific inputs, the China University of Geosciences, and the Longmen Cultural Relics Care Agency. Funds for the studies and restoration works have been provided for under the Revised Five-Year and Ten-Year Plans approved by the People\u2019s Government of Luoyang City in 1999.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChinese art\nMogao Caves\nPrinciples for the Conservation of Heritage Sites in China\nYungang Grottoes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in English) UNESCO \u2013 Longmen Grottoes\nPhotos\nWisdom embodied: Chinese Buddhist and Daoist sculpture in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a collection catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries (fully available online as PDF), which contains material on the Longmen Grottoes",

          "We hired a private guide and took the train from Xi'an for a day trip. Next time I'd probably overnight here. It is an amazing site and stunning work. We took the shuttle to and from the site and in this extreme heat and shortened time frame it was well worth it.",
          "We adored it: it\u2019s a place to visit absolutely. It\u2019s well organized and even if it\u2019s crowded you can enjoy it and take your time to take some good pictures. In summer time is very hot so bring some water with you or buy some long the way. It might be comfortable taking an",
          "If you are in Xi'an Province it is very convenience to take a bullet train to Longmen Grottoes, Luoyang. The location was equipped with buggy, ferry rides and shops. What will you witness was years of dedications and faith of an individual to carve the Buddha images inside the",

          "Absolutely remarkable - intricate carvings/sculptures (around 110,000 of them) that were created over several hundred years, the earliest one that you'll see and that's still relatively well preserved dates back to 420AD. The visitor center (northwest gate) is ridiculously far",
          "Assuming your a solo traveller and not part of a group, starting from Luoyang. Luoyang is still basically laid out in the ancient Chinese style of a rigid grid pattern. Because the river runs through it there are some distortions. To get to the grottos you want the K81 Bus,",

          "Yes, this is part of the Longmen grottoes, and equally worthwhile. A place to go if in the area at all. But try to go on day without rain, the stairs may be slippery when wet!",
          "I am not much of a \"cave man\", but the Longmen grottoes, caves and carvings are truly impressive. Imagine these huge carvings were made starting some sixteen hundred years ago, with chisel and hammer, out of the rock hard cliff sides. It must have taken a lot of people,",
          "It was one of my personal highlights of our trip to China. I found many of the statues and scenes intriguing. It is well worth the climb to see the stone carvings.",
          "An exceptional destination, one with tremendous historical significance, well preserved but also with many scars of past looting. The park is pretty well organized and a full walk through would take at least several hours. Some pretty serious climbing could be needed so not",

          "It is a must-see even if it is crowded. Very special example of religious art that was created through many centuries. The Buddha statues of different sizes are wonderful, unbelievable how they were carved into the rocks. Also the landscape on both sides of the river is beautiful",

          "It is certainly worth the visit. It is really amazing to see so many Buddha statues in caves. To really appreciate the Grottoes, I would suggest doing some reading on the history (the northern Wei, second Zhou and Tang dynasties). The view across the river from Manshui bridge",
          "You can't say you have visited Luoyang unless you visited Longmen Grottoes. It's only 20 minutes from Luoyang High Speed rail station. From the main entrance where you get the ticket/parking lot (plenty of parking), you will take the electrical car for about 10 minutes. From",
          "I visited here as part of a 32-day solo holiday with China Private Tours. Longmen Grotto is situated in Luoyang, about half way between Xian and Zhengzhou and is around a 90-minute bullet train ride from both. Longmen is a major attraction in the region and should be on any tour",

          "We went with a tour guide in a small group of five and it was a wonderful trip. Other than the history and facts as detailed by the guide, the sceneries on the banks of Yihe river was fabulous. I would advise to visit China at around this time of the year (November) when it is",
          "The carvings were terrific. It is such a shame that over time they have been looted/ partially destroyed. Lots of stairs to climb, so pop on the good walking shoes. Worth ascending the stairs though.",

          "The main highlight of the Longmen Grottoes is the tall mountain in the centre of the western caves. It's a very steep climb, but well worth it as this has the largest of all the carvings. It will be crowded, no matter what. You can only visit the mountain as part of the Longmen",
          "You could be forgiven for thinking you were India if you visit the Longmen Caves. It's certainly unique amongst anything I've ever seen in China and very like the stone carving I more associate with India. Getting to the caves is very easy. Take the 56 bus all the way from",

          "The statues was amazing. The grotto lies on both sides of a river and the entire landscape is very scenic. We went during low season so there weren't many people so it felt really intimate and I was just in complete awe at the size of the statues. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "A historic site that is a must see! The 10,000 Buddhas are amazing. Some of the Buddhas are 8 stories tall, and so stunningly artistic. You also will see and meet people who are on pilgrimages there to honor Buddha and worship. It is stunning what ancient people were able to do.",

          "The most impressive figure is the statue of Vairocana Buddha sitting cross-legged on the eight-square lotus throne. You must be able to climb about 160 steps to reach it. It is definitely worth seeing. Best view of the whole mountain is from the opposite side of the river.",

          "What an absolute wonder is to walk around the Grottoes even when you are surrounded by millions of Chinese tourists pushing you around its worth every minute. The main Grottoe is the most spectacular one but its a fair work from the entrance as you walk towards the Grottoes",
          "We spent a few hours at the sight and saw the carvings up close, but you only really appreciate the largest carving from across the river.",
          "I'm not sure why people would say that this place is terrible, maybe it attracts a LOT of local tourists or it's hard for people to have a long walk and climb the stairs. The place is not physically challenged friendly for sure, it's a long walk plus climbing all the flight of",

          "It is a nice place where you can also learn some Chinese history. Unfortunately, it hasn't been possible keeping all the statues in perfect state and most of them miss heads and/or fingers. Worth a visit in any case.",
          "This site is well laid out for tourists, and very popular with locals groups. The carvings and impressive and with steps up to most of them you can get some good views. If you walk over the bridge you can look back on the cliff face and it really gives you an idea of the scale",
          "This place is quite interesting to see how locals will carve sculptures in the limestones. Quite a fair bit of walking up and down the stairs if you want to see all the different carvings. However, I must say to me after a while it was just not worth the climbing up and down",
          "So cool! Make sure you do go to this! Wear comfy shoes and clothing as you well be doing quiet a bit of walking and using stairs. We did every cave we could and it was worth it. We took the go cart from the beginning and back. If you have to pay extra do if. Don't forget",

          "This place is really amazing. The sense of place and scale affected by these literally thousands rock-carved niches and statues transports you to another era. Considering that the project begun over 1500 years ago, and was carried out over subsequent centuries, makes it all that",

        "wiki": "Kisho Kurokawa (\u9ed2\u5ddd \u7d00\u7ae0, Kurokawa Kish\u014d) (April 8, 1934 \u2013 October 12, 2007) was a leading Japanese architect and one of the founders of the Metabolist Movement.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Kanie, Aichi, Kurokawa studied architecture at Kyoto University, graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1957. He then attended University of Tokyo, under the supervision of Kenzo Tange. Kurokawa received a master's degree in 1959. Kurokawa then went on to study for a doctorate of philosophy, but subsequently dropped out in 1964. Kisho Kurokawa was conferred an Honorary Doctorate of Architecture by the Chancellor of Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), Malaysia in Sept. 7, 2002.\nWith colleagues, he cofounded the Metabolist Movement in 1960, whose members were known as Metabolists. It was a radical Japanese avant-garde movement pursuing the merging and recycling of architecture styles within an Asian context. The movement was very successful, peaking when its members received praise for the Takara Cotillion Beautillion at the Osaka World Expo 1970. The group was dismantled shortly thereafter.\n\nKurokawa had a daughter, potter Kako Matsuura, and a son, renowned photographer Mikio, from his first marriage to his college classmate. His second marriage was to actress Ayako Wakao (\u82e5\u5c3e \u6587\u5b50 Wakao Ayako), one of Japan's biggest movie stars of the 20th century. Kurokawa's younger brother works in industrial design but has also cooperated with Kurokawa on some architecture projects.\nKurokawa was the founder and president of Kisho Kurokawa Architect & Associates, established 8 April 1962. The enterprise's head office is in Tokyo with branch offices in Osaka, Nagoya, Nur-Sultan, Kuala Lumpur, Beijing and Los Angeles. The company is registered with the Japanese government as a \"First Class Architects Office.\"\nAlthough he had practiced the concept of sustainable and eco-minded architecture for four decades, Kisho Kurokawa became more adamant about environmental protection in his latter years. In 2007, he ran for governor of Tokyo and then for a seat in the House of Councillors in the 2007 Japanese House of Councillors election. Although not elected, Kisho Kurokawa successfully established the Green Party to help provide environmental protection.  Also in 2007, Kurokawa created the structure of the Anaheim University Kisho Kurokawa Green Institute, which helps to develop environmentally-conscious business practices.  Kurokawa was a stakeholder and founding Chair of the Executive Advisory Board of the Anaheim, California-based university since 1998 and his wife Ayako Wakao-Kurokawa serves as Honorary Chairman of the institute.\nKurokawa wrote extensively on philosophy and architecture and lectured widely. He wrote that there are two traditions inherent in any culture: the visible and the invisible. His work, he claimed, carried the invisible tradition of Japan. In 1972, he received a grant from the Graham Foundation to deliver a lecture at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.\nLooking at his architecture\u2014particularly at metabolism\u2014tradition may not appear to be present, but, underneath the hard skin of the surface, his work is indeed Japanese. However, it is difficult to claim that the modern technologies and material he called on was inherited from the Japanese tradition and that the traditional forms of Japanese architecture can be recognized in his contemporary concrete or steel towers. Yet, Kurokawa's architecture evolved from the Japanese tradition, and there is a Japanese aesthetic in the context of his work. His architecture focused on keeping traditional Japanese concepts invisible, especially materiality, impermanence, receptivity and detail. Kurokawa specifically referred to these four factors in his discussions of new wave Japanese Architecture.\nHe died of heart failure on October 12, 2007; he was 73.\n\n\n== Key architectural concepts ==\n\n\n=== Impermanence ===\n\nKurokawa noted that, with the exception of Kyoto and Kanazawa, most Japanese cities were destroyed during World War II. When Western cities are destroyed, brick and stone remained as proof of their past existence. Sadly, remarks Kurokawa, Japan's cities were mostly built of wood and natural elements, so they burnt to ashes and disappeared completely. He also noted that both Edo (now Tokyo) and Kyoto were almost entirely destroyed during several battles of the Warring States period in the 15th and 16th centuries. The shifting of power caused parts of Japan to be destroyed. On the same note, historically speaking, Japan's cities have almost yearly been hit with natural disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons, floods and volcanic eruptions. This continuous destruction of buildings and cities has given the Japanese population, in Kurokawa's words, \u201can uncertainty about existence, a lack of faith in the visible, a suspicion of the eternal.\u201d\nIn addition, the four seasons are very clearly marked in Japan, and the changes through the year are dramatic. Time, then, in Japanese culture is a precious entity that forces every candle, every being, every entity to fade at one point in time. The idea that buildings and cities should seem as natural as possible and that they should be in harmony with the rest of nature, since it is only temporarily there, helped create the tradition of making buildings and cities of \u201ctemporary\u201d structure.\nThis idea of impermanence was reflected in Kurokawa's work during the Metabolism Movement. Buildings were built to be removable, interchangeable and adaptable. The concept of impermanence influence his work toward being in open systems, both in time and space.\n\n\n=== Materiality ===\n\nKurokawa explains that the Japanese tried to exploit the natural textures and colors of materials used in a building. The traditional tea room was intentionally built of only natural materials such as earth and sand, paper, the stems and leaves of plants, and small trees. Trees from a person's own backyard were preferred for the necessary timbers. All artificial colors were avoided, and the natural colors and texture of materials were shown to their best advantage. This honesty in materials stemmed from the idea that nature is already beautiful in itself. The Japanese feel that food tastes better, wood looks better, materials are better when natural. There is a belief that maximum enjoyment comes from the natural state.\nThis tradition on materiality was alive in Kurokawa's work which treated iron as iron, aluminum as aluminum, and made the most of the inherent finish of concrete. The tradition of honesty of materiality is present in Kurokawa's capsule building. In it, he showed technology with \u201cno artificial colors.\" The capsule, escalator unit, elevator unit and pipe and ductwork were all exterior and exposed. Kurokawa opened structures and made no attempt to hide the connective elements, believing that beauty was inherent in each of the individual parts. This bold approach created a texture of elements that became the real materiality of the whole.\n\n\n=== Receptivity ===\nThe notion of receptivity is a crucial Japanese idea\u2014possibly a \u201ctradition.\" Kurokawa stated that Japan is a small country. For more than a thousand years, the Japanese had an awareness of neighboring China and Korea and, in the modern age, Portugal, Great Britain and America, to name a few. The only way for a small country like Japan to avoid being attacked by these empires was to make continuous attempts to absorb foreign cultures for study and, while establishing friendly relations with the larger nations, preserve its own identity. This receptivity is the aspect that allowed Japan to grow from a farming island into an imperial nation, first using Chinese political systems and Chinese advancement, then Western techniques and knowledge. Japan eventually surpassed China and stumbled upon itself during World War II. After the war, Japan, using this same perspective absorbed American culture and technology.\nKurokawa's architecture follows the string of receptivity but, at one point, tries to diverge and find its own identity. At first, Kurokawa's work followed the Modern Movement that was introduced in Japan by Tange, Isozaki and their peers. Tange showed the world that Japan could build modern buildings. His peers followed and continued the style. Then at one point in the 1960s, Kurokawa and a small group of architects began a new wave of contemporary Japanese architecture, believing that previous solutions and imitations were not satisfactory for the new era: life was not present in Modernism. They labeled their approach \u201cmetabolism.\" Kurokawa's work became receptive \u201cto his own philosophy, the Principle of Life.\" (He saw architecture and cities as a dynamic process where parts needed to be ready for change. He mostly used steel in open frames and units that were prefabricated and interchangeable.)\n\n\n=== Detail ===\nKurokawa explained that the attention paid to detail in Japanese work derived essentially from the typical attempt to express individuality and expertise. In Japan the execution of details was a process of working not from the whole to the parts but from the parts to the whole. Every wood connection in a house was carefully crafted from the inside out. Japan is a country that moved from a non-industrial country to a fully industrial nation in less than 50 years, during the Meiji revolution. This sharp jump from producing goods by craftsmen to industrially realized production was so rapid that the deep-rooted tradition of fine craftsmanship as a statement of the creator did not disappear. As a result, the Japanese maker continues to be instilled with a fastidious preoccupation for fine details, which can be seen in contemporary architecture, art and industry. The attention to detail, an integral part of Japan's tradition, forms a uniquely indigenous aesthetic.Similarly, Kurokawa's architecture features carefully detailed connections and finishes. He confessed: \u201cThis attention to detail is also an important key to understand my own architecture. The belief in the importance of details also suggests the new hierarchy.\u201d Kurokawa believed that, while Western architecture and cities have been organized with a hierarchy from the infrastructure to the parts and details, his new approach to contemporary Japanese architecture focused on the autonomy of parts.\n\n\n=== Sustainability ===\nIn 1958, Kisho Kurokawa predicted a \u201cTransition from the Age of the Machine to the Age of Life,\u201d and has continually utilized such key words of life principles as metabolism (metabolize and recycle), ecology, sustainability, symbiosis, intermediate areas (ambiguity) and Hanasuki (Splendor of Wabi) in order to call for new styles to be implemented by society.  For four decades, Kisho Kurokawa created eco-friendly and sustainable architectural projects.  In 2003 he was awarded the Dedalo-Minosse International Prize (Grand Prix) for his creation of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia and KLIA is the first and only airport in the world to receive the United Nations' Green Globe 21 certification for the airport's commitment to environmental responsibility each year since 2004.  In 2008, the Kisho Kurokawa Green Institute was founded in his honor.\n\n\n== Projects ==\n(organized by the year of completion)\n\n\n=== 1970s ===\nTakara Beautilion, Theme Pavilion, and Toshiba IHI Pavilion, for Expo '70 (Osaka, 1970)\nNakagin Capsule Tower (Ginza, Tokyo, 1970-1972)\nCapsule House K, Karuizawa, Japan (1974)\nSony Tower (Osaka, 1972\u20131976)\nTateshina Planetarium (Hiroshima, 1976)\nHeadquarters of the Japanese Red Cross Society (Tokyo, 1975\u20131977)\nNational Museum of Ethnology (Osaka, 1973\u20131977)\nVitosha New Otani (Sofia, Bulgaria, 1974\u20131979)\n\n\n=== 1980s ===\n\nSaitama Prefectural Museum of Modern Art (Saitama, 1978\u20131982)\nNational Bunraku Theater (Osaka, 1979\u20131983)\nWacoal Kojimachi Building (Tokyo, 1982\u20131984)\nChokaso (Tokyo, 1985\u20131987)\nNagoya City Art Museum (Nagoya, 1983\u20131987)\nJapanese-German Center of Berlin (Berlin, 1985\u20131988)\nCentral Plaza 1, Brisbane, Australia\nOsaka Prefectural Government Offices (Osaka, 1988)\nHiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art (Hiroshima, 1988\u20131989)\n\n\n=== 1990s ===\n\nChinese-Japanese Youth Center (Beijing, 1987\u20131990)\nOkinawa Prefectural Government Headquarters (Okinawa, 1988\u20131990)\nThe Sporting Club at Illinois Center (Chicago, 1987\u20131990)\nMelbourne Central (Melbourne, Australia, 1986\u20131991)\nMiki House New Office Building (Osaka, 1985\u20131991)\nNara City Museum of Photography (Nara, 1989\u20131991)\nLouvain-La-Neuve Museum (Belgium, 1990\u20131992)\nPacific Tower (Paris, France, 1988\u20131992)\nLane Crawford Place (Singapore, 1990\u20131993)\nSenkantei (Hy\u014dgo, 1992\u20131993)\nEhime Museum of Science (Ehime, 1991\u20131994)\nIshibashi Junior High School (Tochigi, 1992\u20131994)\nThe Museum of Modern Art Wakayama/Wakayama Prefectural Museum (Wakayama, 1990\u20131994)\nHotel Kyocera (Kagoshima, 1991\u20131995)\nKibi-cho City Hall/Kibi Dome (Wakayama, 1993\u20131995)\nRepublic Plaza (Singapore, 1986\u20131995)\nFukui City Museum of Art (Fukui, 1993\u20131996)\nSoftopia Japan (Gifu, 1990\u20131996)\nFujinomiya Golf Club (Fujinomiya, Shizuoka, 1994\u20131997)\nKashima-machi City Hall (Kumamoto, 1995\u20131997)\nShiga Kogen Roman Art Museum (Yamanouchi, 1994\u20131997)\nKuala Lumpur International Airport (Sepang, Malaysia, 1992\u20131998)\nNew Wing of the Van Gogh Museum (Amsterdam, Netherlands, 1990\u20131998)\nAmber Hall (Kuji, 1996\u20131999)\nO Residence (Tokyo, 1997\u20131999)\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\n\nFukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum (Katsuyama, 1996\u20132000)\nOsaka International Convention Center (Osaka, 1994\u20132000)\nOita Stadium (\u014cita, 1996\u20132001, used for the Football World Cup 2002)\nKL Sentral (Kuala Lumpur, 1994-2001)\nToyota Stadium (Toyota City, 1997\u20132001)\nAstana International Airport (Astana, Kazakhstan, 2000\u20132003)\nThe National Art Center, Tokyo, Roppongi, Tokyo, 2000\u20132005)\nCampus of Kyushu University (with Ryota Matsumoto of Nihon Sekkei, Fukuoka, 2003\u20132005)\nSingapore Flyer (Singapore, 2005\u20132008)\nFusionopolis Phase 1 (Singapore, 2006 -)\nZhengzhou International Convention and Exhibition Centre (Zhengzhou, China, 2002\u20132005)\nDesign and Master Plan of Kazakhstan's New Capital (Astana, delayed due to budget problems)\nKrestovsky Stadium (St. Petersburg, 2006\u20132017)\nTrade Center (Yekaterinburg, 2007-)\nMaggie's Cancer Care Centre, Singleton Hospital, Swansea (proposed)\n\n\n== Awards ==\nGold Medal, Acad\u00e9mie d'Architecture, France (1986)\nRichard Neutra Award, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (1988)\n48th Art Academy Award, highest award for artists and architects in Japan (1992)\nRenaming The Art Institute of Chicago to the Kisho Kurokawa Gallery of Architecture (1994)\nPacific Rim Award, American Institute of Architects, Los Angeles chapter (first awarded, 1997)\nHonorary Fellow, Royal Institute of British Architects, United Kingdom\nHonorary Member, Union of Architects, Bulgaria\nHonorary Doctorate of Architecture by Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), Malaysia (2002)\nDedalo-Minosse International Prize (Grand Prix) for Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Malaysia (2003\u20132004)\nCertification for a sustainable airport, Green Globe 21, United Nations, for Kuala Lumpur International Airport (2003)\nWalpole Medal of Excellence, United Kingdom (2005)\nShungdu Friendship Award, China (2005)\nInternational Architecture Award, The Chicago Athenaeum Museum (2006)\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\nImages Publishing Group (2000).

          "Due to limited time, we were only able to see 1/3 of it because it was low season so many of the attractions were closed for maintenance. Each section of the theme park depicts either a specific moment in China history or a particular dynasty.",
          "We did not appreciate the place, though we visited only at night. It is a bit too much in terms of kitsch, noise and consumerism. I would give it a miss.",
          "Excellent to learn about Chinese History, specially my wife and me who are teachers. They have a great show with more than 700 artists, along a river inspired in the Chinese famous painting along the Yellow River.",
          "Just ended our Chinese whirlwind tour of my wife\u2019s old stomping grounds and she really wanted to see this park. I was a bit put off by some of the reviews, but off we went. Hey, I was really surprised on how much I enjoyed the days theatrics and scenery here. The admission",
          "Very high priced theme park crowded and noisy. Some of the \"shows\" are ok yet the main purpose of the park is to squeeze more money out of the visitors wallets. We did not see the night show which appears to be a WOW event. However, i would not want to go back nor really",
          "This is a Chinese cultural theme park showing a variety of activities and historical events from the Song dynasty that had its capital in Kaifeng. It is definitely not a high brow cultural centre but is very popular with Chinese tourists, and does have plenty of activities to",
          "You might be desappointed if you expected anything authentic here, but apart from that the park is really impressive and entertaining. There are some great shows available and really beautiful sets as well.",
          "The Tribute to the Song Dynasty at night is probably the most beautiful and amazing show I have ever been to anywhere in the world. A must if you are there.",
          "This place is typical Chinese park- gardens, couple of ancient looking building and bowers, lakes and trashy decoration. It might have value for local people but I guess not much for tourists. The entrance fee is quite high, in the end it's just usual park that should be free to",
          "We went to The Millennium Park solely for the Famous Song Dynasty Show which was amazing! However, the park itself doesn\u2019t have much to offer, but it\u2019s nice if you just want to stroll around before the show.",
          "This is a park, sort of like Epcot in the US. It depicts several regions and special places in China. There are also several shows. If you find yourself in Kaifeng and need something to do, you might enjoy it.",
          "This area to the west of the Dragon Pavilion forms part of the Long Ting park. Long Ting itself is much more interesting than the Millennium addition, which is mainly just a boating lake.",
          "There are a lot of lovely old things to see in Kaifeng but the Millennium Park is just packed with people, very corny, very fake.... maybe with kids it is worth a few hours. We were there in peak August week so maybe after August might be better. But if you have limited time in",
          "... can you see a 1200-year old ancient capital, half-demolished, to make way for a theme park about... itself. A post-modern marvel, where the fake is real and the real is fake. Snarkiness aside, you can have a good time here, if you come with a Chinese speaker and don't mind",
          "This was the place I enjoyed the most as there were so many things to see. Every part of the park, there are things to see. With beautiful scenery and real props, all staff working there were in their Dynasty costumes, playing different roles,acting and performing on the streets",
          "The place is amazing (if they were rollercoaster there, i'd say it's Song Dynasty Historical Disneyland) and if you want to fully experience it -- and check out every show from the list, I suggest spending two days there. Also, for students, there's a cheaper entrance ticket.",
          "Absolutely amazing harmonious place, the park is worth visiting not only once. We were lucky to get there for the Lantern Festival and enjoyed the breathtaking show of unbelievable lanterns. Loved the place and will go again when lotus flowers are blooming. Highly",

        "wiki": "Zhengzhou is the capital and largest city of Henan Province in the central part of the People's Republic of China. It is one of the National Central Cities in China, the centre of Central Plains area, and serves as the political, economic, technological, and educational center of the province. The Zhengzhou metropolitan area (including Zhengzhou and Kaifeng) is the core area of the Central Plains Economic Zone.The city lies on the southern bank of the Yellow River. Zhengzhou is a major hub of China's national transportation network, with railways connecting Zhengzhou to Europe and an international airport. Zhengzhou is a National Civilized City, State-list Famous Historical and Culture City, and the birthplace of the Yellow Emperor. As of 2020, there are two World Cultural Heritage Sites in Zhengzhou. The Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (ZCE) is China's first futures exchange, Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone is China's first Airport Economy Zone.Zhengzhou has a population of 10,120,000 inhabitants, and had a GDP of 1.014 billion (RMB) in 2018. The city is one of the main built-up areas of Henan region. Greater Zhengzhou was named as one of the 13 emerging mega-cities in China in a July 2012 report by the Economist Intelligence Unit, and officially named as the eighth National Central City in 2017 by the central government in Beijing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Shang dynasty established Aodu (\u969e\u90fd) or Bodu (\u4eb3\u90fd) in Zhengzhou. This prehistorical city had become abandoned as ruins long before the First Emperor of China in BC 260. Since 1950, archaeological finds in a walled city in Eastern Zhengzhou have provided evidence of Shang dynasty settlements in the area. Outside this city, remains of large public buildings and a complex of small settlements have been discovered. The site is generally identified with the Shang capital of Ao and is preserved in the Shang dynasty Ruins monument in Guanchen District. The Shang, who continually moved their capital due to frequent natural disasters, left Ao at around 13th century BC. The site, nevertheless, remained occupied; Zhou (post-1050 BC) tombs have also been discovered. Legend suggests that in the Western Zhou period (1111\u2013771 BC) the site became the fief of a family named Guan. From this derives the name borne by the county (xian) since the late 6th century BC\u2014Guancheng (City of the Guan). The city first became the seat of a prefectural administration in AD 587, when it was named Guanzhou. In 605 it was first called Zhengzhou\u2014a name by which it has been known virtually ever since.The name Zhengzhou came from the Sui dynasty (AD 582), even though it was located in Chenggao, another town. The government moved to the contemporary city during the Tang dynasty. It achieved its greatest importance under the Sui (AD 581\u2013618), Tang (618\u2013907), and early Song (960\u20131127) dynasties, when it was the terminus of the New Bian Canal, which joined the Yellow River to the northwest. There, at a place called Heyin, a vast granary complex was established to supply the capitals at Luoyang and Chang'an to the west and the frontier armies to the north. In the Song period, however, the transfer of the capital eastward to Kaifeng robbed Zhengzhou of much of its importance.In 1903 the Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway arrived at Zhengzhou, and in 1909 the first stage of the Longhai Railway gave it an east\u2013west link to Kaifeng and Luoyang; it later was extended eastward to the coast at Lianyungang, Jiangsu, and westward to Xi'an (Chang'an), Shaanxi, as well as to western Shaanxi. Zhengzhou thus became a major rail junction and a regional center for cotton, grain, peanuts, and other agricultural produce. Early in 1923 a workers' strike began in Zhengzhou and spread along the rail line before it was suppressed; a 14-story double tower in the center of the city commemorates the strike. On June 10, 1938, Chiang Kai-shek's National Revolutionary Army opened up the dikes retaining the Yellow River at Huayuankou between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, in an effort to stem the tide of invading Japanese; however, the ensuing 1938 Yellow River flood also killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese.Zhengzhou also has a locomotive and rolling-stock repair plant, a tractor-assembly plant, and a thermal generating station. The city's industrial growth has resulted in a large increase in the population, coming predominantly from industrial workers from the north. A water diversion project and pumping station, built in 1972, has provided irrigation for the surrounding countryside. The city has an agricultural university.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLocated just north of the province's centre and south of the Yellow River, Zhengzhou borders Luoyang to the west, Jiaozuo to the northwest, Xinxiang to the northeast, Kaifeng to the east, Xuchang to the southeast, and Pingdingshan to the southwest. With the land within its administrative borders generally sloping down from west to east, Zhengzhou is situated at the transitional zone between the North China Plain to the east and the Song Mountains and Xionger Mountains to the west, which are part of the greater Qinling range. The city centre is situated to the south of the middle reach of the Yellow River, where its valley broadens into the great plain. Zhengzhou is at the crossing point of the north\u2013south route skirting the Taihang Mountains and the mountains of western Henan. The prefecture spans 34\u00b0 16' ~ 34\u00b0 58 N latitude and 112\u00b0 42' ~ 114\u00b0 14' E longitude, covering a total area of 7,446.2 square kilometres (2,875.0 sq mi), including the metropolitan area, which covers 1,013.3 km2 (391.2 sq mi), and the city centre, which occupies 147.7 square kilometres (57.0 sq mi).\nThe section of the Yellow River flowing through the prefecture extends 150.4 km (93.5 mi). Mountains loom over the western counties of Gongyi and Dengfeng while the easternmost county of Zhongmu is a vast, fertile floodplain, with the counties in between being hilly transitions.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZhengzhou experiences a monsoon-influenced, four-season humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cwa), with cool, dry winters and hot, humid summers. Spring and autumn are dry and somewhat abbreviated transition periods.

        "wiki": "Kaifeng (Chinese: \u5f00\u5c01) is a prefecture-level city in east-central Henan province, China. It is one of the Eight Ancient Capitals of China, having been the capital seven times in history, and is best known for being the Chinese capital in the Northern Song dynasty.\nAround 5 million people currently live in Kaifeng's metropolitan area. Located along the Yellow River's southern bank, it borders the provincial capital of Zhengzhou to the west, Xinxiang to the northwest, Shangqiu to the east, Zhoukou to the southeast, Xuchang to the southwest, and Heze of Shandong to the northeast.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe postal romanization for the city is \"Kaifeng\". Its official one-character abbreviation in Chinese is \u6c74 (Bi\u00e0n). Historically it has also been known as\n\nD\u00e0li\u00e1ng (Chinese: \u5927\u6881)\nBi\u00e0nli\u00e1ng (\u6c74\u6881)\nBi\u00e0nzh\u014du (\u6c74\u5dde)\nN\u00e1nj\u012bng (\u5357\u4eac)\nD\u014dngj\u012bng (\u6771\u4eac)\nBi\u00e0nj\u012bng (\u6c74\u4eac)The area was named \"Kaifeng\" after the Qin's conquest of China in the second century BC. The name literally means \"opening the border\" and figuratively \"hidden\" and \"vengeance\". Its name was originally Qifeng (Chinese: \u5553\u5c01), but the syllable qi (Baxter-Sagart: /*k\u02b0\u02e4ij\u0294/) was changed to the essentially synonymous kai \uff08/*N\u0259-[k]\u02b0\u02e4\u0259j/, /*[k]\u02b0\u02e4\u0259j/\uff09 to avoid the naming taboo of Liu Qi (Emperor Jing of Han).\n\n\n== Administration ==\nThe prefecture-level city of Kaifeng administers five districts and four counties:\n\nGulou District (\u9f13\u697c\u533a)\nLongting District (\u9f99\u4ead\u533a)\nYuwangtai District (\u79b9\u738b\u53f0\u533a)\nXiangfu District (\u7965\u7b26\u533a)\nShunhe Hui District (\u987a\u6cb3\u56de\u65cf\u533a)\nWeishi County (\u5c09\u6c0f\u53bf)\nQi County (\u675e\u53bf)\nTongxu County (\u901a\u8bb8\u53bf)\nLankao County (\u5170\u8003\u53bf)\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKaifeng is one of the Eight Ancient Capitals of China. As with Beijing, there have been many reconstructions during its history.\nIn 364 BC during the Warring States period, the State of Wei founded a city called Daliang (\u5927\u6881) as its capital in this area. During this period, the first of many canals in the area was constructed linking a local river to the Yellow River. When the State of Qin conquered the State of Wei, Kaifeng was destroyed and abandoned except for a mid-sized market town, which remained in place.\nDuring the Han Dynasty, the city underwent some reconstruction. Kaifeng became the capital of Liu Wu (son of Han emperor Wen) when he was given the title of Liang Xiao Wang. Liu Wu restored and constructed many buildings and old city walls. Kaifeng became a center of music, art, a refuge for artists, and of splendid gardens despite the trivial political importance of the city at this period.Early in the 7th century, Kaifeng was transformed into a major commercial hub when it was connected to the Grand Canal as well as through the construction of a canal running to western Shandong.\nIn 781 during the Tang dynasty, a new city was reconstructed and named Bian (\u6c74). Bian was the capital of the Later Jin (936\u2013946), Later Han (947\u2013950), and Later Zhou (951\u2013960) of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The Song dynasty made Bian its capital when it overthrew the Later Zhou in 960. Shortly afterwards, the city underwent further expansion.\nDuring the Song, when it was known as Dongjing or Bianjing, Kaifeng, then the largest and most prosperous city in China, was the capital, with a population of over 400,000 living both inside and outside the city wall. Typhus was an acute problem in the city. The historian Jacques Gernet provides a lively picture of life in this period in his Daily Life in China on the Eve of the Mongol Invasion, 1250-1276, which often draws on Dongjing Meng Hua Lu, a nostalgic memoir of the city of Kaifeng.In 1049, the Youguosi Pagoda (\u4f51\u570b\u5bfa\u5854) \u2013 or Iron Pagoda as it is called today \u2013 was constructed measuring 54.7 meters (179 ft) in height. It has survived the vicissitudes of war and floods to become the oldest landmark in this ancient city. Another Song-dynasty pagoda, Po Tower, dating from 974, has been partially destroyed.\n\nAnother well-known sight was the astronomical clock tower of the engineer, scientist, and statesman Su Song (1020\u20131101 AD). It was crowned with a rotating armillary sphere that was hydraulically-powered (i.e. by water wheel and a water clock), yet it incorporated an escapement mechanism two hundred years before they were found in the clockworks of Europe and featured the first known endless power-transmitting chain drive.\nKaifeng reached its peak importance in the 11th century as a commercial and industrial center at the intersection of four major canals. During this time, the city was surrounded by three rings of city walls and probably had a population of between 600,000 and 700,000. It is believed that Kaifeng was the largest city in the world from 1013 to 1127.This period ended in 1127 when the city fell to Jurchen invaders during the Jingkang Incident. It subsequently came under the rule of the Jurchen Jin dynasty, which had conquered most of North China during the Jin\u2013Song Wars. While it remained an important administrative center, only the area inside the inner city wall of the early Song remained settled and the two outer rings were abandoned.\nAs the imperial capital of the Song, Kaifeng was conveniently situated along the Grand Canal for logistics supply but militarily vulnerable due to its position on the floodplains of the Yellow River.\nKaifeng served as the Jurchen \"southern capital\" from 1157 (other sources say 1161) and was reconstructed during this time. The Jurchen kept their main capital further north until 1214 when they were forced to move the imperial court southwards to Kaifeng in order to flee from the onslaught of the Mongols. In 1232 they succumbed to the combined Mongol and Song forces in the Mongol siege of Kaifeng. The Mongols captured the city and in 1279 conquered all of China. During the Yuan dynasty Bianliang became the capital of Henan Jiangbei Province, which was established in 1277.\n\nThe city was briefly captured around the mid-fourteenth century by the Red Turban rebels who made it their capital for ten years. They were crushed by the early Ming forces. At the beginning of the Ming dynasty in 1368, Kaifeng was made the capital of Henan province.In 1642, Kaifeng was flooded by the Ming army with water from the Yellow River to prevent the peasant rebel Li Zicheng from taking over. After this disaster, the city was abandoned again.\nIn 1662, during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor in the Qing dynasty, Kaifeng was rebuilt. Another reconstruction in 1843 followed flooding in 1841, shaping Kaifeng as it stands today.\nOn 6 June 1938, the city was occupied by the invading Japanese Imperial Army.\nKaifeng is also known for having the oldest extant Jewish community in China, the Kaifeng Jews.\nKaifeng remained the capital of Henan province until 1954, when it was moved to Zhengzhou.\nIn 1969, the former President of the People's Republic of China, Liu Shaoqi, died from medical neglect while under house arrest in Kaifeng.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nKaifeng has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa) that borders on a humid continental climate, with four distinct seasons. Winters are cool and mostly dry while summers are hot and humid; spring is warm and sees some, but not much rainfall, while autumn weather is crisp and drier. Precipitation mainly occurs from June to September.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\nDowntown Kaifeng is about 55 km (34 mi) away from Zhengzhou Xinzheng International Airport (IATA: CGO, ICAO: ZHCC), which is the busiest airport in central China in terms of both passenger and cargo traffic (2017 statistics).With the completion of Zhengzhou\u2013Kaifeng intercity railway and Zhengzhou\u2013Xinzheng Airport intercity railway, fast train connections to Zhengzhou Xinzheng International Airport from Kaifeng became available. As of August 2018, there are 12 pairs of intercity trains running between Xinzheng Airport and Songchenglu every day, with a travel time of 53 min.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nKaifeng railway station is on the east\u2013west Longhai Railway mainline and provides convenient access to many cities around China, including Beijing West, Shanghai, Shanghai Hongqiao, Tianjin, Xi'an, Jinan, Hangzhou. Services to Zhengzhou, Luoyang and Qingdao are also frequent and convenient. Direct long-distance services to Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Chongqing North, Harbin, \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, Fuzhou, Dalian and Wuhan are also available.\nThe Zhengzhou\u2013Kaifeng intercity railway (\u90d1\u5f00\u57ce\u9645\u94c1\u8def) started operation on 28 December 2014, connecting the provincial capital Zhengzhou and Kaifeng. The railway currently terminates at Songchenglu, and is planned to be extended to Kaifeng railway station. The designed top speed is 200 km/h (120 mph).\nKaifeng North railway station of the Xuzhou\u2013Lanzhou high-speed railway is the main high-speed railway station of the city. It started operation on 10 September 2016.\n\n\n=== Coach ===\nThere are 4 main coach stations in Kaifeng:\n\nKaifeng West Coach Station (\u5f00\u5c01\u5ba2\u8fd0\u897f\u7ad9)\nKaifeng Long-Distance Coach Station (\u5f00\u5c01\u957f\u9014\u6c7d\u8f66\u7ad9)\nKaifeng Jinming Coach Station (\u5f00\u5c01\u91d1\u660e\u6c7d\u8f66\u7ad9)\nKaifeng Xiangguosi Coach Station (\u5f00\u5c01\u76f8\u56fd\u5bfa\u6c7d\u8f66\u7ad9)There are frequent services to many neighboring counties, other provincial cities and long-distance services to other provinces.\n\n\n=== Road transport ===\n G30 Lianyungang\u2013Khorgas Expressway\n G45 Daqing\u2013Guangzhou Expressway\n S82 Zhengzhou\u2013Minquan Expressway\n S83 Lankao\u2013Nanyang Expressway\n China National Highway 106\n China National Highway 220\n China National Highway 310\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nKaifeng is known for having the oldest extant Jewish community in China, the Kaifeng Jews.\nIt also has a significant Muslim enclave and is notable for its many women's mosques (n\u01das\u00ec), including the oldest n\u01das\u00ec in China: Wangjia Hutong Women's Mosque, which dates to 1820.There are also some active Christian churches, like Sacred-Heart of Kaifeng cathedral (\u5f00\u5c01\u8036\u7a23\u5723\u5fc3\u4e3b\u6559\u5ea7\u5802).\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nKaifeng cuisine plays a dominant part in forming Henan cuisine.Kaifeng offers a wide range of food specialties such as steamed pie and dumplings. Particularly famous is Kaifeng's five-spice bread (w\u01d4xi\u0101ng sh\u0101ob\u01d0ng), which, like pita, can be opened and filled. In the evening, Kaifeng's streets turn into restaurants while hundreds open their stands and begin selling their food in the famous night market. People from nearby Zhengzhou often come to Kaifeng to visit family members and to enjoy the atmosphere.\nThe Ma Yu Ching's Bucket Chicken House (\u9a6c\u8c6b\u5174\u6876\u5b50\u9e21;; M\u01ce Y\u00f9x\u012bng T\u01d2ngzi J\u012b), located in Kaifeng, is by some accounts the world's oldest restaurant.\n\n\n=== Chrysanthemums ===\nThe chrysanthemum is the city flower of Kaifeng. The tradition of cultivating varieties of chrysanthemums extends back 1600 years, and the scale of cultivation reached its height during the Song dynasty until its loss to the J\u00fcrchens in 1126.\nThe city has held the Kaifeng Chrysanthemum Cultural Festival since 1983 (renamed China Kaifeng Chrysanthemum Cultural Festival in 1994). The festival has since taken place between 18 October and 18 November of every year.\nThe festival reached another milestone in 2012, when it celebrated its 30th birthday. The opening ceremony was broadcast live on Henan Satellite TV Channel (HNTV) at the evening prime slot on 18 October 2012, which has a coverage of all Chinese cities of or above the prefecture-level classification in the Chinese administrative division.\nDuring the festival, hundreds of chrysanthemums breeds are on show at festival venues, and the flower becomes a common features around the city. Kaifeng has been dubbed the \"city of chrysanthemums\".\n\n\n== Sporting events ==\n\n\n=== Zheng-Kai International Marathon ===\nThe China Zheng-Kai International Marathon (\u4e2d\u56fd\u90d1\u5f00\u56fd\u9645\u9a6c\u62c9\u677e\u8d5b, Zheng-Kai stands for \"Zhengzhou-Kaifeng\", also abbreviated \"ZK\") is a sporting event hosted jointly by the Chinese Athletic Association, the general sport administration of Henan province, Zhengzhou municipal government, and the Kaifeng municipal government.

        "wiki": "Chinese dragon, also known as East Asian dragon or Long or Lung, are legendary creatures in Chinese mythology, Chinese folklore, and East Asian culture at large. Chinese dragons have many animal-like forms such as turtles and fish, but are most commonly depicted as snake-like with four legs. They traditionally symbolize potent and auspicious powers, particularly control over water, rainfall, typhoons, and floods. The dragon is also a symbol of power, strength, and good luck for people who are worthy of it in East Asian culture. During the days of Imperial China, the Emperor of China usually used the dragon as a symbol of his imperial strength and power.\n\nIn Chinese culture, excellent and outstanding people are compared to a dragon, while incapable people with no achievements are compared to other, disesteemed creatures, such as a worm. A number of Chinese proverbs and idioms feature references to a dragon, such as \"Hoping one's son will become a dragon\" (simplified Chinese: \u671b\u5b50\u6210\u9f99; traditional Chinese: \u671b\u5b50\u6210\u9f8d; pinyin: w\u00e0ng z\u01d0 ch\u00e9ng l\u00f3ng).\n\n\n== Symbolic value ==\nHistorically, the Chinese dragon was associated with the Emperor of China and used a symbol to represent imperial power. The founder of the Han dynasty Liu Bang claimed that he was conceived after his mother dreamt of a dragon. During the Tang dynasty, Emperors wore robes with dragon motif as an imperial symbol, and high officials might also be presented with dragon robes. In the Yuan dynasty, the two-horned five-clawed dragon was designated for use by the Son of Heaven or Emperor only, while the four-clawed dragon was used by the princes and nobles. Similarly during the Ming and Qing dynasty, the five-clawed dragon was strictly reserved for use by the Emperor only. The dragon in the Qing dynasty appeared on the first Chinese national flag.The dragon is sometimes used in the West as a national emblem of China though such use is not commonly seen in the People's Republic of China or the Republic of China. Instead, it is generally used as the symbol of culture. In Hong Kong, the dragon was a component of the coat of arms under British rule. It was later to become a feature of the design of Brand Hong Kong, a government promotional symbol.The Chinese dragon has very different connotations from the European dragon \u2013 in European cultures, the dragon is a fire-breathing creature with aggressive connotations, whereas the Chinese dragon is a spiritual and cultural symbol that represents prosperity and good luck, as well as a rain deity that fosters harmony. It was reported that the Chinese government decided against using the dragon as its official 2008 Summer Olympics mascot because of the aggressive connotations that dragons have outside of China, and chose more \"friendly\" symbols instead.\n\nSometimes Chinese people use the term \"Descendants of the Dragon\" (simplified Chinese: \u9f99\u7684\u4f20\u4eba; traditional Chinese: \u9f8d\u7684\u50b3\u4eba) as a sign of ethnic identity, as part of a trend started in the 1970s when different Asian nationalities were looking for animal symbols as representations, for example, the wolf may be used by the Mongols as it is considered to be their legendary ancestor.\n\n\n== State symbol ==\n\nThe dragon was the symbol of the Chinese emperor for many dynasties. During the Qing dynasty, the Azure Dragon was featured on the first Chinese national flag. It featured shortly again on the Twelve Symbols national emblem, which was used during the Republic of China, from 1913 to 1928.\n\n\n== Dragon worship ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\n\nThe ancient Chinese self-identified as \"the gods of the dragon\" because the Chinese dragon is an imagined reptile that represents evolution from the ancestors and qi energy. The presence of dragons within Chinese culture dates back several thousands of years with the discovery of a dragon statue dating back to the fifth millennium BC from the Yangshao culture in Henan in 1987, and jade badges of rank in coiled form have been excavated from the Hongshan culture circa 4700-2900 BC. Some of the earliest Dragon artifacts are the pig dragon carvings from the Hongshan culture.\nThe coiled dragon or snake form played an important role in early Chinese culture. The character for \"dragon\" in the earliest Chinese writing has a similar coiled form, as do later jade dragon amulets from the Shang period.Ancient Chinese referred to unearthed dinosaur bones as dragon bones and documented them as such. For example, Chang Qu in 300 BC documents the discovery of \"dragon bones\" in Sichuan. The modern Chinese term for dinosaur is written as \u6050\u9f8d; \u6050\u9f99; k\u01d2ngl\u00f3ng ('terror dragon'), and villagers in central China have long unearthed fossilized \"dragon bones\" for use in traditional medicines, a practice that continues today.The binomial name for a variety of dinosaurs discovered in China, Mei long, in Chinese (\u5bd0 m\u00e8i and \u9f99 l\u00f3ng) means 'sleeping dragon'. Fossilized remains of Mei long have been found in China in a sleeping and coiled form, with the dinosaur nestling its snout beneath one of its forelimbs while encircling its tail around its entire body.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Mythical creature ===\n\nFrom its origins as totems or the stylized depiction of natural creatures, the Chinese dragon evolved to become a mythical animal. The Han dynasty scholar Wang Fu recorded Chinese myths that long dragons had nine anatomical resemblances.The people paint the dragon's shape with a horse's head and a snake's tail. Further, there are expressions as 'three joints' and 'nine resemblances' (of the dragon), to wit: from head to shoulder, from shoulder to breast, from breast to tail. These are the joints; as to the nine resemblances, they are the following: his antlers resemble those of a stag, his head that of a camel, his eyes those of a demon, his neck that of a snake, his belly that of a clam (shen, \u8703), his scales those of a carp, his claws those of an eagle, his soles those of a tiger, his ears those of a cow. Upon his head he has a thing like a broad eminence (a big lump), called [chimu] (\u5c3a\u6728). If a dragon has no [chimu], he cannot ascend to the sky.\nFurther sources give variant lists of the nine animal resemblances. Sinologist Henri Dor\u00e9 lists these characteristics of an authentic dragon: \"The antlers of a deer. The head of a crocodile. A demon's eyes. The neck of a snake. A tortoise's viscera. A hawk's claws. The palms of a tiger. A cow's ears. And it hears through its horns, its ears being deprived of all power of hearing.\" He notes that, \"Others state it has a rabbit's eyes, a frog's belly, a carp's scales.\" The anatomy of other legendary creatures, including the chimera and manticore, is similarly amalgamated from fierce animals.\nChinese dragons were considered to be physically concise. Of the 117 scales, 81 are of the yang essence (positive) while 36 are of the yin essence (negative). Initially, the dragon was benevolent, wise, and just, but the Buddhists introduced the concept of malevolent influence among some dragons. Just as water destroys, they said, so can some dragons destroy via floods, tidal waves, and storms. They suggested that some of the worst floods were believed to have been the result of a mortal upsetting a dragon.\nMany pictures of Chinese dragons show a flaming pearl under their chin or in their claws. The pearl is associated with spiritual energy, wisdom, prosperity, power, immortality, thunder, or the moon. Chinese art often depicts a pair of dragons chasing or fighting over the flaming pearl.\nChinese dragons are occasionally depicted with bat-like wings growing out of the front limbs, but most do not have wings, as their ability to fly (and control rain/water, etc.) is mystical and not seen as a result of their physical attributes.\nThis description accords with the artistic depictions of the dragon down to the present day. The dragon has also acquired an almost unlimited range of supernatural powers. It is said to be able to disguise itself as a silkworm, or become as large as our entire universe. It can fly among the clouds or hide in water (according to the Guanzi). It can form clouds, can turn into water, can change color as an ability to blend in with their surroundings, as an effective form of camouflage or glow in the dark (according to the Shuowen Jiezi).\nIn many other countries, folktales speak of the dragon having all the attributes of the other 11 creatures of the zodiac, this includes the whiskers of the Rat, the face and horns of the Ox, the claws and teeth of the Tiger, the belly of the Rabbit, the body of the Snake, the legs of the Horse, the goatee of the Goat, the wit of the Monkey, the crest of the Rooster, the ears of the Dog, and the snout of the Pig.\nIn some circles, it is considered bad luck to depict a dragon facing downwards, as it is seen as disrespectful to place a dragon in such manner that it cannot ascend to the sky. Also, depictions of dragons in tattoos are prevalent as they are symbols of strength and power, especially criminal organisations where dragons hold a meaning all on their own. As such, it is believed that one must be fierce and strong enough, hence earning the right to wear the dragon on his skin, lest his luck be consumed by the dragons.According to an art historian John Boardman, depictions of Chinese Dragon and Indian Makara might have been influenced by K\u0113tos in Greek Mythology possibly after contact with silk-road images of the K\u0113tos as Chinese dragon appeared more reptilian and shifted head-shape afterwards.\n\n\n=== Ruler of weather and water ===\n\nChinese dragons are strongly associated with water and weather in popular religion. They are believed to be the rulers of moving bodies of water, such as waterfalls, rivers, or seas. The Dragon God is the dispenser of rain as well as the zoomorphic representation of the yang masculine power of generation. In this capacity as the rulers of water and weather, the dragon is more anthropomorphic in form, often depicted as a humanoid, dressed in a king's costume, but with a dragon head wearing a king's headdress.\nThere are four major Dragon Kings, representing each of the Four Seas: the East Sea (corresponding to the East China Sea), the South Sea (corresponding to the South China Sea), the West Sea (sometimes seen as the Qinghai Lake and beyond), and the North Sea (sometimes seen as Lake Baikal).\nBecause of this association, they are seen as \"in charge\" of water-related weather phenomena. In premodern times, many Chinese villages (especially those close to rivers and seas) had temples dedicated to their local \"dragon king\". In times of drought or flooding, it was customary for the local gentry and government officials to lead the community in offering sacrifices and conducting other religious rites to appease the dragon, either to ask for rain or a cessation thereof.\nThe King of Wuyue in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period was often known as the \"Dragon King\" or the \"Sea Dragon King\" because of his extensive hydro-engineering schemes which \"tamed\" the sea.\n\n\n=== Symbol of imperial authority ===\n\nAccording to Chinese legend, both Chinese primogenitors, the earliest Door and the Yellow Emperor (Huangdi), were closely related to 'Long' (Chinese dragon). At the end of his reign, the first legendary ruler, the Yellow Emperor, was said to have been immortalized into a dragon that resembled his emblem, and ascended to Heaven. The other legendary ruler, the Yan Emperor, was born by his mother's telepathy with a mythical dragon. Since the Chinese consider the Yellow Emperor and the Yan Emperor as their ancestors, they sometimes refer to themselves as \"the descendants of the dragon\". This legend also contributed towards the use of the Chinese dragon as a symbol of imperial power.Dragons (usually with five claws on each foot) were a symbol for the emperor in many Chinese dynasties. During the Qing dynasty, the imperial dragon was colored yellow or gold, and during the Ming dynasty it was red. The imperial throne was referred to as the Dragon Throne. During the late Qing dynasty, the dragon was even adopted as the national flag. Dragons are featured in carvings on the stairs and walkways of imperial palaces and imperial tombs, such as at the Forbidden City in Beijing.\nIn some Chinese legends, an emperor might be born with a birthmark in the shape of a dragon. For example, one legend tells the tale of a peasant born with a dragon birthmark who eventually overthrows the existing dynasty and founds a new one; another legend might tell of the prince in hiding from his enemies who is identified by his dragon birthmark.In contrast, the Empress of China was often identified with the Chinese phoenix.\n\n\n=== Modern belief ===\nWorship of the Dragon God is celebrated throughout China with sacrifices and processions during the fifth and sixth moons, and especially on the date of his birthday the thirteenth day of the sixth moon. A folk religious movement of associations of good-doing in modern Hebei is primarily devoted to a generic Dragon God whose icon is a tablet with his name inscribed, for which it has been named the \"movement of the Dragon Tablet\".\n\n\n== Depictions of the dragon ==\n\n\n=== Neolithic depictions ===\n\nDragons or dragon-like depictions have been found extensively in neolithic-period archaeological sites throughout China. The earliest depiction of dragons was found at Xinglongwa culture sites. Yangshao culture sites in Xi'an have produced clay pots with dragon motifs. A burial site Xishuipo in Puyang which is associated with the Yangshao culture shows a large dragon mosaic made out of clam shells. The Liangzhu culture also produced dragon-like patterns. The Hongshan culture sites in present-day Inner Mongolia produced jade dragon objects in the form of pig dragons which are the first 3-dimensional representations of Chinese dragons.One such early form was the pig dragon. It is a coiled, elongated creature with a head resembling a boar. The character for \"dragon\" in the earliest Chinese writing has a similar coiled form, as do later jade dragon amulets from the Shang dynasty.\n\n\n=== Classical depictions ===\n\nChinese literature and myths refer to many dragons besides the famous long. The linguist Michael Carr analyzed over 100 ancient dragon names attested in Chinese classic texts. Many such Chinese names derive from the suffix -long:\n\nTianlong (Chinese: \u5929\u9f8d; pinyin: ti\u0101nl\u00f3ng; Wade\u2013Giles: t'ien-lung; lit.: 'heavenly dragon'), celestial dragon that guards heavenly palaces and pulls divine chariots; also a name for the constellation Draco\nShenlong (\u795e\u9f8d; sh\u00e9nl\u00f3ng; shen-lung; 'god dragon'), thunder god that controls the weather, appearance of a human head, dragon's body, and drum-like stomach\nFuzanglong (\u4f0f\u85cf\u9f8d; f\u00fac\u00e1ngl\u00f3ng; fu-ts'ang-lung; 'hidden treasure dragon'), underworld guardian of precious metals and jewels, associated with volcanoes\nDilong (\u5730\u9f8d; d\u00ecl\u00f3ng; ti-lung; 'earth dragon'), controller of rivers and seas; also a name for earthworm\nYinglong (\u61c9\u9f8d; y\u00ecngl\u00f3ng; ying-lung; 'responding dragon'), winged dragon associated with rains and floods, used by Yellow Emperor to kill Chi You\nJiaolong (\u86df\u9f8d; ji\u0101ol\u00f3ng; chiao-lung; 'crocodile dragon'), hornless or scaled dragon, leader of all aquatic animals\nPanlong (\u87e0\u9f8d; p\u00e1nl\u00f3ng; p'an-lung; 'coiled dragon'), lake dragon that has not ascended to heaven\nHuanglong (\u9ec3\u9f8d; hu\u00e1ngl\u00f3ng; huang-lung; 'yellow dragon'), hornless dragon symbolizing the emperor\nFeilong (\u98db\u9f8d; f\u0113il\u00f3ng; fei-lung; 'flying dragon'), winged dragon that rides on clouds and mist; also a name for a genus of pterosaur (compare Feilong kick and Fei Long character)\nQinglong (\u9752\u9f8d; q\u012bngl\u00f3ng; ch'ing-lung; 'Azure Dragon'), the animal associated with the East in the Chinese Four Symbols, mythological creatures in the Chinese constellations\nQiulong (\u866f\u9f8d; q\u00edul\u00f3ng; ch'iu-lung; 'curling dragon'), contradictorily defined as both \"horned dragon\" and \"hornless dragon\"\nZhulong (\u71ed\u9f8d; zh\u00fal\u00f3ng; chu-lung; 'torch dragon') or Zhuyin (\u71ed\u9670; zh\u00fay\u012bn; chu-yin; 'illuminating darkness') was a giant red draconic solar deity in Chinese mythology. It supposedly had a human's face and snake's body, created day and night by opening and closing its eyes, and created seasonal winds by breathing. (Note that this zhulong is different from the similarly named Vermilion Dragon or the Pig dragon).\nChilong (\u87ad\u9f8d or \u9b51\u9f8d; ch\u012bl\u00f3ng; ch'ih-lung; 'demon dragon'), a hornless dragon or mountain demonFewer Chinese dragon names derive from the prefix long-:\n\nLongwang (\u9f8d\u738b; l\u00f3ngw\u00e1ng; lung-wang; 'Dragon Kings') divine rulers of the Four Seas\nLongma (\u9f8d\u99ac; l\u00f3ngm\u01ce; lung-ma; 'dragon horse'), emerged from the Luo River and revealed ba gua to Fu XiSome additional Chinese dragons are not named with long \u9f8d, for instance,\n\nHong (\u8679; h\u00f3ng; hung; 'rainbow'), a two-headed dragon or rainbow serpent\nShen (\u8703; sh\u00e8n; shen; 'giant clam'), a shapeshifting dragon or sea monster believed to create mirages\nBashe (\u5df4\u86c7; b\u0101sh\u00e9; pa-she; 'ba snake') was a giant python-like dragon that ate elephants\nTeng (\u87a3; t\u00e9ng; t'eng) or Tengshe (\u817e\u86c7; \u9a30\u86c7; t\u00e9ngsh\u00e9; t'eng-she; lit. \"soaring snake\") is a flying dragon without legsChinese scholars have classified dragons in diverse systems. For instance, Emperor Huizong of the Song dynasty canonized five colored dragons as \"kings\".\n\nThe Azure Dragon [Qinglong \u9752\u9f8d] spirits, most compassionate kings.\nThe Vermilion Dragon [Zhulong \u6731\u9f8d or Chilong \u8d64\u9f8d] spirits, kings that bestow blessings on lakes.\nThe Yellow Dragon [Huanglong \u9ec3\u9f8d] spirits, kings that favorably hear all petitions.\nThe White Dragon [Bailong \u767d\u9f8d] spirits, virtuous and pure kings.\nThe Black Dragon [Xuanlong \u7384\u9f8d or Heilong \u9ed1\u9f8d] spirits, kings dwelling in the depths of the mystic waters.With the addition of the Yellow Dragon of the Center to Azure Dragon of the East, these Vermilion, White, and Black Dragons coordinate with the Four Symbols, including the Vermilion Bird of the South, White Tiger of the West, and Black Tortoise of the North.\n\n\n=== Nine sons of the dragon ===\n\nSeveral Ming dynasty texts list what were claimed as the Nine Offspring of the Dragon (\u9f8d\u751f\u4e5d\u5b50), and subsequently these feature prominently in popular Chinese stories and writings. The scholar Xie Zhaozhe (\u8b1d\u8087\u6ddb, 1567\u20131624) in his work Wu Za Zu (\u4e94\u96dc\u4fce, c. 1592) gives the following listing, as rendered by M.W. de Visser:\n\nA well-known work of the end of the sixteenth century, the Wuzazu \u4e94\u96dc\u4fce, informs us about the nine different young of the dragon, whose shapes are used as ornaments according to their nature.\nThe [p\u00fa l\u00e1o \u84b2\u7262], four leg small form dragon class which like to scream, are represented on the tops of bells, serving as handles.\nThe [qi\u00fa ni\u00fa \u56da\u725b], which like music, are used to adorn musical instruments.\nThe [ch\u012b w\u011bn \u86a9\u543b], which like swallowing, are placed on both ends of the ridgepoles of roofs (to swallow all evil influences).\nThe [ch\u00e1o f\u0113ng \u5632\u98a8], beasts-like dragon which like adventure, are placed on the four corners of roofs.\nThe [y\u00e1 z\u00ec \u775a\u7726], which like to kill, are engraved on sword guards.\nThe [x\u00ec x\u00ec \u5c53\u5c6d], which have the shape of the [ch\u012b h\u01d4 \u87ad\u864e (One kind small form dragon)], and are fond of literature, are represented on the sides of grave-monuments.\nThe [b\u00ec \u00e0n \u72f4\u72b4], which like litigation, are placed over prison gates (in order to keep guard).\nThe [su\u0101n n\u00ed \u72fb\u730a], which like to sit down, are represented upon the bases of Buddhist idols (under the Buddhas' or Bodhisattvas' feet).\nThe [b\u00ec x\u00ec \u8d14\u5c6d], also known as [b\u00e0 xi\u00e0 \u9738\u4e0b], finally, big tortoises which like to carry heavy objects, are placed under grave-monuments.Further, the same author enumerates nine other kinds of dragons, which are represented as ornaments of different objects or buildings according to their liking prisons, water, the rank smell of newly caught fish or newly killed meat, wind and rain, ornaments, smoke, shutting the mouth (used for adorning key-holes), standing on steep places (placed on roofs), and fire.\n\nThe Sheng'an waiji (\u5347\u5eb5\u5916\u96c6) collection by the poet Yang Shen (\u694a\u614e, 1488\u20131559) gives different 5th and 9th names for the dragon's nine children: the t\u0101o ti\u00e8 (\u9955\u992e), form of beasts, which loves to eat and is found on food-related wares, and the ji\u0101o t\u00fa (\u6912\u5716), which looks like a conch or clam, does not like to be disturbed, and is used on the front door or the doorstep. Yang's list is b\u00ec x\u00ec, ch\u012b w\u011bn or ch\u00e1o f\u0113ng, p\u00fa l\u00e1o, b\u00ec \u00e0n, t\u0101o ti\u00e8, qi\u00fa ni\u00fa, y\u00e1 z\u00ec, su\u0101n n\u00ed, and ji\u0101o t\u00fa. In addition, there are some sayings including [b\u0101 xi\u00e0 \ud85c\ude22\ud85c\udfe1], Hybrid of reptilia animal and dragon, a creature that likes to drink water, and is typically used on bridge structures.Oldest known attestation of the \"children of the dragon\" list is found in the Shuyuan zaji (\u83fd\u5712\u96dc\u8a18, Miscellaneous records from the bean garden) by Lu Rong (1436\u20131494); however, he noted that the list enumerates mere synonyms of various antiques, not children of a dragon. The nine sons of the dragon were commemorated by the Shanghai Mint in 2012's year of the dragon with two sets of coins, one in silver, and one in brass. Each coin in the sets depicts one of the 9 sons, including an additional coin for the father dragon, which depicts the nine sons on the reverse.It's also a Chinese idiom, which means among brothers each one has his good points.\n\n\n=== Dragon claws ===\n\nEarly Chinese dragons are depicted with two to five claws. Different countries that adopted the Chinese dragon have different preferences; in Mongolia and Korea, four-clawed dragons are used, while in Japan, three-clawed dragons are common. In China, three-clawed dragons were popularly used on robes during the Tang dynasty. The usage of the dragon motif was codified during the Yuan dynasty, and the five-clawed dragons became reserved for use by the emperor while the princes used four-clawed dragons.  Phoenixes and five-clawed two-horned dragons may not be used on the robes of officials and other objects such as plates and vessels in the Yuan dynasty. It was further stipulated that for commoners, \"it is forbidden to wear any cloth with patterns of Qilin, Male Fenghuang (Chinese phoenix), White rabbit, Lingzhi, Five-Toe Two-Horn Dragon, Eight Dragons, Nine Dragons, 'Ten thousand years', Fortune-longevity character and Golden Yellow etc.\"The Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty emulated the Yuan dynasty rules on the use of the dragon motif and decreed that the dragon would be his emblem and that it would have five claws. The four-clawed dragon would be used typically for imperial nobility and certain high-ranking officials. The three-clawed dragon was used by lower ranks and the general public (widely seen on various Chinese goods in the Ming dynasty). The dragon, however, was only for select royalty closely associated with the imperial family, usually in various symbolic colors, while it was a capital offense for anyone\u2014other than the emperor himself\u2014to ever use the completely gold-colored, five-clawed Long dragon motif. Improper use of claw number or colors was considered treason, punishable by execution of the offender's entire clan. During the  Qing dynasty, the Manchus initially considered three-clawed dragons the most sacred and used that until 1712 when it was replaced by five-clawed dragons, and portraits of the Qing emperors were usually depicted with five-clawed dragons.In works of art that left the imperial collection, either as gifts or through pilfering by court eunuchs (a long-standing problem), where practicable, one claw was removed from each set, as in several pieces of carved lacquerware, for example the well known Chinese lacquerware table in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\n\n\n=== Number nine ===\n\nThe number nine is special in China as it is seen as number of the heaven, and Chinese dragons are frequently connected with it. For example, a Chinese dragon is normally described in terms of nine attributes and usually has 117 (9x13) scales\u201481 (9x9) Yang and 36 (9x4) Yin.\nThis is also why there are nine forms of the dragon and there are 9 sons of the dragon (see Classical depictions above). The Nine-Dragon Wall is a spirit wall with images of nine different dragons, and is found in imperial Chinese palaces and gardens. Because nine was considered the number of the emperor, only the most senior officials were allowed to wear nine dragons on their robes\u2014and then only with the robe completely covered with surcoats. Lower-ranking officials had eight or five dragons on their robes, again covered with surcoats; even the emperor himself wore his dragon robe with one of its nine dragons hidden from view.\nThere are a number of places in China called \"Nine Dragons\", the most famous being Kowloon (in Cantonese) in Hong Kong. The part of the Mekong in Vietnam is known as C\u1eedu Long, with the same meaning.\n\n\n=== Chinese zodiac ===\n\nThe Dragon is one of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac which is used to designate years in the Chinese calendar. It is thought that each animal is associated with certain personality traits. Dragon years are usually the most popular to have children. There are more people born in Dragon years than in any other animal years of the zodiac.\n\n\n=== Constellations ===\n\nThe Azure Dragon (Qing Long, \u9752\u9f8d) is considered to be the primary of the four celestial guardians, the other three being the Zhu Que\u2014\u6731\u96c0 (Vermilion Bird), Bai Hu\u2014\u767d\u864e (White Tiger), Xuan Wu\u2014\u7384\u6b66 (Black Tortoise-like creature). In this context, the Azure Dragon is associated with the East and the element of Wood.\n\n\n=== Dragonboat racing ===\n\nAt special festivals, especially the Duanwu Festival, dragon boat races are an important part of festivities. Typically, these are boats paddled by a team of up to 20 paddlers with a drummer and steersman. The boats have a carved dragon as the head and tail of the boat. Dragon boat racing is also an important part of celebrations outside of China, such as at Chinese New Year. A similar racing is popular in India in the state of Kerala called Vallamkali and there are records on Chinese traders visiting the seashores of Kerala centuries back (Ibn Batuta).\n\n\n=== Dragon dancing ===\n\nOn auspicious occasions, including Chinese New Year and the opening of shops and residences, festivities often include dancing with dragon puppets. These are \"life sized\" cloth-and-wood puppets manipulated by a team of people, supporting the dragon with poles. They perform choreographed moves to the accompaniment of drums, drama, and music. They also wore good clothing made of silk.\n\n\n=== Dragon and Fenghuang ===\n\nFenghuang (simplified Chinese: \u51e4\u51f0; traditional Chinese: \u9cf3\u51f0; pinyin: f\u00e8nghu\u00e1ng; Wade\u2013Giles: f\u00eang\u2074-huang\u00b2), known in Japanese as H\u014d-\u014d or Hou-ou, are phoenix-like birds found in East Asian mythology that reign over all other birds. In Chinese symbolism, it is a feminine entity that is paired with the masculine Chinese dragon, as a visual metaphor of a balanced and blissful relationship, symbolic of both a happy marriage and a regent's long reign.\n\n\n=== Dragon as n\u0101ga ===\n\nIn many Buddhist countries, the concept of the n\u0101ga has been merged with local traditions of great and wise serpents or dragons, as depicted in this stairway image of a multi-headed n\u0101ga emerging from the mouth of a Makara in the style of a Chinese dragon at Phra Maha Chedi Chai Mongkol on the premises of Wat Pha Namthip Thep Prasit Vararam in Thailand's Roi Et Province Nong Phok District.\n\n\n=== Dragons and tigers ===\nThe tiger is considered to be the eternal rival to the dragon, thus various artworks depict a dragon and tiger fighting an epic battle. A well used Chinese idiom to describe equal rivals (often in sports nowadays) is \"Dragon versus Tiger\". In Chinese martial arts, \"Dragon style\" is used to describe styles of fighting based more on understanding movement, while \"Tiger style\" is based on brute strength and memorization of techniques.\n\n\n=== Dragons and botany ===\nThe elm cultivar Ulmus pumila 'Pendula', from northern China, called 'Weeping Chinese Elm' in the West, is known locally as Lung chao y\u00fc shu (: 'Dragon's-claw elm') owing to its branching.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nAs a part of traditional folklore, dragons appear in a variety of mythological fiction. In the classical novel Journey to the West, the son of the Dragon King of the West was condemned to serve as a horse for the travelers because of his indiscretions at a party in the heavenly court. Sun Wukong's staff, the Ruyi Jingu Bang, was robbed from Ao Guang, the Dragon King of the East Sea. In Fengshen Yanyi and other stories, Nezha, the boy hero, defeats the Dragon Kings and tames the seas. Chinese dragons also appear in innumerable Japanese anime films and television shows, manga, and in Western political cartoons as a personification of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese respect for dragons is emphasized in Naomi Novik's Temeraire novels, where they were the first people to tame dragons and are treated as equals, intellectuals, or even royalty, rather than beasts solely bred for war in the West. Manda is a large Chinese dragon that appears in the Godzilla storyline. A golden three-headed dragon also appears in the comic book series God Is Dead.\nRed dragon is a symbol of China which appears in many Mahjong games.\nA Chinese Water-Dragon is used as the main antagonist in Season 3 of the Australian television series Mako Mermaids. The Dragon is heavily based on Chinese mythology to coincide with a new Chinese mermaid on the show.\nThe main antagonist of Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior, Yan-Lo, was a Chinese dragon. Despite the fact that he's deceased during the events of the film, he continues to hatch evil plans in the form of a spirit.\n\n\n== Regional variations across Asia ==\nWhile depictions of the dragon in art and literature are consistent throughout the cultures in which it is found, there are some regional differences.\nFor more information on peculiarities in the depiction of the dragon in other Asian cultures, see:\nDragons related to the Chinese dragon:\n\nDruk, the Thunder Dragon of Bhutanese mythology\nJapanese dragon\nKorean dragon\nN\u0101ga, a Hindu and Buddhist creature in South Asian and Southeast Asian mythology.\nBakunawa, a moon-eating sea dragon depicted in Philippine mythology.\nVietnamese dragonDragons similar to the Chinese dragon:\n\nMakara, a sea Dragon in Hindu and Buddhist mythology\nYali, a legendary creature in Hindu mythology\nNepalese dragon as depicted with Bhairava\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nNikaido, Yoshihiro (2015).

        "wiki": "Henan (\u6cb3\u5357; alternatively Honan) is a landlocked province of the People's Republic of China, located in the central part of the country. Henan is often referred to as Zhongyuan or Zhongzhou (\u4e2d\u5dde), which literally means \"central plain\" or \"midland\", although the name is also applied to the entirety of China proper. Henan is a birthplace of Chinese civilization, with over 3,000 years of recorded history and remained China's cultural, economical and political center until approximately 1,000 years ago.\nHenan Province is home to many heritage sites which have been left behind, including the ruins of Shang dynasty capital city Yin and the Shaolin Temple. Four of the Eight Great Ancient Capitals of China, Luoyang, Anyang, Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, are located in Henan. The practice of tai chi also began in Chen Jia Gou Village (Chen style), as did the later Yang and Wu styles.Although the name of the province (\u6cb3\u5357) means \"south of the [Yellow] river\", approximately a quarter of the province lies north of the Yellow River, also known as the Huang He. With an area of 167,000 km2 (64,479 sq mi), Henan covers a large part of the fertile and densely populated North China Plain. Its neighboring provinces are Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui and Hubei. Henan is China's third most populous province with a population of over 94 million. Henan is also the world's seventh-most populous subnational entity, and if it were a country by itself, Henan would be the 14th most populous country in the world, ahead of Egypt and Vietnam.\nHenan is the 5th largest provincial economy of China and the largest among inland provinces. However, per capita GDP is low compared to other eastern and central provinces.\nHenan is considered to be one of the less developed areas in China economically. The economy continues to grow based on aluminum and coal prices, as well as agriculture, heavy industry, tourism and retail. High-tech industries and service sector is underdeveloped and is concentrated around Zhengzhou and Luoyang.\n\n\n== History ==\nWidely regarded as one of the Cradles of Chinese civilization along with Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, Henan is known for its historical prosperity and periodic downturns. The economic prosperity resulted from its extensive fertile plains and its location at the heart of the country. However, its strategic location also means that it has suffered from nearly all of the major wars in China. In addition, the numerous floods of the Yellow River have caused significant damage from time to time. Kaifeng, in particular, has been buried by the Yellow River's silt seven times due to flooding.\n\n\n=== Ancient Era ===\n\nArchaeological sites reveal that prehistoric cultures such as the Yangshao Culture and Longshan Culture were active in what is now northern Henan since the Neolithic Era. The more recent Erlitou culture has been controversially identified with the Xia dynasty, the first and largely legendary Chinese dynasty that was established, roughly, in the 21st century BC. Virtually the entire kingdom existed within what is now north and central Henan.\nThe Xia dynasty collapsed around the 16th century BC following the invasion of Shang, a neighboring vassal state centered around today's Shangqiu in eastern Henan. The Shang dynasty (16th\u201311th centuries BC) was the first literate dynasty of China. Its many capitals are located at the modern cities of Shangqiu, Yanshi, and Zhengzhou. Their last and most important capital, Yin, located in modern Anyang, is where the first Chinese writing was created.\n\nIn the 11th century BC, the Zhou dynasty of Shaanxi arrived from the west and overthrew the Shang dynasty. The capital was moved to Chang'an, and the political and economical center was moved away from Henan for the first time. In 722 BC, when Chang'an was devastated by Xionites invasions, the capital was moved back east to Luoyang. This began the Spring and Autumn period, a period of warfare and rivalry. What is now Henan and all of China was divided into a variety of small, independent states, constantly at war for control of the central plain. Although regarded formally as the ruler of China, the control that Zhou king in Luoyang exerted over the feudal kingdoms had virtually disappeared. Despite the prolonged period of instability, prominent philosophers such as Confucius emerged in this era and offered their ideas on how a state should be run. Laozi, the founder of Taoism, was born in northern Chu, part of modern-day Henan.\nLater on, these states were replaced by seven large and powerful states during the Warring States period, and Henan was divided into three states, the Wei to the north, the Chu to the south, and the Han in the middle. In 221 BC, state of Qin forces from Shaanxi conquered all of the other six states, ending 800 years of warfare.\n\n\n=== Imperial Era ===\nYing Zheng, the leader of Qin, crowned himself (220 BCE) as the First Emperor. He abolished the feudal system and centralized all powers, establishing the Qin dynasty and unifying the core of the Han Chinese homeland for the first time. The empire quickly collapsed after the death (210 BCE) of Ying Zheng and was replaced by the Han dynasty in 206 BC, with its capital at Chang'an. Thus, a golden age of Chinese culture, economy, and military power began. The capital moved east to Luoyang in 25 AD, in response to a coup in Chang'an that created the short-lived Xin dynasty. Luoyang quickly regained control of China, and the Eastern Han dynasty (25\u2013220) began, extending the golden age for another two centuries.\nThe late Eastern Han dynasty saw war and rivalry between regional warlords. Xuchang in central Henan was the power base of Cao Cao, who eventually succeeded in unifying all of northern China under the Kingdom of Wei. Wei then moved its capital to Luoyang, which remained the capital after the unification of China by the Western Jin dynasty. During this period Luoyang became one of the largest and most prosperous cities in the world, despite being repeatedly damaged by warfare.\n\nWith the fall of the Western Jin dynasty in the 4th and 5th centuries, nomadic peoples from the north invaded northern China and established many successive regimes in northern China, including Henan. These people were gradually assimilated into the Chinese culture in a process known as sinification.\nThe short-lived Sui dynasty reunified China again in 589 with its capital back in Chang'an. It collapsed due to Sui Emperor Yang's costly attempt to relocate the capital from Chang'an to Luoyang and the construction of many extravagant palaces there. The succeeding Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) kept its capital in Chang'an, marking the beginning of China's second golden age, with Henan being one of the wealthiest places in the empire.\nThe Tang dynasty lasted for three centuries before it eventually succumbed to internal strife. In the Period of Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms (907\u2013960) that followed, Kaifeng in eastern Henan became the capital of four dynasties. The Song dynasty that reunified China in 982 also had its capital at Kaifeng. Under Song rule, China entered another era of culture and prosperity, and Kaifeng overtook Luoyang and Chang'an as the largest city in China and in the world. In 1127, however, the Song dynasty succumbed to Jurchen (Jin dynasty) invaders from the north in the Jin\u2013Song war, and in 1142 ceded all of northern China, including Henan. The Song government moved its capital to Hangzhou in Southern China, which, under the Southern Song dynasty (1127\u20131279) continued to enjoy relative economic and culture prosperity. A prolonged period of peace and cultural and economic prosperity in the Yangtze River delta Jiangnan region (modern southern Jiangsu, northern Zhejiang, and Shanghai) made this the new center of Chinese culture and economy.\nKaifeng served as the Jurchen's \"southern capital\" from 1157 (other sources say 1161) and was reconstructed during this time. But the Jurchen kept their main capital further north, until 1214, when they were forced to move the imperial court southwards to Kaifeng in order to flee the Mongol onslaught. In 1234 they succumbed to combined Mongol and Song dynasty forces. Mongols took control, and in 1279 they conquered all of China, establishing the Yuan dynasty and set up the equivalent of modern Henan province, with borders very similar to the modern ones. Neither its territories nor its role in the economy changed under later dynasties. Henan remained important in the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) and Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911) that followed, though its economy slowly deteriorated due to frequent natural disasters.\n\n\n=== Modern Era ===\nThe Qing dynasty was overthrown by the 1911 Revolution and then the Republic of China was established in 1912, during which a man from Henan, Yuan Shikai, played an important role and thus he became the first president of Republic of China. The construction and extension of the Pinghan Railway and Longhai Railway had turned Zhengzhou, a minor county town at the time, into a major transportation hub. Despite the rise of Zhengzhou, Henan's overall economy repeatedly stumbled as it was the hardest hit by the many disasters that struck China in its modern era.\nHenan suffered greatly during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In 1938, when the Imperial Japanese Army captured Kaifeng, the government led by Chiang Kai-shek bombed the Huayuankou dam in Zhengzhou in order to prevent the Japanese forces from advancing further. However, this caused massive flooding in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. In 1942 Henan was hit by a great famine resulting from a mix of drought, locusts and destruction caused by the war. Grain requisition policies were continued by Chinese and Japanese authorities despite the shortage of food, making the death toll far greater than it might have been otherwise.\nIn 1954, the new government of the People's Republic of China moved the capital of Henan from Kaifeng to Zhengzhou, as a result of its economic importance. The PRC had earlier established a short-lived Pingyuan Province consisting of what is now northern Henan and western Shandong with Xinxiang as its capital. This province was abolished in 1952.\nIn 1958, Yashan in Suiping County, Henan, became the first people's commune of China, heralding the beginning of the \"Great Leap Forward\". In the subsequent famines of the early 1960s popularly attributed to the Great Leap Forward, Henan was one of the hardest hit and millions of lives were lost.A destructive flooding of the Huai River in the summer of 1950 prompted large-scale construction of dams on its tributaries in central and southern Henan. \nUnfortunately, many of the dams were not able to withstand the extraordinarily high levels of rainfall caused by Typhoon Nina in August 1975. Sixty-two dams, the largest of which was the Banqiao Dam in Biyang County collapsed; catastrophic flooding, spread over several counties throughout Zhumadian Prefecture and further downstream, killed at least 26,000 people. Unofficial human life loss estimates, including deaths from the ensuing epidemics and famine, range as high as 85,600, 171,000 or even 230 000. This is considered the most deadly dam-related disaster in human history.By the early 1970s, China was one of the poorest countries in the world, and Henan was one of the poorest provinces in China. In 1978, however, when the communist leader Deng Xiaoping initiated the open door policy and embraced capitalism, China entered an economic boom that continues today. The boom did not reach inland provinces such as Henan initially, but by the 1990s Henan's economy was expanding at an even faster rate than that of China overall.\nIn November 2004, martial law was declared in Zhongmou County, Henan, to quell deadly ethnic clashes between Han Chinese and the Muslim Hui Chinese. The reported number of deaths ranged between 7 and 148.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHenan has a diverse landscape with floodplains in the east and mountains in the west. Much of the province forms part the densely populated North China Plain, an area known as the \"breadbasket of China\". The Taihang Mountains intrude partially into Henan's northwestern borders from Shanxi, forming the eastern edge of Loess Plateau. To the west the Xionger and Funiu Mountains form an extensive network of mountain ranges and plateaus, supporting one of the few remaining temperate deciduous forests which once covered all of Henan. The renowned Mount Song and its Shaolin Temple is located in the far east of the region, near the capital city Zhengzhou. To the far south, the Dabie Mountains divides Hubei from Henan. The Nanyang Basin, separated from North China Plain by these mountains, is another important agricultural and population center, with culture and history distinct from the rest of Henan and closer to that of Hubei's. Unlike the rest of northern China, desertification is not a problem in Henan, though sandstorms are common in cities near the Yellow River due to the large amount of sand present in the river. At 2413.8 meters above sea level, the highest point in Henan province is Laoyachanao (\u8001\u9e26\u5c94\u57b4).The Yellow River passes through central Henan. It enters from the northwest, via the Sanmenxia Reservoir. After it passes Luoyang, the mountains gave way to plains. Excessive amount of sediments are formed due to the silt it picks up from the Loess Plateau, raising the riverbed and causing frequent floods which shaped the habitat of the region. More recently however, construction of dams and levees, as well as the depletion of water resources have ended the floods. The Huai River in southern Henan is another important river, and has been recognized as part of the boundary dividing northern and southern Chinese climate and culture.\nHenan shares borders with six other provinces. It is bordered to the west by Shaanxi, to the south by Hubei, and to the north by Shanxi (northwest) and Hebei (northeast). To the east lie Shandong (northeast) and Anhui (southeast), whose borders meet at a narrow strip of land which separates Henan from Jiangsu to the east.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHenan has a temperate climate that is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cwa or Cfa) to the south of the Yellow River and bordering on humid continental (K\u00f6ppen Dwa) to the north. It has a distinct seasonal climate characterised by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and generally cool to cold, windy, dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone. Temperatures average around the freezing mark in January and 27 to 28 \u00b0C in July.  A great majority of the annual rainfall occurs during the summer.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nHenan is divided into seventeen prefecture-level divisions: all prefecture-level cities; along with one directly administered county-level city (a sub-prefecture-level city):\n\nThese 17 prefecture-level cities and one directly administered county-level city of Henan are in turn subdivided into 158 county-level divisions (52 districts,21 county-level cities, and 85 counties; the sub-prefecture-level city of Jiyuan is counted as a county-level city here). Those are in turn divided into 2440 township-level divisions (866 towns, 1234 townships, twelve ethnic townships, and 328 subdistricts).\n\n\n=== Urban areas ===\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nWith a population of approximately 93.6 million, Henan is the third most populous Chinese province after Guangdong and Shandong. It is also the fifth most populous sub-national division in the world. If it were a country by itself, it would be the twelfth most populous in the world, just behind Mexico and ahead of the Philippines. However, the hukou system shows Henan as the most populous province in China with over 103 million people, as it counts the migrant Henanese laborers as residents of Henan, instead of the province they currently reside in. On the other hand, Guangdong is shown as having only 81 million people, though the actual population is 95 million due to the influx of migrants from other provinces.\nThe population is highly homogeneous with 98.8% of the population being Han. Small populations of Mongols and Manchus exists in scattered rural communities as well as major urban centers. \nAlong with Jiangxi, Henan has one of the most unbalanced gender ratios in China. As a result of the Chinese government's one-child policy (many parents do not want the only child to be female and abort the fetus), the gender ratio was 118.46 males for 100 females in 2000. Subsequently, aborting fetuses due to their female sex was banned in Henan and heavy fines are issued for those who violate the law. In addition, daughter-only families receive an annual allowance from the government. Despite these efforts the problem seems to have become far worse. Based on a 2009 British Medical Journal study, the ratio is over 140 boys for every 100 girls in the 1\u20134 age group; this might be a strong exaggeration, as many families with more than one child do not register their daughters to the hukou in order to escape fines.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nAccording to a 2012 survey only around 13% of the population of Henan belongs to organised religions, the largest groups being Buddhists with 6.4%, followed by Protestants with 5.6%, Muslims with 1.3% and Catholics with 0.5%. Henan has some important centres of Chinese Buddhism, the White Horse Temple and the famous Shaolin Monastery.\nHenan has also the largest Christian population by numbers and percentage of any province of China, 6.1% of the province's population as of 2012, corresponding to approximately 7 million Christians. A 2009 survey reported the share of Christians to be 9.33%.  In 2019, Communist officials demolished the True Jesus Church near Zhumadian city in Henan province.The reports didn't give figures for other types of religion; 86% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in worship of nature deities, Confucianism, Taoism and folk religious sects (for example, a sect that is endogenous to Henan is the Tianxian miaodao). According to a 2007 survey, approximately 8% of the Henanese believe in and are involved in ancestor veneration, the traditional Chinese religion of the lineages organised into lineage churches and ancestral shrines.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe Government of Henan is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.\nThe Governor of Henan is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Henan. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Henan Communist Party of China Provincial Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the \"Henan CPC Party Chief\".\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nHenan has seen rapid development in its economy over the past two decades, and its economy has expanded at an even faster rate than the national average of 10%. This rapid growth has transformed Henan from one of the poorest provinces to one that matches other central provinces, though still relatively impoverished on a national scale. In 2011, Henan's nominal GDP was 3.20 trillion RMB (US$427 billion), making it the fifth largest economy in China, although it ranks nineteenth in terms of GDP per capita.\nHenan is a semi-industrialized economy with an underdeveloped service sector. In 2009, Henan's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth 277 billion RMB (US$40 billion), 1.097 trillion RMB (US$160 billion), and 563 billion RMB (US$82 billion), respectively. Agriculture has traditionally been a pillar of its economy, with the nation's highest wheat and sesame output and second highest rice output, earning its reputation as the breadbasket of China. Henan is also an important producer of beef, cotton, maize, pork, animal oil, and corn. Food production and processing makes up more than 14% of the output from the province's secondary industry, and it is said that 90% of Chinese McDonald's and KFC ingredients comes from Henan.Although Henan's industry has traditionally been based on light textiles and food processing, recent developments have diversified the industry sector to metallurgy, petrol, cement, chemical industry, machinery and electronics. Henan has the second largest molybdenum reserves in the world. Coal, aluminum, alkaline metals and tungsten are also present in large amounts in western Henan. Henan houses some of the biggest limestone reserves in China estimated over 24 billion tons. Export and processing of these materials is one of the main sources of revenues.\nHenan is actively trying to build its economy around the provincial capital of Zhengzhou, and it is hoped that the province may become an important transportation and manufacturing hub in the years to come. In 2008, the total trade volume (import and export) was US$17.5 billion, including US$10.7 billion for exports.  Since 2002, 7,111 foreign enterprises have been approved, and foreign funds (FDI) of US$10.64 billion have been used in contracts with a realized FDI of US$5.3 billion. Foreign exchanges are increasing continuously. Friendly provincial relationships have been established with 16 states (districts) in the United States, Japan, Russia, France, Germany, and others.  Some cities of Henan have established friendly relationships (sister city) with thirty-two foreign cities.\nHenan's service sector is rather small and underdeveloped. Finance and commerce are largely concentrated in urban centers such as Zhengzhou and Luoyang, where the economy is fueled by a large and relatively affluent consumer base. In order to make the economy more knowledge- and technology-based, the government established a number of development zones in all of the major cities, promoting industries such as software, information technologies, new materials, bio-pharmaceutical and photo-machinery-electronics. Henan is a major destination for tourists, with places such as Shaolin Temple and Longmen Grottoes attracting millions of tourists each year.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nHenan has some of the most advanced transportation system in China due to its flat terrain and its location at the heart of central China's construction boom. The Jingguang and Longhai Railway, the nation's two most important railways, run through much of the province and intersects at Zhengzhou. Other railway hubs such as Shangqiu, Xinxiang, and Luohe have also become important centers of trade and manufacturing as a result. A high-speed railway links Zhengzhou with Xi'an. Henan's expressway system is highly developed and the total length is approximately 5,000 km (3,100 mi), the highest total for any Chinese province. The state of air transport is less stellar, the only 3 public airports are located in Xinzheng (near Zhengzhou), Luoyang, and Nanyang.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nMost of Henan speaks dialects of the Mandarin group of dialects spoken in northern and southwestern China. Linguists put these dialects into the category of \"Zhongyuan Mandarin\". The northwestern corner of Henan is an exception, where people speak Jin dialects instead. The dialects of Henan are collectively called \"the Henan dialect\" in popular usage, with easily identifiable stereotypical features.\nYu opera (Yuju) is the local form of Chinese opera; it is also well-known and popular across the rest of China. Henan Quju and Henan Yuediao are also important local opera forms.\nHenan cuisine is the local cuisine, with traditions such as the Luoyang Shuixi (Luoyang \"Water Table\", consisting entirely of various soups, etc.); Xinyang Duncai (Xinyang brewed vegetables), and the traditional cuisine of Kaifeng.\nImportant traditional art and craft products include: Junci, a type of porcelain originating in Yuzhou noted for its unpredictable colour patterns; the jade carvings of Zhenping; and Luoyang's Tangsancai (\"Tang Three Colours\"), which are earthenware figurines made in the traditional style of the Tang dynasty.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nHenan is located in the Yellow River valley where ancient people lived. Intricate pottery, writing and musical instruments of the Peiligang Culture and Yangshao Culture arose during neolithic times. Three of the Seven Ancient Capitals of China are in Henan: Luoyang, Kaifeng and Anyang. 16 historical sites in Henan are protected at the national level and 267 more at the provincial level.\n\nMount Jigong, on the southern border.\nMount Song, near Dengfeng, one of the Five Sacred Mountains of China.\nShaolin Temple, on Mount Song.\nGaocheng Astronomical Observatory in Dengfeng, the oldest astronomical observatory in China.\nLongmen Grottoes, near Luoyang, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2000.\nSongyue Pagoda\nYinxu in Anyang, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nYouguo Temple with the Iron Pagoda\nWhite Horse Temple in Luoyang\nBaligou in Xinxiang\nMount Mangdang in Shangqiu\nYuntai Mountain in Jiaozuo\n\n\n== Colleges and universities ==\n\nZhengzhou University\nHenan University of Economics and Law\nHenan University\nHenan Agricultural University\nHenan Polytechnic University\nHenan University of Science and Technology\nHenan Normal University\nNorth China Institute of Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric Power\nZhongyuan Institute of Technology\nZhengzhou University of Light Industry\nHenan University of Technology\nZhengzhou Institute of Aeronautical Industry Management\nHenan Medical University\nHenan College of Traditional Chinese Medicine\nXinxiang College\nHuanghe Science and Technology University\nNanyang Institute of Technology\nSias University\nShangqiu College\nShangqiu Normal College\nAnyang Institute of Technology\nZhengzhou Grain College\nZhengzhou University of Technology\nZhengzhou Textile Institute\nLuoyang Institute of Technology\nPingdingshan Normal College\nXinxiang Medical University\nNanyang Teachers College\n\n\n== Notable individuals ==\nSun Tiantian (born 12 October 1981), tennis player\nZhao Ziyang (17 October 1919 \u2212 17 January 2005), former Premier and CCP Secretary\nDeng Yaping (born 5 February 1973), four-time Olympic gold medalist.\nDu Wei (born 9 February 1982), professional football player\nGe Xin'ai (born 30 June 1953) Table Tennis World Champion (1975, 1977, 1979)\nChen Zhong, Olympic gold medalist in Taekwondo\nLiu Guoliang, member of the Chinese ping pong team\nSu Zhibo, the first Chinese gold medalist in the Asian Games\nShang Tang, the first ruling king of the Shang dynasty\nHui Shi (380 BC\u2212?), philosopher\nXu Shen (c.58\u2212c. 147), editor of the Shuowen Jiezi\nRuan Ji (210\u2013263), poet\nDu Fu (712\u2013770), considered one of the greatest of Chinese poets\nHan Yu (768\u2013824), one of China's best known prose writers and poets\nLi Shangyin (813\u2013858), poet\nCheng Hao (1032\u20131085) and brother Cheng Yi (1033\u20131107), Neo-Confucian philosophers\nLi Tang (c. 1080\u2212c. 1130), painter\nYuan Shikai (1859\u20131916), second President of the Republic of China\nFeng Youlan (1895\u20131990), philosopher\nLao Zi (Lao Tzu: dates uncertain), founder of Daoism\nChuang Tzu (born 369 BC), Daoist philosopher\nGao Yaojie, medical doctor\nMo Zi, founder of Mohism\nLie Yukou (c. 4th century BC), Daoist philosopher\nLi Pei Yun, Member of Henan Professional Wushu Team and winner of the gold medal every year from 1977 through 1982 in the Henan Province Kung-Fu competition in four different events;

        "wiki": "Guangzhou (; Chinese: \u5e7f\u5dde, Cantonese pronunciation: [k\u02b7\u0254\u030c\u02d0\u014b.ts\u0250\u0302u] or [k\u02b7\u0254\u030c\u02d0\u014b.ts\u0250\u0301u] (listen); Mandarin pronunciation: [kw\u00e0\u014b.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u] (listen)), also known as Canton and formerly romanized as Kwangchow, is the capital and most populous city of the province of Guangdong in southern China. On the Pearl River about 120 km (75 mi) north-northwest of Hong Kong and 145 km (90 mi) north of Macau, Guangzhou has a history of over 2,200 years and was a major terminus of the maritime Silk Road, and continues to serve as a major port and transportation hub, as well as one of China's three largest cities.Guangzhou is at the heart of the most-populous built-up metropolitan area in mainland China, which extends into the neighboring cities of Foshan, Dongguan, Zhongshan and Shenzhen, forming one of the largest urban agglomerations on Earth, the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone. Administratively, the city holds sub-provincial status and is one of China's nine National Central Cities. At the end of 2018, the population of the city's expansive administrative area was estimated at 14,904,400 by city authorities, up 3.8% from the previous year. Guangzhou is ranked as an Alpha global city. There is a rapidly increasing number of foreign temporary residents and immigrants from Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa. This has led to it being dubbed the \"Capital of the Third World\".The domestic migrant population from other provinces of China in Guangzhou was 40% of the city's total population in 2008. Together with Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen, Guangzhou has one of the most expensive real estate markets in China.  In the late 1990s and early 2000s, nationals of sub-Saharan Africa who had initially settled in the Middle East and other parts of Southeast Asia moved in unprecedented numbers to Guangzhou in response to the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis.Long the only Chinese port accessible to  most foreign traders, Guangzhou fell to the British during the First Opium War.  No longer enjoying a monopoly after the war, it lost trade to other ports such as Hong Kong and Shanghai, but continued to serve as a major entrep\u00f4t.  In modern commerce, Guangzhou is best known for its annual Canton Fair, the oldest and largest trade fair in China.  For three consecutive years (2013\u20132015), Forbes ranked Guangzhou as the best commercial city in mainland China.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\n\nGu\u01cengzh\u014du is the pinyin romanisation of the Chinese name \u5ee3\u5dde, which was simplified in mainland China to \u5e7f\u5dde in the 1950s. The name of the city is taken from the ancient Guang Province (Guang Zhou), after it had become the prefecture's seat of government, which is how some other Chinese cities, including Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Fuzhou got their names. The character \u5ee3 or \u5e7f\u2014which also appears in the names of the provinces Guangdong and Guangxi, together called the Liangguang\u2014means \"broad\" or \"expansive\" and refers to the intention to dispense imperial grace broadly in the region with the founding of county of Guangxin in the Han Dynasty.\nBefore acquiring its current name, the town was known as Panyu (\u756a\u79ba), a name still borne by one of Guangzhou's districts not far from the main city. The origin of the name is still uncertain, with 11 various explanations being offered, including that it may have referred to two local mountains. The city has also sometimes been known as Guangzhou Fu or Guangfu after its status as the capital of a prefecture. From this latter name, Guangzhou was known to medieval Persians such as Al-Masudi and Ibn Khordadbeh as Khanfu (\u062e\u0627\u0646\u0641\u0648). Under the Southern Han, the city was renamed Xingwang Fu (\u8208\u738b\u5e9c).The Chinese abbreviation for Guangzhou is \"\u7a57\" (although the abbreviation on car license plates, as with the rest of the province, is \u7ca4), after its nickname \"Rice City\" (\u7a57\u57ce). The city has long borne the nickname City of Rams (\u7f8a\u57ce) or City of the Five Rams (\u4e94\u7f8a\u57ce) from the five stones at the old Temple of the Five Immortals said to have been the sheep or goats ridden by the Taoist culture heroes credited with introducing rice cultivation to the area around the time of the city's foundation. The former name \"City of the Immortals\" (\u4ed9\u57ce/\u4e94\u4ed9\u57ce) came from the same story. The more recent City of Flowers (\u82b1\u57ce) is usually taken as a simple reference to the area's fine greenery.\nThe English name \"Canton\" derived from Portuguese Cant\u00e3o or Cidade de Cant\u00e3o, a muddling of dialectical pronunciations of \"Guangdong\" (e.g., Hakka K\u00f3ng-t\u00fbng). Although it originally and chiefly applied to the walled city, it was occasionally conflated with Guangdong by some authors. It was adopted as the Postal Map Romanization of Guangzhou and remained in common use until the gradual adoption of pinyin. As an adjective, it is still used in describing the people, language, cuisine and culture of Guangzhou and the surrounding Liangguang region. The 19th-century name \"Kwang-chow foo\" derived from Nanjing dialect of Mandarin and the town's status as a prefectural capital.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nA settlement now known as Nanwucheng was present in the area by 1100 BC. Some traditional Chinese histories placed Nanwucheng's founding during the reign of Ji Yan, king of Zhou from 314\u2013256 BC. It was said to have consisted of little more than a stockade of bamboo and mud.\n\n\n=== Nanyue ===\nPanyu was established on the east bank of the Pearl River in 214 BC to serve as a base for the Qin Empire's first failed invasion of the Baiyue lands in southern China. Legendary accounts claimed the soldiers at Panyu were so vigilant that they did not remove their armor for three years. Upon the fall of the Qin, General Zhao Tuo established his own kingdom of Nanyue and made Panyu its capital in 204 BC. It remained independent through the Chu-Han Contention, although Zhao negotiated recognition of his independence in exchange for his nominal submission to the Han in 196 BC. Archaeological evidence shows that Panyu was an expansive commercial centre: in addition to items from central China, archaeologists have found remains originating from Southeast Asia, India, and even Africa. Zhao Tuo was succeeded by Zhao Mo and then Zhao Yingqi. Upon Zhao Yingqi's death in 115 BC, his younger son Zhao Xing was named as his successor in violation of Chinese primogeniture. By 113 BC, his Chinese mother, the Empress Dowager Jiu (\u6a1b) had prevailed upon him to submit Nanyue as a formal part of the Han Empire. The native prime minister L\u00fc Jia (\u5442\u5609) launched a coup, killing Han ambassadors along with the king, his mother, and their supporters. A successful ambush then annihilated a Han force which had been sent to arrest him. The enraged Emperor Wu launched a massive river- and sea-borne invasion: six armies under Lu Bode and Yang Pu took Panyu and annexed Nanyue by the end of 111 BC.\n\n\n=== Imperial China ===\n\nIncorporated into the Han Dynasty, Panyu became a provincial capital. In AD 226, it became the seat of Guang Prefecture, which gave it its modern name. The Old Book of Tang described Guangzhou as an important port in southern China. Direct routes connected the Middle East and China, as shown in records of a Chinese prisoner returning home from Iraq twelve years after his capture at Talas. Relations were not always peaceful: Arab and Persian pirates sacked the city on 30 October 758 and were massacred by the Chinese rebel Huang Chao in 878, along with the city's Jews, Christians, and Parsis. The port was reportedly closed for fifty years after the chaos.Amid the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms that followed the collapse of the Tang dynasty, the Later Liang governor Liu Yan used his base at Panyu to establish a \"Great Yue\" or \"Southern Han\" empire, which lasted from 917 to 971. The region enjoyed considerable cultural and economic success in this period. From the 10th to 12th century, there are records that the large foreign communities were not exclusively male, but included \"Persian women\". According to Odoric of Pordenone, Guangzhou was as large as three Venices and rivalled all of Italy in the amount of crafts it produced. He also noted the large amount of ginger available as well as large geese and snakes. Guangzhou was visited by the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta during his 14th-century journey around the world; he detailed the process by which the Chinese constructed their large ships in the port's shipyards.Shortly after the Hongwu Emperor's declaration of the Ming dynasty, he reversed his earlier support of foreign trade and imposed the first of a series of sea bans (haijin). These banned private foreign trade upon penalty of death for the merchant and exile for his family and neighbors. The Yuan-era maritime intendancies of Guangzhou, Quanzhou, and Ningbo were closed in 1384 and legal trade became limited to the tribute delegations sent to or by official representatives of foreign governments.Following the Portuguese conquest of Malacca, Rafael Perestrello travelled to Guangzhou as a passenger on a native junk in 1516. His report induced Fern\u00e3o Pires de Andrade to sail to the city with eight ships the next year, but De Andrade's exploration was understood as spying and his brother Sim\u00e3o and others began attempting to monopolize trade, enslaving Chinese women and children, engaging in piracy, and fortifying the island of Tam\u00e3o. Rumors even circulated that Portuguese were eating the children. The Guangzhou administration was charged with driving them off: they bested the Portuguese at the Battle of Tunmen and in Xicao Bay; held a diplomatic mission hostage in a failed attempt to pressure the restoration of the sultan of Malacca, who had been accounted a Ming vassal; and, after placing them in cangues and keeping them for most of a year, ultimately executed 23 by lingchi. With the help of local pirates, the \"Folangji\" then carried out smuggling at Macao, Lampacau, and St John's Island (now Shangchuan), until Leonel de Sousa legalized their trade with bribes to Admiral Wang Bo (\u6c6a\u67cf) and the 1554 Luso-Chinese Accord. The Portuguese undertook not to raise fortifications and to pay customs dues; three years later, after providing the Chinese with assistance suppressing their former pirate allies, the Portuguese were permitted to warehouse their goods at Macau instead of Guangzhou itself.On October 1646, the Longwu Emperor's brother Zhu Yuyue fled by sea to Guangzhou the last seat of the Ming empire. On 11 December, he declared himself the Shaowu Emperor, borrowing his imperial regalia from local theatre troupes. He led a successful offense against his cousin Zhu Youlang but was deposed and executed on 20 January 1647 when the Ming turncoat Li Chengdong (\u674e\u6210\u6771) sacked the city on behalf of the Qing.The Qing became somewhat more open to foreign trade after gaining control of Taiwan in 1683. The Portuguese from Macau and Spaniards from Manila returned, as did private Muslim, Armenian, and English traders. From 1699 to 1714, the French and British East India Companies sent a ship or two each year; the Austrian Ostend General India Co. arrived in 1717, the Dutch East India Co. in 1729, the Danish Asiatic Co. in 1731, and the Swedish East India Co. the next year. These were joined by the occasional Prussian or Trieste Company vessel. The first independent American ship arrived in 1784 and the first colonial Australian one in 1788. By that time, Guangzhou was one of the world's great ports, organised under the Canton System. The main exports were tea and porcelain. As a meeting place of merchants from all over the world, Guangzhou became a major contributor to the rise of the modern global economy.In the 19th century, most of the city's buildings were still only one or two storeys. The major structures were the Plain Minaret of the Huaisheng Mosque, the Flower Pagoda of the Temple of the Six Banyan Trees, and the guard tower known as the 5-Storey Pagoda. The northern hills, since urbanized, were bare and covered with traditional graves. The brick city walls were about 6 miles (10 km) in circumference, 25 feet (8 m) high, and 20 feet (6 m) wide. Its eight main gates and two water gates all held guards during the day and were closed at night. The wall rose to incorporate a hill on its northern side and was surrounded on the other three by a moat which, along with the canals, functioned as the city's sewer, emptied daily by the river's tides. A partition wall with four gates divided the northern \"old town\" from the southern \"new town\" closer to the river; the suburb of Xiguan (\"West Gate\") stretched beyond and the boats of fishers, traders, and Tanka (\"boat people\") almost entirely concealed the riverbank for about 4 miles (6 km). It was common for homes to have a storefront facing the street and to treat their courtyards as a kind of warehouse. The city was part of a network of signal towers so effective that messages could be relayed to Beijing\u2014about 1,200 miles (1,931 km) away\u2014in less than 24 hours.The Canton System was maintained until the outbreak of the First Opium War in 1839. Following a series of battles in the Pearl River Delta, the British captured Guangzhou itself on 18 March 1841. The Second Battle of Canton was fought two months later. Following the Qing's 1842 treaty with Great Britain, Guangzhou lost its privileged trade status as more and more treaty ports were opened to more and more countries, usually including extraterritorial enclaves. Amid the decline of Qing prestige and the chaos of the Red Turban Rebellion (1854\u20131856), the Punti and Hakka waged a series of clan wars from 1855 to 1867 in which one million people died.\nThe concession for the Guangzhou\u2013Hankou railway was awarded to the American China Development Co. in 1898. It completed its branch line west to Foshan and Sanshui before being engulfed in a diplomatic crisis after a Belgian consortium bought a controlling interest and the Qing cancelled its concession. J.P. Morgan was awarded millions in damages and the line to Wuchang wasn't completed until 1936 and a unified Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway waited until the completion of Wuhan's Yangtze River Bridge in 1957.\n\n\n=== Modern China ===\n\n\n==== Revolutions ====\n\nDuring the late Qing Dynasty, Guangzhou was the site of failed revolts such as the Uprisings of 1895 and 1911 to overthrow the Qing; the 72 rebels whose bodies were found after the latter uprising are remembered and honoured as the city's 72 Martyrs in the Huanghuagang (\"Yellow Flower Mound\") Mausoleum.\nAll these failed revolutionary attempts would eventually lead to the Xinhai Revolution which successfully overthrew the Qing Dynasty to establish a new Han Chinese republic.\n\n\n==== Republic of China ====\nAfter the assassination of Song Jiaoren and Yuan Shikai's attempts to remove the Nationalist Party of China from power, the leader of Guangdong Hu Hanmin joined the 1913 Second Revolution against him but was forced to flee to Japan with Sun Yat-sen after its failure. The city came under national spotlight again in 1917, when Prime Minister Duan Qirui's abrogation of the constitution triggered the Constitutional Protection Movement. Sun Yat-sen came to head the Guangzhou Military Government supported by the members of the dissolved parliament and the Southwestern warlords. The Guangzhou government fell apart as the warlords withdrew their support. Sun fled to Shanghai in November 1918 until the Guangdong warlord Chen Jiongming restored him in October 1920 during the Yuegui Wars. On 16 June 1922, Sun was ousted in a coup and fled on the warship Yongfeng after Chen sided with the Zhili Clique's Beijing government. In the following months Sun mounted a counterattack into Guangdong by rallying supporters from Yunnan and Guangxi, and in January established a government in the city for the third time.\n\nFrom 1923 to 1926 Sun and the Kuomintang used the city as a base to prosecute a renewed revolution in China by conquering the warlords in the north.  Although Sun was previously dependent on opportunistic warlords who hosted him in the city, with the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, the KMT developed its own military power to serve its ambition. The Canton years saw the evolution of the KMT into a revolutionary movement with a strong military focus and ideological commitment, setting the tone of the KMT rule of China beyond 1927.\nIn 1924 the KMT made the momentous decision to ally with the Communist Party and the USSR. With Soviet help, KMT reorganized itself along the Leninist line and adopted a pro-labor and pro-peasant stance. The Kuomintang-CCP cooperation was confirmed in the First Congress of the KMT and the communists were instructed to join the KMT. The allied government set up the Peasant Movement Training Institute in the city, of which Mao Zedong was a director for one term. Sun and his military commander Chiang used Soviet funds and weapons to build an armed force staffed by communist commissars, training its cadres in the Whampoa Military Academy. In August, the fledgling army suppressed the Canton Merchants' Corps Uprising. The next year the anti-imperialist May Thirtieth Movement swept the country, and the KMT government called for strikes in Canton and Hong Kong. The tensions of the massive strikes and protests led to the Shakee Massacre.\nAfter the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925 the mood was changing in the party toward the communists. In August the left-wing KMT leader Liao Zhongkai was assassinated and the right-wing leader Hu Hanmin, the suspected mastermind, was exiled to the Soviet Union, leaving the pro-communist Wang Jingwei in charge. Opposing communist encroachment, the right-wing Western Hills Group vowed to expel the communists from the KMT. The \"Canton Coup\" on 20 March 1926 saw Chiang solidify his control over the Nationalists and their army against Wang Jingwei, the party's left wing, its Communist allies, and its Soviet advisors. By May, he had ended civilian control of the military and begun his Northern Expedition against the warlords of the north. Its success led to the split of the KMT between Wuhan and Nanking and the purge of the communists in the Shanghai Massacre. Immediately afterwards Canton joined the purge under the auspice of Li Jishen, resulting in the arrest of communists and the suspension of left wing KMT apparatuses and labor groups. Later in 1927 when Zhang Fakui, a general supportive of the Wuhan faction seized Canton and installed Wang Jingwei's faction in the city, the communists saw an opening and launched the Guangzhou Uprising. Prominent communist military leaders Ye Ting and Ye Jianying led the failed defense of the city. Soon, control of the city reverted to Li Jishen.\nLi was deposed in the War between Chiang and Guangxi Clique. By 1929, Chen Jitang had established himself as the powerholder of Guangdong. In 1931 he threw his weight behind the anti-Chiang schism by hosting a separate Nationalist government in Guangzhou. Opposing Chiang's alleged dictatorship, the separatists included KMT leaders like Wang Jingwei, Sun Fo and others from diverse factions. The peace negotiations amidst the armed stand-off led to the 4th National Congress of Kuomintang being held separately by three factions in Nanjing, Shanghai and Canton. Resigning all his posts, Chiang pulled off a political compromise that reunited all factions. While the intraparty division was resolved, Chen kept his power until he was defeated by Chiang in 1936.\nDuring World War II, the \"Canton Operation\" subjected the city to Japanese occupation by the end of December 1938.\n\n\n==== People's Republic of China ====\nAmid the closing months of the Chinese Civil War, Guangzhou briefly served as the capital of the Republic of China after the taking of Nanjing by the PLA in April 1949. The People's Liberation Army entered the city on 14 October 1949. Amid a massive exodus to Hong Kong and Macau, the Nationalists blew up the Haizhu Bridge across the Pearl River in retreat. The Cultural Revolution had a large effect on the city with much of its temples, churches and other monuments destroyed during this chaotic period.\nThe People's Republic of China initiated building projects including new housing on the banks of the Pearl River to adjust the city's boat people to life on land. Since the 1980s, the city's close proximity to Hong Kong and Shenzhen and its ties to overseas Chinese have made it one of the first beneficiaries of China's opening up under Deng Xiaoping. Beneficial tax reforms in the 1990s have also helped the city's industrialisation and development.\nThe municipality was expanded in the year 2000, with Huadu and Panyu joining the city as urban districts and Conghua and Zengcheng as more rural counties. The former districts of Dongshan and Fangcun were abolished in 2005, merged into Yuexiu and Liwan respectively. The city acquired Nansha and Luogang. The former was carved out of Panyu, the latter from parts of Baiyun, Tianhe, Zengcheng, and an exclave within Huangpu. The National People's Congress approved a development plan for the Pearl River Delta in January 2009; on March 19 the same year, the Guangzhou and Foshan municipal governments agreed to establish a framework to merge the two cities. In 2014, Luogang merged into Huangpu and both Conghua and Zengcheng counties were upgraded to districts.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe old town of Guangzhou was near Baiyun Mountain on the east bank of the Pearl River (Zhujiang) about 80 miles (129 km) from its junction with the South China Sea and about 300 miles (483 km) below its head of navigation. It commanded the rich alluvial plain of the Pearl River Delta, with its connection to the sea protected at the Humen Strait. The present city spans 7,434.4 square kilometres (2,870.4 sq mi) on both sides of the river from 112\u00b0 57\u2032 to 114\u00b0 03\u2032 E longitude and 22\u00b0 26\u2032 to 23\u00b0 56\u2032 N latitude in south-central Guangdong. The Pearl is the 4th-largest river of China. Baiyun Mountain is now locally referred to as the city's \"lung\" (\u5e02\u80ba).The elevation of the prefecture generally increases from southwest to northeast, with mountains forming the backbone of the city and the ocean comprising the front. Tiantang Peak (\u5929\u5802\u9876, \"Heavenly Peak\") is the highest point of elevation at 1,210 metres (3,970 ft) above sea level.\n\n\n=== Natural resources ===\nThere are 47 different types of minerals and also 820 ore fields in Guangzhou, including 18 large and medium-sized oil deposits. The major minerals are granite, cement limestone, ceramic clay, potassium, albite, salt mine, mirabilite, nepheline, syenite, fluorite, marble, mineral water, and geothermal mineral water. Since Guangzhou is located in the water-rich area of southern China, it has a wide water area with lots of rivers and water systems, accounting for 10% of the total land area. The rivers and streams improve the landscape and keep the ecological environment of the city stable.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDespite being located just south of the Tropic of Cancer, Guangzhou has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) influenced by the East Asian monsoon. Summers are wet with high temperatures, high humidity, and a high heat index. Winters are mild and comparatively dry. Guangzhou has a lengthy monsoon season, spanning from April through September. Monthly averages range from 13.9 \u00b0C (57.0 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July, while the annual mean is 22.6 \u00b0C (72.7 \u00b0F). Autumn, from October to December, is very moderate, cool and windy, and is the best travel time. The relative humidity is approximately 68 percent, whereas annual rainfall in the metropolitan area is over 1,700 mm (67 in). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 17 percent in March and April to 52 percent in November, the city receives 1,628 hours of bright sunshine annually, considerably less than nearby Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Extreme temperatures have ranged from 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) to 39.1 \u00b0C (102.4 \u00b0F). The last recorded snowfall in the city was on 24 January 2016, 87 years after the second last recorded snowfall.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nGuangzhou is a sub-provincial city. It has direct jurisdiction over eleven districts:\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nGuangzhou is the main manufacturing hub of the Pearl River Delta, one of mainland China's leading commercial and manufacturing regions. In 2017, the GDP reached \u00a52,150 billion (US$318 billion), per capita was \u00a5150,678 (US$22,317). Guangzhou is considered one of the most prosperous cities in China.  Owing to rapid industrialisation, it is also considered one of the most polluted cities once. But as city development goes greener, it is now one of the most livable cities in China.\nThe Canton Fair, formally the \"China Import and Export Fair\", is held every year in April and October by the Ministry of Trade. Inaugurated in the spring of 1957, the fair is a major event for the city. It is the trade fair with the longest history, highest level, largest scale in China. From the 104th session onwards, the fair moved to the new Guangzhou International Convention and Exhibition Center (\u5e7f\u5dde\u56fd\u9645\u4f1a\u5c55\u4e2d\u5fc3) in Pazhou, from the older complex in Liuhua. The GICEC is served by two stations on Line 8 and three stations on Tram Line THZ1. Since the 104th session, the Canton Fair has been arranged in three phases instead of two phases.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Local products ===\nCantonese is one of China's most famous and popular regional cuisines, with a saying stating simply to \"Eat in Guangzhou\" (\u98df\u5728\u5e7f\u5dde)\nCantonese sculpture includes work in jade, wood, and (now controversially) ivory.\nCanton porcelain developed over the past three centuries as one of the major forms of exportware. It is now known within China for its highly colorful style.\nCantonese embroidery is one of China's four main styles of the art and is represented in Guangzhou, although its principal centre is at Chaozhou.\nZhujiang Beer, a pale lager, is one of China's most successful brands. It is made in Guangzhou from water piped directly to the brewery from a natural spring.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\nGuangzhou Peugeot Automobile Company produced the Peugeot 504 and Peugeot 505 automobiles from 1989 to 1997.\n\nGuangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone\nGuangzhou Nansha Export Processing Zone\nThe Export Processing Zone was founded in 2005. Its total planned area is 1.36 km2 (0.53 sq mi). It is located in Nansha District and it belongs to the provincial capital, Guangzhou. The major industries encouraged in the zone include automobile assembly, biotechnology and heavy industry. It is situated 54 kilometres (34 miles) (70 minutes drive) south of Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport and close to Nansha Port. It also has the advantage of Guangzhou Metro line 4 which is being extended to Nansha Ferry Terminal.\nGuangzhou Free Trade Zone\nThe zone was founded in 1992. It is located in the east of Huangpu District and near to Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone. It is also very close to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport. The major industries encouraged in the zone include international trade, logistics, processing and computer software.\nGuangzhou Science City\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe 2010 census found Guangzhou's population to be 12.78 million. As of 2014, it was estimated at 13,080,500, with 11,264,800 urban residents. Its population density is thus around 1,800 people per km2. The built-up area of the Guangzhou proper connects directly to several other cities. The built-up area of the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone covers around 17,573 square kilometres (6,785 sq mi) and has been estimated to house 22 million people, including Guangzhou's nine urban districts, Shenzhen (5.36m), Dongguan (3.22m), Zhongshan (3.12m), most of Foshan (2.2m), Jiangmen (1.82m), Zhuhai (890k), and Huizhou's Huiyang District (760k). The total population of this agglomeration is over 28 million after including the population of the adjacent Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The area's fast-growing economy and high demand for labour has produced a huge \"floating population\" of migrant workers. Up to 10 million migrants reside in the area least six months each year. In 2008, about five million of Guangzhou's permanent residents were hukouless migrants.\n\n\n=== Ethnicity and language ===\nMost of Guangzhou's population is Han Chinese. Almost all of the local Cantonese people speak Cantonese as their first language, while most migrants speak forms of Mandarin. In 2010, each language was the native tongue of roughly half of the city's population, although minor but substantial numbers speak other varieties as well. In 2018, He Huifeng of the South China Morning Post stated that younger residents have increasingly favored using Mandarin instead of Cantonese in their daily lives, causing their Cantonese-speaking grandparents and parents to use Mandarin to communicate with them. He Huifeng stated that factors included local authorities discouraging the use of Cantonese in schools and the rise in prestige of Mandarin-speaking Shenzhen. Guangzhou has a very unbalanced gender ratio, but its province has a higher imbalance than the rest of the country. While most areas of China have 112-120 boys per 100 girls, the Guangdong province that houses Guangzhou has more than 130 boys for every 100 girls.The influx of Chinese immigrants in Guangzhou also brought an estimated 300,000 prostitutes mostly from Sichuan from central China. Guangzhou now has a huge influx of migrants, with up to 30 million additional migrants living in the area for at least six months out of every year. This huge influx of people from other areas, called the floating population, is due to the city's fast-growing economy and high labor demands. Guangzhou Mayor Wan Qingliang told an urban planning seminar that Guangzhou is facing a very serious population problem stating that, while the city had 10.33 million registered residents at the time with targets and scales of land use based on this number, the city actually had a population with migrants of nearly 15 million. According to the Guangzhou Academy of Social Sciences researcher Peng Peng, the city is almost at its maximum capacity of just 15 million, which means the city is facing a great strain, mostly due to a high population of unregistered people.According to the 2000 National Census, marriage is one of the top two reasons for permanent migration and particular important for female as 29.3% of the permanent female migrants migrate for marriage [Liang et al.,2004]. Many of the economic migrant female marries men from Guangzhou in hopes of a better life. but like elsewhere in the People's Republic of China, the household registration system (hukou) limits migrants' access to residences, educational institutions and other public benefits. In May 2014, legally employed migrants in Guangzhou were permitted to receive a hukou card allowing them to marry and obtain permission for their pregnancies in the city, rather than having to return to their official hometowns as previously.Historically, the Cantonese people have made up a sizeable part of the 19th- and 20th-century Chinese diaspora and many overseas Chinese have ties to Guangzhou. This is particularly true in the United States, Canada, and Australia.\nDemographically, the only significant immigration into China has been by overseas Chinese, but Guangzhou sees many foreign tourists, workers, and residents from the usual locations such as the United States. Notably, it is also home to thousands of African immigrants, including people from Nigeria, Somalia, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\nThe encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 25 million.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Urban mass transit ===\n\nWhen the first line of the Guangzhou Metro opened in 1997, Guangzhou was the fourth city in Mainland China to have an underground railway system, behind Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. Currently the metro network is made up of thirteen lines, covering a total length of 476.26 km (295.93 mi). A long-term plan is to make the city's metro system expand to over 500 km (310 mi) by 2020 with 15 lines in operation. In addition to the metro system there is also the Haizhu Tram line which opened on 31 December 2014.The Guangzhou Bus Rapid Transit (GBRT) system which was introduced in 2010 along Zhongshan Road. It has several connections to the metro and is the world's 2nd-largest Bus Rapid Transit system with 1,000,000 passenger trips daily. It handles 26,900 pphpd during the peak hour a capacity second only to the TransMilenio BRT system in Bogota. The system averages one bus every 10 seconds or 350 per hour in a single direction and contains the world's longest BRT stations\u2014around 260 m (850 ft) including bridges.\n\n\n=== Motor transport ===\n\nIn the 19th century, the city already boasted over 600 long, straight streets; these were mostly paved but still very narrow. In June 1919, work began on demolishing the city wall to make way for wider streets and the development of tramways. The demolition took three years in total.In 2009, it was reported that all 9,424 buses and 17,695 taxis in Guangzhou would be operating on LPG-fuel by 2010 to promote clean energy for transport and improve the environment ahead of the 2010 Asian Games which were held in the city. At present, Guangzhou is the city that uses the most LPG-fueled vehicles in the world, and at the end of 2006, 6,500 buses and 16,000 taxis were using LPG, taking up 85 percent of all buses and taxis.Effective January 1, 2007, the municipal government banned motorcycles in Guangdong's urban areas. Motorcycles found violating the ban are confiscated. The Guangzhou traffic bureau claimed to have reported reduced traffic problems and accidents in the downtown area since the ban.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nGuangzhou's main airport is the Baiyun International Airport in Baiyun District; it opened on August 5, 2004. This airport is the second busiest airport in terms of traffic movements in China. It replaced the old Baiyun International Airport, which was very close to the city centre but failed to meet the city's fast-growing air traffic demand. The old Baiyun International Airport was in operation for 72 years. Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport now has three runways, with two more planned. The Terminal 2 has opened on April 26, 2018. Another airport located in Zengcheng District is under planning.Guangzhou is served by Hong Kong International Airport; ticketed passengers can take ferries from the Lianhuashan Ferry Terminal and Nansha Ferry Port in Nansha District to the HKIA Skypier. There are also coach bus services connecting Guangzhou with HKIA.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\nGuangzhou is the terminus of the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou, Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen, Guangzhou\u2013Maoming and Guangzhou\u2013Meizhou\u2013Shantou conventional speed railways. In late 2009, the Wuhan\u2013Guangzhou high-speed railway started service, with multiple unit trains covering 980 km (608.94 mi) at a top speed of 320 km/h (199 mph).  In December 2014, the Guiyang\u2013Guangzhou high-speed railway and Nanning-Guangzhou railway began service with trains running at top speeds of 250 km/h (155 mph) and 200 km/h (124 mph), respectively. The Guangdong Through Train departs from the Guangzhou East railway station and arrives at the Hung Hom Station in Kowloon, Hong Kong. The route is approximately 182 km (113 mi) in length and the ride takes less than two hours. Frequent coach services are also provided with coaches departing every day from different locations (mostly major hotels) around the city. A number of regional railways radiating from Guangzhou started operating such as the Guangzhou\u2013Zhuhai intercity railway and the Guangzhou-Foshan-Zhaoqing intercity railway.\n\n\n=== Water transport ===\nThere are daily high-speed catamaran services between Nansha Ferry Terminal and Lianhua Shan Ferry Terminal in Guangzhou and the Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal, as well as between Nansha Ferry Terminal and Macau Ferry Pier in Hong Kong.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nWithin China, the culture of the Cantonese people is a subset of the larger \"Southern\" or \"Lingnan\" cultural areas. Notable aspects of Guangzhou's cultural heritage include:\n\nCantonese language, the local and prestige variant of Yue Chinese\nCantonese cuisine, one of China's eight major culinary traditions\nCantonese opera, usually divided into martial and literary performances\nXiguan, the area west of the former walled cityGuangzhou Opera House & Symphony Orchestra also perform classical Western music and Chinese compositions in their style. Cantonese music is a traditional style of Chinese instrumental music, while Cantopop is the local form of pop music and rock-and-roll which developed from neighbouring Hong Kong.\n\n\n=== Religions ===\nQing-era Guangzhou had around 124 religious pavilions, halls, and temples. Today, in addition to the Buddhist Association, Guangzhou also has a Taoist Association, a Jewish community, and a history with Christianity and Islam.\n\n\n==== Daoism ====\nTaoism and Chinese folk religion are still represented at a few of the city's temples. Among the most important is the Temple of the Five Immortals, honoring the five immortals credited with introducing rice cultivation at the foundation of the city. The five rams they rode were supposed to have turned into stones upon their departure and gave the city several of its nicknames. Another place of worship is the City God Temple. Guangzhou, like most of southern China, is also notably observant concerning ancestral veneration during occasions like the Tomb Sweeping and Ghost Festivals.\n\n\n==== Buddhism ====\nBuddhism is the most prominent religion in Guangzhou. The Zhizhi Temple was founded in AD 233 from the estate of a Wu official; it is said to comprise the residence of Zhao Jiande, the last of the Nanyue kings, and has been known as the Guangxiao Temple (\"Temple of Bright Filial Piety\") since the Ming. The missionary Bodhidharma is traditionally said to have visited Panyu during the Liu Song or Liang dynasties (5th or 6th century). Around AD 520, Emperor Wu of the Liang ordered the construction of the Baozhuangyan Temple and the Xilai Monastery to store the relics of Cambodian Buddhist saints which had been brought to the city and to house the monks beginning to assemble there. The Baozhuangyan is now known as the Temple of the Six Banyan Trees, after a famous poem composed by Su Shi after a visit during the Northern Song. The Xilai Monastery was renamed the Hualin Temple (\"Flowery Forest Temple\") after its reconstruction during the Qing.\nThe temples were damaged by both the Republican campaign to \"Promote Education with Temple Property\" (\u5edf\u7522\u8208\u5b78) and the Maoist Cultural Revolution but have been renovated since the opening up that began in the 1980s. The Ocean Banner Temple on Henan Island, once famous in the west as the only tourist spot in Guangzhou accessible to foreigners, has been reopened as the Hoi Tong Monastery.\n\n\n==== Christianity ====\nNestorian Christians first arrived in China via the overland Silk Road, but suffered during Emperor Wuzong's 845 persecution and were essentially extinct by the year 1000. The Qing-era ban on foreigners limited missionaries until it was abolished following the First Opium War, although the Protestant Robert Morrison was able to perform some work through his service with the British factory. The Catholic Archdiocese of Guangzhou is housed at Guangzhou's Sacred Heart Cathedral, known locally as the \"Stone House\". A Gothic Revival edifice which was built by hand from 1861 to 1888 under French direction, its original Latin and French stained-glass windows were destroyed during the wars and amid the Cultural Revolution; they have since been replaced by English ones. The Canton Christian College (1888) and Hackett Medical College for Women (1902) were both founded by missionaries and now form part of Guangzhou's Lingnan. Since the opening up of China in the 1980s, there has been renewed interest in Christianity, but Guangzhou maintains pressure on underground churches which avoid registration with government officials. The Catholic archbishop Dominic Tang was imprisoned without trial for 22 years, but his present successor is recognised by both the Vatican and China's Patriotic Church.\n\n\n==== Islam ====\nGuangzhou has had a Muslim community since very early in the history of Islam; the native or nativised adherents of the faith are known as the Hui. Huaisheng Mosque was probably built during the Tang dynasty. Arab and Persian pirates sacked the city in 758 and were massacred by the Chinese rebel Huang Chao in 878, along with the Jews, Christians, and Parsis.  The modern city includes numerous halal restaurants.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nThe 18,000 seat Guangzhou International Sports Arena will be one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.From 12\u201327 November 2010, Guangzhou hosted the 16th Asian Games. The same year, it hosted the first Asian Para Games from December 12 to 19. Combined, these were the largest sporting events the city ever hosted.Guangzhou also hosted the following major sporting events:\n\n1987 The 6th National Games of China\n1991 The 1st FIFA Women's World Cup\n2001 The 2001 National Games of China\n2007 The 8th National Traditional Games of Ethnic Minorities of the People's Republic of China\n2008 The 49th World Table Tennis Championships\n2009 The 11th Sudirman Cup: the world badminton mixed team championshipsCurrent professional sports clubs based in Guangzhou include:\n\nIn the 2010s, Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao F.C. has risen to be a powerhouse in association football in China, having won eight out of nine national titles between 2011 and 2019. The team has also won the AFC Champions League in 2013 and 2015. The club has competed at the 2013 and 2015 FIFA Club World Cup, where it lost 3\u20130 in the semi-final stage to the 2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League winners FC Bayern Munich and the 2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League winners FC Barcelona, respectively.\n\n\n== Destinations ==\n\n\n=== Eight Views ===\n\nThe Eight Views of Ram City are Guangzhou's eight most famous tourist attractions. They have varied over time since the Song dynasty, with some being named or demoted by emperors. The following modern list was chosen through public appraisal in 2011:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\n\n\n=== Tourist attractions ===\nGuangzhou attracts more than 223 million visitors each year, and the total revenue of the tourism exceeded 400 billion in 2018.

Together they broadcast in more than a dozen channels. The primary language of both stations is Cantonese. Traditionally only one channel of Radio Guangdong is dedicated to Mandarin Chinese. However, in recent years there has been an increase in Mandarin programmes on most Cantonese channels. Radio stations from cities around Guangzhou mainly broadcast in Cantonese and can be received in different parts of the city, depending on the radio stations' locations and transmission power. The Beijing-based China National Radio also broadcasts Mandarin programmes in the city. Radio Guangdong has a 30-minute weekly English programme, Guangdong Today, which is broadcast globally through the World Radio Network. Daily English news programmes are also broadcast by Radio Guangdong.\nGuangzhou has some of the best Chinese-language newspapers and magazines in mainland China, most of which are published by three major newspaper groups in the city, the Guangzhou Daily Press Group, Nanfang Press Corporation, and the Yangcheng Evening News Group. The two leading newspapers of the city are Guangzhou Daily and Southern Metropolis Daily. The former, with a circulation of 1.8 million, has been China's most successful newspaper for 14 years in terms of advertising revenue, while Southern Metropolis Daily is considered one of the most liberal newspapers in mainland China. In addition to Guangzhou's Chinese-language publications, there are a few English magazines and newspapers. The most successful is That's Guangzhou, which started more than a decade ago and has since blossomed into That's PRD, producing expatriate magazines in Beijing and Shanghai as well. It also produces In the Red.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre, also known as Guangzhou University Town (\u5e7f\u5dde\u5927\u5b66\u57ce), is a large tertiary education complex located in the southeast suburbs of Guangzhou. It occupies the entirety of Xiaoguwei Island in Panyu District, covering an area of about 18 square kilometres (7 sq mi). The complex accommodates campuses from ten higher education institutions and can eventually accommodate up to 200,000 students, 20,000 teachers, and 50,000 staff.The Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Centre higher education campuses:\n\nGuangdong Pharmaceutical University\nGuangdong University of Foreign Studies\nGuangdong University of Technology\nGuangzhou Academy of Fine Arts\nGuangzhou University\nGuangzhou University of Chinese Medicine\nSouth China Normal University\nSouth China University of Technology\nSun Yat-sen University\nXinghai Conservatory of MusicGuangzhou's other fully accredited and degree-granting universities and colleges include:\n\nGuangdong Institute of Science and Technology\nGuangdong Polytechnic Normal University\nGuangdong University of Finance & Economics\nGuangdong University of Finance\nGuangzhou College of South China University of Technology\nGuangzhou Medical University\nGuangzhou Sports University\nJinan University\nSouth China Agricultural University\nSouthern Medical University\nZhongkai University of Agriculture and EngineeringThe two main comprehensive libraries are Guangzhou Library and Sun Yat-sen Library of Guangdong Province.

          "The \u201cYellow River Scenic Spots\u201d are an odd collection of attractions just north of Zhengzhou. First, you can ride a hovercraft out to a low muddy island in the river, where a group of elderly women nicely try to convince you to rent their ATV or go for a pony ride until it\u2019s",
          "One of the marvel of China culture examples. We had walked nearly 5Km and seen so many (1000s) Lord Buddha and work. You feel something different and you feel vibrations. Truly amazing. Olden days, many Indian monks travelled to China SJ settled and I had seen many and many",
          "we had an organised activity on hovercrafts, although it poured with rain trip was still well worth it,",
          "My hubby and I visited the yellow river and did all the tourist offerings available. Our cab driver who drove us from the hotel to the Yellow river scenic sight shared with us that we should take the tram (added cost) as the place was just really huge. The tram would take us",
          "Again, like the Scenic spots, Huang-he is a must see spot if you are in Zhengzhou. I thought I only go down and touch it with my bare hands. But no, there is a full hour cruise for 80 RMB and you go by with a hovercraft! It was a great fun, I never sit inside only read about",
          "We took the boat ride on the Yellow River and walked around the land in the middle of it. Such an interesting experience.",
          "Although the Yellow River is the 6th longest in the world, there is nothing to suggest its claim to fame when visiting the designated look-out. Like most of China's tourists spots, there is something not quite right about it. There is a board walk over muddy reeds but the area",
          "Took a taxi to get there. It is a waste of time and money. There is nothing special of the scenic area. It\u2019s not even yellow but brown because of the mud. At least, I can now say I saw the famous yellow river...",
          "I saw it a couple of times when in and around Zhengzhou and it is wide and it's muddy however while you are out and about in Zhengzhou you may as wrell see the river that is part of China's mythology.",
          "Was talked into shelling out for a hovercraft trip on the yellow river by the tour guide. This cost 90 yuan pp.. don\u2019t waste your money. Trip lasts about 25 mins including a 10 min stop on a muddy island where locals wait with quad bikes and ponies to rip you off again for a",
          "Ticked another item off my bucket list! Heard about the Yellow River but never visited before, also my first ride in a hovercraft, which was a plus! Also a chance to ride a horse on the banks of the river, or even try the quad bikes!",
          "I would avoid a stand alone visit. It is a pleasant choice but not with great views. The water is muddy and very turbulent.",
          "I can think of hundreds of rivers and waterfalls that are a lot more scenic, easier to get to and a lot less expensive.",
          "Lunch was over 400 yuan. Normally, I would pay 40-50 yuan for a similar type meal in Zhengzhou city. Basic meat, rice, and vegetables. I should have checked the menu prices. The vegetables were apparently the most expensive item, because it was special to the Yellow River. Yeah,",
          "It is about two hours each way from Zhengzhou, but the place is a must see. Totally worth the drive and the visit.",
          "We passed by the Yellow river on several occasions during our stay in China. On each occasions it just looked like a big strech of filthy and dirty water. Really not worth seeing.",
          "Invited with friends to drive there. An hour from town. The water was popular with many people. I 4WD Jeep invited us Laowai (foreigners) to join in the river crossing. A tight squeeze but fun. Lunch on a boat moored to the river's edge, caught a fresh fish from the river.",
          "Always wanted to see the river but its disappointing after taking the long ride there. There is nothing special to see, just a river as usual.",
          "While in Zhengzhou, it is worthwhile to visit the famous Yellow River, one of the most famous rivers in China. You ride a hovercraft to the centre of the river just to view the landscape. Not visually astounding, just a look to see what it is like Nearby is the Yang Huang",
          "We visited Yellow river in summer. Nice architecture, beautiful scenery, picturesque views. Strongly advise to go there.",
          "Nice view, was on a hovercraft ride on the yellow river. Very magnificent view, peaceful view. The ride even stopped half way for us to take a camel ride or motobike ride at 20 yuan",
          "I went to the yellow river scenic area and paid for the cable car to get a good view of the river. What I saw was not impressive. The air pollution made it difficult to see much of anything, but what was visible were power lines, pipes, and other construction zone images.",
          "Only worth a visit because this an important area for the start of the Chinese civilization. There was not much to see other than taking the hovercraft to reach the sand bar in the middle of the river. The interior of the hovercraft had seen its better days. Upon arrival, there",
          "Love the song Yellow River since my teenage days, at last on 15April 2016, I boarded a hovercraft to travel across the Yellow River of Zhengzhou. Wow, the hovercraft was fun and thrilling. It travelled both on land and water. We stopped at a sand bar where we could look at the",
          "Its a good time there. Good photo shoot angles plus the flowers in the spring are heart striking. A nice ride in hovercraft, cable car, speed boat is a good experience over there. This place is more good for kids because the installed many kids rides like bumper cars. There",
          "Unless you find used condoms sanitary napkins, beer bottles, and the filthiest bathrooms in China (and that is saying a lot) skip this one. It is basically a landfill with a shallow, doubtless polluted as hell, river flowing through it. Do not recommend.",

          "Though the bus ride was long. The group had fun as we were in 1 coach of 30pax. The 5 hours to Hukou waterfalls were worth it as this is totally a different waterfall. This one was next to the Dragon Cave that gave some adventure & got them wet! Also the sound of the yellow",
          "I came to this park based on earlier reviews and as I don't have enough time to travel to Yan'an, I decided to go to the nearest Yellow River viewing spot in Zhengzhou. I can't help to feel like I have walked into a theme park! Looking at the elaborate constructions of statues",
          "Before going to see the Yellow River, I spent 2 weeks in Zhenzghou. In the city, I didn't feel the atmosphere of China, but I felt it by The Yellow River. The Yellow River can offer a lot of green areas, peaceful time while looking at the river, temples, museum. Definitely worth",

          "Zhengzhou is not a place for tourism. However, the Yellow River Park is definitely a place to go. Besides, being a great workout walking around for many kilometres, there are surprises everywhere you go: fascinating sculptures, designs, walk-thru zoo, ups and downs, and of",
          "We had a day spare in our trip through China, and some of the images looked quite nice in brochures. However, we went during the off season, and the park was quite dirty. In many spots there was literally piles of rubble and garbage. What we didn't realise was people actually",

        "wiki": "Zhengzhou Xinzheng International Airport (IATA: CGO, ICAO: ZHCC) is the principal airport serving Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, China.\nThe airport is located in Xinzheng, 37 kilometres (23 mi) southeast of downtown Zhengzhou. It was opened on 28 August 1997, replacing its predecessor, the now-demolished Dongjiao Airport. The airport is the only international airport in Henan and serves as a main gateway for the province and the central plain area.\nThe airport is operated by Henan Airport Group and is a hub for Cargolux, as well as a focus city for China Southern Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, West Air, Lucky Air, and Donghai Airlines. According to statistics of 2018, it is the 12th-busiest airport by passenger traffic in the People's Republic of China with 27,334,730 passengers, and the 7th busiest airport in terms of cargo traffic nationwide. As of 2018, the airport is the busiest airport in central China in both passenger and cargo traffic.Its IATA code \"CGO\" is derived from Zhengzhou's former romanization Chengchow.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early development ===\nThe principal airport of Zhengzhou had been Dongjiao Airport (Chinese: \u90d1\u5dde\u4e1c\u90ca\u673a\u573a), which was located to the east of downtown Zhengzhou, since 1956. To meet the demand of city development, a plan to build a new airport in Xuedian Township, Xinzheng to replace the old Dongjiao Airport was approved in 1992. The new airport was originally named Zhengzhou Xuedian Airport (Chinese: \u90d1\u5dde\u859b\u5e97\u673a\u573a) after the township of its location and was later changed to the current name. Construction began in 1993 and the new airport was opened on 28 August 1997 with a terminal of 45,900 square meters and a runway (Runway 12R/30L) of 3,400 m. The designed capacity of the terminal was 3.8 million passengers a year. All the flights of Dongjiao Airport were transferred to the new airport. Dongjiao Airport was later demolished to build the Zhengdong New Area CBD on its site.In 2000, the airport was approved by the state council to become the 21st international airport in China.\nFrom 2005 to 2007, the original terminal underwent a major expansion and renovation. The new terminal (current Terminal 1) has an area of 128,000 square meters and was opened on 29 December 2007.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Phase II expansion ===\nIn 2013, the state council approved the expansion project of the airport, including a new terminal (Terminal 2), the second runway (Runway 12L/30R) and a ground traffic center (GTC), in alignment with its first airport-based economy zone (Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone). The construction started in 2012, and was finished in 2015. Terminal 2 was opened on 19 December 2015 together with the GTC, and the second runway was opened on 7 January 2016, making the airport the first with two terminals and two runways in central China.\n\n\n=== Recent development ===\nAfter Foxconn Zhengzhou (the main production base for iPhone, located just to the north of the airport) was put into operation in 2010, the cargo transport of the airport has been booming. Between 2010 and 2017, the cargo volume handled by the airport increased from 85,798.1 to 502,714.8 metric tonnes, growing by 34 percent yearly on average, making it the 7th busiest airport in China by cargo traffic.Long-haul and intercontinental passenger services from the airport also began to emerge in recent years. In late 2015 Emirates announced it would begin service from Dubai to Zhengzhou via Yinchuan from May 2016, as part of the airline's expansion plans in China. This is Zhengzhou's first connection to the Middle East. The service started from 3 May 2016 and stopped from November 2018. On 11 November 2016, Sichuan Airlines launched non-stop flights to Vancouver. It is the first regular non-stop intercontinental passenger service for the airport. Non-stop flight service to Melbourne was opened by Jetstar on 6 December 2017.  This is the first air route to Australia from the airport.\nThe airport rail link services between Zhengzhou city center and the airport became available after the completion of the ground traffic center in 2015, including the Zhengzhou\u2013Xinzheng Airport intercity railway, which started operations from 31 December 2015 and served as an express link, and Zhengzhou Metro Chengjiao line, which started operations from 12 January 2017.In 2017, the airport surpassed Wuhan Tianhe International Airport and Changsha Huanghua International Airport in terms of passenger traffic, making it the busiest airport in central China in both passenger and cargo traffic.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Terminal 1 (closed) ===\nThe current Terminal 1 was opened on 29 December 2007, after the expansion and renovation of the former terminal, which was opened in 1998. It covers an area of 128,000 square metres (1,380,000 sq ft) and has 14 gates with jet bridges. The roof of Terminal 1 is shaped like waves.\nAfter the opening of Terminal 2, it was closed as a future reserve and temporarily transformed into an exhibition hall.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Terminal 2 ===\nTerminal 2, the only terminal building in operation at present, is located to the northeast of Terminal 1. It was opened on 19 December 2015 with an area of 485,000 square metres (5,220,000 sq ft). Terminal 2 has an X-shaped layout with four piers seeing from above, which resembles and implies \"opened arms to embrace the world\". The northwest pier is for international flights and others are for domestic use.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Ground Traffic Center (GTC) ===\n\nThe ground traffic center was opened together with Terminal 2. It is to the west of Terminal 2 and is connected to the arrival hall of Terminal 2 by three corridors. The GTC has been designed to become a transportation hub for traffic between the airport and cities in central plains region, with an intercity train station and a metro station on the underground floors. Passengers can take taxis, intercity coaches, intercity trains and Zhengzhou Metro trains here.\n\n\n=== Air-traffic Control Tower ===\n\nThe new air-traffic control tower was put into use on 7 January 2016, together with the second runway. The control tower is 93.5 m (307 ft) in height and its shape resembles the Jiahu Gudi (bone flute) discovered in Henan.\n\n\n=== Runways ===\n\nThe airport has two parallel runways:\n\nThe south dock(3,400 m (11,200 ft) long and 45 m (148 ft) wide, opened in 1997)\n\nThe north runway (3,600 m (11,800 ft) long and 60 m (200 ft) wide, opened in 2016)The north runway has a Category II Precision Approach. Normally, the north runway (12L/30R) is used for landing while the south runway (12R/30L) is used for taking-off.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n=== Passenger ===\n\n\n=== Cargo ===\n\n\n== Ground transportation ==\n\n\n=== Highway ===\n\nS1 Zhengzhou Airport Expressway\nG4 Beijing\u2013Hong Kong\u2013Macau ExpresswayBoth expressways are connected to the airport via Yingbin Elevated Road.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nAirport rail link is served by Zhengzhou\u2013Xinzheng Airport intercity railway and Zhengzhou Metro Chengjiao line.\n\n\n==== Intercity Railway ====\n\nThe Xinzheng Airport railway station is located in the GTC. The waiting hall and ticket offices are on the B2 floor and platforms are on the B3 floor. Intercity trains to Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou East, Jiaozuo and Songchenglu (Kaifeng) are in operation.\n\n\n==== Metro ====\n\nTrains of the Chengjiao Line of the Zhengzhou Metro connects the airport to downtown Zhengzhou using through services via Line 2.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\n\n==== Shuttle bus ====\nThere are several airport shuttle bus routes to various destinations in Zhengzhou. The bus station is on the 1st floor of Terminal 2.\n\n\n==== Inter-city coach ====\nThe airport also offers inter-city coach services to and from other cities in the central plain region, including Luoyang, Kaifeng, Xuchang, Xinxiang, Nanyang, Anyang, Jiaozuo, Pingdingshan, Shangqiu, Zhoukou, Zhumadian, Heze, Changzhi, and Jincheng. Unlike the Zhengzhou routes, inter-city coaches depart from the GTC.\n\n\n==== City bus ====\nThere are several bus routes, operated by Zhengzhou Bus Communication Corporation, serving the airport and neighbouring areas in the Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone. \n\n611: towards Shizu Road bus terminal\n612: towards Yongzhou Road and Yuanling Road\n613: towards Hang'an 2 Street and Jichang 6 Road\n638: towards South gate of Zhengzhou Garden-Expo Park\nY636: night service, towards Lingkong Street and Taihu Road\n\n\n== Accidents and incidents ==\nOn 4 February 2014, Joy Air Flight 1533, a Xian MA60 carrying 7 crew members and 37 passengers from Taiyuan Wusu International Airport to Zhengzhou Xinzheng International Airport had a mechanical failure on the landing gear while landing at Zhengzhou. The nose gear collapsed and the aircraft's nose cone hit the runway. No passengers or crew suffered any injuries.\nOn 5 February 2014, heavy snowfall forced the airport to close for several hours in the afternoon and evening, leaving roughly 2,000 passengers stranded in the airport on one of the busiest travel days of the annual New Year. Many grew frustrated by the lack of information provided by airport or airline staff, and began damaging check-in desks and flight information displays, with some assaulting staff as well. The riot and further snow forced the airport to close again on the next day. Police eventually came to the scene and restored order (See Zhengzhou Airport riot).\nOn 15 April 2018, Air China Flight 1350, an Airbus A321 from Changsha Huanghua International Airport to Beijing Capital International Airport was diverted to make an emergency landing at Zhengzhou Xinzheng International Airport. It was reported that a flight attendant was held hostage by a male passenger with a pen. No one suffered any injuries in this incident.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of airports in China\nList of the busiest airports in China\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nAirport information for ZHCC at World Aero Data.

        "wiki": "Zhengzhou is the capital and largest city of Henan Province in the central part of the People's Republic of China. It is one of the National Central Cities in China, the centre of Central Plains area, and serves as the political, economic, technological, and educational center of the province. The Zhengzhou metropolitan area (including Zhengzhou and Kaifeng) is the core area of the Central Plains Economic Zone.The city lies on the southern bank of the Yellow River. Zhengzhou is a major hub of China's national transportation network, with railways connecting Zhengzhou to Europe and an international airport. Zhengzhou is a National Civilized City, State-list Famous Historical and Culture City, and the birthplace of the Yellow Emperor. As of 2020, there are two World Cultural Heritage Sites in Zhengzhou. The Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (ZCE) is China's first futures exchange, Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone is China's first Airport Economy Zone.Zhengzhou has a population of 10,120,000 inhabitants, and had a GDP of 1.014 billion (RMB) in 2018. The city is one of the main built-up areas of Henan region. Greater Zhengzhou was named as one of the 13 emerging mega-cities in China in a July 2012 report by the Economist Intelligence Unit, and officially named as the eighth National Central City in 2017 by the central government in Beijing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Shang dynasty established Aodu (\u969e\u90fd) or Bodu (\u4eb3\u90fd) in Zhengzhou. This prehistorical city had become abandoned as ruins long before the First Emperor of China in BC 260. Since 1950, archaeological finds in a walled city in Eastern Zhengzhou have provided evidence of Shang dynasty settlements in the area. Outside this city, remains of large public buildings and a complex of small settlements have been discovered. The site is generally identified with the Shang capital of Ao and is preserved in the Shang dynasty Ruins monument in Guanchen District. The Shang, who continually moved their capital due to frequent natural disasters, left Ao at around 13th century BC. The site, nevertheless, remained occupied; Zhou (post-1050 BC) tombs have also been discovered. Legend suggests that in the Western Zhou period (1111\u2013771 BC) the site became the fief of a family named Guan. From this derives the name borne by the county (xian) since the late 6th century BC\u2014Guancheng (City of the Guan). The city first became the seat of a prefectural administration in AD 587, when it was named Guanzhou. In 605 it was first called Zhengzhou\u2014a name by which it has been known virtually ever since.The name Zhengzhou came from the Sui dynasty (AD 582), even though it was located in Chenggao, another town. The government moved to the contemporary city during the Tang dynasty. It achieved its greatest importance under the Sui (AD 581\u2013618), Tang (618\u2013907), and early Song (960\u20131127) dynasties, when it was the terminus of the New Bian Canal, which joined the Yellow River to the northwest. There, at a place called Heyin, a vast granary complex was established to supply the capitals at Luoyang and Chang'an to the west and the frontier armies to the north. In the Song period, however, the transfer of the capital eastward to Kaifeng robbed Zhengzhou of much of its importance.In 1903 the Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway arrived at Zhengzhou, and in 1909 the first stage of the Longhai Railway gave it an east\u2013west link to Kaifeng and Luoyang; it later was extended eastward to the coast at Lianyungang, Jiangsu, and westward to Xi'an (Chang'an), Shaanxi, as well as to western Shaanxi. Zhengzhou thus became a major rail junction and a regional center for cotton, grain, peanuts, and other agricultural produce. Early in 1923 a workers' strike began in Zhengzhou and spread along the rail line before it was suppressed; a 14-story double tower in the center of the city commemorates the strike. On June 10, 1938, Chiang Kai-shek's National Revolutionary Army opened up the dikes retaining the Yellow River at Huayuankou between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, in an effort to stem the tide of invading Japanese; however, the ensuing 1938 Yellow River flood also killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese.Zhengzhou also has a locomotive and rolling-stock repair plant, a tractor-assembly plant, and a thermal generating station. The city's industrial growth has resulted in a large increase in the population, coming predominantly from industrial workers from the north. A water diversion project and pumping station, built in 1972, has provided irrigation for the surrounding countryside. The city has an agricultural university.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLocated just north of the province's centre and south of the Yellow River, Zhengzhou borders Luoyang to the west, Jiaozuo to the northwest, Xinxiang to the northeast, Kaifeng to the east, Xuchang to the southeast, and Pingdingshan to the southwest. With the land within its administrative borders generally sloping down from west to east, Zhengzhou is situated at the transitional zone between the North China Plain to the east and the Song Mountains and Xionger Mountains to the west, which are part of the greater Qinling range. The city centre is situated to the south of the middle reach of the Yellow River, where its valley broadens into the great plain. Zhengzhou is at the crossing point of the north\u2013south route skirting the Taihang Mountains and the mountains of western Henan. The prefecture spans 34\u00b0 16' ~ 34\u00b0 58 N latitude and 112\u00b0 42' ~ 114\u00b0 14' E longitude, covering a total area of 7,446.2 square kilometres (2,875.0 sq mi), including the metropolitan area, which covers 1,013.3 km2 (391.2 sq mi), and the city centre, which occupies 147.7 square kilometres (57.0 sq mi).\nThe section of the Yellow River flowing through the prefecture extends 150.4 km (93.5 mi). Mountains loom over the western counties of Gongyi and Dengfeng while the easternmost county of Zhongmu is a vast, fertile floodplain, with the counties in between being hilly transitions.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nZhengzhou experiences a monsoon-influenced, four-season humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cwa), with cool, dry winters and hot, humid summers. Spring and autumn are dry and somewhat abbreviated transition periods. The city has an annual mean temperature of 14.73 \u00b0C (58.5 \u00b0F), with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from 0.5 \u00b0C (32.9 \u00b0F) in January to 27.1 \u00b0C (80.8 \u00b0F) in July. The frost-free period lasts on average 220 days. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221217.9 \u00b0C (0 \u00b0F) on 2 January 1955, 27 December 1971 and 1 February 1990 to 43.0 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) on 19 July 1966.Rainfall is primarily produced by the monsoonal low during summer; in winter, when the vast Siberian High dominates due to radiative cooling from further north, the area receives little precipitation. During the summer season, the city is also often affected by tropical depressions, which bring additional amounts of rain. The annual precipitation is about 630 millimetres (25 in). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 45 percent in February and March to 54 percent in May, the city receives 2,182 hours of sunshine per year, which is just under half the possible total.\n\n\n== Administration and demography ==\n\nZhengzhou is divided into 6 urban districts, 5 county-level cities and 1 county. These subdivisions are likely to undergo significant changes in the near future due to increasingly rapid urban expansion and urban planning.\nThe municipality is home to 8,626,505 inhabitants (2010 census) and 6,35 million in its built up area made of 6 urban and suburban districts, Xingyang and Xinzheng cities and now Zhongmu county largely being urbanized, making the city one of the main built-up areas of the province.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nZhengzhou was the capital of China during the Shang dynasty. Parts of the Shang-era capital city wall that were built 3,600 years ago still remain in Downtown Zhengzhou (see Zhengzhou Shang City). Zhengzhou maintains abundant cultural heritages that reflect its glorious history as well as the culture of Henan Province. Zhengzhou Confucius Temple, initially built during the Eastern Han dynasty 1900 years ago, is one of the oldest Confucian Temples in China. Other important architectural heritage sites in the city center include Town God Temple and Erqi Memorial Tower.\nThe internationally known tourist attraction is the Shaolin Monastery, which is in Dengfeng, about 90 kilometres (56 miles) southwest of downtown Zhengzhou (1.5 hours by coach). The Shaolin Monastery is not only known as one of China's most important Buddhist shrines, but also as the ancient center of Chinese Kung-fu. Shaolin Monastery and its famed Pagoda Forest were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010.The Henan Museum is one of China's most important museums. It has a collection of more than 130,000 pieces of cultural relics includes exhibitions from prehistoric times, including dinosaur fossils and prehistoric human remains, up through the modern eras.\nZhengzhou's most developed and modern area is the Zhengdong New Area, which is in the eastern part of the city.

        "wiki": "The Shanghai Metro (Chinese: \u4e0a\u6d77\u5730\u94c1) is a rapid transit system in Shanghai, operating urban and suburban transit services to 14 of its 16 municipal districts and to Huaqiao Town, Kunshan, Jiangsu Province. Opening in 1993 with full-scale construction extending back to 1986, the Shanghai Metro is the third-oldest rapid transit system in mainland China, after the Beijing Subway and the Tianjin Metro. It has seen substantial growth, significantly during the years leading up to the Expo 2010, and is still expanding quickly, with its most recent expansions having opened in December 2018. It is the biggest component of the Shanghai metropolitan rail transit network, together with the Shanghai maglev train, the Zhangjiang Tram, the Songjiang Tram and the China Railway-operated commuter rail services to Jinshan. The metro system is also integrated with other forms of public transport in Shanghai.\nThe Shanghai Metro system is the world's second biggest metro system by route length after the Beijing Subway, totaling 676 kilometres (420 mi). It is also the second biggest by the number of stations with 413 stations on 16 lines. It ranks second in the world by annual ridership with 3.71 billion rides delivered in 2018. The daily ridership record was set at 13.29 million on March 8, 2019. Over 10 million people use the system on an average workday.On 16 October 2013, with the extension of Line 11 into Kunshan in Jiangsu province, Shanghai Metro became the first rapid transit system in China to provide cross-provincial service and the second intercity metro after the Guangfo Metro. Further plans to connect the Shanghai Metro with the metro system of Suzhou are under active review, with the first line connecting Shanghai Metro Line 11 and Suzhou Metro Line 3 under construction and projected to be completed by 2024. Ambitious expansion plans call for 25 lines with over 1,000 km (620 mi) of length by 2025. By then, every location in the central area of Shanghai will be within 600 m (2,000 ft) of a subway station.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMay 28, 1993 \u2013 Southern section of Line 1 (Shanghai South Railway Station \u2013 Xujiahui) enters operation (4.4 km or 2.7 mi).\nApril 10, 1995 \u2013 Line 1 (Jinjiang Park \u2013 Shanghai Railway Station; including initial section, which opened 1993) enters operation  (16.1 km or 10.0 mi).\nDecember 28, 1996 \u2013 Southern extension to Line 1 (Xinzhuang \u2013 Jinjiang Park) enters operation (4.5 km or 2.8 mi).\nSeptember 20, 1999 \u2013 Line 2 (Zhongshan Park \u2013 Longyang Road) enters operation (16.3 km or 10.1 mi).\nDecember 27, 2000 \u2013 The eastern extension to Line 2 (Longyang Road \u2013 Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park) (2.8 km or 1.7 mi) and Line 3 (Shanghai South Railway Station \u2013 Jiangwan Town) (24.6 km or 15.3 mi) open.\nNovember 25, 2003 \u2013 Line 5 (Xinzhuang \u2013 Minhang Development Zone) enters operation (17.2 km or 10.7 mi).\nDecember 28, 2004 \u2013 Northern extension to Line 1 (Shanghai Railway Station \u2013 Gongfu Xincun) enters operation (12.4 km or 7.7 mi).\nDecember 31, 2005 \u2013 Line 4 enters operation, except the section between Lancun Road and Damuqiao Road that was delayed due to a construction accident.\nDecember 18, 2006 \u2013 Northern extension to Line 3 (Jiangwan Town \u2013 North Jiangyang Road) enters operation (15.7 km or 9.8 mi).\nDecember 30, 2006 \u2013 Western extension to Line 2 (Songhong Road \u2013 Zhongshan Park) enters operation (6.15 km or 3.82 mi).\nDecember 29, 2007 \u2013 Five lines or sections enter operation on the same day:Second northern extension to Line 1 (Gongfu Xincun \u2013 Fujin Road) (3.4 km or 2.1 mi)\nDelayed section of Line 4 (Lancun Road \u2013 Damuqiao Road), completing the loop.\nLine 6 (Gangcheng Road \u2013 South Lingyan Road) (31.1 km or 19.3 mi)\nLine 8 (Shiguang Road \u2013 Yaohua Road)\nLine 9 (Songjiang Xincheng \u2013 Guilin Road)\nDecember 28, 2008 \u2013 Line 9 is extended from Guilin Road to Yishan Road, connecting with the rest of the metro network.\nJuly 5, 2009 \u2013 Southern extension to Line 8 (Yaohua Road \u2013 Shendu Highway) enters operation (14.4 km or 8.9 mi).\nDecember 5, 2009 \u2013 Line 7 (Shanghai University \u2013 Huamu Road) enters operation (34.4 km or 21.4 mi).\nDecember 31, 2009 \u2013 The downtown section of Line 9 (Yishan Road \u2013 Century Avenue) and the first section of Line 11 (Jiangsu Road \u2013 North Jiading) open.\nFebruary 24, 2010 \u2013 Short section of eastern extension of Line 2 (Longyang Road \u2013 Guanglan Road) enters operation.

The only exception is the segment shared by Lines 3 and 4, between Hongqiao Road station and Baoshan Road station, where both services use the same tracks and platforms.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Services ==\n\n\n=== Partial service patterns ===\nPartial service patterns exist on Lines 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12 and 17. Partial services serve only a (usually busier) sub-segment of the entire physical line. In addition, Line 2 had a piecewise service pattern during morning peak hours whereby the suburban segment between Guanglan Road station and Pudong International Airport station is partially served by a 4-car fleet in addition to the regular 8-car fleet serving the whole line before April 19, 2019.\nSince 28 December 2018, during off-peak times, an 8-car fleet from East Xujing or Songhong Road station may terminate at Pudong International Airport station, but most trains still terminate at Guanglan Road station or Tangzhen (only during peak hours). 8-car train started serving the whole line in a regular schedule from April 19, 2019.Partial services make it easier to find seats on the metro in rush hours. As an example, every second east-bound train on line 12 passing Caobao Road station is much more empty because it departed from Hongmei Road station.\nLine 12 has a partial service between Hongmei Road and Jufeng Road.\nLine 11, one of the three branch lines of the metro system, operates a different partial service pattern. Trains travelling to and from the branch line terminate at Huaqiao Station and Sanlin respectively. Hence, a passenger who wants to travel from the terminus of the branch to the eastern terminus of the line, at Disney Resort must change trains.Line 17, which opened in December 2017, operates a partial service pattern from Hongqiao Railway Station to Dianshanhu Avenue during rush hours in addition to the full service to Oriental Land.\n\n\n==== Line 16 ====\nLine 16, unlike the rest of the system, is built with passing loops and operates a rush-hour express service. The service was postponed on January 30, 2014, due to lack of available trains, but resumed on March 21, 2016.\n\n\n=== Announcements ===\nAll trains in the Shanghai Metro display destinations in Simplified Chinese and English, and make announcements in Standard Mandarin, English, and (on line 16 only) Shanghainese in order to indicate next stations, directions, and partial/full-length service patterns.\n\n\n=== Operating hours ===\nThe operating hours for most Shanghai metro stations starts between 5:00 to 6:00 in the morning and ends between 22:30 to 23:00 CST. In February 2017 (Shanghai Metro) announced that by April 1, 2017, the operating hours of Line 1, 2, and 7 to 10 will be extended by an hour after the regular last train on each Friday, Saturday and last working days before Chinese Public Holidays. This will be extended to Lines 3, 4, 6, and 11 to 13 by July 1, 2017. By the end of 2018, all the stations in the city center will extend their operating hours after midnight. Also, there will be two trains taking passengers from Hongqiao Railway Station after normal operation time and only stop at several stations, which always happens on the last day of a vacation, e.g. Labor Day, National Day, etc.\n\n\n== Stations ==\n\n\n=== Transfer stations ===\nThere are two types of transfer stations: physical transfer stations and transit-card only ones. In a physical transfer station, passengers can transfer between subway lines without exiting a fare zone. In a transit-card only transfer station, however, passengers have to exit and re-enter fare zones as they transfer from one subway line to another. In order to receive a discounted fare, passengers must use a Shanghai public transport card (SPTC) instead of Single-Ride tickets.\n\nBaoshan Road, Shanghai Railway Station, Zhongtan Road, Zhenping Road, Caoyang Road, Jinshajiang Road, Zhongshan Park, West Yan'an Road and Hongqiao Road are interchanges between Lines 3 and 4. This is where the two lines share tracks between Baoshan Road and Hongqiao Road.\nLines 4 and 6 stop at two different stations both known as Pudian Road, but these two stations are not located together and interchanging is not possible.\nLongyang Road and Pudong International Airport stations also provide transfers to the Shanghai maglev train, though passengers have to make another payment if they board the Maglev train.\n\n\n==== Transit-card only transfer stations ====\nA transit-card only transfer station is a station where two lines meet, but unlike a physical interchange, there is no direct pathway between them within the paid fare area. Passengers wishing to interchange must exit the paid fare area for the first line, walk a short distance on the street, and re-enter the paid fare area for the second line. Since June 1, 2008, passengers interchanging using a Shanghai public transport card have their trip regarded as one journey and the distance will be accumulated for fare calculation. Passengers must exit a station and re-enter another within 30 minutes using the same Shanghai public transport card. Those using single-ride tickets cannot use virtual transfers and must purchase a new ticket.\nIn some cases, virtual interchanges in place during a period of construction were superseded by physical interchanges at the completion of the construction. For example, Hongkou Football Stadium station was previously a virtual interchange between Line 3 and Line 8. Another previously virtual interchange was South Shaanxi Road station between Line 1 and Line 10; after the opening of an extension of line 12 to the station in December 2015 transfers among all three lines became a physical interchange.\nThe current virtual interchanges are:\n\nChangqing Road is a virtual interchange station between Line 7 and Line 13.\nHongqiao Airport Terminal 2 is a virtual interchange station between Line 2 and Line 10. However, Line 2 trains bound for Pudong International Airport and Line 10 trains bound for Xinjiangwancheng share an island platform. The middle island platform of the station opened in January 2018, so that passengers may transfer from downtown Line 2 and Line 10 trains by walking through the middle island platform.\nShanghai Railway Station is a virtual interchange station between Line 1 and Line 3 / Line 4, but Line 3 and Line 4 share the same platforms and the transfer between Lines 3 and 4 can be made by simply waiting for the next train to arrive at the platform.\nWest Nanjing Road is a virtual interchange station among Line 2, Line 12 and Line 13.\n\n\n=== Transport hubs ===\nThe busiest station in Shanghai Metro system is People's Square (Lines 1, 2 and 8). As the interchange station for three lines, it is extremely crowded during peak hours. It remains busy during the rest of the day as it is located near major shopping and tourist destinations such as East Nanjing Road, a pedestrian street, as well as the Shanghai Museum, People's Park, the Shanghai Grand Theatre and Yan'an Park on People's Square. It has the second largest number of exits (totalling 17) in the stations of the metro system.\nXujiahui (Lines 1, 9 and 11) is located in the major Xujiahui commercial center of Shanghai. Six large shopping malls and eight large office towers are each within a three-minute walk of one of the station's exits, numbering a total of 18 since the addition of the four in the Line 9 part of the station that opened in December 2009. This is the largest number of exits of all the stations on the system. This station is also widely used as a pedestrian tunnel across the wide roads.\nLujiazui (Line 2) is the major station in Pudong area. It is situated in the heart of Lujiazui financial district, the financial center of Shanghai. The city's iconic landmarks, the Oriental Pearl TV Tower, Jin Mao Tower, Shanghai Tower and Shanghai World Financial Centre are all within walking distance of the station. In contrast to Xujiahui and People's Square, Lujiazui is not particularly busy during off-peak hours or on weekends as it is located in financial district of Shanghai. Line 14, expected to open in 2020, will pass Lujiazui and provide transfer as well.\nShanghai Railway Station (Lines 1, 3 and 4) is a major transportation hub in Shanghai, containing the railway station, two subway lines and the stop for many city bus lines as well as interprovincial buses. These bus lines will soon be housed in a brand-new bus station. The line 1 platform is in the South square while platforms for line 3/4 are in the North square. These two platforms are technically separate stations, so interchange is only possible between lines 3/4. A transfer to the line 1 platform requires a SPTC or a new ticket.\nShanghai South Railway Station (Lines 1 and 3) is a transport station for line 1 and line 3; and the maintenance base of line 1 is also located at Shanghai South Railway Station.\nZhongshan Park (Lines 2, 3 and 4) is a heavily trafficked station due to the large shopping malls and hotel immediately above it.\nCentury Avenue (Lines 2, 4, 6 and 9) is the largest interchange station in the Shanghai Metro system, and the first station in mainland China to offer an interchange between four metro or subway lines.Pudong International Airport (Line 2) is the eastern terminus of Line 2. It serves the airport of the same name in Shanghai. The station also provides a transfer with the Shanghai maglev train to Longyang Road.\nHongqiao Railway Station (Lines 2, 10 and 17), Hongqiao Airport Terminal 1 (Line 10) and Hongqiao Airport Terminal 2 (Lines 2 and 10) are metro stations located in the Hongqiao transportation hub, composed of the Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport and Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station. Both Hongqiao Airport stations are directly linked with the airport, offering many domestic and limited international flights, and the Hongqiao Railway metro station is directly linked with the train station. The airport and railway stations themselves offer a zero-distance transfer.\n\n\n== Ticket system ==\n\nLike many other metro systems in the world (Shanghai Metro) uses a distance-based fare system. The system uses a \"one-ticket network\", which means that interchanging is possible between all interchange stations, given that the transfer staying within the Shanghai Metro system, without the purchase of another ticket where available, excluding some stations where transferring to another line at said station requires leaving the Fare Zone (i.e. the area extending from the platform to the entry/exit gates) which mandates a Single-Journey Ticket be used before entering that of another line, requiring the purchase of another Single-Journey Ticket (Shanghai Public Transport Cards are exempt as they are not consumed upon exit). The Shanghai Public Transport Card, which allows access to most public transport in Shanghai under one card, is another form of payment.\n\n\n=== Fares ===\nFor most lines, the base fare is 3 yuan for journeys under 6 km, then 1 yuan for each additional 10 km. As of December 2017, the highest fare is 15 yuan (from Oriental Land to Dishui Lake).\n\n\n==== Normal Discounts ====\nFor journeys exclusively on the 1st Phase of Line 5 (Xinzhuang \u2013 Minhang Development Zone), the fare is 2 yuan for journeys under 6 km and all other journeys are 3 yuan (though the total length of this section is a bit longer than 16 km). Will not be applied once passengers interchange to other lines, e.g. Fare for passengers from Xinzhuang to Chunshen Road is 2 Yuan, while fare for passengers from Waihuanlu to Chunshen Road is 3 Yuan.\nFor journeys exclusively from Xinzhuang Station to People's Square Station, the fare is 4 yuan, though the distance between People's Square Station and Xinzhuang Station is about 17.8 km (11.1 mi).\n\n\n==== Discounts for SPTC holders ====\nUsers of the Shanghai public transport card get a 10% discount for the rest of the calendar month after paying 70 yuan in taking metro, e.g. a passenger has paid 67 Yuan on metro tickets through SPTC this calendar month, and next time he will only pay 2.7 yuan for his next 3-yuan ticket in this calendar month. The discount is applied only for journeys after the payment; it is not retroactively applied to previous journeys.\nUsers of the Shanghai public transport card as part of the \"Air-conditioned Bus Transfer Discount\" get a 1 yuan discount when transferring to the metro within 90 minutes. (The 10% monthly discount may be applied after the transfer discount) This discount also applies for a bus to Metro and bus to bus transfers and can accumulate over multiple transfers. For example, to get from Zhenbei Rd/Meichuan Rd to Xiuyan Rd/Hunan Rd would normally cost 8 yuan each way (947 buses to line 4 to 451 bus) but only costs 6 RMB with the card (947 buses discounted transfer to line 4, discounted transfer to 451 bus). Depending on the time spent at the destination the discount will be applied at the start of the return trip as well, making the cost of a round-trip 11 yuan instead of the 16 yuan that would normally be charged without the card.\n\n\n=== Single Journey ticket ===\nSingle-Journey tickets can be purchased from ticket vending machines, and at some stations, at a ticket window.  Single-ride tickets are embedded with RFID contactless chips. When entering the system riders tap the ticket against a scanner above the turnstile, and when they exit they insert the ticket into a slot where it is stored and recycled.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Shanghai Public Transportation Card ===\n\nIn addition to a Single-Ride ticket, the fare can be paid using a Shanghai public transport card, which is similar to the Octopus card of Hong Kong's MTR. This RFID-embedded card can be purchased at selected banks, convenience stores and metro stations with a 20-yuan deposit. This card can be loaded at ticket booths, Service Centers at the metro stations as well as many small convenience stores and banks throughout the city. The Shanghai Public Transportation Card can also be used to pay for other forms of transportation, such as taxi or bus.\n\n\n=== One-day pass ===\nA one-day pass was introduced for the Expo 2010 held in Shanghai. The fare for the calendar day was set at 18 yuan, for unlimited travel within the metro system. This is not available through vending machines, but has to be purchased at Service Centers at metro stations.\n\n\n=== Three-day pass ===\nA three-day pass is available for Shanghai Metro. The fare for three days was set at 45 yuan, for unlimited travel within the metro system. This pass is not available through vending machines, but has to be purchased at Service Centers at metro stations.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Gauge ===\nStandard gauge is used throughout the network, allowing new train equipment to be transported over the Chinese rail network which uses the same gauge.\n\n\n=== Stations ===\nAlmost all stations, except most of the elevated sections and sections of Line 2 from Songhong Road to Longyang Road, have platform screen doors with sliding acrylic glass at the platform edge. The train stops with its doors lined-up with the sliding doors on the platform edge and open when the train doors open, and are closed at other times. These screens are also being retrofitted on existing lines, starting with Line 1 whose core stations had doors by the end of 2006. On part of Line 2 and most of the elevated sections, the platform has sliding safety doors that reach only halfway up from the ground called Automatic platform gates.\n\n\n=== Rolling stock ===\nThere are currently over 5000 revenue railcars in the Shanghai metro system. The 5000th car was delivered on July 20, 2018. It is expected that the 7000th metro car will be received in 2020. Train sets used in the system include:\n\n134 Bombardier Movia 456 six car sets (09A01, 09A02, 07A01 and 12A01) \u2013 Lines 9, 7 and 12\n53 German Shanghai Metro Group (GSMG) six cars units (Coded as AC01 for Line 1, AC02 for Line 2 for those using Alternating Current since they were made or DC01 for those formerly using Direct Current (for Line 1) \u2013 Line 1 and 2 (all reformed to eight car units)\n53 Alstom Metropolis eight car sets (Coded as 01A05) \u2013 Line 1, (Coded as 02A02) \u2013 Line 2\n16 Alstom Metropolis four car sets (02A04) \u2013 Section of Line 2\n17 Alstom Metropolis four car sets (05C01) \u2013 Line 5\n21 Alstom Metropolis four car sets (06C01) \u2013 Line 6\n28 Alstom Metropolis six car sets (08C01) \u2013 Line 8\n29 CNR Changchun Railway Vehicles Co., Ltd. four car sets (AC14) \u2013 Line 6\n38 CNR Changchun Railway Vehicles Co., Ltd. seven car sets (AC15) \u2013 Line 8\n28 Alstom Metropolis six car sets (03A01) \u2013 Line 3\n94 Siemens & CSR Zhuzhou six car sets (AC05, AC16) \u2013 Line 4 and 11\n41 Shanghai Electric-Alstom/Nanjing Puzhen Rolling Stock Co., Ltd. six car sets \u2013 Line 10\n33 Nanjing Puzhen Rolling Stock Works six car sets \u2013 Line 13\n46 Siemens & CSR Zhuzhou three car sets \u2013 Two sets are coupled to form a six car train \u2013 Line 16\n26 CNR Changchun Railway Vehicles Co., Ltd. six car sets (03A02 and 04A02) \u2013 Lines 3 and 4\nCNR Changchun Railway Vehicles Co., Ltd. six car sets (09A03) \u2013 Line 9\n16 CNR Changchun Railway Vehicles Co., Ltd. six car sets (11A02, 11A03) \u2013 Line 11\nAPM 300 four car sets \u2013 Pujiang lineTrain sets to be used in the future include:\n\n49 CRRC Nanjing Puzhen Ltd. eight car sets \u2013 Line 14Most lines currently use 6 car sets, with the exceptions being:\n\nThe Minhang Developing Zone branch of Line 5 and Line 6.\nSome trains on Line 8 use 7 car sets.\nLine 1 and Line 2 use 8 car sets.\nMost trains on Line 16 use 3 car sets. However, this is set to change with new 6-car sets being phased into service from March 2020 along with the existing 3-car sets being coupled into 6-car sets.\n\n\n=== Signalling ===\nShanghai Metro lines 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 are equipped with CBTC systems capable of headways as low as 90 seconds.\n\n\n=== Power supply ===\nIn contrast to many other metro systems in the world, the Shanghai Metro uses overhead wires for the power supply, except for Line 16, Line 17 and Pujiang Line which use third rail.\nOn Line 2, Siemens Transportation Systems equipped the line with an overhead contact line (cantilever material: galvanized steel) and 7 DC traction power supply substations.\n\n\n=== Passenger information systems ===\nPlasma screens on the platforms show passengers when the next two trains are coming, along with advertisements and public service announcements. The subway cars contain LCD screens showing advertisements and on some lines, the next stop, while above-ground trains have LED screens showing the next stop. The LED screens are being phased in on Line 1 and are also included in lines 7 and 9, two underground lines. There are recorded messages stating the next stop in Mandarin, English, and (on line 16 only) Shanghainese, but the messages stating nearby attractions or shops for a given station (a form of paid advertising) are in Mandarin only. The metro operating company is resistant to expanding use of Shanghainese for announcing stops, on the basis that, on most lines, the majority of passengers can understand either Mandarin or English.Station signs are in Chinese and English. The Metro authority is testing a new systematic numbering system for stations on Line 10.\n\n\n== Future expansion ==\nThe Shanghai Metro system is one of the fastest-growing metro systems in the world. As of 2019, Shanghai has more than 120 km (75 mi) of metro under construction. By the end of 2020, the network will comprise 19 lines (Lines 1\u201318 and Pujiang Line) spanning 804 kilometres (500 mi). In addition, there are plans to connect the Shanghai Metro with the Suzhou Rail Transit in neighbouring Jiangsu province.\n\n\n== Incidents ==\nDecember 22, 2009\u2014at about 5:50 am, an electrical fault in the tunnel between South Shaanxi Road station and People's Square station caused a few trains to stall. While the track was under repair, a low-speed collision occurred between two trains on Line 1, trapping scores of passengers underground for up to two hours and affecting millions of early commuters. Nobody was injured, but the front of the train was badly damaged. Service resumed at around 12:15 pm.\nJuly 5, 2010\u2014at the Zhongshan Park station a woman died after trying to crowd into a subway train as the doors were closing.  With her wrist trapped in the train doors, she was dragged between the train and the platform screen doors when the train started moving.\nSeptember 27, 2011\u2014at 2:51 pm, two trains on Line 10 collided between Yuyuan Garden station and Laoximen station, injuring 284 \u2013 300 people.  Initial investigations found that train operators violated regulations while operating the trains manually after a loss of power on the line caused its signal system to fail. No deaths were reported.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nShanghai Metro Club\nShanghai Subway Information on UrbanRail\nShanghai Metro Map \u2013 real distances",

          "The park may not be the most beautiful, but it sure deserves a visit and if you're a morning runner this is a must. The most impressive way to enter the park is along the newely renovated Cascades Ladder leading down to the lake from the Rotonda. There's several pathways around",

          "This is a rather small lake in the centre of Chisinau. There is a beach for summer activities, but in November when I was there nobody was swimming or sunbathing naturally. Many people walk or jog around the lake and in the surrounding park. Nice place to spend 1 or 2 hours.",
          "A beautiful place. A lake just 10 minutes walk from the center. A large promenade around the lake, the silence of the forest around the lake where you have a walking path. You can also run around the lake. If you love silence and nature you will enjoy it.",
          "If you want to take a walk in the park, it is great! There are many squirrels that are very fun to watch but besides that, it's just a large lake with ducks in it. The most disappointing thing was that there were fishermen that were eating sunflower seeds and they were",

          "What I most remember about this park was the long staircase--I think there are about 200 steps or so. This park is not a tourist attraction but genuinely for locals. We came here because my son used to live in Chisinau for a few months. He remembered walking through this park",
          "We have lived near and visited this lake park over a 10 year period and have seen it go through decline and renewal. All of our children have been strolled there when infants and my wife has biked and run in this park for years. In recent years, the government has invested in",
          "We wandered out of our hotel and went of to the park that lies on the banks of this lake. The countryside, albeit steep was pleasant to walk in though, in late July 2015, it was very hot. We came down to this lake and folowwed in round. It does not compete with famous lakes, but",
          "20 minutes by walk from the centre of the town (up to small hill) you can surprisingly find this lake on the opposite foot of the hill. When you go through the main entrance, you descend almost 200 stairs to get it. And of courst you must climb them back. This lake serves as a",
          "Nice park for Chisinau, big lake. You can rent kayac - canoe. People bike and run around the lake. Half of the park is nice and renovated. There are people that also swim in it.",
          "Pretty much just for the locals. There are nicer parks throughout Chisinau. That said, if you want to see a fairly nice lake or go for a jog you probably wouldn't find a better place than here. I walked to the far end of the lake away from the city then climbed up through the",
          "This is a better park than many in Chisinau and is in a nice part of the city, and is plainly much loved by the locals. That said, it is a park with a lake. The end.",

          "Valea Morilor,or as some people may call it \"komsomol's lake\" is a very good place for people who enjoy walking.This place is very good when it's very hot outside,because when you're there you don't feel that it's very hot outside.4/5 because there are not too many places nearby",
          "While I did enjoy the time spent in this park, the state of the place is pitiful. Everything is degrading, the works done hadn't really improved anything. Hopefully the fountain staircase is in reconstruction, maybe it will change something.",

The total cost of the monument was 4.000.000 lei.\nA few days before the 1940 Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, the monument was relocated to Vaslui, and its pedestal was blown up. On August 25, 1942, the monument was returned to Chi\u0219in\u0103u and taken back to Romania in 1944. In 1945, the Soviet authorities ordered the restoration of the monument to Chi\u0219in\u0103u. \nOn 31 August 1989 the monument to Stephen the Great was returned to its original location, chosen by Alexandru Pl\u0103m\u0103deal\u0103 in the 1920s. The initial inscriptions were restored. Flower-laying ceremonies are regularly performed at the pedestal of this monument on each national holiday and on days of official top- and high-level visits.\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Stephen the Great Monument, Chi\u0219in\u0103u at Wikimedia Commons\nThe Monument to Stephen the Great\nThe Monuments of Kishinev",

From its construction to 2011 the monument sheltered at its second level a huge bell of nearly 6400 kg (400 Puduri).\nIt was smelted with the copper of the cannons captured by the Russian forces from the Ottoman Empire. The bell \"clopote\u2013velican\" was initially made for the cathedral's belfry but happened to be too big for it. Finally it was installed in this arch, which was designed in purpose.\nThe monument and the mechanism of its clock were fully restored in 1973.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCentrul istoric al Chi\u015fin\u01celui, La \u00eenceputul secolului al XXI-LEA, Chi\u0219in\u01ceu, Editura ARC, 2009\nIurie Colesnic; Petru Starostenco (1997).

          "A beautiful Arch with such rich history of the Moldovian and the gift it represents to the people, and a great location next to the Nativity Cathedral.",
          "This is a fairly small arch located right in the centre of Chisinau. It's a popular site for tourists and is probably one of the more significant places to visit whilst exploring the city. Not that much to see though so a quick visit should generally be sufficient.",

          "Built in the 1800's to mark victory over the Ottoman empire, the statue is actually much smaller than it first appears. Still, the most important thing is what it represents and its symbolism to the Moldavian people.",

          "It's not exactly Paris but it's a charming Triumphal Arch and as it's right in the centre of the main site-seeing area of Chisinau it's worth taking a look. It's right by the Cathedral so it can be seen with that. There's a little market by the Arch and the Cathedral that's",

          "There are a couple of distinctive landmarks in the center of the city and the Triumphal Arch is one. It really marks the dead center of town. It is lovely, having been renovated a few years back and is probably one of the only sites in Chisinau that you will visit regardless",
          "Quite small but nice and centrally located. It worth a picture while wondering around Chisinau center.",
          "It\u2019s not an extraordinary sight but if you are in the center of the city it\u2019s an easy sight. There are a lot of cables around it which makes taking a nice picture rather difficult.",

          "Situated in the center, it's one of Chi\u0219in\u0103u symbols. You can't miss it because you'll pass nearby if you want to discover the town.",
          "This rivals Arc de Triomphe in Paris and is a very very impressive sight on Stefan Cel Mare street in central Chisinau, in front of government buildings.",
          "We walked there from our hotel. I was really surprised to see how small it is compared to other Triumphal Archs I saw before. I wanted to see it for a long time, so the walk there was worth it for me. Not fancy, but definitely it's worth to say you've been there.",
          "I recommend a tour and of course visit the arch. Moldova is the less visited country in Europe. It absolutely deserves a visit.",
          "Drive by...it's nothing fancy. Similar to all the other arches scattered around the world. Don't make a special trip to see it.",
          "Located just infront of a government building and near the Nativity Church, it is one of the few attractions in the city of Chisinau. You wont miss this landmark as you drive along the famous Stefan Cel Mare Avenue.",
          "There are only a few good landmarks in the center of Chisinau and the Triumphal Arch is one. It sits on a broad boulevard in the primary square -- the Grand National Assembly Square -- used in Chisinau for protests, public gatherings, rock concerts and other celebrations. The",
          "This Triumph Arch is on the Main Street on the edge of the city park. The government building is across the road. The park is good for kids as there is a quiet good playground. There is also an excellent cafe near the arch. They sell very good raspberry lemonades and lots of",
          "It's a nice triumphal arch in the Roman tradition. But it is really scaled down from the famous ones (starting in Paris). I'm glad that they've kept he main square (where this is), uncluttered. There is a pleasing symmetry to the place.",
          "I would say this is a prime sight in Chisinau and it's not significant when it comes to Moldovan history as it was built to honour the Russians beating the Turks. However, there's always something special when it comes to arched and of course it's worth a look if you pass by.",
          "Fascinating story behind this beautiful arch. Easily reached from central town and worth the walk. Very close to cathedral.",
          "The Triumphal Arch is a historical monument to commemorate the victory of the Russian Empire over the Ottoman Empire. I recommend viewing when you come to Chisinau.",
          "Walking on Chisinau\u2019s downtown, you will pass there! It is beautiful! There is a Moldavian flag and it touchs you!",
          "This central Chisinau monument was something I passed by or under every day. For me one of the symbols of this lovely city",
          "It looks great from far away. Many people took picture there with the national flag. Also a good position to view the parliament building.",
          "This arch does not compare with Paris France, very impressive nonetheless and I absolutely love the patriotism Romanian has for their patriots. That was the over arching sentiment I had gotten in visiting the arch is that they love their country and honor their citizens.",
          "Average because this place is very dirty. Moldavian people do not care about cleaning the face of their city. Arch and cathedral looks good, but overall this park zone is not quiet and fast-food boutiques at all the corners of the park is a bad idea. Once can be visited, but not",
          "About to show a lack of culture here, but once you've seen one Triumphal Arch, you've seen them all.",
          "Nice to see the arch, with Moldova flag on, just by the park and there is also a nice old church nearby.",
          "The Triumphal Arch in Chisinau is very modest when compared to the ones in places like Rome. It was built by the Russians after winning the Turks in the first half of the 19th century.",
          "Built by the Russians during their first rule of this city after they broke it from Moldavia principality. Stands here to recognize a victory of theirs in one thr many wars they fought to get to Constantinople, reclaim the Byzantium heritage and own black sea straights. Stands",
          "Good photo oppornity next to other historically important sightseeing stops. Big national flag inside the arch the triomphe.",
          "A historical European building in front the Moldavian government. Perfect foto place Close to the par central park.",
          "Enough to see it from taxi window. Nothing special at all. A very small version of Paris Triumphal Arch.",
          "Beautiful monument in the city center near have two parks for enjoying in walk.Also have a big ortodox church is a beautiful church.I visited in a christmas time,and the lights perfect.",

          "Next to the parliament, on the edge of the central park. Can' miss it. But I thought it is larger. Anyway, one of those must see things.",
          "This Triumphal arch is very special. I haven\u2019t seen an arch with a clock before. Don\u2019t miss it. The clock is seen from the street. The Triumphal arch was built in 1840 by the architect I. Zauschevic and thanks to the governors of Bessarabia initiative to commemorate the victory",
          "It's a very small archway but still a historic monument. Perhaps I was expecting more and it is next to a major road so you cannot sit , there is no decent information plate on the walls so all in all it's a 2 minute visit.",
          "The memorial is city friendly, purposeful, functional and not over intrusive to the eye. I sat with an ice cream and agreed with its architect that death is something that not be glorified. The arch frames the church in the gardens. Great attraction.",
          "Nice Photo oppurtunity and good to have a look at the two parks for a stroll. Not too busy so should get a pic on your own",
          "Nice structure. Interesting view looking through it from the Church side toward the monument of Stephen the Great with flags.",

          "Walking in the city and found the arc. One of the better things to see here but you won't need to spend much time here!!",

          "Great to just walk around and check out. Also nearby many other local landmarks. There is a church right near by which puts on different events and celebrations.",
          "It is maybe the most known monument in Chisinau If you stop downtown it is impossible not to see it. there is also an interesting story about it",
          "It's landmark, so good photo spot & meeting place. Good ask for as drop off point for taxi's. also convenient bus stop",
          "We did visit it in the winter and it was nice, besides it is close the park you may enjoy a nice long walk if you wish so.",
          "I always taught that this arch only exist in Paris, France. Anyway, after travelling to several countries in Eastern Europe, this is the third arch that I've seen which is located within the Eastern Region of Europe. This arch is located acccross the main street from the",

          "While not as impressive as some \"triumphal arches\", this symbol of the city is worth a visit and provides the usual \"photo ops.\" Since it is not located in the center of a plaza or boulevard it is not visible from a distance. It is of some interest to note that it commemorates",
          "A very pretty area and the inside of the church was quite pretty.The arch was also a surprise as we were unaware until we actually saw it.",

          "This arch of triumph is very beautiful and small, it was called \"holy gate\" which symbolized the entrance to cathedral park",
          "this is a small one and it probably reflects that the country has little esteem for outside conflicts fighting and many jubliee around them.",

          "Similar to other reviews: there is not a lot to see or do in Chisinau so this place gets a 3-star. Anywhere else, it would probably get 1-star. Basically a quick stop to take a photo so you can prove you have been in Moldova. I walked through the park to a restaurant to enjoy",

          "Fine place for a walk while looking for some sights at Chisinau. The church nearby is really nice, so the visit is highly recommended. After a walk around you may enjoy a beer or glass of wine in one of a few bars in the park.",
          "Last time was April 2015 and each year before that for many years. It's interesting the change of seasons at the park along side it. The arch is alongside the main road through town. A popular meeting place near the cathedral, it's similar to many other arches such as in",
          "First off, Chisinau is not known internationally as a tourist destination. After visiting five times, I love the country, but it is, what it is. The Triumphal Arch is a great place for a picture and then see the cathedral. There is nothing special about the arch, and there",

Its canonical territory is the Republic of Moldova.\nThe Metropolis of Chi\u0219in\u0103u and All Moldova is the largest church in the country, and one of the two main Orthodox churches in Moldova (beside the Metropolis of Bessarabia, a self-governing metropolitanate of the Romanian Orthodox Church). In the 2004 census in Moldova 3,158,015 people or 95.5% of those declaring a religion claimed to be Eastern Orthodox Christians of all rites.\nThe head of the Moldovan Orthodox Church is Metropolitan Vladimir (Cantarean), who is a permanent member of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIt is believed that Orthodox Christianity was first brought to Romania and Moldova by the Apostle Andrew. Be that as it may, by the 14th century the Orthodox Church in the Principality of Moldavia\u2014today northeastern Romania, Moldova, and southwestern Ukraine\u2014was under the authority of the Metropolitan of Galicia. In 1391, the Patriarchate of Constantinople, which had jurisdiction over the region, elected a metropolitan for the Metropolis of Moldavia specifically. By the 15th century this metropolitan was elected by the autocephalous Church of Ohrid, but following the abolition of the latter it returned to the jurisdiction of the Church of Constantinople. During this time, in the 17th century, the Metropolis of Moldavia transitioned from using Church Slavonic to Romanian language.\nIn 1812, the eastern half of Moldavia (renamed as Bessarabia) was annexed by the Russian Empire, which placed the Orthodox churches in this territory under the jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church. In 1813, it was established the Eparchy of Kishinev (Chi\u0219in\u0103u) and Hotin, under Romanian Archbishop Gavril B\u0103nulescu-Bodoni. After 1821, the Russian state and church started a policy of centralization and Russification that included the imposition of Church Slavonic instead of Romanian as the liturgical language, and all archbishops as Russians. However, native priests continue to serve in the rural parishes (covering most of the Moldavian population); as most did not speak Russian, attempts to establish a Russian-only seminary failed, and the rural clergy became increasingly isolated from the church leadership. Consequently, after 1867, church authorities began using both Romanian and Russian in their publications, and in 1905 there was a short-lived initiative to make Romanian the language of education.In 1858, after southern Bessarabia was returned to Moldavia, which soon united with Wallachia to form Romania, the orthodox churches in Cahul, Bolgrad, and Ismail re-entered under the Romanian Church jurisdiction of the Metropolis of Moldavia, which established the Diocese of the Lower Danube, in 1864. In 1878, after Russia re-annexed southern Bessarabia, the Russian Church jurisdiction was reinstated.\nIn 1918, after the region came under Romanian rule, the Archdiocese of Kishinev came, against protests of the Russian Orthodox Church, under the subordination of the Romanian Orthodox Church. Unwilling to accept the changes that came, its bishop was replaced. In 1922, the Holy Synod of the Romanian Orthodox Church set up two more dioceses in Bessarabia\u2014the Diocese of Hotin, seated in B\u0103l\u021bi, and the Diocese of the Cetatea Alb\u0103, seated in Ismail\u2014and, in 1927, the Orthodox Church in Bessarabia was raised to the rank of the Metropolis of Bessarabia. The Romanian state and church started a counter-campaign of Romanianization in order to impose Romanian as the liturgical language, and the Revised Julian calendar usage.Following the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet Union annexed Bessarabia and proclaimed the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. The Metropolis of Bessarabia was forced to interrupt its activity. In the same period, the Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church established on the territory of the new soviet republic a new Diocese of Kishinev. In 1990, it was raised to the rank of the Archdiocese.A year after independence from the USSR as the Republic of Moldova in 1991, the Russian Orthodox Church granted autonomy to its jurisdiction in the new country and raised the rank of the Archdiocese to the Metropolis of Chi\u0219in\u0103u and All Moldova.\n\n\n== Structure and organization ==\nThe Moldovan Orthodox Church claims exclusive jurisdiction over the Orthodox Church in Moldova, although this is contested by the Romanian Orthodox Church and its Metropolis of Bessarabia. The Metropolis of Chi\u0219in\u0103u and All Moldova currently consists of five eparchies or dioceses:  Chi\u0219in\u0103u under Metropolitan Vladimir (Cantarean), vicar of Soroca, under Bishop Ioan (Mo\u0219negu\u021bu), B\u0103l\u021bi and F\u0103le\u0219ti under Bishop Marchel (Mih\u0103escu), Cahul and Comrat under Bishop Anatolie (Botnari), Edine\u021b and Briceni under Bishop Nicodim (Vulpe), Tiraspol and Dub\u0103sari under Archbishop Savva (Volkov), and Ungheni and Nisporeni under Bishop Petru (Mustea\u021b\u0103), As of 2010, the Metropolis of Chi\u0219in\u0103u and All Moldova had 1,231 parishes, 46 monasteries, 9 sketes, a theological academy, and two theological seminaries served by 7 hierarchs, 1,395 priests, and 107 deacons.\nSince the grant of autonomy to the Moldovan Orthodox Church by the Moscow Patriarchate, the Church has administered its local affairs through a local synod chaired by its primate, and the Church's eparchial or diocesan bishops.\n\n\n== The position of the Romanian Orthodox Church ==\nThe Romanian Orthodox Church consider that, during the time, the Russian Orthodox Church jurisdiction on the former territory of Bessarabia was an unfair and abusive act in terms of historical reality and canon law, and the jurisdiction right of the Russian Metropolis of Chi\u0219in\u0103u and All Moldova can be exercised only to the Russian ethnics of Moldova.In the lead-up to the independence of Moldova, the Romanian Orthodox Church reactivated the interwar Metropolis of Bessarabia, granted it autonomy, and gave it authority over the Republic of Moldova and areas in southwestern Ukraine with Romanian populations. The Metropolis was started in 1992 by the Moldovan Orthodox Bishop of B\u0103l\u021bi, Petru (P\u0103duraru). In 2006, the Supreme Court of Justice of Moldova recognised the Autonomous Metropolis of Bessarabia, as \"historical, canonical and spiritual successor of the Metropolis of Bessarabia which functioned until 1944 including\".The Metropolis of Bessarabia had 84 parishes in Moldova at the time of its organization, and is considered a schismatic organization by the Russian Orthodox Church. On the other hand, the Romanian Orthodox Church is in favour of a \"peaceful coexistence and brotherly cooperation between the two Orthodox Metropolises which operate under the jurisdiction of the two sister Orthodox Patriarchies\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of the Orthodox Church in Moldova\nMetropolis of Moldavia and Bukovina\nArchbishop of Chi\u015fin\u0103u\nReligion in Moldova\nMetropolis of Bessarabia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nVia\u0163a bisericeasc\u0103 din Basarabia sub st\u0103p\u00e2nirea ruseasc\u0103 (1812-1918) (in Romanian)",

Halippa Street (formerly Marshal Malinovsky Street). It is dedicated to soviet soldiers who died in the battles against the German-Romanian troops of the Second World War.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn Soviet times the complex was known as the Victory Memorial. The monument was made on May 9, 1975 in honour of the Soviet soldiers who died in the Great Patriotic War. The monument was restored on August 24, 2006, marking the 62nd anniversary of the Liberation of Moldova.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe central part of the memorial is a pyramid of five 25-meter tall stone rifles. A 5-pointed star with an eternal flame in the center of the monument. The monument is guarded by an honor guard from the Moldovan Army that changes guard hourly. Wreath-laying ceremonies are regularly held at the center of the memorial on national holidays. On August 1, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia issued a five-ruble coin from the series \u201cCities \u2014 capitals of states liberated by the Soviet troops from Nazi invaders\u201d, dedicated to Chisinau, the reverse of which depicts the memorial in honor of the Jassy\u2013Kishinev Offensive. The number of copies is two million.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Chi\u0219in\u0103u ( KISH-ih-NOW, also US:  KEE-shee-NOW, Romanian: [ki\u0283i\u02c8n\u0259w] (listen)), also known as Kishinev (Russian: \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0451\u0432, tr. Kishinj\u00f3v [k\u02b2\u026a\u0282\u0268\u02c8n\u02b2\u0275f]), is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Moldova. The city is Moldova's main industrial and commercial center, and is located in the middle of the country, on the river B\u00e2c, a tributary of the Dniester. According to the results of the 2014 census, the city proper had a population of 532,513, while the population of the Municipality of Chi\u0219in\u0103u (which includes the city itself and other nearby communities) was 700,000.\nChi\u0219in\u0103u is the most economically prosperous locality in Moldova and its largest transportation hub. Nearly a third of Moldova's population lives in the metro area.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the city's name is unclear. A theory suggests that the name may come from the archaic Romanian word chi\u0219la (meaning \"spring\", \"source of water\") and nou\u0103 (\"new\"), because it was built around a small spring, at the corner of Pu\u0219kin and Albi\u0219oara streets.The other version, formulated by \u0218tefan Ciobanu, Romanian historian and academician, holds that the name was formed the same way as the name of Chi\u0219ineu (alternative spelling: Chi\u0219in\u0103u) in Western Romania, near the border with Hungary. Its Hungarian name is Kisjen\u0151, from which the Romanian name originates. Kisjen\u0151 comes from kis \"small\" and the Jen\u0151, one of the seven Hungarian tribes that entered the Carpathian Basin in 896. At least 24 other settlements are named after the Jen\u0151 tribe.Chi\u0219in\u0103u is known in Russian as \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0451\u0432 (Kishinj\u00f3v), while Moldova's Russian-language media call it \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044d\u0443, [k\u02b2\u026a\u0282\u0268\u02c8n\u025b\u028a] (Kishineu). It is written Ki\u015fin\u00f6v in the Latin Gagauz alphabet. It was also written as Chi\u0219ineu in pre-20th-century Romanian and as \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044d\u0443 in the Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet. Historically, the English language name for the city, Kishinev, was based on the modified Russian one because it entered the English language via Russian at the time Chi\u0219in\u0103u was part of the Russian Empire (e.g. Kishinev pogrom). Therefore, it remains a common English name in some historical contexts. Otherwise, the Romanian-based Chi\u0219in\u0103u has been steadily gaining wider currency, especially in written language. The city is also historically referred to as German: Kischinau, Polish: Kiszyni\u00f3w, Ukrainian: \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0456\u0432, romanized: Kyshyniv, or Yiddish: \u05e7\u05e2\u05e9\u05e2\u05e0\u05e2\u05f0\u200e, romanized: Keshenev.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Moldavian period ===\nFounded in 1436 as a monastery village, the city was part of the Principality of Moldavia (which, starting with the 16th century became a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire, but still retaining its autonomy). At the beginning of the 19th century Chi\u0219in\u0103u was a small town of 7,000 inhabitants.\nIn 1812, in the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812), the eastern half of Moldavia was ceded to the Russian Empire. The newly acquired territories became known as Bessarabia.\n\n\n=== Russian Imperial period ===\n\nUnder Russian government, Chi\u0219in\u0103u became the capital of the newly annexed oblast (later guberniya) of Bessarabia. By 1834, an imperial townscape with broad and long roads had emerged as a result of a generous development plan, which divided Chi\u0219in\u0103u roughly into two areas: the old part of the town, with its irregular building structures, and a newer city centre and station. Between 26 May 1830 and 13 October 1836 the architect Avraam Melnikov established the Catedrala Na\u0219terea Domnului with a magnificent bell tower. In 1840 the building of the Triumphal arch, planned by the architect Luca Zaushkevich, was completed. Following this the construction of numerous buildings and landmarks began.\nOn 28 August 1871, Chi\u0219in\u0103u was linked by rail with Tiraspol, and in 1873 with Corne\u0219ti. Chi\u0219in\u0103u-Ungheni-Ia\u0219i railway was opened on 1 June 1875 in preparation for the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878). The town played an important part in the war between Russia and Ottoman Empire, as the main staging area of the Russian invasion. During the Belle \u00c9poque, the mayor of the city was Carol Schmidt, considered one of Chisinau's best mayors. Its population had grown to 92,000 by 1862, and to 125,787 by 1900.\n\n\n==== Pogroms and pre-revolution ====\n\nIn the late 19th century, especially due to growing anti-Semitic sentiment in the Russian Empire and better economic conditions in Moldova, many Jews chose to settle in Chi\u0219in\u0103u. By the year 1897, 46% of the population of Chi\u0219in\u0103u was Jewish, over 50,000 people.As part of the pogrom wave organized in the Russian Empire, a large anti-Semitic riot was organized in the town on  19\u201320 April 1903, which would later be known as the Kishinev pogrom. The rioting continued for three days, resulting in 47 Jews dead, 92 severely wounded, and 500 suffering minor injuries. In addition, several hundred houses and many businesses were plundered and destroyed. Some sources say 49 people were killed. The pogroms are largely believed to have been incited by anti-Jewish propaganda in the only official newspaper of the time, Bessarabetz (\u0411\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0446\u044a). Mayor Schmidt disapproved of the incident and resigned later in 1903. The reactions to this incident included a petition to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia on behalf of the American people by US President Theodore Roosevelt in July 1903.On 22 August 1905 another violent event occurred: The police opened fire on an estimated 3,000 demonstrating agricultural workers. Only a few months later, 19\u201320 October 1905, a further protest occurred, helping to force the hand of Nicholas II in bringing about the October Manifesto. However, these demonstrations suddenly turned into another anti-Jewish pogrom, resulting in 19 deaths.\n\n\n=== Romanian period ===\n\nFollowing the Russian October Revolution, Bessarabia declared independence from the crumbling empire, as the Moldavian Democratic Republic, before joining the Kingdom of Romania. As of 1919, Chi\u0219in\u0103u, with an estimated population of 133,000, became the second largest city in Romania.\nBetween 1918 and 1940, the center of the city undertook large renovation work. Romania granted important subsidies to its province and initiated large scale investment programs in the infrastructure of the main cities in Bessarabia, expanded the railroad infrastructure and started an extensive program to eradicate illiteracy.\nIn 1927, the Stephen the Great Monument, by the sculptor Alexandru Pl\u0103m\u0103deal\u0103, was erected. In 1933, the first higher education institution in Bessarabia was established, by transferring the Agricultural Sciences Section of the University of Ia\u0219i to Chi\u0219in\u0103u, as the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nOn 28 June 1940, as a direct result of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, Bessarabia was annexed by the Soviet Union from Romania, and Chi\u0219in\u0103u became the capital of the newly created Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic.\nFollowing the Soviet occupation, mass deportations, linked with atrocities, were executed by the NKVD between June 1940 and June 1941. In Chi\u0219in\u0103u, over 400 people were summarily executed in July 1940 and buried in the grounds of the Metropolitan Palace, the Chi\u0219in\u0103u Theological Institute, and the backyard of the Italian Consulate, where the NKVD had established its headquarters. As part of the policy of political repression of the potential opposition to the Communist power, tens of thousand members of native families were deported from Bessarabia to other regions of the USSR.\nOn 10 November 1940, a devastating earthquake occurred. The epicenter of the quake, which measured 7.4 (or 7.7, according to other sources) on the Richter scale, was in Vrancea Mountains and subsequently led to substantial destruction: 78 deaths and 2,795 affected buildings (of which 172 destroyed).In June 1941, in order to recover Bessarabia, Romania entered World War II under the command of the German Wehrmacht, declaring war to the Soviet Union. In the chaos of the Second World War, Chi\u0219in\u0103u was severely affected. In June\u2013July 1941 the city came under bombardment by Nazi air raids. However, the Romanian and newly Moldovan sources assign most of the responsibility for the damage to Soviet NKVD destruction battalions, that operated in Chi\u0219in\u0103u until 17 July 1941, when it was captured by Axis forces.Following the German and Romanian reoccupation, the city suffered from the Nazi extermination policy of its Jewish inhabitants, who were transported on trucks to the outskirts of the city and then summarily shot in partially dug pits. The number of Jews murdered during the initial occupation of the city is estimated at approximately 10,000 people.As the war drew to a conclusion, the city was once again the scene of heavy fighting as German and Romanian troops retreated. Chi\u0219in\u0103u was captured by the Red Army on 24 August 1944 as a result of the Jassy-Kishinev Operation.\n\n\n=== Soviet period ===\nAfter the war, Bessarabia was fully reintegrated into the Soviet Union, around 65 percent of its territory as the Moldavian SSR, while the remaining 35 percent were transferred to the Ukrainian SSR.\nTwo other waves of deportations of Moldova's native population were carried out by the Soviets, the first one immediately after the Soviet reoccupation of Bessarabia until the end of the 1940s, and the second one in the mid-1950s.In the years 1947 to 1949 the architect Alexey Shchusev developed a plan with the aid of a team of architects for the gradual reconstruction of the city.There was rapid population growth in the 1950s, to which the Soviet administration responded by constructing large-scale housing and palaces in the style of Stalinist architecture. This process continued under Nikita Khrushchev, who called for construction under the slogan \"good, cheaper and built faster\". The new architectural style brought about dramatic change and generated the style that dominates today, with large blocks of flats arranged in considerable settlements. These Khrushchev-era building are often informally called Khrushchyovka.\nThe period of the most significant redevelopment of the city extended from 1971, when the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union adopted a decision \"On the measures for further development of the city of Kishinev\", which secured more than one billion rubles in investment from the state budget, which continued until the independence of Moldova in 1991. The share of dwellings built during the Soviet period (1951\u20131990) represents 74.3 percent of total households.On 4 March 1977, the city was again jolted by a devastating earthquake. Several people were killed and panic broke out.\n\n\n=== After independence ===\nMany streets of Chi\u0219in\u0103u are named after historic persons, places or events. Independence from the Soviet Union was followed by a large-scale renaming of streets and localities from a Communist theme into a national one.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nChi\u0219in\u0103u is located on the river B\u00e2c, a tributary of the Dniester, at 47\u00b00\u2032N 28\u00b055\u2032E, with an area of 120 km2 (46 sq mi). The municipality comprises 635 km2 (245 sq mi).\nThe city lies in central Moldova and is surrounded by a relatively level landscape with very fertile ground.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nChi\u0219in\u0103u has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfa) characterised by warm summers and cool, windy winters. Winter minimum temperatures are often below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F), although they rarely drop below \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F). In summer, the average maximum temperature is approximately 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), however, temperatures occasionally reach 35 to 40 \u00b0C (95 to 104 \u00b0F) in mid-summer in downtown. Although average precipitation and humidity during summer is relatively low, there are infrequent yet heavy storms.\nSpring and autumn temperatures vary between 16 to 24 \u00b0C (61 to 75 \u00b0F), and precipitation during this time tends to be lower than in summer but with more frequent yet milder periods of rain.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Municipality ===\nMoldova is administratively subdivided into 3 municipalities, 32 districts, and 2 autonomous units. With a population of 662,836 inhabitants (as of 2014), the Municipality of Chi\u0219in\u0103u (which includes the nearby communities) is the largest of these municipalities.Besides the city itself, the municipality comprises 34 other suburban localities: 6 towns (containing further 2 villages within), and 12 communes (containing further 14 villages within).

Under the Moldovan constitution, Urechean \u2014 elected to parliament in 2005 \u2014 was unable to hold an additional post to that of an MP. The Democratic Moldova Bloc leader subsequently accepted his mandate and in April resigned from his former position. During his 11-year term, Urechean committed himself to the restoration of the church tower of the Catedrala Na\u0219terea Domnului and improvements in public transport.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\nThe municipality in its totality elects a mayor and a local council, which then name five pretors, one for each sector.

El\u0103t, an older mall in the Botanica district, and Sun City, in the center, are more popular with locals.\nSeveral amusement parks exist around the city. A Soviet era one is located in the Botanica district, along the three lakes of a major park, which reaches the outskirts of the city center. Another, the modern Aventura Park, is located farther from the center. A circus, which used to be in a grand building in the R\u00e2\u0219cani sector, has been inactive for several years due to a poorly funded renovation project.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the results of the last Moldovan census, conducted in May 2014, 532,513 inhabitants live within the Chi\u0219in\u0103u city limits.

          "It's a bit scary place where you have a strong abandoned feeling. The concrete architecture is crumbling, public toilets are opened, dark and dirty. I didnt find any special flowers, nothing I would not see in another regular parks of the city. Pure sadness.",

          "My hotel was closeby and I had an hour to spare so thought quickly to go have a look. Forget it! There was no single entrance to the park for kilometers along its borders! Unseen!",

          "If you bored- than you should go. I would not say that this is number #1 place to visit in Chisinau. Just a regular park with a small lake. If you want to relax, this is a place to be at. But nothing extraordinary. Thank you.",
          "Nice park zone if you looking for a quiet nature place in the town, has small lake and if I count right, length is about 3 kilometers. Best for solo walking, to work with the notebook in really quiet place or to have a good time with the family.",
          "We tried to walk to it and combine it with other sights. However, the access is not easily possible, we were routed to an entrance farthest from the city. Beyond that, alleys and trees, it seemed quiet.",

          "Nothing there. We walked in from the university side, the path and steps were badly paved and need some maintenance. The lake looked dirty and had rubbish floating in it. The chess pieces want repairing. Best parts were the new steps and waterways where we left the park.",

It was erected near the main entrance of the Stephen the Great Park in Central Chi\u0219in\u0103u. The monument was completed in 1927 and opened on 29 April 1928 (to replace the monument to Alexander II of Russia, destroyed by the Romanian authorities in 1918). The total cost of the monument was 4.000.000 lei.\nA few days before the 1940 Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, the monument was relocated to Vaslui, and its pedestal was blown up. On August 25, 1942, the monument was returned to Chi\u0219in\u0103u and taken back to Romania in 1944. In 1945, the Soviet authorities ordered the restoration of the monument to Chi\u0219in\u0103u. \nOn 31 August 1989 the monument to Stephen the Great was returned to its original location, chosen by Alexandru Pl\u0103m\u0103deal\u0103 in the 1920s. The initial inscriptions were restored. Flower-laying ceremonies are regularly performed at the pedestal of this monument on each national holiday and on days of official top- and high-level visits.\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Stephen the Great Monument, Chi\u0219in\u0103u at Wikimedia Commons\nThe Monument to Stephen the Great\nThe Monuments of Kishinev",

        "wiki": "The National Museum of History of Moldova (Romanian: Muzeul Na\u021bional de Istorie a Moldovei) is a museum in Central Chi\u015fin\u0103u, Moldova.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nOver 263,000 exhibits, 165,000 of which belong to the national heritage, are exhibited in the National Museum of History, founded in 1983 on the former Regional Lyceum. It is situated on 121a, 31 August 1989 str., in the historical center of Chi\u015fin\u0103u. In the museum yard there is the Capitoline Wolf, the copy of the one in Rome. Every year almost 15 exhibitions are held in the museum; which are important events in Moldova. The museum is structured into many scientific sections: Ancient History and Archaeology, Medieval History, History of Basarabia, Contemporary History, Treasures.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe National Museum of Archaeology and History of Moldova is one of the most important museum institutions of the Republic of Moldova, in terms of its collection and scientific prestige.\n\nThe museum was established on December 21, 1983, when there was issued the Order of the Ministry of Culture No. 561 \u201cOn reprofiling of the Museums\u201d (on the basis of the Joint Decree of the Central Committee of the CPM and the Council of Ministers of MSSR \u201cOn the utilization of the historical monument \u2013 the edifice of the former Chisinau Boys\u2019 Gymnasia where S. Lazo studied\u201d from 29 November 1983).\nThe State Museum of History of MSSR was created on the basis of the Republican Museum of Military Glory, into which it was incorporated, and the historical collection of the State Museum of History and Regional Studies of MSSR. It was housed in the restoring historical building of the former Chisinau Boys\u2019 Gymnasia No.1, where formerly the Republican Museum of Military Glory had been located.\nOn October 22, 1991, by the Order of the Ministry of Culture No. 231 \u201cOn perfection of the republican museums\u2019 activity\u201d, the State Museum of History of MSSR was renamed to the National Museum of History of Moldova.\nIn 2006 the National Museum of History of Moldova was reorganized into the National Museum of Archaeology and History of Moldova through absorption of the Museum of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova, according to the Decree of the Government of the Republic of Moldova No.1326 \u201cOn the measures of optimization of infrastructure in the field of science and innovation\u201d from 14 December 2005.\nAt present the National Museum of Archaeology and History of Moldova is subordinate to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Moldova, its scientific activity being coordinated by the Academy of Sciences of Moldova.\nThe museum collections, which initially consisted of the collections of the Republican Museum of Military Glory and the State Museum of History and Regional Studies of MSSR, every year were enriching with items of real scientific value through research, donations, and acquisitions. Besides, in 1989\u20131995 and 2006\u20132007, large transfers of collections from a number of broken up museums \u2013 the Republican Museum of Friendship Among the Peoples, the Museum of History of the CPM, the Republican Museum of History of the Komsomol, the Republican Museum of G.I. Kotovsky and S.G. Lazo, the Republican Museum of the History of Religion, the Memorial Museum of Bulgarian Volunteers, and the Museum of Archaeology of The Academy of Sciences of Moldova \u2013 also contributed to the growth and diversity of the museum property.\nToday, the National Museum of Archaeology and History of Moldova owns 322,172 items, the diversity of which covers the history of Moldova over the centuries, from prehistoric times to the present, telling about the land, facts, events, and outstanding people.\nIn 1991, the first permanent historical exhibition \u201cPages of Centuries-old History of Moldova\u201d, covering the period from the oldest times to 1940, was opened to the public. It was located in three rooms of the 1st floor, with an area of 645 sq. m., containing about 900 exhibit items. The exhibition illustrated the features of the area between the Prut and Dniester in the context of the history of medieval Moldavian state. As to the period after the dismemberment of Moldova in 1812, in the exhibition there was presented only the history of Bessarabia.\nIn 1997, the permanent historical exhibition was redesigned in content, placement, and by the method of presentation. It expanded to the entire first floor, occupying six rooms with an area of 1,400 sq. m. Chronological framework of the exhibition includes the period from the Paleolithic to the end of the fifth decade of the 20th century.\nIn 2006\u20132007, the museum was in a new process of rebuilding of the permanent exhibition, intending to make radical changes in terms of vision and the content of exhibits, representing the section of prehistory and ancient history. Underlying these changes are the collections transferred from the former Museum of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova.  Of course, the current formula of the permanent exhibition is an intermediate. Now there is conceptually and thematically developing a new vision of the exhibition of the National Museum of Archaeology and History of Moldova.\nIn August 1990, in the ground floor of the museum there was open to the public the Diorama of the Iasi \u2013 Chisinau Operation, and in 1994, in the basement \u2013 the exhibition of items made of precious metals \u201cTreasure-house\u201d.\nThe museum also offers the public diverse temporary exhibitions, which complement the permanent exhibition and contribute to the promotion of the museum cultural and historical property.  During the 27 years of its existence, the museum has organized about 189 temporary exhibitions (at the museum, outside the museum, and abroad), based on its own collections as well as in collaboration with other cultural and research institutions.\n\n\n== The edifice ==\nThe National Museum of Archaeology and History of Moldova from the very beginning was located in the historical building of the former Chisinau Boys\u2019 Gymnasia No.1, later the Boy's Lyceum named after B.P. Hasdeu (in 1945\u20131963 in the premises there was housed the frontier detachment \u201cNistru\u201d, and in 1963\u20131977 \u2013 the Polytechnic Institute), that was in the process of restoration.\nThe earthquake of 1977 has played a tragic role in the history of this monument, causing serious damage that could lead to a total destruction of the building. Restoration work, started in 1979, was halted because, due to the severe destruction, the building was beyond repair.\nThe old building was demolished and replaced by a new one (the construction lasted from 1980 to 1987), which retained only the exterior of the historical monument, built in eclectic style, and decorative elements of the gymnasia assembly hall, repeated in three domical rooms of the new building.\nThus, the new museum edifice, in operation from 1987, is a modern two-storey monumental building facing the 31 August 1989 Street.  It has 12 exhibition rooms and a diorama, with a total area of 5,700 sq. m.\nThe museum has five branches: Exhibitions of Military Technology, The Sciusev House and Museum (both in Chi\u015fin\u0103u), The C. Stamati House and Museum (Ocni\u0163a), Lazo's Manson (in Piatra), Carol the XIIth's House and Museum in Varni\u0163a.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCapitoline Wolf, Chi\u015fin\u0103u\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "W always visit the Ethnographic museums when we travel, and this is one of the best. It is located in a beautifully restored building and the displays were really well done. If you see only one museum in Chisinau, I would recommend it be this one.",

          "Nice building (architect Bernardazzi, the same that build the most known buildings of Odessa). A collection of ethnographic objects that is presenting traditional Moldova. There is also a skeleton of bronto? dino? saurus and a place that you may like a lot - the vivarium. but",

His father, Sergey Lvovich Pushkin, belonged to Pushkin noble families. His maternal great-grandfather was Central-African-born general Abram Petrovich Gannibal. He published his first poem at the age of 15, and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum. Upon graduation from the Lycee, Pushkin recited his controversial poem \"Ode to Liberty\", one of several that led to his exile by Tsar Alexander I of Russia. While under the strict surveillance of the Tsar's political police and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, the drama Boris Godunov. His novel in verse, Eugene Onegin, was serialized between 1825 and 1832.\nPushkin was fatally wounded in a duel with his brother-in-law, Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anth\u00e8s, also known as Dantes-Gekkern, a French officer serving with the Chevalier Guard Regiment, who attempted to seduce the poet's wife, Natalia Pushkina.\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\nPushkin's father, Sergei Lvovich Pushkin (1767\u20131848), was descended from a distinguished family of the Russian nobility that traced its ancestry back to the 12th century. Pushkin's mother, Nadezhda (Nadya) Ossipovna Gannibal (1775\u20131836), was descended through her paternal grandmother from German and Scandinavian nobility. She was the daughter of Ossip Abramovich Gannibal (1744\u20131807) and his wife, Maria Alekseyevna Pushkina (1745\u20131818).\n\nOssip Abramovich Gannibal's father, Pushkin's great-grandfather, was Abram Petrovich Gannibal (1696\u20131781), an African page kidnapped to Constantinople as a gift to the Ottoman Sultan and later transferred to Russia as a gift for Peter the Great. Abram wrote in a letter to Empress Elizabeth, Peter the Great's daughter, that Gannibal was from the town of \"Lagon\". Largely on the basis of a mythical biography by Gannibal's son-in-law Rotkirkh, some historians concluded from this that Gannibal was born in a part of what was then the Abyssinian Empire, located today in Ethiopia. Vladimir Nabokov, when researching Eugene Onegin, cast serious doubt on this origin theory. Later research by the scholars Dieudonn\u00e9 Gnammankou and Hugh Barnes eventually conclusively established that Gannibal was instead born in Central Africa, in an area bordering Lake Chad in modern-day Cameroon. After education in France as a military engineer, Gannibal became governor of Reval and eventually G\u00e9n\u00e9ral en Chef (the third most senior army rank) in charge of the building of sea forts and canals in Russia.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in Moscow, Pushkin was entrusted to nursemaids and French tutors, and spoke mostly French until the age of ten. He became acquainted with the Russian language through communication with household serfs and his nanny, Arina Rodionovna, whom he loved dearly and was more attached to than to his own mother. He published his first poem at 15. When he finished school, as part of the first graduating class of the prestigious Imperial Lyceum in Tsarskoye Selo, near Saint Petersburg, his talent was already widely recognized on the Russian literary scene. After school, Pushkin plunged into the vibrant and raucous intellectual youth culture of the capital, Saint Petersburg. In 1820, he published his first long poem, Ruslan and Ludmila, with much controversy about its subject and style.\n\n\n== Social activism ==\nWhile at the Lyceum, Pushkin was heavily influenced by the Kantian liberal individualist teachings of Alexander Petrovich Kunitsyn, whom Pushkin would later commemorate in his poem 19 October. Pushkin also immersed himself in the thought of the French Enlightenment, to which he would remain permanently indebted throughout his life, particularly Diderot and Voltaire, whom he described as \"the first to follow the new road, and to bring the lamp of philosophy into the dark archives of history\".Pushkin gradually became committed to social reform and emerged as a spokesman for literary radicals. That angered the government and led to his transfer from the capital in May 1820. He went to the Caucasus and to Crimea and then to Kamianka and Chi\u0219in\u0103u in Moldavia, where he became a Freemason.\n\nHe joined the Filiki Eteria, a secret organization whose purpose was to overthrow Ottoman rule in Greece and establish an independent Greek state. He was inspired by the Greek Revolution and when the war against the Ottoman Turks broke out, he kept a diary recording the events of the national uprising.\n\n\n== Rise ==\nHe stayed in Chi\u0219in\u0103u until 1823 and wrote two Romantic poems, which brought him acclaim: The Captive of the Caucasus and The Fountain of Bakhchisaray. In 1823, Pushkin moved to Odessa, where he again clashed with the government, which sent him into exile on his mother's rural estate of Mikhailovskoye (near Pskov) from 1824 to 1826.In Mikhaylovskoye, Pushkin wrote nostalgic love poems which he dedicated to Elizaveta Vorontsova, wife of Malorossia's General-Governor. Then Pushkin continued work on his verse-novel Eugene Onegin.\nIn Mikhaylovskoye, in 1825, Pushkin wrote the poem To***. It is generally believed that he dedicated this poem to Anna Kern, but there are other opinions. Poet Mikhail Dudin believed that the poem was dedicated to the serf Olga Kalashnikova. Pushkinist Kira Victorova believed that the poem was dedicated to the Empress Elizaveta Alekseyevna. Vadim Nikolayev argued that the idea about the Empress was marginal and refused to discuss it, while trying to prove that poem had been dedicated to Tatyana Larina, the heroine of Eugene Onegin.Authorities summoned Pushkin to Moscow after his poem \"Ode to Liberty\" was found among the belongings of the rebels from the Decembrist Uprising (1825). After his exile in 1820, Pushkin's friends and family continually petitioned for his release, sending letters and meeting with Tsar Alexander I and then Tsar Nicholas I on the heels of the Decembrist Uprising. Upon meeting with Tsar Nicholas I Pushkin obtained his release from exile and began to work as the tsar's Titular Counsel of the National Archives. However, because insurgents in the Decembrist Uprising (1825) in Saint Petersburg had kept some of Pushkin's earlier political poems the tsar retained strict control of everything Pushkin published and he was unable to travel at will.\nDuring that same year (1825), Pushkin also wrote what would become his most famous play, the drama Boris Godunov, while at his mother's estate. He could not however, gain permission to publish it until five years later. The original and uncensored version of the drama was not staged until 2007.\nAround 1825\u20131829 he met and befriended the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, during exile in central Russia. In 1829 he travelled through the Caucasus to Erzurum to visit friends fighting in the Russian army during the Russo-Turkish War. In the end of 1829 Pushkin wanted to set off on a journey abroad, the desire reflected in his poem \u041f\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043c, \u044f \u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432; \u043a\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u0431\u044b \u0432\u044b, \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u044c\u044f... He applied for permission for the journey, but received negative response from Nicholas I on 17 January 1830.\n\nAround 1828, Pushkin met Natalia Goncharova, then 16 years old and one of the most talked-about beauties of Moscow. After much hesitation, Natalia accepted a proposal of marriage from Pushkin in April 1830, but not before she received assurances that the Tsarist government had no intentions to persecute the libertarian poet. Later, Pushkin and his wife became regulars of court society. They officially became engaged on 6 May 1830, and sent out wedding invitations. Due to an outbreak of cholera and other circumstances, the wedding was delayed for a year. The ceremony took place on 18 February 1831 (Old Style) in the Great Ascension Church on Bolshaya Nikitskaya Street in Moscow. When the Tsar gave Pushkin the lowest court title, Gentleman of the Chamber, the poet became enraged, feeling that the Tsar intended to humiliate him by implying that Pushkin was being admitted to court not on his own merits but solely so that his wife, who had many admirers including the Tsar himself, could properly attend court balls.\n\nIn the year 1831, during the period of Pushkin's growing literary influence, he met one of Russia's other great early writers, Nikolai Gogol. After reading Gogol's 1831\u20131832 volume of short stories Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka, Pushkin supported him and would feature some of Gogol's most famous short stories in the magazine The Contemporary, which he founded in 1836.\n\n\n== Death ==\nBy the autumn of 1836, Pushkin was falling into greater and greater debt and faced scandalous rumours that his wife was having a love affair. On 4 November he sent a challenge to a duel to Georges d'Anth\u00e8s, also known as Dantes-Gekkern. Jacob van Heeckeren, d'Anth\u00e8s' adoptive father, asked that the duel be delayed by two weeks. With efforts by the poet's friends, the duel was cancelled. On 17 November d'Anth\u00e8s made a proposal to Natalia Goncharova's (Pushkina's) sister \u2013 Ekaterina Goncharova. The marriage did not resolve the conflict. Georges d'Anth\u00e8s continued to pursue Natalia Goncharova in public, and rumours that d'Anth\u00e8s had married Natalia's sister just to save her reputation circulated. On 26 January (7 February in the Gregorian calendar) of 1837 Pushkin sent a \"highly insulting letter\" to Heeckeren. The only answer to that letter could be a challenge to a duel, as Pushkin knew. Pushkin received the formal challenge to a duel through his sister-in-law, Ekaterina Gekkerna, approved by d'Anth\u00e8s, on the same day through the attach\u00e9 of the French Embassy, Viscount d'Archiac. \nPushkin asked Arthur Magenis, then attach\u00e9 to the British Consulate-General in Saint Petersburg, to be his second. Magenis did not formally accept, but on 26 January (7 February), approached Viscount d'Archiac to attempt a reconciliation; however, d'Archiac refused to speak with him as he was not yet officially Pushkin's second. Magenis, unable to find Pushkin in the evening, sent him a letter through a messenger at 2 o'clock in the morning, declining to be his second as the possibility of a peaceful settlement had already been quashed, and the traditional first task of the second was to try to bring about a reconciliation.The duel with d'Anth\u00e8s took place on 27 January (8 February) at the Black River, without the presence of a second for Pushkin. D'Anth\u00e8s fired first, critically wounding Pushkin; the bullet entered at his hip and penetrated his abdomen. D'Anth\u00e8s was only lightly wounded in the right arm. Two days later, on 29 January (10 February) at 14:45, Pushkin died of peritonitis.\nAt Pushkin's wife's request, he was put in the coffin in evening dress \u2013 not in chamber-cadet uniform, the uniform provided by the tsar. The funeral service was initially assigned to the St. Isaac's Cathedral, but was moved to Konyushennaya church. Many people attended. After the funeral, the coffin was lowered into the basement, where it stayed until 3 February, when it was removed to Pskov province. Alexander Pushkin was buried on the grounds of the Svyatogorsky monastery in present-day Pushkinskiye Gory, near Pskov, beside his mother. His last home is now a museum.\n\n\n== Descendants ==\nPushkin had four children from his marriage to Natalia: Maria (b. 1832), Alexander (b. 1833), Grigory (b. 1835) and Natalia (b. 1836), the last of whom married morganatically with Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau (of the House of Nassau-Weilburg) and was granted the title of Countess of Merenberg.\nOnly the lines of Alexander and Natalia still remain. Natalia's granddaughter, Nadejda, married into the extended British royal family (her husband was the uncle of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh). Descendants of the poet now live around the globe in the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the United States.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== Literary ===\nCritics consider many of his works masterpieces, such as the poem The Bronze Horseman and the drama The Stone Guest, a tale of the fall of Don Juan. His poetic short drama Mozart and Salieri (like The Stone Guest, one of the so-called four Little Tragedies, a collective characterization by Pushkin himself in 1830 letter to Pyotr Pletnyov) was the inspiration for Peter Shaffer's Amadeus as well as providing the libretto (almost verbatim) to Rimsky-Korsakov's opera Mozart and Salieri. Pushkin is also known for his short stories. In particular his cycle The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin, including \"The Shot\", were well received. Pushkin himself preferred his verse novel Eugene Onegin, which he wrote over the course of his life and which, starting a tradition of great Russian novels, follows a few central characters but varies widely in tone and focus.\nOnegin is a work of such complexity that, though it is only about a hundred pages long, translator Vladimir Nabokov needed two full volumes of material to fully render its meaning in English. Because of this difficulty in translation, Pushkin's verse remains largely unknown to English readers. Even so, Pushkin has profoundly influenced western writers like Henry James.\nPushkin wrote The Queen of Spades, which is included in Black Water, a collection of short stories of a fantastic nature by major writers, compiled by Alberto Manguel.\n\n\n=== Musical ===\nPushkin's works also provided fertile ground for Russian composers. Glinka's Ruslan and Lyudmila is the earliest important Pushkin-inspired opera, and a landmark in the tradition of Russian music. Tchaikovsky's operas Eugene Onegin (1879) and The Queen of Spades (La Dame de Pique, 1890) became perhaps better known outside of Russia than Pushkin's own works of the same name.\nMussorgsky's monumental Boris Godunov (two versions, 1868\u20139 and 1871\u20132) ranks as one of the very finest and most original of Russian operas.\nOther Russian operas based on Pushkin include Dargomyzhsky's Rusalka and The Stone Guest; Rimsky-Korsakov's Mozart and Salieri, Tale of Tsar Saltan, and The Golden Cockerel; Cui's Prisoner of the Caucasus, Feast in Time of Plague, and The Captain's Daughter; Tchaikovsky's Mazeppa; Rachmaninoff's one-act operas Aleko (based on The Gypsies) and The Miserly Knight; Stravinsky's Mavra, and N\u00e1pravn\u00edk's Dubrovsky.\nAdditionally, ballets and cantatas, as well as innumerable songs, have been set to Pushkin's verse (including even his French-language poems, in Isabelle Aboulker's song cycle \"Caprice \u00e9trange\"). Zinaida Petrovna Ziberova also set some of his poems to music. Supp\u00e9, Leoncavallo and Malipiero have based operas on his works.The Desire of Glory, which has been dedicated to Elizaveta Vorontsova, was set to music by David Tukhmanov (Vitold Petrovsky \u2013 The Desire of Glory on YouTube), as well as Keep Me, Mine Talisman \u2013 by Alexander Barykin (Alexander Barykin \u2013 Keep Me, Mine Talisman on YouTube) and later by Tukhmanov. \n\n\n=== Romanticism ===\nPushkin is considered by many to be the central representative of Romanticism in Russian literature although he was not unequivocally known as a Romantic. Russian critics have traditionally argued that his works represent a path from Neoclassicism through Romanticism to Realism. An alternative assessment suggests that \"he had an ability to entertain contrarities which may seem Romantic in origin, but are ultimately subversive of all fixed points of view, all single outlooks, including the Romantic\" and that \"he is simultaneously Romantic and not Romantic\".\n\n\n=== Russian language ===\nAccording to Vladimir Nabokov, Pushkin's idiom combined all the contemporaneous elements of Russian with all he had learned from Derzhavin, Zhukovsky, Batyushkov, Karamzin and Krylov:\nThe poetical and metaphysical strain that still lived in Church Slavonic forms and locutions\nAbundant and natural gallicisms\nEveryday colloquialisms of his set\nStylized popular speech by making a salad of the famous three styles (low, medium elevation, high) dear to the pseudoclassical archaists and adding the ingredients of Russian romanticists with a pinch of parody.\nPushkin is usually credited with developing Russian literature. He is seen as having originated the highly nuanced level of language which characterizes Russian literature after him, and he is also credited with substantially augmenting the Russian lexicon. Whenever he found gaps in the Russian vocabulary, he devised calques. His rich vocabulary and highly-sensitive style are the foundation for modern Russian literature. His accomplishments set new records for development of the Russian language and culture. He became the father of Russian literature in the 19th century, marking the highest achievements of the 18th century and the beginning of literary process of the 19th century. He introduced Russia to all the European literary genres as well as a great number of West European writers. He brought natural speech and foreign influences to create modern poetic Russian. Though his life was brief, he left examples of nearly every literary genre of his day: lyric poetry, narrative poetry, the novel, the short story, the drama, the critical essay and even the personal letter.\nHis work as a critic and as a journalist marked the birth of Russian magazine culture which included him devising and contributing heavily to one of the most influential literary magazines of the 19th century, the Sovremennik (The Contemporary, or \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a). Pushkin inspired the folk tales and genre pieces of other authors: Leskov, Yesenin and Gorky. His use of Russian language formed the basis of the style of novelists Ivan Turgenev, Ivan Goncharov and Leo Tolstoy, as well as that of subsequent lyric poets such as Mikhail Lermontov. Pushkin was analysed by Nikolai Gogol, his successor and pupil, and the great Russian critic Vissarion Belinsky, who produced the fullest and deepest critical study of Pushkin's work, which still retains much of its relevance.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nIn 1929, Soviet writer, Leonid Grossman, published a novel, The d'Archiac Papers, telling the story of Pushkin's death from the perspective of a French diplomat, being a participant and a witness of the fatal duel. The book describes him as a liberal and a victim of the Tsarist regime. In Poland the book was published under the title Death of the Poet.\nIn 1937, the town of Tsarskoye Selo was renamed Pushkin in his honour.\nThere are several museums in Russia dedicated to Pushkin, including two in Moscow, one in Saint Petersburg, and a large complex in Mikhaylovskoye.\nPushkin's death was portrayed in the 2006 biographical film Pushkin: The Last Duel. The film was directed by Natalya Bondarchuk. Pushkin was portrayed on screen by Sergei Bezrukov.\nThe Pushkin Trust was established in 1987 by the Duchess of Abercorn to commemorate the creative legacy and spirit of her ancestor and to release the creativity and imagination of the children of Ireland by providing them with opportunities to communicate their thoughts, feelings and experiences.\nA minor planet, 2208 Pushkin, discovered in 1977 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Chernykh, is named after him. A crater on Mercury is also named in his honour.\nMS Aleksandr Pushkin, second ship of the Russian Ivan Franko class (also referred to as \"poet\" or \"writer\" class).\nA station of Tashkent metro was named in his honour.\nThe Pushkin Hills and Pushkin Lake were named in his honour in Ben Nevis Township, Cochrane District, in Ontario, Canada.\nUN Russian Language Day, established by the United Nations in 2010 and celebrated each year on 6 June, was scheduled to coincide with Pushkin's birthday.\nA statue of Pushkin was unveiled inside the Mehan Garden in Manila, Philippines to commemorate the Philippines\u2013Russia relations in 2010.\nThe Alexander Pushkin diamond, the second largest found in Russia and the former territory of the USSR, was named after him.\nOn 28 November 2009, a Pushkin Monument was erected in Asmara, capital of Eritrea.\nIn 2005 a monument to Pushkin and his grandmother Maria Hannibal was commissioned by an enthusiast of Russian culture Just Rugel in Zakharovo, Russia. Sculptor V. Kozinin\nIn 2019, Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport was named after Pushkin in accordance to the Great Names of Russia contest.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Works ==\n[Not including the short poems, of which there are dozens.]\n\n\n=== Narrative poems ===\n1820 \u2013 Ruslan i Ludmila (\u0420\u0443\u0441\u043b\u0430\u043d \u0438 \u041b\u044e\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0430);

          "Have to admit that I'm not the literary type, and I knew practically nothing about Pushkin before coming area - except that he was some famous Russian writer. Still, when in Rome etc . . so I took the opportunity while in Chisinau to do something of interest and went along. I",

Cricova is famous for its wine cellars, which make it a popular attraction for tourists.\nThe town's population is 9,878 (as of 2004), of which 7,651 are ethnic Moldavians, 788 Ukrainians, 1,123 Russians, 82 Gagauzians, 74 Bulgarians, 6 Jews, 2 Poles, 29 Gypsies, and 123 other/non-declared.\nCricova lies near the river Ichel, which goes into the Nistru river, which supplies Chi\u0219in\u0103u with water. The water from Ichel is not used in Cricova. In the northern part of the river is situated a lake (which is near the entrance to the Cricova wine cellars), which was generally used either for fishing or entertainment.\nNear the town are some mines, used for limestone extraction, some of them are older than 50 years.\nThe town of Cricova was first recorded on July 31, 1431, with the name- \"Vadul-Pietrei\" (\"Stone Ford\"). Later the name \"Cric\u0103u\" appears in Zamfir Arbore's geographical calendar, over time turning into Cricova.\n\n\n== Twin Towns ==\n Noceto, Italy\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Official Site\"\nCricova profile on chisinau.md site (in Romanian)\nDescription of cellars with photos and an interactive map",

        "wiki": "Chi\u0219in\u0103u ( KISH-ih-NOW, also US:  KEE-shee-NOW, Romanian: [ki\u0283i\u02c8n\u0259w] (listen)), also known as Kishinev (Russian: \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0451\u0432, tr. Kishinj\u00f3v [k\u02b2\u026a\u0282\u0268\u02c8n\u02b2\u0275f]), is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Moldova. The city is Moldova's main industrial and commercial center, and is located in the middle of the country, on the river B\u00e2c, a tributary of the Dniester. According to the results of the 2014 census, the city proper had a population of 532,513, while the population of the Municipality of Chi\u0219in\u0103u (which includes the city itself and other nearby communities) was 700,000.\nChi\u0219in\u0103u is the most economically prosperous locality in Moldova and its largest transportation hub. Nearly a third of Moldova's population lives in the metro area.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the city's name is unclear. A theory suggests that the name may come from the archaic Romanian word chi\u0219la (meaning \"spring\", \"source of water\") and nou\u0103 (\"new\"), because it was built around a small spring, at the corner of Pu\u0219kin and Albi\u0219oara streets.The other version, formulated by \u0218tefan Ciobanu, Romanian historian and academician, holds that the name was formed the same way as the name of Chi\u0219ineu (alternative spelling: Chi\u0219in\u0103u) in Western Romania, near the border with Hungary. Its Hungarian name is Kisjen\u0151, from which the Romanian name originates. Kisjen\u0151 comes from kis \"small\" and the Jen\u0151, one of the seven Hungarian tribes that entered the Carpathian Basin in 896. At least 24 other settlements are named after the Jen\u0151 tribe.Chi\u0219in\u0103u is known in Russian as \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0451\u0432 (Kishinj\u00f3v), while Moldova's Russian-language media call it \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044d\u0443, [k\u02b2\u026a\u0282\u0268\u02c8n\u025b\u028a] (Kishineu). It is written Ki\u015fin\u00f6v in the Latin Gagauz alphabet. It was also written as Chi\u0219ineu in pre-20th-century Romanian and as \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044d\u0443 in the Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet. Historically, the English language name for the city, Kishinev, was based on the modified Russian one because it entered the English language via Russian at the time Chi\u0219in\u0103u was part of the Russian Empire (e.g. Kishinev pogrom). Therefore, it remains a common English name in some historical contexts. Otherwise, the Romanian-based Chi\u0219in\u0103u has been steadily gaining wider currency, especially in written language. The city is also historically referred to as German: Kischinau, Polish: Kiszyni\u00f3w, Ukrainian: \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0456\u0432, romanized: Kyshyniv, or Yiddish: \u05e7\u05e2\u05e9\u05e2\u05e0\u05e2\u05f0\u200e, romanized: Keshenev.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Moldavian period ===\nFounded in 1436 as a monastery village, the city was part of the Principality of Moldavia (which, starting with the 16th century became a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire, but still retaining its autonomy). At the beginning of the 19th century Chi\u0219in\u0103u was a small town of 7,000 inhabitants.\nIn 1812, in the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812), the eastern half of Moldavia was ceded to the Russian Empire. The newly acquired territories became known as Bessarabia.\n\n\n=== Russian Imperial period ===\n\nUnder Russian government, Chi\u0219in\u0103u became the capital of the newly annexed oblast (later guberniya) of Bessarabia. By 1834, an imperial townscape with broad and long roads had emerged as a result of a generous development plan, which divided Chi\u0219in\u0103u roughly into two areas: the old part of the town, with its irregular building structures, and a newer city centre and station. Between 26 May 1830 and 13 October 1836 the architect Avraam Melnikov established the Catedrala Na\u0219terea Domnului with a magnificent bell tower. In 1840 the building of the Triumphal arch, planned by the architect Luca Zaushkevich, was completed. Following this the construction of numerous buildings and landmarks began.\nOn 28 August 1871, Chi\u0219in\u0103u was linked by rail with Tiraspol, and in 1873 with Corne\u0219ti. Chi\u0219in\u0103u-Ungheni-Ia\u0219i railway was opened on 1 June 1875 in preparation for the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878). The town played an important part in the war between Russia and Ottoman Empire, as the main staging area of the Russian invasion. During the Belle \u00c9poque, the mayor of the city was Carol Schmidt, considered one of Chisinau's best mayors. Its population had grown to 92,000 by 1862, and to 125,787 by 1900.\n\n\n==== Pogroms and pre-revolution ====\n\nIn the late 19th century, especially due to growing anti-Semitic sentiment in the Russian Empire and better economic conditions in Moldova, many Jews chose to settle in Chi\u0219in\u0103u. By the year 1897, 46% of the population of Chi\u0219in\u0103u was Jewish, over 50,000 people.As part of the pogrom wave organized in the Russian Empire, a large anti-Semitic riot was organized in the town on  19\u201320 April 1903, which would later be known as the Kishinev pogrom. The rioting continued for three days, resulting in 47 Jews dead, 92 severely wounded, and 500 suffering minor injuries. In addition, several hundred houses and many businesses were plundered and destroyed. Some sources say 49 people were killed. The pogroms are largely believed to have been incited by anti-Jewish propaganda in the only official newspaper of the time, Bessarabetz (\u0411\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0446\u044a). Mayor Schmidt disapproved of the incident and resigned later in 1903. The reactions to this incident included a petition to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia on behalf of the American people by US President Theodore Roosevelt in July 1903.On 22 August 1905 another violent event occurred: The police opened fire on an estimated 3,000 demonstrating agricultural workers. Only a few months later, 19\u201320 October 1905, a further protest occurred, helping to force the hand of Nicholas II in bringing about the October Manifesto. However, these demonstrations suddenly turned into another anti-Jewish pogrom, resulting in 19 deaths.\n\n\n=== Romanian period ===\n\nFollowing the Russian October Revolution, Bessarabia declared independence from the crumbling empire, as the Moldavian Democratic Republic, before joining the Kingdom of Romania. As of 1919, Chi\u0219in\u0103u, with an estimated population of 133,000, became the second largest city in Romania.\nBetween 1918 and 1940, the center of the city undertook large renovation work. Romania granted important subsidies to its province and initiated large scale investment programs in the infrastructure of the main cities in Bessarabia, expanded the railroad infrastructure and started an extensive program to eradicate illiteracy.\nIn 1927, the Stephen the Great Monument, by the sculptor Alexandru Pl\u0103m\u0103deal\u0103, was erected. In 1933, the first higher education institution in Bessarabia was established, by transferring the Agricultural Sciences Section of the University of Ia\u0219i to Chi\u0219in\u0103u, as the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nOn 28 June 1940, as a direct result of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, Bessarabia was annexed by the Soviet Union from Romania, and Chi\u0219in\u0103u became the capital of the newly created Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic.\nFollowing the Soviet occupation, mass deportations, linked with atrocities, were executed by the NKVD between June 1940 and June 1941. In Chi\u0219in\u0103u, over 400 people were summarily executed in July 1940 and buried in the grounds of the Metropolitan Palace, the Chi\u0219in\u0103u Theological Institute, and the backyard of the Italian Consulate, where the NKVD had established its headquarters. As part of the policy of political repression of the potential opposition to the Communist power, tens of thousand members of native families were deported from Bessarabia to other regions of the USSR.\nOn 10 November 1940, a devastating earthquake occurred. The epicenter of the quake, which measured 7.4 (or 7.7, according to other sources) on the Richter scale, was in Vrancea Mountains and subsequently led to substantial destruction: 78 deaths and 2,795 affected buildings (of which 172 destroyed).In June 1941, in order to recover Bessarabia, Romania entered World War II under the command of the German Wehrmacht, declaring war to the Soviet Union. In the chaos of the Second World War, Chi\u0219in\u0103u was severely affected. In June\u2013July 1941 the city came under bombardment by Nazi air raids. However, the Romanian and newly Moldovan sources assign most of the responsibility for the damage to Soviet NKVD destruction battalions, that operated in Chi\u0219in\u0103u until 17 July 1941, when it was captured by Axis forces.Following the German and Romanian reoccupation, the city suffered from the Nazi extermination policy of its Jewish inhabitants, who were transported on trucks to the outskirts of the city and then summarily shot in partially dug pits. The number of Jews murdered during the initial occupation of the city is estimated at approximately 10,000 people.As the war drew to a conclusion, the city was once again the scene of heavy fighting as German and Romanian troops retreated. Chi\u0219in\u0103u was captured by the Red Army on 24 August 1944 as a result of the Jassy-Kishinev Operation.\n\n\n=== Soviet period ===\nAfter the war, Bessarabia was fully reintegrated into the Soviet Union, around 65 percent of its territory as the Moldavian SSR, while the remaining 35 percent were transferred to the Ukrainian SSR.\nTwo other waves of deportations of Moldova's native population were carried out by the Soviets, the first one immediately after the Soviet reoccupation of Bessarabia until the end of the 1940s, and the second one in the mid-1950s.In the years 1947 to 1949 the architect Alexey Shchusev developed a plan with the aid of a team of architects for the gradual reconstruction of the city.There was rapid population growth in the 1950s, to which the Soviet administration responded by constructing large-scale housing and palaces in the style of Stalinist architecture. This process continued under Nikita Khrushchev, who called for construction under the slogan \"good, cheaper and built faster\". The new architectural style brought about dramatic change and generated the style that dominates today, with large blocks of flats arranged in considerable settlements. These Khrushchev-era building are often informally called Khrushchyovka.\nThe period of the most significant redevelopment of the city extended from 1971, when the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union adopted a decision \"On the measures for further development of the city of Kishinev\", which secured more than one billion rubles in investment from the state budget, which continued until the independence of Moldova in 1991. The share of dwellings built during the Soviet period (1951\u20131990) represents 74.3 percent of total households.On 4 March 1977, the city was again jolted by a devastating earthquake. Several people were killed and panic broke out.\n\n\n=== After independence ===\nMany streets of Chi\u0219in\u0103u are named after historic persons, places or events. Independence from the Soviet Union was followed by a large-scale renaming of streets and localities from a Communist theme into a national one.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nChi\u0219in\u0103u is located on the river B\u00e2c, a tributary of the Dniester, at 47\u00b00\u2032N 28\u00b055\u2032E, with an area of 120 km2 (46 sq mi). The municipality comprises 635 km2 (245 sq mi).\nThe city lies in central Moldova and is surrounded by a relatively level landscape with very fertile ground.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nChi\u0219in\u0103u has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfa) characterised by warm summers and cool, windy winters. Winter minimum temperatures are often below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F), although they rarely drop below \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F). In summer, the average maximum temperature is approximately 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), however, temperatures occasionally reach 35 to 40 \u00b0C (95 to 104 \u00b0F) in mid-summer in downtown. Although average precipitation and humidity during summer is relatively low, there are infrequent yet heavy storms.\nSpring and autumn temperatures vary between 16 to 24 \u00b0C (61 to 75 \u00b0F), and precipitation during this time tends to be lower than in summer but with more frequent yet milder periods of rain.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Municipality ===\nMoldova is administratively subdivided into 3 municipalities, 32 districts, and 2 autonomous units. With a population of 662,836 inhabitants (as of 2014), the Municipality of Chi\u0219in\u0103u (which includes the nearby communities) is the largest of these municipalities.Besides the city itself, the municipality comprises 34 other suburban localities: 6 towns (containing further 2 villages within), and 12 communes (containing further 14 villages within).

Under the Moldovan constitution, Urechean \u2014 elected to parliament in 2005 \u2014 was unable to hold an additional post to that of an MP. The Democratic Moldova Bloc leader subsequently accepted his mandate and in April resigned from his former position.

A Soviet era one is located in the Botanica district, along the three lakes of a major park, which reaches the outskirts of the city center. Another, the modern Aventura Park, is located farther from the center. A circus, which used to be in a grand building in the R\u00e2\u0219cani sector, has been inactive for several years due to a poorly funded renovation project.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the results of the last Moldovan census, conducted in May 2014, 532,513 inhabitants live within the Chi\u0219in\u0103u city limits.

          "Beautiful building, well restored, right in the heart of the city. Could have been a better experience, but most of the paintings are no-name Moldavian artists with no connection to the international scene... Also, in the grand hall at the second floor, 3 male employees were",
          "This was hands down my favorite visit in chisinau. The exterior and interior are both absolutely gorgeous, perfect for artsy photographs. I was also impressed by both the permanent collection and the temporary exhibits of art they had in the musuem. It is a rather large place so",

          "Apparently, the Romanian government popped out a million euros to help get this completed and boy is it worth it. Fantastic variety of art on display (some images below). One of the key things about an art gallery is the shape of the rooms, the floors, ceilings, the positioning",

          "With scarcity of venues to visit here, this really is a must visit site if you like beautifully restored majestic buildings, housing an excellent collection of local art. The staff were very professional, though seeming to follow most guests into rooms ... which for some may be",

          "This museum has a wonderful collection of paintings. It's interesting to see the beauty of the Moldovan women from the 19th century through the eyes of the artists. A little European collection was also on exhibit. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Chisinau.",
          "We have visited Chisinau many times before but never been to this museum until now. The building has been renovated over the last few years to a very high standard. So even if you're not interested in art we would recommend a visit. It is open most days from 10am to 6pm. We went",

          "For most of Moldova's history it has been somebody else's province and not seen as a nation at all - and this is reflected in the museum. There are few, if any, works here of note, though there are some moderately interesting pieces and there was an exhibition of a modern",
          "With the remodeling work, sponsored by Romania, this has turned into a very adequate art museum. Dropped by recently for the first time in a couple of years and was very pleased",

Kishinj\u00f3v [k\u02b2\u026a\u0282\u0268\u02c8n\u02b2\u0275f]), is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Moldova. The city is Moldova's main industrial and commercial center, and is located in the middle of the country, on the river B\u00e2c, a tributary of the Dniester. According to the results of the 2014 census, the city proper had a population of 532,513, while the population of the Municipality of Chi\u0219in\u0103u (which includes the city itself and other nearby communities) was 700,000.\nChi\u0219in\u0103u is the most economically prosperous locality in Moldova and its largest transportation hub. Nearly a third of Moldova's population lives in the metro area.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the city's name is unclear. A theory suggests that the name may come from the archaic Romanian word chi\u0219la (meaning \"spring\", \"source of water\") and nou\u0103 (\"new\"), because it was built around a small spring, at the corner of Pu\u0219kin and Albi\u0219oara streets.The other version, formulated by \u0218tefan Ciobanu, Romanian historian and academician, holds that the name was formed the same way as the name of Chi\u0219ineu (alternative spelling: Chi\u0219in\u0103u) in Western Romania, near the border with Hungary. Its Hungarian name is Kisjen\u0151, from which the Romanian name originates. Kisjen\u0151 comes from kis \"small\" and the Jen\u0151, one of the seven Hungarian tribes that entered the Carpathian Basin in 896. At least 24 other settlements are named after the Jen\u0151 tribe.Chi\u0219in\u0103u is known in Russian as \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0451\u0432 (Kishinj\u00f3v), while Moldova's Russian-language media call it \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044d\u0443, [k\u02b2\u026a\u0282\u0268\u02c8n\u025b\u028a] (Kishineu). It is written Ki\u015fin\u00f6v in the Latin Gagauz alphabet. It was also written as Chi\u0219ineu in pre-20th-century Romanian and as \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044d\u0443 in the Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet. Historically, the English language name for the city, Kishinev, was based on the modified Russian one because it entered the English language via Russian at the time Chi\u0219in\u0103u was part of the Russian Empire (e.g. Kishinev pogrom). Therefore, it remains a common English name in some historical contexts. Otherwise, the Romanian-based Chi\u0219in\u0103u has been steadily gaining wider currency, especially in written language. The city is also historically referred to as German: Kischinau, Polish: Kiszyni\u00f3w, Ukrainian: \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0456\u0432, romanized: Kyshyniv, or Yiddish: \u05e7\u05e2\u05e9\u05e2\u05e0\u05e2\u05f0\u200e, romanized: Keshenev.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Moldavian period ===\nFounded in 1436 as a monastery village, the city was part of the Principality of Moldavia (which, starting with the 16th century became a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire, but still retaining its autonomy). At the beginning of the 19th century Chi\u0219in\u0103u was a small town of 7,000 inhabitants.\nIn 1812, in the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812), the eastern half of Moldavia was ceded to the Russian Empire. The newly acquired territories became known as Bessarabia.\n\n\n=== Russian Imperial period ===\n\nUnder Russian government, Chi\u0219in\u0103u became the capital of the newly annexed oblast (later guberniya) of Bessarabia. By 1834, an imperial townscape with broad and long roads had emerged as a result of a generous development plan, which divided Chi\u0219in\u0103u roughly into two areas: the old part of the town, with its irregular building structures, and a newer city centre and station. Between 26 May 1830 and 13 October 1836 the architect Avraam Melnikov established the Catedrala Na\u0219terea Domnului with a magnificent bell tower. In 1840 the building of the Triumphal arch, planned by the architect Luca Zaushkevich, was completed. Following this the construction of numerous buildings and landmarks began.\nOn 28 August 1871, Chi\u0219in\u0103u was linked by rail with Tiraspol, and in 1873 with Corne\u0219ti. Chi\u0219in\u0103u-Ungheni-Ia\u0219i railway was opened on 1 June 1875 in preparation for the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878). The town played an important part in the war between Russia and Ottoman Empire, as the main staging area of the Russian invasion. During the Belle \u00c9poque, the mayor of the city was Carol Schmidt, considered one of Chisinau's best mayors. Its population had grown to 92,000 by 1862, and to 125,787 by 1900.\n\n\n==== Pogroms and pre-revolution ====\n\nIn the late 19th century, especially due to growing anti-Semitic sentiment in the Russian Empire and better economic conditions in Moldova, many Jews chose to settle in Chi\u0219in\u0103u. By the year 1897, 46% of the population of Chi\u0219in\u0103u was Jewish, over 50,000 people.As part of the pogrom wave organized in the Russian Empire, a large anti-Semitic riot was organized in the town on  19\u201320 April 1903, which would later be known as the Kishinev pogrom. The rioting continued for three days, resulting in 47 Jews dead, 92 severely wounded, and 500 suffering minor injuries. In addition, several hundred houses and many businesses were plundered and destroyed. Some sources say 49 people were killed. The pogroms are largely believed to have been incited by anti-Jewish propaganda in the only official newspaper of the time, Bessarabetz (\u0411\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0446\u044a). Mayor Schmidt disapproved of the incident and resigned later in 1903. The reactions to this incident included a petition to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia on behalf of the American people by US President Theodore Roosevelt in July 1903.On 22 August 1905 another violent event occurred: The police opened fire on an estimated 3,000 demonstrating agricultural workers. Only a few months later, 19\u201320 October 1905, a further protest occurred, helping to force the hand of Nicholas II in bringing about the October Manifesto. However, these demonstrations suddenly turned into another anti-Jewish pogrom, resulting in 19 deaths.\n\n\n=== Romanian period ===\n\nFollowing the Russian October Revolution, Bessarabia declared independence from the crumbling empire, as the Moldavian Democratic Republic, before joining the Kingdom of Romania. As of 1919, Chi\u0219in\u0103u, with an estimated population of 133,000, became the second largest city in Romania.\nBetween 1918 and 1940, the center of the city undertook large renovation work. Romania granted important subsidies to its province and initiated large scale investment programs in the infrastructure of the main cities in Bessarabia, expanded the railroad infrastructure and started an extensive program to eradicate illiteracy.\nIn 1927, the Stephen the Great Monument, by the sculptor Alexandru Pl\u0103m\u0103deal\u0103, was erected. In 1933, the first higher education institution in Bessarabia was established, by transferring the Agricultural Sciences Section of the University of Ia\u0219i to Chi\u0219in\u0103u, as the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nOn 28 June 1940, as a direct result of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, Bessarabia was annexed by the Soviet Union from Romania, and Chi\u0219in\u0103u became the capital of the newly created Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic.\nFollowing the Soviet occupation, mass deportations, linked with atrocities, were executed by the NKVD between June 1940 and June 1941. In Chi\u0219in\u0103u, over 400 people were summarily executed in July 1940 and buried in the grounds of the Metropolitan Palace, the Chi\u0219in\u0103u Theological Institute, and the backyard of the Italian Consulate, where the NKVD had established its headquarters. As part of the policy of political repression of the potential opposition to the Communist power, tens of thousand members of native families were deported from Bessarabia to other regions of the USSR.\nOn 10 November 1940, a devastating earthquake occurred. The epicenter of the quake, which measured 7.4 (or 7.7, according to other sources) on the Richter scale, was in Vrancea Mountains and subsequently led to substantial destruction: 78 deaths and 2,795 affected buildings (of which 172 destroyed).In June 1941, in order to recover Bessarabia, Romania entered World War II under the command of the German Wehrmacht, declaring war to the Soviet Union. In the chaos of the Second World War, Chi\u0219in\u0103u was severely affected. In June\u2013July 1941 the city came under bombardment by Nazi air raids. However, the Romanian and newly Moldovan sources assign most of the responsibility for the damage to Soviet NKVD destruction battalions, that operated in Chi\u0219in\u0103u until 17 July 1941, when it was captured by Axis forces.Following the German and Romanian reoccupation, the city suffered from the Nazi extermination policy of its Jewish inhabitants, who were transported on trucks to the outskirts of the city and then summarily shot in partially dug pits. The number of Jews murdered during the initial occupation of the city is estimated at approximately 10,000 people.As the war drew to a conclusion, the city was once again the scene of heavy fighting as German and Romanian troops retreated. Chi\u0219in\u0103u was captured by the Red Army on 24 August 1944 as a result of the Jassy-Kishinev Operation.\n\n\n=== Soviet period ===\nAfter the war, Bessarabia was fully reintegrated into the Soviet Union, around 65 percent of its territory as the Moldavian SSR, while the remaining 35 percent were transferred to the Ukrainian SSR.\nTwo other waves of deportations of Moldova's native population were carried out by the Soviets, the first one immediately after the Soviet reoccupation of Bessarabia until the end of the 1940s, and the second one in the mid-1950s.In the years 1947 to 1949 the architect Alexey Shchusev developed a plan with the aid of a team of architects for the gradual reconstruction of the city.There was rapid population growth in the 1950s, to which the Soviet administration responded by constructing large-scale housing and palaces in the style of Stalinist architecture. This process continued under Nikita Khrushchev, who called for construction under the slogan \"good, cheaper and built faster\". The new architectural style brought about dramatic change and generated the style that dominates today, with large blocks of flats arranged in considerable settlements. These Khrushchev-era building are often informally called Khrushchyovka.\nThe period of the most significant redevelopment of the city extended from 1971, when the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union adopted a decision \"On the measures for further development of the city of Kishinev\", which secured more than one billion rubles in investment from the state budget, which continued until the independence of Moldova in 1991. The share of dwellings built during the Soviet period (1951\u20131990) represents 74.3 percent of total households.On 4 March 1977, the city was again jolted by a devastating earthquake. Several people were killed and panic broke out.\n\n\n=== After independence ===\nMany streets of Chi\u0219in\u0103u are named after historic persons, places or events. Independence from the Soviet Union was followed by a large-scale renaming of streets and localities from a Communist theme into a national one.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nChi\u0219in\u0103u is located on the river B\u00e2c, a tributary of the Dniester, at 47\u00b00\u2032N 28\u00b055\u2032E, with an area of 120 km2 (46 sq mi). The municipality comprises 635 km2 (245 sq mi).\nThe city lies in central Moldova and is surrounded by a relatively level landscape with very fertile ground.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nChi\u0219in\u0103u has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfa) characterised by warm summers and cool, windy winters. Winter minimum temperatures are often below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F), although they rarely drop below \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F). In summer, the average maximum temperature is approximately 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), however, temperatures occasionally reach 35 to 40 \u00b0C (95 to 104 \u00b0F) in mid-summer in downtown. Although average precipitation and humidity during summer is relatively low, there are infrequent yet heavy storms.\nSpring and autumn temperatures vary between 16 to 24 \u00b0C (61 to 75 \u00b0F), and precipitation during this time tends to be lower than in summer but with more frequent yet milder periods of rain.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Municipality ===\nMoldova is administratively subdivided into 3 municipalities, 32 districts, and 2 autonomous units. With a population of 662,836 inhabitants (as of 2014), the Municipality of Chi\u0219in\u0103u (which includes the nearby communities) is the largest of these municipalities.Besides the city itself, the municipality comprises 34 other suburban localities: 6 towns (containing further 2 villages within), and 12 communes (containing further 14 villages within).

A Soviet era one is located in the Botanica district, along the three lakes of a major park, which reaches the outskirts of the city center. Another, the modern Aventura Park, is located farther from the center. A circus, which used to be in a grand building in the R\u00e2\u0219cani sector, has been inactive for several years due to a poorly funded renovation project.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the results of the last Moldovan census, conducted in May 2014, 532,513 inhabitants live within the Chi\u0219in\u0103u city limits.

        "wiki": "Andrei Mudrea (born April 29, 1954, Mitocul Vechi, Orhei rayon, Republic of Moldova), Honoured/Merited Master of Arts, the Romanian painter and fine artist from Bessarabia. He was one of Mihai Grecu's disciples, the author of several painting, graphics, sculpture and art-object works. He was the founder and member of \"The group of ten\". The works of the fine artist  Andrei Mudrea occupies a leading position among the works of reference or even of Moldovan artistic avant-garde. He was the chairman  and the member of the panel of the various competitions in the field of fine arts held in Chi\u0219in\u0103u.Mudrea's works, created over three decades, record an evolution that marks several stages of ascension. They carry an individual message, of deep philosophical character and those correspond to artistic aspirations and are related to the changes that occur in the national cultural environment.Andrei Mudrea is considered one of the most talented Bessarabian painters. The artist messages are full of alarming drama, that is usually an encrypted one, hidden in a metaphor, whether it be landscapes, famous Mudri houses or paintings painted in a postmodern manner.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nFrom 1969 to 1973, he studied at the School of Fine Arts \"I. Repin\", currently the Republican College of Fine Arts \"Alexandru Pl\u0103m\u0103deal\u0103\" in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, R. Moldova.

In 1978 he debuted with the paintings \"Mother\" and \"The parent's house\" (mixed technique, white on white paintings), and from 1978 until now he participates in all the exhibitions organized by the of Plastic Artists of the Republic of Moldova.The works published in 1975-1985 bear the M. Grecu's influence. The painting of these years attests to the existence of several tangents related to the progressive use of dyes, to obtaining clear-dark effects, texture and volume. The works published in 1985-1995 reveal a new stage in the artist's creation, another way of the master\u2019s.\nLater, in 1989 he became a member of the Union of Artists of Moldova. In 1990 he participated in the developing of the State Coat of Arms of the Republic of Moldova and is the author and promoter of the \"8-ray Star\".

The same impulse to thank, but, this time, for the quench of thirst for light, I had when admiring the paintings of the painter Andrei Mudrea. In the pictures, all of them - people, objects and the atmosphere - everything is enveloped, exalted, penetrated by the light. Even the stones ... If I would try to find in my memory a replica of this original and of the talent full of dignity, I would imagine it like a solar river, dripping stormily between old and new walls, through the stony fluorescence of the relief, crossing with haste the green of the saddles and approaching more and more softly to our souls, illuminating and ennobling them and calls them gently to the Universe of Light. \"\nLeonida Lari, poet, journalist, writer, 2004.\n***\n\"(...) Remaining lyrical and poetic at the beginning of his creation, A. Mudrea evolves, making the pictures of a profound dramatic character, specific to the times and, at the same time, remaining permanently as an author of spiritual messages, encrypted in the context of images embodied in the vestments of the parable and metaphor. The Andrei Mudrea\u2019s works, undoubtedly, represent a true page of the modern art, valid both in the country and abroad.\"\nTudor St\u01cevil\u01ce, PhD in arts study, 2013.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site of Andrei Mudrea\nOfficial page of TripAdvisor",

It is located in the city of Chi\u015fin\u0103u, Moldova.\n\n\n== History ==\nFrom the 6th to the 13th centuries, the territory of Moldova was populated by Slavic tribes, the Ulichs and the Tivertsi, along with the Dacians. Not far from the city of Peresechen, in a valley with three lakes, there was a sanctuary dedicated to Slavonic tribal gods and dead ancestors. It was called Ross Valley in honor of the mythical ancestor of the Russian people, Rus. There stood the idols and altars of a number of Slavonic gods and ancestral patrons. In the days of pagan holidays, folk festivals were arranged in the valley and on the lakes.\n\nThe role of Ross Valley in the religious life of Slavic people declined as the Pechenegs and Cumans invaded these lands in the 9th century. After the dissemination of Christianity among the Slav tribes in the 10th-11th centuries, the sanctuary evidently was destroyed. But its name was preserved among local inhabitants, and in the course of time it was transformed into Rose Valley.\n\n\n== Modern times ==\nIn the 1950s, rose plantations were planted in the Rose Valley.\nAt the end of the 1960s, the park saw some improvement. New lanes were laid, concrete dams were built, and lakes were cleared of silt.\nNow the central section of the park is decorated with several lakes covering nine hectares. About 50 varieties of trees and bushes grow there. There is a stage with a capacity of 1000 spectators, a small amusement park with a Ferris wheel, and the restaurants Doina (destroyed), Cetatea Veche (\"The Old Fortress\"), and Curtea V\u00een\u0103toreasc\u0103 (\"The Hunters' Court\").  The remains of several stone idols were preserved and restored in the 1970s in the form of decorative statues. Also preserved were the stairs that led to the altars and the foundation of an ancient construction on the shore of one of the lakes \u2014 now part of the restaurant Cetatea Veche.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Chi\u0219in\u0103u ( KISH-ih-NOW, also US:  KEE-shee-NOW, Romanian: [ki\u0283i\u02c8n\u0259w] (listen)), also known as Kishinev (Russian: \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0451\u0432, tr. Kishinj\u00f3v [k\u02b2\u026a\u0282\u0268\u02c8n\u02b2\u0275f]), is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Moldova. The city is Moldova's main industrial and commercial center, and is located in the middle of the country, on the river B\u00e2c, a tributary of the Dniester. According to the results of the 2014 census, the city proper had a population of 532,513, while the population of the Municipality of Chi\u0219in\u0103u (which includes the city itself and other nearby communities) was 700,000.\nChi\u0219in\u0103u is the most economically prosperous locality in Moldova and its largest transportation hub. Nearly a third of Moldova's population lives in the metro area.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the city's name is unclear. A theory suggests that the name may come from the archaic Romanian word chi\u0219la (meaning \"spring\", \"source of water\") and nou\u0103 (\"new\"), because it was built around a small spring, at the corner of Pu\u0219kin and Albi\u0219oara streets.The other version, formulated by \u0218tefan Ciobanu, Romanian historian and academician, holds that the name was formed the same way as the name of Chi\u0219ineu (alternative spelling: Chi\u0219in\u0103u) in Western Romania, near the border with Hungary. Its Hungarian name is Kisjen\u0151, from which the Romanian name originates. Kisjen\u0151 comes from kis \"small\" and the Jen\u0151, one of the seven Hungarian tribes that entered the Carpathian Basin in 896. At least 24 other settlements are named after the Jen\u0151 tribe.Chi\u0219in\u0103u is known in Russian as \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0451\u0432 (Kishinj\u00f3v), while Moldova's Russian-language media call it \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044d\u0443, [k\u02b2\u026a\u0282\u0268\u02c8n\u025b\u028a] (Kishineu). It is written Ki\u015fin\u00f6v in the Latin Gagauz alphabet. It was also written as Chi\u0219ineu in pre-20th-century Romanian and as \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044d\u0443 in the Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet. Historically, the English language name for the city, Kishinev, was based on the modified Russian one because it entered the English language via Russian at the time Chi\u0219in\u0103u was part of the Russian Empire (e.g. Kishinev pogrom). Therefore, it remains a common English name in some historical contexts. Otherwise, the Romanian-based Chi\u0219in\u0103u has been steadily gaining wider currency, especially in written language. The city is also historically referred to as German: Kischinau, Polish: Kiszyni\u00f3w, Ukrainian: \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0456\u0432, romanized: Kyshyniv, or Yiddish: \u05e7\u05e2\u05e9\u05e2\u05e0\u05e2\u05f0\u200e, romanized: Keshenev.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Moldavian period ===\nFounded in 1436 as a monastery village, the city was part of the Principality of Moldavia (which, starting with the 16th century became a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire, but still retaining its autonomy). At the beginning of the 19th century Chi\u0219in\u0103u was a small town of 7,000 inhabitants.\nIn 1812, in the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812), the eastern half of Moldavia was ceded to the Russian Empire. The newly acquired territories became known as Bessarabia.\n\n\n=== Russian Imperial period ===\n\nUnder Russian government, Chi\u0219in\u0103u became the capital of the newly annexed oblast (later guberniya) of Bessarabia. By 1834, an imperial townscape with broad and long roads had emerged as a result of a generous development plan, which divided Chi\u0219in\u0103u roughly into two areas: the old part of the town, with its irregular building structures, and a newer city centre and station. Between 26 May 1830 and 13 October 1836 the architect Avraam Melnikov established the Catedrala Na\u0219terea Domnului with a magnificent bell tower. In 1840 the building of the Triumphal arch, planned by the architect Luca Zaushkevich, was completed. Following this the construction of numerous buildings and landmarks began.\nOn 28 August 1871, Chi\u0219in\u0103u was linked by rail with Tiraspol, and in 1873 with Corne\u0219ti. Chi\u0219in\u0103u-Ungheni-Ia\u0219i railway was opened on 1 June 1875 in preparation for the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878). The town played an important part in the war between Russia and Ottoman Empire, as the main staging area of the Russian invasion. During the Belle \u00c9poque, the mayor of the city was Carol Schmidt, considered one of Chisinau's best mayors. Its population had grown to 92,000 by 1862, and to 125,787 by 1900.\n\n\n==== Pogroms and pre-revolution ====\n\nIn the late 19th century, especially due to growing anti-Semitic sentiment in the Russian Empire and better economic conditions in Moldova, many Jews chose to settle in Chi\u0219in\u0103u. By the year 1897, 46% of the population of Chi\u0219in\u0103u was Jewish, over 50,000 people.As part of the pogrom wave organized in the Russian Empire, a large anti-Semitic riot was organized in the town on  19\u201320 April 1903, which would later be known as the Kishinev pogrom. The rioting continued for three days, resulting in 47 Jews dead, 92 severely wounded, and 500 suffering minor injuries. In addition, several hundred houses and many businesses were plundered and destroyed. Some sources say 49 people were killed. The pogroms are largely believed to have been incited by anti-Jewish propaganda in the only official newspaper of the time, Bessarabetz (\u0411\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0446\u044a). Mayor Schmidt disapproved of the incident and resigned later in 1903. The reactions to this incident included a petition to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia on behalf of the American people by US President Theodore Roosevelt in July 1903.On 22 August 1905 another violent event occurred: The police opened fire on an estimated 3,000 demonstrating agricultural workers. Only a few months later, 19\u201320 October 1905, a further protest occurred, helping to force the hand of Nicholas II in bringing about the October Manifesto. However, these demonstrations suddenly turned into another anti-Jewish pogrom, resulting in 19 deaths.\n\n\n=== Romanian period ===\n\nFollowing the Russian October Revolution, Bessarabia declared independence from the crumbling empire, as the Moldavian Democratic Republic, before joining the Kingdom of Romania. As of 1919, Chi\u0219in\u0103u, with an estimated population of 133,000, became the second largest city in Romania.\nBetween 1918 and 1940, the center of the city undertook large renovation work. Romania granted important subsidies to its province and initiated large scale investment programs in the infrastructure of the main cities in Bessarabia, expanded the railroad infrastructure and started an extensive program to eradicate illiteracy.\nIn 1927, the Stephen the Great Monument, by the sculptor Alexandru Pl\u0103m\u0103deal\u0103, was erected. In 1933, the first higher education institution in Bessarabia was established, by transferring the Agricultural Sciences Section of the University of Ia\u0219i to Chi\u0219in\u0103u, as the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nOn 28 June 1940, as a direct result of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, Bessarabia was annexed by the Soviet Union from Romania, and Chi\u0219in\u0103u became the capital of the newly created Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic.\nFollowing the Soviet occupation, mass deportations, linked with atrocities, were executed by the NKVD between June 1940 and June 1941. In Chi\u0219in\u0103u, over 400 people were summarily executed in July 1940 and buried in the grounds of the Metropolitan Palace, the Chi\u0219in\u0103u Theological Institute, and the backyard of the Italian Consulate, where the NKVD had established its headquarters. As part of the policy of political repression of the potential opposition to the Communist power, tens of thousand members of native families were deported from Bessarabia to other regions of the USSR.\nOn 10 November 1940, a devastating earthquake occurred. The epicenter of the quake, which measured 7.4 (or 7.7, according to other sources) on the Richter scale, was in Vrancea Mountains and subsequently led to substantial destruction: 78 deaths and 2,795 affected buildings (of which 172 destroyed).In June 1941, in order to recover Bessarabia, Romania entered World War II under the command of the German Wehrmacht, declaring war to the Soviet Union. In the chaos of the Second World War, Chi\u0219in\u0103u was severely affected. In June\u2013July 1941 the city came under bombardment by Nazi air raids. However, the Romanian and newly Moldovan sources assign most of the responsibility for the damage to Soviet NKVD destruction battalions, that operated in Chi\u0219in\u0103u until 17 July 1941, when it was captured by Axis forces.Following the German and Romanian reoccupation, the city suffered from the Nazi extermination policy of its Jewish inhabitants, who were transported on trucks to the outskirts of the city and then summarily shot in partially dug pits. The number of Jews murdered during the initial occupation of the city is estimated at approximately 10,000 people.As the war drew to a conclusion, the city was once again the scene of heavy fighting as German and Romanian troops retreated. Chi\u0219in\u0103u was captured by the Red Army on 24 August 1944 as a result of the Jassy-Kishinev Operation.\n\n\n=== Soviet period ===\nAfter the war, Bessarabia was fully reintegrated into the Soviet Union, around 65 percent of its territory as the Moldavian SSR, while the remaining 35 percent were transferred to the Ukrainian SSR.\nTwo other waves of deportations of Moldova's native population were carried out by the Soviets, the first one immediately after the Soviet reoccupation of Bessarabia until the end of the 1940s, and the second one in the mid-1950s.In the years 1947 to 1949 the architect Alexey Shchusev developed a plan with the aid of a team of architects for the gradual reconstruction of the city.There was rapid population growth in the 1950s, to which the Soviet administration responded by constructing large-scale housing and palaces in the style of Stalinist architecture. This process continued under Nikita Khrushchev, who called for construction under the slogan \"good, cheaper and built faster\". The new architectural style brought about dramatic change and generated the style that dominates today, with large blocks of flats arranged in considerable settlements. These Khrushchev-era building are often informally called Khrushchyovka.\nThe period of the most significant redevelopment of the city extended from 1971, when the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union adopted a decision \"On the measures for further development of the city of Kishinev\", which secured more than one billion rubles in investment from the state budget, which continued until the independence of Moldova in 1991. The share of dwellings built during the Soviet period (1951\u20131990) represents 74.3 percent of total households.On 4 March 1977, the city was again jolted by a devastating earthquake. Several people were killed and panic broke out.\n\n\n=== After independence ===\nMany streets of Chi\u0219in\u0103u are named after historic persons, places or events. Independence from the Soviet Union was followed by a large-scale renaming of streets and localities from a Communist theme into a national one.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nChi\u0219in\u0103u is located on the river B\u00e2c, a tributary of the Dniester, at 47\u00b00\u2032N 28\u00b055\u2032E, with an area of 120 km2 (46 sq mi). The municipality comprises 635 km2 (245 sq mi).\nThe city lies in central Moldova and is surrounded by a relatively level landscape with very fertile ground.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nChi\u0219in\u0103u has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfa) characterised by warm summers and cool, windy winters. Winter minimum temperatures are often below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F), although they rarely drop below \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F). In summer, the average maximum temperature is approximately 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), however, temperatures occasionally reach 35 to 40 \u00b0C (95 to 104 \u00b0F) in mid-summer in downtown. Although average precipitation and humidity during summer is relatively low, there are infrequent yet heavy storms.\nSpring and autumn temperatures vary between 16 to 24 \u00b0C (61 to 75 \u00b0F), and precipitation during this time tends to be lower than in summer but with more frequent yet milder periods of rain.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== Municipality ===\nMoldova is administratively subdivided into 3 municipalities, 32 districts, and 2 autonomous units. With a population of 662,836 inhabitants (as of 2014), the Municipality of Chi\u0219in\u0103u (which includes the nearby communities) is the largest of these municipalities.Besides the city itself, the municipality comprises 34 other suburban localities: 6 towns (containing further 2 villages within), and 12 communes (containing further 14 villages within). The population, as of 2014 census, is shown in brackets:\n\n\n==== Cities/towns ====\n\n\n==== Communes ====\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nChi\u0219in\u0103u is governed by the City Council and the City Mayor (Romanian: Primar), both elected once every four years.\nHis predecessor was Serafim Urechean. Under the Moldovan constitution, Urechean \u2014 elected to parliament in 2005 \u2014 was unable to hold an additional post to that of an MP. The Democratic Moldova Bloc leader subsequently accepted his mandate and in April resigned from his former position. During his 11-year term, Urechean committed himself to the restoration of the church tower of the Catedrala Na\u0219terea Domnului and improvements in public transport.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\nThe municipality in its totality elects a mayor and a local council, which then name five pretors, one for each sector.

Chi\u0219in\u0103u has the largest and most developed mass media sector in Moldova, and is home to several related companies ranging from leading television networks and radio stations to major newspapers.  All national and international banks (15) have their headquarters located in Chi\u0219in\u0103u.\nNotable sites around Chi\u0219in\u0103u include the cinema Patria, the new malls Malldova, Megapolis Mall and best-known retailers, such as N1, Fidesco, Green Hills, Fourchette and Metro. While many locals continue to shop at the bazaars, many upper class residents and tourists shop at the retail stores and at Malldova. El\u0103t, an older mall in the Botanica district, and Sun City, in the center, are more popular with locals.\nSeveral amusement parks exist around the city. A Soviet era one is located in the Botanica district, along the three lakes of a major park, which reaches the outskirts of the city center. Another, the modern Aventura Park, is located farther from the center. A circus, which used to be in a grand building in the R\u00e2\u0219cani sector, has been inactive for several years due to a poorly funded renovation project.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the results of the last Moldovan census, conducted in May 2014, 532,513 inhabitants live within the Chi\u0219in\u0103u city limits.

In 1836 the construction of the Kishinev Cathedral and its belfry was finished. The belfry was demolished in Soviet times and was rebuilt in 1997. Chi\u0219in\u0103u also displays a tremendous number of orthodox churches and 19th-century buildings around the city such as Ciuflea Monastery or the Transfiguration Church. Much of the city is made from limestone dug from Cricova, leaving a famous wine cellar there.\nMany modern-style buildings have been built in the city since 1991. There are many office and shopping complexes that are modern, renovated or newly built, including Kentford, SkyTower, and Uni\u00f3n Fenosa headquarters.

It is dedicated to Saint Theodore of Amasea.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe monastery was financed by Anastasie Ciufli (1801 - 1870) to respect the last will of his brother Teodor Ciufli (1796 - 1854).\nThe two brothers were Aromanian merchants who emigrated from Macedonia to Bessarabia in 1821.\nAnastasie was authorised to start the construction of the church for his brother in 1854, it was finally consecrated on June 6, 1858. Teodor's remains were placed in the south wing of the building, his brother eventually joined him in their final resting place after his own death 11 years later.\nIn 1962, many churches of the Moldavian SSR were closed or their purpose changed. The main church of Chi\u0219in\u0103u, the Nativity Cathedral suffered the same fate by being transformed into an exhibition building. Thus the head of Moldova Church had to be moved to the then monastery of Ciuflea, which was granted of the status of cathedral and renamed according to its benefactor. In 2002, about a decade after the breakup of the Soviet Union, it became a monastery.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nStarostenco, Petru (2009).

        "wiki": "Frank Uwe Laysiepen (German: [f\u0281a\u014bk \u02c8u\u02d0v\u0259 la\u026a\u02c8zi\u02d0pn\u0329]; November 30, 1943 \u2013 March 2, 2020), known professionally as Ulay, was a German artist based in Amsterdam and Ljubljana, who received international recognition for his Polaroid art and collaborative performance art with longtime companion Marina Abramovi\u0107.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nIn the early 1970s, struggling with his sense of \"Germanness,\" Ulay moved to Amsterdam, where he began experimenting with the medium of Polaroid. Renais sense (1974), a series of self-reflective and autobiographical collages, depicted overt visual representations of a constructed gender that were considered scandalous at the time.\n\n\n== Works with Marina Abramovi\u0107 ==\n\nIn 1975, Laysiepen, who went by the single name Ulay, met the Serbian performance artist Marina Abramovi\u0107. They began living and performing together that year. When Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay began their collaboration, the main concepts they explored were the Ego and artistic identity. They created \"relation works\" characterized by constant movement, change, process and \"art vital\". The couple expressed their commitment in their Relation Works (1976\u20131988) manifesto: \u2018Art Vital: No fixed living place, permanent movement, direct contact, local relation, self-selection, passing limitations, taking risks, mobile energy.\u2019\nThis was the beginning of a decade of influential collaborative work. Each performer was interested in the traditions of their cultural heritage and the individual's desire for ritual. Consequently, they decided to form a collective being called \"The Other\", and spoke of themselves as parts of a \"two-headed body\". They dressed and behaved like twins and created a relationship of complete trust. As they defined this phantom identity, their individual identities became less accessible. In an analysis of phantom artistic identities, Charles Green has noted that this allowed a deeper understanding of the artist as performer, for it revealed a way of \"having the artistic self-made available for self-scrutiny\".The work of Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay tested the physical limits of the body and explored male and female principles, psychic energy, transcendental meditation and nonverbal communication. While some critics have explored the idea of a hermaphroditic state of being as a feminist statement, Abramovi\u0107 herself denies considering this as a conscious concept. Her body studies, she insists, have always been concerned primarily with the body as the unit of an individual, a tendency she traces to her parents' military pasts. Rather than concerning themselves with gender ideologies, Abramovi\u0107/Ulay explored extreme states of consciousness and their relationship to architectural space. They devised a series of works in which their bodies created additional spaces for audience interaction. In discussing this phase of her performance history, she has said: \"The main problem in this relationship was what to do with the two artists' egos. I had to find out how to put my ego down, as did he, to create something like a hermaphroditic state of being that we called the death self.\"\nIn Relation in Space (1976) they ran into each other repeatedly for an hour \u2013 mixing male and female energy into the third component called \"that self\".\nRelation in Movement (1977) had the pair driving their car inside of a museum for 365 laps; a black liquid oozed from the car, forming a kind of sculpture, each lap representing a day. (After 365 laps the idea was that they entered the New Millennium.)\nIn Relation in Time (1977) they sat back to back, tied together by their ponytails for sixteen hours. They then allowed the public to enter the room to see if they could use the energy of the public to push their limits even further.\nTo create Breathing In/Breathing Out the two artists devised a piece in which they connected their mouths and took in each other's exhaled breaths until they had used up all of the available oxygen. Seventeen minutes after the beginning of the performance they both fell to the floor unconscious, their lungs having filled with carbon dioxide.\nIn Imponderabilia (1977, reenacted in 2010) two performers, both completely nude, stand in a doorway. The public must squeeze between them in order to pass, and in doing so choose which one of them to face.\nIn AAA-AAA (1978) the two artists stood opposite each other and made long sounds with their mouths open. They gradually moved closer and closer, until they were eventually yelling directly into each other's mouths. This piece demonstrated their interest in endurance and duration.\nIn 1980, they performed Rest Energy, in an art exhibition in Dublin, where both balanced each other on opposite sides of a drawn bow and arrow, with the arrow pointed at Abramovi\u0107's heart. With almost no effort, Ulay could easily kill Abramovi\u0107 with one finger. This seems to symbolize the dominance of men and what kind of upper hand they have in society over women. In addition, the handle of the bow is held by Abramovi\u0107 and is pointed at herself. The handle of the bow is the most significant part of a bow. This would be a whole different piece if it were a Ulay aiming a bow at an Abramovi\u0107, but by having her hold the bow, it is almost as if the she is supporting him while taking her own life.Between 1981 and 1987, the pair performed Nightsea Crossing in twenty-two performances. They sat silently across from each other in chairs for seven hours a day.In 1988, after several years of tense relations, Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay decided to make a spiritual journey which would end their relationship. They each walked the Great Wall of China, in a piece called Lovers, starting from the two opposite ends and meeting in the middle. As Abramovi\u0107 described it: \"That walk became a complete personal drama. Ulay started from the Gobi Desert and I from the Yellow Sea. After each of us walked 2500 km, we met in the middle and said good-bye.\" She has said that she conceived this walk in a dream, and it provided what she thought was an appropriate, romantic ending to a relationship full of mysticism, energy, and attraction. She later described the process: \"We needed a certain form of ending, after this huge distance walking towards each other. It is very human. It is in a way more dramatic, more like a film ending ... Because in the end, you are really alone, whatever you do.\" She reported that during her walk she was reinterpreting her connection to the physical world and to nature. She felt that the metals in the ground influenced her mood and state of being; she also pondered the Chinese myths in which the Great Wall has been described as a \"dragon of energy.\" It took the couple eight years to acquire permission from the government of the People's Republic of China to perform the work, by the time of which their relationship had completely dissolved.\nAt her 2010 MoMA retrospective, Abramovi\u0107 performed The Artist Is Present, in which she shared a period of silence with each stranger who sat in front of her. Although \"they met and talked the morning of the opening\", Abramovi\u0107 had a deeply emotional reaction to Ulay when he arrived at her performance, reaching out to him across the table between them; the video of the event went viral.In November 2015, Ulay took Abramovi\u0107 to court, claiming she had paid him insufficient royalties according to the terms of a 1999 contract covering sales of their joint works. In September 2016, a Dutch court ordered Abramovi\u0107 to pay \u20ac250,000 to Ulay as his share of sales of artistic collaborations over their joint works. In its ruling, the court in Amsterdam found that Ulay was entitled to royalties of 20% net on the sales of their works, as specified in the original 1999 contract, and ordered Abramovi\u0107 to backdate royalties of more than \u20ac250,000, as well as more than \u20ac23,000 in legal costs. Additionally, she was ordered to provide full accreditation to joint works listed as by \"Ulay/Abramovi\u0107\" covering the period from 1976 to 1980, and \"Abramovi\u0107/Ulay\" for those from 1981 to 1988.\n\n\n== Later works ==\nUlay experimented extensively with incorporating audience participation into his performance art. His installations Can\u2019t Beat the Feeling: Long Playing Record (1991\u20131992) and Bread and Butter (1993) were openly critical of European Union expansion. In the Berlin Afterimages \u2013 EU Flags series, he exploited the phenomenon of retinal afterimages to depict reversed images of EU member nation flags. He produced The Delusion: An Event about Art and Psychiatry (2002) on the grounds of the Vincent van Gogh Psychiatric Institute in Venray, the Netherlands. Other projects that incorporated audience participation include Luxembourg Portraits and A Monument for the Future.Rendering reality as accurately as possible was the focus of Cursive and Radicals (2000), Johnny\u2013The Ontological in the Photographic Image (2004), and WE Emerge (2004), the last realized in collaboration with AoRTa art centre in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, Republic of Moldova.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFrom 1976 to 1988 Ulay was in a relationship with Marina Abramovi\u0107, with whom he collaborated on a number of pieces of performance art.\nIn 2013, director Damjan Kozole released the documentary Project Cancer: Ulay's journal from November to November about the artist's life, work and 2011 cancer diagnosis. The film follows Ulay's treatments, meetings with friends and travels, as well as his ongoing practice. He recovered from the lymphatic cancer in 2014.He died on March 2, 2020 in Ljubljana, Slovenia, aged 76.\n\n\n== Prizes and awards ==\n1984: The San Sebastian Video Award\n1985: The Lucano Video Award\n1986: The Polaroid Video Award\n1986: Video Award \u2013 Kulturkreis im Verband der Deutschen Industrie\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nModus Vivendi.

          "Beautiful building, well restored, right in the heart of the city. Could have been a better experience, but most of the paintings are no-name Moldavian artists with no connection to the international scene... Also, in the grand hall at the second floor, 3 male employees were",
          "This was hands down my favorite visit in chisinau. The exterior and interior are both absolutely gorgeous, perfect for artsy photographs. I was also impressed by both the permanent collection and the temporary exhibits of art they had in the musuem. It is a rather large place so",
          "You'll notice immediately that the building is gorgeous. The interior, too, is lovely, especially the intricate staircases. The exhibits are well displayed and span a wide expanse of eras and styles, the staff are warm and welcoming, and the admission price is low. It's a",
          "Interesting artworks and stunning architecture - the staircase is a marvel in itself. I loved the grand hall, although it was a bit hard to find :-)",
          "What a building - only managed to see the stairwell on my last visit as it was being renovated but this time, saw it in all its glory. Quite an eclectic range of exhibits - some mesmerising sculptures and some eye catching pictures. Very quiet, few visitors and perfect to just",
          "Apparently, the Romanian government popped out a million euros to help get this completed and boy is it worth it. Fantastic variety of art on display (some images below). One of the key things about an art gallery is the shape of the rooms, the floors, ceilings, the positioning",
          "It was an interesting building which is probably worth exploring. Unfortunately, they were closed when we visited so cannot comment on the quality of art.",
          "Very small museum. They have sculptures, poster exhibitions, icons, masks, rugs to hang on the wall etc. Some paintings too... It would have been nice to see more Moldavian artists.",

          "Another must see in Chisinau! The museum features local and international paintings, sculptures, and other works. The exterior and interior are amazing! The tariff is 10 lei with an additional 10 lei for photos and videos.",

          "Great selection of local art. Interesting modern art pieces. The building is stunning inside ;) 10 lei entrance fee, and small additional fee if you Want to take photos.",
          "The is a charge for entry - 5MDL for seniors/students and 10MDL for others. Most of the original collection \"disappeared\" during the war and has never been found, as so they have started again. The current collection is interesting with a good selection of old and very modern",
          "Unexpected collection of art that really impressed my wife who is an art teacher. Spent somtime there in a very nice building. The stakk was extra friendly and helpful. One of the security guards helped us find a taxi by taking to a stop 2 blocks away.",

          "With scarcity of venues to visit here, this really is a must visit site if you like beautifully restored majestic buildings, housing an excellent collection of local art. The staff were very professional, though seeming to follow most guests into rooms ... which for some may be",
          "The collection is not huge but for only 10lei (another 15 for photos) you probably won't mind. If you like art, you'll probably be very satisfied. There is a range of styles/techniques and I loved that the sculptures in one room are laid out in a way that you sort of walk among",
          "This museum has a wonderful collection of paintings. It's interesting to see the beauty of the Moldovan women from the 19th century through the eyes of the artists. A little European collection was also on exhibit. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Chisinau.",
          "We have visited Chisinau many times before but never been to this museum until now. The building has been renovated over the last few years to a very high standard. So even if you're not interested in art we would recommend a visit. It is open most days from 10am to 6pm. We went",
          "One large hall of Western art on the second floor on the left is Dutch landscapes, academic sculpture and painting of France and Germany and others. On the first floor there is an exhibition of art nouveau and accompanying styles of Moldova from the beginning of the last",
          "I myself is not a huge fan of arts, but I always go to the national gallery, because I like to educate myself. Permanent collection is quite cool, but mostly anonymous authors. For a symbolic price you can by photo permit, I suggest you do so, because there will most definitely",
          "Perhaps it was luck but, in addition to the permanent collection, which is good, we were so fortunate to see the impressive retrospective exhibition of works by Lica Sainciuc - a fascinating Moldavian artist",

          "If you are interested in clocks then there is an exhibition for you , the artwork is good but to me it was disappointing with limited information in English. I noted that on the outside entrance it stated that entry was free but to get inside you pay 20 MDL (a pound) to view the",
          "I'm more than sure that you are not so familiar with Moldovan art (painting as well as sculpture or ceramics) but there are very interesting works to be discovered and you will enjoy for sure.",

          "Great museum some beautiful pieces on display a lot of Moldovan and Russian art which I've never seen before. The building itself is beautiful full of white marble and air conditioned so makes for a nice hour or two out of the heat!",
          "This museum blew me away. They renovated it and it was reopened in November. The renovations are very impressive. And the quality of the art is outstanding. You can expect to see this kind of art at the Louvre. Frankly, it is a MUST-SEE for everyone. For art lovers, it is a",
          "For most of Moldova's history it has been somebody else's province and not seen as a nation at all - and this is reflected in the museum. There are few, if any, works here of note, though there are some moderately interesting pieces and there was an exhibition of a modern",
          "With the remodeling work, sponsored by Romania, this has turned into a very adequate art museum. Dropped by recently for the first time in a couple of years and was very pleased",

In this deed the holy abode was referred to as \"m\u0103n\u0103stirea de la V\u00e2\u0219nov\u0103\u021b unde este egumen Chiprian\" (the monastery of V\u00e2\u0219nov\u0103\u021b where the hegumen is Chiprian) and was given in the possession of Alexander's wife - princess Marena.\nAfter a period of decay, the monastery was rebuilt at the behest of Petru Rare\u0219, from 1542 to 1545.\n\n\n== Churches ==\nThere are three churches on the monastery site. The Church of the Dormition (a stone summer church) is the oldest extant church in Moldova. The winter church of St George is a twentieth century building. The nineteenth century church is dedicated to St Nicholas. The Church of the Dormition contains the tomb of Metropolitan Gavril B\u0103nulescu-Bodoni.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVirtual tour, Visit.md\nCapriana, Monasteries of Moldova\n\"M\u0103n\u0103stirea C\u0103priana\", at molddata.md\nTudor Cires and Simona Lazar, \"Tovar\u0103\u015fe p\u0103rinte, evacua\u0163i m\u0103n\u0103stirea!\", Jurnalul Na\u0163ional, June 30, 2007, accessed December 20, 2007\n\"Panoramas of C\u0103priana monastery\", at panorama.md\n\"HDR Photos of C\u0103priana monastery\"",

        "wiki": "Bern [b\u025brn] (listen) (Alemannic German: B\u00e4rn [b\u0325\u00e6\u02d0rn]; French: Berne [b\u025b\u0281n] (listen); Italian: Berna [\u02c8b\u025brna]; Romansh: Berna [\u02c8b\u025brn\u0250] (listen)) is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their \"federal city\", in German: Bundesstadt, French: ville f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, and Italian: citt\u00e0 federale. With a population of about 144,000 (as of 2020), Bern is the fifth-most populous city in Switzerland. The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014. The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000. Bern is also the capital of the canton of Bern, the second-most populous of Switzerland's cantons.\nThe official language in Bern is the Swiss variety of Standard German, but the most-spoken language is an Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Bernese German.\nIn 1983, the historic old town (in German: Altstadt) in the centre of Bern became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe etymology of the name \"Bern\" is uncertain. According to the local legend, based on folk etymology, Berchtold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen, the founder of the city of Bern, vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt, and this turned out to be a bear. It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona, which at the time was known as Bern in Middle High German. The city was sometimes referred to as Bern im \u00dcechtland to distinguish it from Verona. As a result of the finding of the Bern zinc tablet in the 1980s, it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin, possibly *berna \"cleft\". The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of Bern from at least the 1220s. The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the B\u00e4rengraben dates to the 1440s.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nNo archaeological evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today\u2032s city centre prior to the 12th century has been found so far. In antiquity, a Celtic oppidum stood on the Engehalbinsel (peninsula) north of Bern, fortified since the second century BC (late La T\u00e8ne period), thought to be one of the 12 oppida of the Helvetii mentioned by Caesar. During the Roman era, a Gallo-Roman vicus was on the same site. The Bern zinc tablet has the name Brenodor (\"dwelling of Breno\"). In the Early Middle Ages, a settlement in B\u00fcmpliz, now a city district of Bern, was some 4 km (2 mi) from the medieval city.\nThe medieval city is a foundation of the Z\u00e4hringer ruling family, which rose to power in Upper Burgundy in the 12th century. According to 14th-century historiography (Cronica de Berno, 1309), Bern was founded in 1191 by Berthold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen.\nIn 1218, after Berthold died without an heir, Bern was made a free imperial city by the Goldene Handfeste of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II.\n\n\n=== Old Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nIn 1353, Bern joined the Swiss Confederacy, becoming one of the eight cantons of the formative period of 1353 to 1481.\nBern invaded and conquered Aargau in 1415 and Vaud in 1536, as well as other smaller territories, thereby becoming the largest city-state north of the Alps; by the 18th century, it comprised most of what is today the canton of Bern and the canton of Vaud.\nThe city grew out towards the west of the boundaries of the peninsula formed by the river Aare. The Zytglogge tower marked the western boundary of the city from 1191 until 1256, when the K\u00e4figturm took over this role until 1345. It was, in turn, succeeded by the Christoffelturm (formerly located close to the site of the modern-day railway station) until 1622. During the time of the Thirty Years' War, two new fortifications \u2013 the so-called big and small Schanze (entrenchment) \u2013 were built to protect the whole area of the peninsula.\nAfter a major blaze in 1405, the city's original wooden buildings were gradually replaced by half-timbered houses and subsequently the sandstone buildings which came to be characteristic for the Old Town. Despite the waves of pestilence that hit Europe in the 14th century, the city continued to grow, mainly due to immigration from the surrounding countryside.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nBern was occupied by French troops in 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars, when it was stripped of parts of its territories. It regained control of the Bernese Oberland in 1802, and following the Congress of Vienna of 1814, it newly acquired the Bernese Jura. At this time, it once again became the largest canton of the Confederacy as it stood during the Restoration and until the secession of the canton of Jura in 1979.\nBern was made the Federal City (seat of the Federal Assembly) within the new Swiss federal state in 1848.\nA number of congresses of the socialist First and Second Internationals were held in Bern, particularly during World War I when Switzerland was neutral; see Bern International.\nThe city's population rose from about 5,000 in the 15th century to about 12,000 by 1800 and to above 60,000 by 1900, passing the 100,000 mark during the 1920s.\nPopulation peaked during the 1960s at 165,000 and has since decreased slightly, to below 130,000 by 2000.\nAs of September 2017, the resident population stood at 142,349, of which 100,000 were Swiss citizens and 42,349 (31%) resident foreigners. A further estimated 350,000 people live in the immediate urban agglomeration.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBern lies on the Swiss plateau in the canton of Bern, slightly west of the centre of Switzerland and 20 km (12 mi) north of the Bernese Alps. The countryside around Bern was formed by glaciers during the most recent ice age. The two mountains closest to Bern are Gurten with a height of 864 m (2,835 ft) and Bantiger with a height of 947 m (3,107 ft). The site of the old observatory in Bern is the point of origin of the CH1903 coordinate system at 46\u00b057\u203208.66\u2033N 7\u00b026\u203222.50\u2033E.\nThe city was originally built on a hilly peninsula surrounded by the river Aare, but outgrew natural boundaries by the 19th century. A number of bridges have been built to allow the city to expand beyond the Aare.\nBern is built on very uneven ground. An elevation difference of up to 60 metres exists between the inner city districts on the Aare (Matte, Marzili) and the higher ones (Kirchenfeld, L\u00e4nggasse).\nBern has an area, as of 2013, of 51.62 km2 (19.93 sq mi). Of this area, 9.42 km2 (3.64 sq mi) or 18.2% is used for agricultural purposes, while 17.21 km2 (6.64 sq mi) or 33.3% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 23.76 km2 (9.17 sq mi) or 46.0% is settled (buildings or roads), 1.08 km2 (0.42 sq mi) or 2.1% is either rivers or lakes, and 0.14 km2 (0.054 sq mi) or 0.3% is unproductive land.Of the developed area of Bern, 3.1% consists of industrial buildings, 22.3% housing and other buildings, and 12.9% is devoted to transport infrastructure. Power and water infrastructure, as well as other special developed areas, made up 1.2% of the city, while another 6.5% consists of parks, green belts, and sports fields.\nOf Bern's total land area, 32.8% is heavily forested. Of the agricultural land, 13.3% is used for growing crops and 4.4% is designated to be used as pasture. Local rivers and streams provide all the water in the municipality.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification, Bern has a humid continental climate (Dfb) closely bordering on an oceanic climate (Cfb).\nThe closest weather station near Bern is located in the municipality of Zollikofen, about 5 kilometres (3 mi) north of the city centre. The warmest month for Bern is July, with a daily mean temperature of 18.3 \u00b0C (64.9 \u00b0F), and a daily maximum temperature of 24.3 \u00b0C (75.7 \u00b0F). The highest temperature recorded at Bern / Zollikofen is 37.0 \u00b0C (98.6 \u00b0F), recorded in August 2003. On average, a temperature of 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) or above is recorded 40.7 days per year, and 6 days per year with a temperature of 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) or above at Zollikofen, and the warmest day reaches an average of 32.1 \u00b0C (89.8 \u00b0F).There are 103.7 days of air frost, and 22.3 ice days per year at Bern (Zollikofen) for the period of 1981\u20132010, as well as 14.1 days of snowfall, 36.7 days of snow cover per year and the average amount of snow measured per year is 52.6 centimetres (20.7 in). On average, January is the coldest month, with a daily mean temperature of \u22120.4 \u00b0C (31.3 \u00b0F), and a daily minimum temperature of \u22123.6 \u00b0C (25.5 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature ever recorded at Bern (Zollikofen) was \u221223.0 \u00b0C (\u22129.4 \u00b0F), recorded in February 1929, and typically the coldest temperature of the year reaches an average of \u221212.8 \u00b0C (9.0 \u00b0F) for the period of 1981\u20132010.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nThe municipality is administratively subdivided into six districts (Stadtteile), each of which consists of several quarters (Quartiere).\n\n\n=== Government ===\n\nThe Municipal Council (de: Gemeinderat, fr: conseil municipal) constitutes the executive government of the City of Bern and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of five councillors (German: Gemeinderat/-r\u00e4tin, French: conseiller/conseill\u00e8re municipal(e)), each presiding over a directorate (de: Direktion, fr: direction) comprising several departments and bureaus. The president of the executive department acts as mayor (de: Stadtpr\u00e4sident, fr: Le Maire). In the mandate period 2017\u20132020 (Legislatur) the Municipal Council is presided by Stadtpr\u00e4sident Alec von Graffenried. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the City Council are carried by the Municipal Council. The regular election of the Municipal Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. Any resident of Bern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council.

Kishinj\u00f3v [k\u02b2\u026a\u0282\u0268\u02c8n\u02b2\u0275f]), is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Moldova. The city is Moldova's main industrial and commercial center, and is located in the middle of the country, on the river B\u00e2c, a tributary of the Dniester. According to the results of the 2014 census, the city proper had a population of 532,513, while the population of the Municipality of Chi\u0219in\u0103u (which includes the city itself and other nearby communities) was 700,000.\nChi\u0219in\u0103u is the most economically prosperous locality in Moldova and its largest transportation hub. Nearly a third of Moldova's population lives in the metro area.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the city's name is unclear. A theory suggests that the name may come from the archaic Romanian word chi\u0219la (meaning \"spring\", \"source of water\") and nou\u0103 (\"new\"), because it was built around a small spring, at the corner of Pu\u0219kin and Albi\u0219oara streets.The other version, formulated by \u0218tefan Ciobanu, Romanian historian and academician, holds that the name was formed the same way as the name of Chi\u0219ineu (alternative spelling: Chi\u0219in\u0103u) in Western Romania, near the border with Hungary. Its Hungarian name is Kisjen\u0151, from which the Romanian name originates. Kisjen\u0151 comes from kis \"small\" and the Jen\u0151, one of the seven Hungarian tribes that entered the Carpathian Basin in 896. At least 24 other settlements are named after the Jen\u0151 tribe.Chi\u0219in\u0103u is known in Russian as \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0451\u0432 (Kishinj\u00f3v), while Moldova's Russian-language media call it \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044d\u0443, [k\u02b2\u026a\u0282\u0268\u02c8n\u025b\u028a] (Kishineu). It is written Ki\u015fin\u00f6v in the Latin Gagauz alphabet. It was also written as Chi\u0219ineu in pre-20th-century Romanian and as \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044d\u0443 in the Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet. Historically, the English language name for the city, Kishinev, was based on the modified Russian one because it entered the English language via Russian at the time Chi\u0219in\u0103u was part of the Russian Empire (e.g. Kishinev pogrom). Therefore, it remains a common English name in some historical contexts. Otherwise, the Romanian-based Chi\u0219in\u0103u has been steadily gaining wider currency, especially in written language. The city is also historically referred to as German: Kischinau, Polish: Kiszyni\u00f3w, Ukrainian: \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0456\u0432, romanized: Kyshyniv, or Yiddish: \u05e7\u05e2\u05e9\u05e2\u05e0\u05e2\u05f0\u200e, romanized: Keshenev.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Moldavian period ===\nFounded in 1436 as a monastery village, the city was part of the Principality of Moldavia (which, starting with the 16th century became a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire, but still retaining its autonomy). At the beginning of the 19th century Chi\u0219in\u0103u was a small town of 7,000 inhabitants.\nIn 1812, in the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812), the eastern half of Moldavia was ceded to the Russian Empire. The newly acquired territories became known as Bessarabia.\n\n\n=== Russian Imperial period ===\n\nUnder Russian government, Chi\u0219in\u0103u became the capital of the newly annexed oblast (later guberniya) of Bessarabia. By 1834, an imperial townscape with broad and long roads had emerged as a result of a generous development plan, which divided Chi\u0219in\u0103u roughly into two areas: the old part of the town, with its irregular building structures, and a newer city centre and station. Between 26 May 1830 and 13 October 1836 the architect Avraam Melnikov established the Catedrala Na\u0219terea Domnului with a magnificent bell tower. In 1840 the building of the Triumphal arch, planned by the architect Luca Zaushkevich, was completed. Following this the construction of numerous buildings and landmarks began.\nOn 28 August 1871, Chi\u0219in\u0103u was linked by rail with Tiraspol, and in 1873 with Corne\u0219ti. Chi\u0219in\u0103u-Ungheni-Ia\u0219i railway was opened on 1 June 1875 in preparation for the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878). The town played an important part in the war between Russia and Ottoman Empire, as the main staging area of the Russian invasion. During the Belle \u00c9poque, the mayor of the city was Carol Schmidt, considered one of Chisinau's best mayors. Its population had grown to 92,000 by 1862, and to 125,787 by 1900.\n\n\n==== Pogroms and pre-revolution ====\n\nIn the late 19th century, especially due to growing anti-Semitic sentiment in the Russian Empire and better economic conditions in Moldova, many Jews chose to settle in Chi\u0219in\u0103u. By the year 1897, 46% of the population of Chi\u0219in\u0103u was Jewish, over 50,000 people.As part of the pogrom wave organized in the Russian Empire, a large anti-Semitic riot was organized in the town on  19\u201320 April 1903, which would later be known as the Kishinev pogrom. The rioting continued for three days, resulting in 47 Jews dead, 92 severely wounded, and 500 suffering minor injuries. In addition, several hundred houses and many businesses were plundered and destroyed. Some sources say 49 people were killed. The pogroms are largely believed to have been incited by anti-Jewish propaganda in the only official newspaper of the time, Bessarabetz (\u0411\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0446\u044a). Mayor Schmidt disapproved of the incident and resigned later in 1903. The reactions to this incident included a petition to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia on behalf of the American people by US President Theodore Roosevelt in July 1903.On 22 August 1905 another violent event occurred: The police opened fire on an estimated 3,000 demonstrating agricultural workers. Only a few months later, 19\u201320 October 1905, a further protest occurred, helping to force the hand of Nicholas II in bringing about the October Manifesto. However, these demonstrations suddenly turned into another anti-Jewish pogrom, resulting in 19 deaths.\n\n\n=== Romanian period ===\n\nFollowing the Russian October Revolution, Bessarabia declared independence from the crumbling empire, as the Moldavian Democratic Republic, before joining the Kingdom of Romania. As of 1919, Chi\u0219in\u0103u, with an estimated population of 133,000, became the second largest city in Romania.\nBetween 1918 and 1940, the center of the city undertook large renovation work. Romania granted important subsidies to its province and initiated large scale investment programs in the infrastructure of the main cities in Bessarabia, expanded the railroad infrastructure and started an extensive program to eradicate illiteracy.\nIn 1927, the Stephen the Great Monument, by the sculptor Alexandru Pl\u0103m\u0103deal\u0103, was erected. In 1933, the first higher education institution in Bessarabia was established, by transferring the Agricultural Sciences Section of the University of Ia\u0219i to Chi\u0219in\u0103u, as the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nOn 28 June 1940, as a direct result of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, Bessarabia was annexed by the Soviet Union from Romania, and Chi\u0219in\u0103u became the capital of the newly created Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic.\nFollowing the Soviet occupation, mass deportations, linked with atrocities, were executed by the NKVD between June 1940 and June 1941. In Chi\u0219in\u0103u, over 400 people were summarily executed in July 1940 and buried in the grounds of the Metropolitan Palace, the Chi\u0219in\u0103u Theological Institute, and the backyard of the Italian Consulate, where the NKVD had established its headquarters. As part of the policy of political repression of the potential opposition to the Communist power, tens of thousand members of native families were deported from Bessarabia to other regions of the USSR.\nOn 10 November 1940, a devastating earthquake occurred. The epicenter of the quake, which measured 7.4 (or 7.7, according to other sources) on the Richter scale, was in Vrancea Mountains and subsequently led to substantial destruction: 78 deaths and 2,795 affected buildings (of which 172 destroyed).In June 1941, in order to recover Bessarabia, Romania entered World War II under the command of the German Wehrmacht, declaring war to the Soviet Union. In the chaos of the Second World War, Chi\u0219in\u0103u was severely affected. In June\u2013July 1941 the city came under bombardment by Nazi air raids. However, the Romanian and newly Moldovan sources assign most of the responsibility for the damage to Soviet NKVD destruction battalions, that operated in Chi\u0219in\u0103u until 17 July 1941, when it was captured by Axis forces.Following the German and Romanian reoccupation, the city suffered from the Nazi extermination policy of its Jewish inhabitants, who were transported on trucks to the outskirts of the city and then summarily shot in partially dug pits. The number of Jews murdered during the initial occupation of the city is estimated at approximately 10,000 people.As the war drew to a conclusion, the city was once again the scene of heavy fighting as German and Romanian troops retreated. Chi\u0219in\u0103u was captured by the Red Army on 24 August 1944 as a result of the Jassy-Kishinev Operation.\n\n\n=== Soviet period ===\nAfter the war, Bessarabia was fully reintegrated into the Soviet Union, around 65 percent of its territory as the Moldavian SSR, while the remaining 35 percent were transferred to the Ukrainian SSR.\nTwo other waves of deportations of Moldova's native population were carried out by the Soviets, the first one immediately after the Soviet reoccupation of Bessarabia until the end of the 1940s, and the second one in the mid-1950s.In the years 1947 to 1949 the architect Alexey Shchusev developed a plan with the aid of a team of architects for the gradual reconstruction of the city.There was rapid population growth in the 1950s, to which the Soviet administration responded by constructing large-scale housing and palaces in the style of Stalinist architecture. This process continued under Nikita Khrushchev, who called for construction under the slogan \"good, cheaper and built faster\". The new architectural style brought about dramatic change and generated the style that dominates today, with large blocks of flats arranged in considerable settlements. These Khrushchev-era building are often informally called Khrushchyovka.\nThe period of the most significant redevelopment of the city extended from 1971, when the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union adopted a decision \"On the measures for further development of the city of Kishinev\", which secured more than one billion rubles in investment from the state budget, which continued until the independence of Moldova in 1991. The share of dwellings built during the Soviet period (1951\u20131990) represents 74.3 percent of total households.On 4 March 1977, the city was again jolted by a devastating earthquake. Several people were killed and panic broke out.\n\n\n=== After independence ===\nMany streets of Chi\u0219in\u0103u are named after historic persons, places or events. Independence from the Soviet Union was followed by a large-scale renaming of streets and localities from a Communist theme into a national one.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nChi\u0219in\u0103u is located on the river B\u00e2c, a tributary of the Dniester, at 47\u00b00\u2032N 28\u00b055\u2032E, with an area of 120 km2 (46 sq mi).

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Parliament of the Republic of Moldova is the supreme representative body of the Republic of Moldova, the only state legislative authority, being a unicameral structure composed of 101 elected deputies on lists, for a period of 4 years. Parliament is elected by universal vote, equal directly, secret and freely expressed. The President of the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova is elected by the Parliament, with a minimum of 52 votes. Nowadays this function is fulfilled by Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova leader Zinaida Grecean\u00eei.\nThe Constitutional Court of the Republic of Moldova, on a proposal of the Central Electoral Commission, decides to validate or invalidate the mandate of deputy. The mandate is invalid in the case of violation of electoral legislation. The Parliament is meeting at the convening of the Speaker of the Parliament within 30 days of the elections. Parliament's mandate is prolonged until the legal meeting of the new composition. During this period the Constitution cannot be amended and organic laws cannot be adopted, amended or abrogated.\n\n\n== Apparatus ==\nThe Parliament staff ensures an organizational, informational and technological assistance to activity of the Parliament, the Standing Bureau, standing committees, parliamentary factions and of deputies. The structure and the personal record of the parliament staff are approved by the Parliament.\n\n\n== Legislative procedure ==\nAccording to the Constitution of Moldova (1994), the Parliament is the supreme representative organ and the single legislative authority of the state.

Kishinj\u00f3v [k\u02b2\u026a\u0282\u0268\u02c8n\u02b2\u0275f]), is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Moldova. The city is Moldova's main industrial and commercial center, and is located in the middle of the country, on the river B\u00e2c, a tributary of the Dniester. According to the results of the 2014 census, the city proper had a population of 532,513, while the population of the Municipality of Chi\u0219in\u0103u (which includes the city itself and other nearby communities) was 700,000.\nChi\u0219in\u0103u is the most economically prosperous locality in Moldova and its largest transportation hub. Nearly a third of Moldova's population lives in the metro area.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the city's name is unclear. A theory suggests that the name may come from the archaic Romanian word chi\u0219la (meaning \"spring\", \"source of water\") and nou\u0103 (\"new\"), because it was built around a small spring, at the corner of Pu\u0219kin and Albi\u0219oara streets.The other version, formulated by \u0218tefan Ciobanu, Romanian historian and academician, holds that the name was formed the same way as the name of Chi\u0219ineu (alternative spelling: Chi\u0219in\u0103u) in Western Romania, near the border with Hungary. Its Hungarian name is Kisjen\u0151, from which the Romanian name originates. Kisjen\u0151 comes from kis \"small\" and the Jen\u0151, one of the seven Hungarian tribes that entered the Carpathian Basin in 896. At least 24 other settlements are named after the Jen\u0151 tribe.Chi\u0219in\u0103u is known in Russian as \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0451\u0432 (Kishinj\u00f3v), while Moldova's Russian-language media call it \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044d\u0443, [k\u02b2\u026a\u0282\u0268\u02c8n\u025b\u028a] (Kishineu). It is written Ki\u015fin\u00f6v in the Latin Gagauz alphabet. It was also written as Chi\u0219ineu in pre-20th-century Romanian and as \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044d\u0443 in the Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet. Historically, the English language name for the city, Kishinev, was based on the modified Russian one because it entered the English language via Russian at the time Chi\u0219in\u0103u was part of the Russian Empire (e.g. Kishinev pogrom). Therefore, it remains a common English name in some historical contexts. Otherwise, the Romanian-based Chi\u0219in\u0103u has been steadily gaining wider currency, especially in written language. The city is also historically referred to as German: Kischinau, Polish: Kiszyni\u00f3w, Ukrainian: \u041a\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0456\u0432, romanized: Kyshyniv, or Yiddish: \u05e7\u05e2\u05e9\u05e2\u05e0\u05e2\u05f0\u200e, romanized: Keshenev.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Moldavian period ===\nFounded in 1436 as a monastery village, the city was part of the Principality of Moldavia (which, starting with the 16th century became a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire, but still retaining its autonomy). At the beginning of the 19th century Chi\u0219in\u0103u was a small town of 7,000 inhabitants.\nIn 1812, in the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812), the eastern half of Moldavia was ceded to the Russian Empire. The newly acquired territories became known as Bessarabia.\n\n\n=== Russian Imperial period ===\n\nUnder Russian government, Chi\u0219in\u0103u became the capital of the newly annexed oblast (later guberniya) of Bessarabia. By 1834, an imperial townscape with broad and long roads had emerged as a result of a generous development plan, which divided Chi\u0219in\u0103u roughly into two areas: the old part of the town, with its irregular building structures, and a newer city centre and station. Between 26 May 1830 and 13 October 1836 the architect Avraam Melnikov established the Catedrala Na\u0219terea Domnului with a magnificent bell tower. In 1840 the building of the Triumphal arch, planned by the architect Luca Zaushkevich, was completed. Following this the construction of numerous buildings and landmarks began.\nOn 28 August 1871, Chi\u0219in\u0103u was linked by rail with Tiraspol, and in 1873 with Corne\u0219ti. Chi\u0219in\u0103u-Ungheni-Ia\u0219i railway was opened on 1 June 1875 in preparation for the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878). The town played an important part in the war between Russia and Ottoman Empire, as the main staging area of the Russian invasion. During the Belle \u00c9poque, the mayor of the city was Carol Schmidt, considered one of Chisinau's best mayors. Its population had grown to 92,000 by 1862, and to 125,787 by 1900.\n\n\n==== Pogroms and pre-revolution ====\n\nIn the late 19th century, especially due to growing anti-Semitic sentiment in the Russian Empire and better economic conditions in Moldova, many Jews chose to settle in Chi\u0219in\u0103u. By the year 1897, 46% of the population of Chi\u0219in\u0103u was Jewish, over 50,000 people.As part of the pogrom wave organized in the Russian Empire, a large anti-Semitic riot was organized in the town on  19\u201320 April 1903, which would later be known as the Kishinev pogrom. The rioting continued for three days, resulting in 47 Jews dead, 92 severely wounded, and 500 suffering minor injuries. In addition, several hundred houses and many businesses were plundered and destroyed. Some sources say 49 people were killed. The pogroms are largely believed to have been incited by anti-Jewish propaganda in the only official newspaper of the time, Bessarabetz (\u0411\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0446\u044a). Mayor Schmidt disapproved of the incident and resigned later in 1903. The reactions to this incident included a petition to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia on behalf of the American people by US President Theodore Roosevelt in July 1903.On 22 August 1905 another violent event occurred: The police opened fire on an estimated 3,000 demonstrating agricultural workers. Only a few months later, 19\u201320 October 1905, a further protest occurred, helping to force the hand of Nicholas II in bringing about the October Manifesto. However, these demonstrations suddenly turned into another anti-Jewish pogrom, resulting in 19 deaths.\n\n\n=== Romanian period ===\n\nFollowing the Russian October Revolution, Bessarabia declared independence from the crumbling empire, as the Moldavian Democratic Republic, before joining the Kingdom of Romania. As of 1919, Chi\u0219in\u0103u, with an estimated population of 133,000, became the second largest city in Romania.\nBetween 1918 and 1940, the center of the city undertook large renovation work. Romania granted important subsidies to its province and initiated large scale investment programs in the infrastructure of the main cities in Bessarabia, expanded the railroad infrastructure and started an extensive program to eradicate illiteracy.\nIn 1927, the Stephen the Great Monument, by the sculptor Alexandru Pl\u0103m\u0103deal\u0103, was erected. In 1933, the first higher education institution in Bessarabia was established, by transferring the Agricultural Sciences Section of the University of Ia\u0219i to Chi\u0219in\u0103u, as the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nOn 28 June 1940, as a direct result of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, Bessarabia was annexed by the Soviet Union from Romania, and Chi\u0219in\u0103u became the capital of the newly created Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic.\nFollowing the Soviet occupation, mass deportations, linked with atrocities, were executed by the NKVD between June 1940 and June 1941. In Chi\u0219in\u0103u, over 400 people were summarily executed in July 1940 and buried in the grounds of the Metropolitan Palace, the Chi\u0219in\u0103u Theological Institute, and the backyard of the Italian Consulate, where the NKVD had established its headquarters. As part of the policy of political repression of the potential opposition to the Communist power, tens of thousand members of native families were deported from Bessarabia to other regions of the USSR.\nOn 10 November 1940, a devastating earthquake occurred. The epicenter of the quake, which measured 7.4 (or 7.7, according to other sources) on the Richter scale, was in Vrancea Mountains and subsequently led to substantial destruction: 78 deaths and 2,795 affected buildings (of which 172 destroyed).In June 1941, in order to recover Bessarabia, Romania entered World War II under the command of the German Wehrmacht, declaring war to the Soviet Union. In the chaos of the Second World War, Chi\u0219in\u0103u was severely affected. In June\u2013July 1941 the city came under bombardment by Nazi air raids. However, the Romanian and newly Moldovan sources assign most of the responsibility for the damage to Soviet NKVD destruction battalions, that operated in Chi\u0219in\u0103u until 17 July 1941, when it was captured by Axis forces.Following the German and Romanian reoccupation, the city suffered from the Nazi extermination policy of its Jewish inhabitants, who were transported on trucks to the outskirts of the city and then summarily shot in partially dug pits. The number of Jews murdered during the initial occupation of the city is estimated at approximately 10,000 people.As the war drew to a conclusion, the city was once again the scene of heavy fighting as German and Romanian troops retreated. Chi\u0219in\u0103u was captured by the Red Army on 24 August 1944 as a result of the Jassy-Kishinev Operation.\n\n\n=== Soviet period ===\nAfter the war, Bessarabia was fully reintegrated into the Soviet Union, around 65 percent of its territory as the Moldavian SSR, while the remaining 35 percent were transferred to the Ukrainian SSR.\nTwo other waves of deportations of Moldova's native population were carried out by the Soviets, the first one immediately after the Soviet reoccupation of Bessarabia until the end of the 1940s, and the second one in the mid-1950s.In the years 1947 to 1949 the architect Alexey Shchusev developed a plan with the aid of a team of architects for the gradual reconstruction of the city.There was rapid population growth in the 1950s, to which the Soviet administration responded by constructing large-scale housing and palaces in the style of Stalinist architecture. This process continued under Nikita Khrushchev, who called for construction under the slogan \"good, cheaper and built faster\". The new architectural style brought about dramatic change and generated the style that dominates today, with large blocks of flats arranged in considerable settlements. These Khrushchev-era building are often informally called Khrushchyovka.\nThe period of the most significant redevelopment of the city extended from 1971, when the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union adopted a decision \"On the measures for further development of the city of Kishinev\", which secured more than one billion rubles in investment from the state budget, which continued until the independence of Moldova in 1991.

        "wiki": "Tiraspol (Russian: \u0422\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c [t\u02b2\u026a\u02c8rasp\u0259l\u02b2]; Ukrainian: \u0422\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0456\u043b\u044c [t\u026a\u02c8r\u0251spil\u02b2]) is internationally recognised as the second largest city in Moldova, but is effectively the capital and administrative centre of the unrecognised Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (Pridnestrovie). The city is located on the eastern bank of the Dniester River. Tiraspol is a regional hub of light industry, such as furniture and electrical goods production.\nThe modern city of Tiraspol was founded by the Russian generalissimo Alexander Suvorov in 1792, although the area had been inhabited for thousands of years by varying ethnic groups. The city celebrates its anniversary every year on 14 October.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe toponym consists of two ancient Greek words: \u03a4\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2, Tyras, the Ancient name for the Dniester River, and polis, i.e., a city (state).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Classical history ===\nTyras (\u03a4\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2), also spelled Tiras, was a colony of the Greek city Miletus, probably founded about 600 BC, situated some 10 kilometres (6 miles) from the mouth of the Tiras River (Dniester). Of no great importance in early times, in the 2nd century BC it fell under the dominion of indigenous kings whose names appear on its coins. It was destroyed by the Thracian Getae about 50 BC.\nIn 56 AD the Romans restored the city and made it part of the colonial province of Lower Moesia. A series of its coins exist that feature heads of Roman emperors from Domitian to Severus Alexander. Soon after the time of the latter, the city was destroyed again, this time by the invasion of the Goths. Its government was in the hands of five archons, a senate, a popular assembly and a registrar. The images on its coins from this period suggest a trade in wheat, wine and fish. The few inscriptions extant are mostly concerned with trade.\nSuch ancient archeological remains are scanty, as the city site was built over by the great medieval fortress of Monocastro or Akkerman. During the Middle Ages, the area around Tiraspol was a buffer zone between the Tatars and the Moldavians, and inhabited by both ethnic groups.\n\n\n=== Russian foundation ===\nThe Russian Empire conquered its way to the Dniester River, taking territory from the Ottoman Empire. In 1792 the Russian army built fortifications to guard the western border near a Moldavian village named Sucleia. Field Marshal Alexander Suvorov is considered the founder of modern Tiraspol; his statue is the city's most distinctive landmark. The city took its name from Tyras, the Greek name of the Dniester River on which it stands.\nIn 1828 the Russian government established a customs house in Tiraspol to try to suppress smuggling. The customs house was subordinated to the chief of the Odessa customs region. It began operations with 14 employees. They inspected shipments of bread, paper, oil, wine, sugar, fruits and other goods.\n\n\n=== Soviet Tiraspol ===\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution, the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created in Ukraine in 1924, with Balta as its capital. The republic had Romanian, Ukrainian and Russian as its official languages. Its capital was moved in 1929 to Tiraspol, which remained the capital of the Moldavian ASSR until 1940.\nIn 1940, following the secret provisions of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, the USSR forced Romania to cede Bessarabia. It integrated Tiraspol, until then part of the Ukrainian SSR, into the newly formed Moldavian SSR. On 7 August 1941, following the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, the city was taken over by Romanian troops. Later that month, on 19 August, the Tiraspol Agreement establishing the Transnistria Governorate was signed. During the occupation, Tiraspol was under Romanian administration. During that period almost all of its Jewish population died: they were slain in situ or deported to German Nazi death camps, where they were murdered.\nIn 1941 before the occupation, the newspaper Dnestrovskaya Pravda was founded by the Tiraspol City Council of popular deputies. This is the oldest periodical publication in the region. On 12 April 1944, the city was retaken by the Red Army and became again part of Moldavian SSR.\n\n\n=== Post-independence ===\nOn 27 January 1990, the citizens in Tiraspol passed a referendum declaring the city as an independent territory. The nearby city of Bendery also declared its independence from Moldova. As the Russian-speaking independence movement gained momentum, some local governments banded together to resist pressure from the Moldovan government for nationalization.\nOn 2 September 1990, Tiraspol was proclaimed the capital of the new Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. The new republic was not officially recognized by Soviet authorities; however, it received support from some important Soviet leaders, such as Anatoly Lukyanov. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the territory east of the Dniester River declared independence as the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR), with Tiraspol as its capital. It was not recognized by the international community.\nOn 1 July 2005, the Lucian Blaga Lyceum, a high school with Romanian as its language of instruction, was registered as a Pridnestrovian non-governmental establishment. The registration of six Romanian language schools has been the subject of negotiations with the government since 2000. The tension increased in the summer of 2004, when the Pridnestrovian authorities forcibly closed the schools that used the Moldovan language in the Latin script. According to the official PMR view, this is considered as Romanian. Moldovan, written in the Cyrillic script, is one of the three official languages in the PMR; Romanian is not. Some economic measures and counter-measures were taken on both banks of the Dniester.\nTensions have been expressed in terrorist incidents. On 6 July 2006, an explosion, believed to be caused by a bomb, killed at least eight people in a minibus. On 13 August 2006, a grenade explosion in a trolleybus killed two and injured ten.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nTiraspol features a humid continental climate that closely borders an oceanic climate and has transitional features of the humid subtropical climate due to its warm summers. Summers are mild, with average monthly temperatures at around 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F) in July and August. Winters are cold, with average temperatures in the coldest month (January) at \u22122.7 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F). Precipitation is relatively evenly spread throughout the year, though there is a noticeable increase in monthly precipitation in June and July. Tiraspol on average sees nearly 500 mm (20 in) of precipitation per year.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe population of the city was about 190,000 in 1989 and about 203,000 in 1992. 41% were Russians, 32% Ukrainians (both Eastern Slavic) and 18% were Moldovans (ethnically akin to Romanians).\nAs result of the political and economic situation that followed the proclamation of the independent (unrecognized) Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, as well as large Jewish emigration in the early 1990s, the population of the city fell below its 1989 number and the 2004 Census in Transnistria put its population at 158,069.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe Latin Catholic minority was served by its own Roman Catholic Diocese of Tiraspol (originally called Cherson), which at times also covered part of neighbouring Romania and Russia, until its 2002 suppression and merger into the Russian Diocese of Saint Clement at Saratov.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe statue of Alexander Suvorov was erected in the central square in 1979 in commemoration of his 250th anniversary. In front of the Pridnestrovian Government building there is a statue of Vladimir Lenin. On the opposite side of the central square, a monument plaza features a Soviet T-34 tank, commemorating the Soviet victory in World War II, an eternal flame to those who fell defending the city in 1941 and liberating it in 1944, as well as several monuments dedicated to more recent conflicts, including the Soviet\u2013Afghan War and the War of Transnistria.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nThe two main football clubs are Sheriff Tiraspol and FC Tiraspol. Sheriff is the most successful Moldovan football club of recent history, winning 14 league titles since the 2000\u20132001 season, and 6 Moldovan Cups. A third club, CS Tiligul-Tiras Tiraspol, withdrew from competition prior to the 2009\u20132010 season. Tiraspol is home to the Sheriff Stadium, the largest capacity stadium in the region, with a capacity of 14,300 seats.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\n Trondheim, Norway (2000)\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nNikolay Zelinsky (1861 in Tiraspol \u2013 1953 in Moscow) Russian and Soviet chemist, academician of the Academy of Sciences of USSR, invented the first effective filtering activated charcoal gas mask\nGeorgi Stamatov (1869 in Tiraspol \u2013 1942 in Sofia) was a Bulgarian writer.\nMikhail Larionov (1881 in Tiraspol \u2013 1964) was an avant-garde Russian painter.\nAbraham Rabinovitch (1889 in Tiraspol \u2013 1964 in New South Wales) was an Australian-Russian property developer and pioneer of the Sydney Modern Orthodox Jewish community; emigrated to Australia in 1915\nGheorghe Pintilie (born 1902 in Tiraspol \u2013 1985) was a Soviet intelligence agent, Russian citizen and naturalised Romanian communist activist of Ukrainian origin and the first Director of the Securitate\nIzrail Shmurun (1912 in Tiraspol \u2013 1985 in Chi\u0219in\u0103u) a Moldavian Soviet architect\nLarisa Eryomina (born 1950 in Tiraspol) a stage and screen actress, particularly in Soviet films of the 1970s.\nOxana Ionova (born 1966 in Tiraspol) was the head of the state tax service of Pridnestrovie and director of Pridnestrovie's central bank from 2008 to 2011, subsequently charged with embezzlement of Russian humanitarian aid and state property, illegal business practices, abuse of power and forgery.\nVlad Stashevsky (born 1974 in Tiraspol) is a Russian pop singer.\nSergey Stepanov (born 1984 in Tiraspol) musician and composer from Pridnestrovie, member of the SunStroke Project\nValeria Lukyanova (born 1985 in Tiraspol) is a Ukrainian model and entertainer, famous for her resemblance to a Barbie doll, lives in Moscow.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nSerhiy Kivalov (born 1954 in Tiraspol) is Ukrainian politician, jurist, parliamentarian, head of Central Election Commission\nVladimir Mikhailovich Belyaev (born 18 March 1965 in Tiraspol) is the minister of information and telecommunications\nMaya Parnas (born 1974 in Tiraspol) politician and was the former acting Prime Minister of Pridnestrovie\nNina Shtanski (born 1977 in Tiraspol) \u2013 former Pridnestrovian state politician, the Minister of Foreign Affairs 2012 to 2015\nRoman Khudyakov (born 1977 in Tiraspol) is a Pridnestrovian-born Russian politician, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party of Pridnestrovie\nVladimir Yastrebchak (born 1979 in Tiraspol) the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Pridnestrovie from 2008 to 2012.\nOlga Paterova (born in 1984 in Tiraspol) a young politician, the press secretary for the political youth organization Breakthrough\nYury Cheban, Pridnestrovian Minister of Natural Resources and Ecological Control\n\n\n=== Sport ===\nConstantin Nour (1906 or 1907 in Tiraspol \u2013 1986) was a Romanian champion middleweight boxer and national team trainer\nIgor Samoilenco (born 1977 in Tiraspol) retired male boxer from Moldova\nLarisa Popova (born 1957 in Tiraspol) Moldovan rower who competed for the Soviet Union in the 1976 Summer Olympics\nAndrei Mihailov (born 1980 in Tiraspol) former backstroke swimmer, competed in the 2000 and the 2004 Summer Olympics\nAndrei Corneencov (born 1982 in Tiraspol) former Moldovan international footballer.\nStanislau Tsivonchyk (born 1985 in Tiraspol) a Belarusian pole vaulter, competed in the pole vault at the 2012 Summer Olympics\nVitalie Bulat (born 1987 in Tiraspol) is a Moldovan footballer\nOleksandr Kolchenko (born 1988 in Tiraspol) a Ukrainian basketball player for Cherkaski Mavpy and the Ukrainian national team\nD\u0103nil\u0103 Artiomov (born 1994 in Tiraspol) is a Moldovan breaststroke swimmer\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nTiraspol (p. 422) at Miriam Weiner's Routes to Roots Foundation\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\n=== Non-Pridnestrovian links ===\nTiraspol, Moldova at JewishGen\n(in Polish) Tyraspol (Tiraspol) in the Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland (1892)\nCurrent weather at Tiraspol from Yahoo\nArticle about travelling to Tiraspol at Lonely Planet\nTiraspol on Google Maps\nTiraspol telephone directory\nYellow pages of Tiraspol\n\n\n=== Pridnestrovian links ===\nTiraspol.info (in Russian)",

          "This is just another monument and it is to a guy called Suvorov, a Russian military leader and a national hero. Just another General on horseback type monument. However, if you get this far and into Transnistria, it might be worth a photo or two.",

The limestone in the galleries maintains constant humidity (85\u201395%) and temperature (12\u201314 \u00b0C [54\u201357 \u00b0F]) throughout the year. The longer some specific red wines are stored in such ideal conditions, the more they improve. Some wines are cellared for several decades before being sold. The cellars extend for 200 kilometres (120 mi), of which only 55 kilometres (34 mi) are currently in use.\nIn August 2005, Mile\u0219tii Mici was registered in the Guinness World Records as the biggest wine collection in the world.\nOverall, the complex holds nearly 2 million bottles. More than 70% of the stored wines are red, 20% are white and about 10% are dessert wines. The most valuable items of this collection, worth \u20ac480 a bottle, were produced in 1973\u201374; they are now exported only to Japan.\nWines are exported from Mile\u0219tii Mici to Sweden, Japan, the USA, Great Britain, the Czech Republic, Poland, Greece, Germany, Denmark, Finland, and China.\n\n\n== Wines ==\nThe wines stored here are made from crops of various years, beginning with 1969. Grapes include Pinot, Traminer, Muscat, Riesling, Dnestrovscoie, Milestscoie, Codru, Negru de Purcari, Trandafirul Moldovei, Auriu, and Cahor-Ciumai.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in English)",

It is housed in a building on the Boulevard Stefan the Great, one of the main roads in Chi\u015fin\u0103u. In 2012, it was given the name of the renowned opera singer Maria Bie\u0219u.\n\n\n== Opera company ==\nThe Chi\u015fin\u0103u National Opera, the national opera company of Moldova, was founded in the mid-1940s and became a professional company in 1956. Following the collapse of the USSR, the company is one of the few ex-Soviet opera companies to retain its own orchestra, chorus, soloists and  ballet company.\nIt is housed in the National Opera and Ballet Theatre of Moldova.\n\n\n== History ==\nBuilt during the years of the Soviet Union, the theatre has superb equipment and facilities. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, this theatre was one of the few to retain its own ballet, opera and orchestra, with its own soloists and chorus.\n\n\n=== National Ballet history ===\nProfessional ballet began in Chi\u015fin\u0103u in 1957, after a group of Moldovan dancers trained in Leningrad. New works were soon provided for the company: the Moldovan composer Vasile Zagorsky wrote the ballet Rassvet (Sunrise), while another composer Eduard Lazarev wrote Broken Sword, based on the poem \"Ghosts\", by Mihai Eminescu, a leading Romanian writer.\nIn its first ten years, the company added many well-known classical ballets to its repertoire, including Giselle, The Sleeping Beauty, Spartacus and Coppelia. It toured to Moscow, Kiev and Bulgaria. The most successful of the company\u2019s modern ballet productions was A Young Lady and a Hooligan, based on music by Shostakovitch, in which the lead dancer was Mihai Caftanat, who is still working with the company. Born in Chi\u015fin\u0103u, Caftanat studied ballet in Moscow, returning to his native city to dance Siegfried, Prince Desire, Arald in Broken Sword and Antony in Antony and Cleopatra.\n\nOther notable productions at this time were: the Carmen Suite; Sonnets, using Benjamin Britten\u2019s music; the Arabesques, with Lazarev\u2019s music. Attempts to create national works included the children\u2019s ballet Andriesh by Zlata Tkach and Luceafarul by Eugen Doga based on Eminescu\u2019s best-known poem; while O Seara de Balet re-introduced audiences to the classical choreography of Marius Petipa, Ivanov, Fokine and Gorski. The Kirov Ballet production of La Bayad\u00e8re was carefully re-created by Tatiana Leagt and showed how well the company could handle a difficult work requiring first-class performers.\nIn 1998, the renowned choreographer Yuri Grigorovich from the Bolshoi came to Chi\u015fin\u0103u to direct his version of The Nutcracker, originally played at the Bolshoi in 1966. The company now toured to Moscow, Vietnam, Bulgaria, Italy, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Romania, Hungary, Greece, Paris, Tokyo, Johannesburg, Los Angeles. In 1999 it brought productions of Swan Lake and Sleeping Beauty to the UK. Since 2001 the company performed Grigorovich\u2019s Nutcracker several times in the UK. This was the first time the production had been seen in this country since the Bolshoi performed it in London in the early seventies. The Moldova National Ballet has toured regularly in Spain since 2005, in January 2007 it performed The Best of Tchaikovsky in Spain and northern Germany.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "Edinburgh ( (listen); Scots: Edinburgh; Scottish Gaelic: D\u00f9n \u00c8ideann [\u02c8t\u032au\u02d0n \u02c8e\u02d0t\u02b2\u0259n\u032a\u02e0]) is the capital of Scotland and one of its 32 council areas. Historically part of the county of Midlothian (interchangeably Edinburghshire before 1921), it is located in Lothian on the Firth of Forth's southern shore.\nRecognised as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is the seat of the Scottish Government, the Scottish Parliament and the supreme courts of Scotland. The city's Palace of Holyroodhouse is the official residence of the monarch in Scotland. The city has long been a centre of education, particularly in the fields of medicine, Scots law, literature, philosophy, the sciences and engineering. It is the second largest financial centre in the United Kingdom (after London) and the city's historical and cultural attractions have made it the United Kingdom's second most visited tourist destination attracting 4.9 million visits including 2.4 million from overseas in 2018.Edinburgh is Scotland's second most populous city and the seventh most populous in the United Kingdom. The official population estimates are 488,050 (2016) for the Locality of Edinburgh (Edinburgh pre 1975 regionalisation plus Currie and Balerno), 524,930 (2019) for the City of Edinburgh, and 1,339,380 (2014) for the city region. Edinburgh lies at the heart of the Edinburgh and South East Scotland city region comprising East Lothian, Edinburgh, Fife, Midlothian, Scottish Borders and West Lothian.The city is the annual venue of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. It is home to national institutions such as the National Museum of Scotland, the National Library of Scotland and the Scottish National Gallery. The University of Edinburgh, founded in 1582 and now one of three in the city, is placed 20th in the QS World University Rankings for 2020. The city is also known for the Edinburgh International Festival and the Fringe, the latter being the world's largest annual international arts festival. Historic sites in Edinburgh include Edinburgh Castle, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the churches of St. Giles, Greyfriars and the Canongate, and the extensive Georgian New Town built in the 18th/19th centuries. Edinburgh's Old Town and New Town together are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site, which has been managed by Edinburgh World Heritage since 1999.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n\"Edin\", the root of the city's name, derives from Eidyn, the name for this region in Cumbric, the Brittonic Celtic language formerly spoken there. The name's meaning is unknown. The district of Eidyn centred on the stronghold Din Eidyn, the dun or hillfort of Eidyn. This stronghold is believed to have been located at Castle Rock, now the site of Edinburgh Castle. Eidyn was conquered by the Angles of Bernicia in the 7th century and later by the Scots in the 10th century. As the language shifted to Old English, and subsequently to Scots, the Brittonic din in Din Eidyn was replaced by burh, producing Edinburgh. Similarly, din became d\u00f9n in Scottish Gaelic, producing D\u00f9n \u00c8ideann.\n\n\n== Nicknames ==\n\nThe city is affectionately nicknamed Auld Reekie, Scots for Old Smoky, for the views from the country of the smoke-covered Old Town.\nA remark on a poem in an 1800 collection of the poems of Allan Ramsay said, \"Auld Reeky. A name the country people give Edinburgh from the cloud of smoke or reek that is always impending over it.\"Thomas Carlyle said, \"Smoke cloud hangs over old Edinburgh,\u2014for, ever since Aeneas Silvius's time and earlier, the people have the art, very strange to Aeneas, of burning a certain sort of black stones, and Edinburgh with its chimneys is called 'Auld Reekie' by the country people.\"A character in Walter Scott's The Abbot says \"... yonder stands Auld Reekie\u2014you may see the smoke hover over her at twenty miles' distance.\"Robert Chambers who said that the sobriquet could not be traced before the reign of Charles II attributed the name to a Fife laird, Durham of Largo, who regulated the bedtime of his children by the smoke rising above Edinburgh from the fires of the tenements. \"It's time now bairns, to tak' the beuks, and gang to our beds, for yonder's Auld Reekie, I see, putting on her nicht -cap!\"Some have called Edinburgh the Athens of the North for a variety of reasons. The earliest comparison between the two cities showed that they had a similar topography, with the Castle Rock of Edinburgh performing a similar role to the Athenian Acropolis. Both of them had flatter, fertile agricultural land sloping down to a port several miles away (respectively Leith and Piraeus). Although this arrangement is common in Southern Europe, it is rare in Northern Europe. The 18th-century intellectual life, referred to as the Scottish Enlightenment, was a key influence in gaining the name. Such luminaries as David Hume and Adam Smith shone during this period. Having lost most of its political importance after the Union, some hoped that Edinburgh could gain a similar influence on London as Athens had on Rome. Also a contributing factor was the later neoclassical architecture, particularly that of William Henry Playfair, and the National Monument. Tom Stoppard's character Archie, of Jumpers, said, perhaps playing on Reykjav\u00edk meaning \"smoky bay\", that the \"Reykjav\u00edk of the South\" would be more appropriate.The city has also been known by several Latin names such as Edinburgum while the adjectival forms Edinburgensis and Edinensis are used in educational and scientific contexts.Edina is a late 18th century poetical form used by the Scots poets Robert Fergusson and Robert Burns. \"Embra\" or \"Embro\" are colloquialisms from the same time, as in Robert Garioch's Embro to the Ploy.Ben Jonson described it as \"Britaine's other eye\", and Sir Walter Scott referred to it as \"yon Empress of the North\". Robert Louis Stevenson, also a son of the city, wrote that Edinburgh \"is what Paris ought to be.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe earliest known human habitation in the Edinburgh area was at Cramond, where evidence was found of a Mesolithic camp site dated to c. 8500 BC. Traces of later Bronze Age and Iron Age settlements have been found on Castle Rock, Arthur's Seat, Craiglockhart Hill and the Pentland Hills.When the Romans arrived in Lothian at the end of the 1st century AD, they found a Brittonic Celtic tribe whose name they recorded as the Votadini. The Votadini transitioned into the Gododdin kingdom in the Early Middle Ages, with Eidyn serving as one of the kingdom's districts. During this period, the Castle Rock site, thought to have been the stronghold of Din Eidyn, emerged as the kingdom's major centre. The medieval poem Y Gododdin describes a war band from across the Brittonic world who gathered in Eidyn before a fateful raid; this may describe a historical event around AD 600.In 638, the Gododdin stronghold was besieged by forces loyal to King Oswald of Northumbria, and around this time control of Lothian passed to the Angles. Their influence continued for the next three centuries until around 950, when, during the reign of Indulf, son of Constantine II, the \"burh\" (fortress), named in the 10th-century Pictish Chronicle as oppidum Eden, was abandoned to the Scots. It thenceforth remained under their jurisdiction.The royal burgh was founded by King David I in the early 12th century on land belonging to the Crown, though the date of its charter is unknown. The first documentary evidence of the medieval burgh is a royal charter, c.\u20091124\u20131127, by King David I granting a toft in burgo meo de Edenesburg to the Priory of Dunfermline. By the middle of the 14th century, the French chronicler Jean Froissart was describing it as the capital of Scotland (c. 1365), and James III (1451\u201388) referred to it in the 15th century as \"the principal burgh of our kingdom\". Despite the destruction caused by an English assault in 1544, the town slowly recovered, and was at the centre of events in the 16th-century Scottish Reformation and 17th-century Wars of the Covenant.\n\n\n=== 17th century ===\n\nIn 1603, King James VI of Scotland succeeded to the English throne, uniting the crowns of Scotland and England in a personal union known as the Union of the Crowns, though Scotland remained, in all other respects, a separate kingdom. In 1638, King Charles I's attempt to introduce Anglican church forms in Scotland encountered stiff Presbyterian opposition culminating in the conflicts of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Subsequent Scottish support for Charles Stuart's restoration to the throne of England resulted in Edinburgh's occupation by Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth of England forces \u2013 the New Model Army \u2013 in 1650.In the 17th century, Edinburgh's boundaries were still defined by the city's defensive town walls. As a result, the city's growing population was accommodated by increasing the height of the houses. Buildings of 11 storeys or more were common, and have been described as forerunners of the modern-day skyscraper. Most of these old structures were replaced by the predominantly Victorian buildings seen in today's Old Town.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\nFollowing the Treaty of Union in 1706, the Parliaments of England and Scotland passed Acts of Union in 1706 and 1707 respectively, uniting the two kingdoms in the Kingdom of Great Britain effective from 1 May 1707. As a consequence, the Parliament of Scotland merged with the Parliament of England to form the Parliament of Great Britain, which sat at Westminster in London. The Union was opposed by many Scots, resulting in riots in the city.By the first half of the 18th century, Edinburgh was described as one of Europe's most densely populated, overcrowded and unsanitary towns. Visitors were struck by the fact that the various social classes shared the same urban space, even inhabiting the same tenement buildings; although here a form of social segregation did prevail, whereby shopkeepers and tradesmen tended to occupy the cheaper-to-rent cellars and garrets, while the more well-to-do professional classes occupied the more expensive middle storeys.\n\nDuring the Jacobite rising of 1745, Edinburgh was briefly occupied by the Jacobite \"Highland Army\" before its march into England. After its eventual defeat at Culloden, there followed a period of reprisals and pacification, largely directed at the rebellious clans. In Edinburgh, the Town Council, keen to emulate London by initiating city improvements and expansion to the north of the castle, reaffirmed its belief in the Union and loyalty to the Hanoverian monarch George III by its choice of names for the streets of the New Town: for example, Rose Street and Thistle Street; and for the royal family, George Street, Queen Street, Hanover Street, Frederick Street and Princes Street (in honour of George's two sons).In the second half of the century, the city was at the heart of the Scottish Enlightenment, when thinkers like David Hume, Adam Smith, James Hutton and Joseph Black were familiar figures in its streets. Edinburgh became a major intellectual centre, earning it the nickname \"Athens of the North\" because of its many neo-classical buildings and reputation for learning, recalling ancient Athens. In the 18th-century novel The Expedition of Humphry Clinker by Tobias Smollett one character describes Edinburgh as a \"hotbed of genius\". Edinburgh was also a major centre for the Scottish book trade. The highly successful London bookseller Andrew Millar was apprenticed there to James McEuen.From the 1770s onwards, the professional and business classes gradually deserted the Old Town in favour of the more elegant \"one-family\" residences of the New Town, a migration that changed the city's social character. According to the foremost historian of this development, \"Unity of social feeling was one of the most valuable heritages of old Edinburgh, and its disappearance was widely and properly lamented.\"\n\n\n=== 19th and 20th centuries ===\n\nAlthough Edinburgh's traditional industries of printing, brewing and distilling continued to grow in the 19th century, and were joined by new rubber works and engineering works, there was little industrialisation compared with other cities in Britain. By 1821, Edinburgh had been overtaken by Glasgow as Scotland's largest city. The city centre between Princes Street and George Street became a major commercial and shopping district, a development partly stimulated by the arrival of railways in the 1840s. The Old Town became an increasingly dilapidated, overcrowded slum with high mortality rates. Improvements carried out under Lord Provost William Chambers in the 1860s began the transformation of the area into the predominantly Victorian Old Town seen today. More improvements followed in the early 20th century as a result of the work of Patrick Geddes, but relative economic stagnation during the two world wars and beyond saw the Old Town deteriorate further before major slum clearance in the 1960s and 1970s began to reverse the process. University building developments which transformed the George Square and Potterrow areas proved highly controversial.\n\nSince the 1990s a new \"financial district\", including the Edinburgh International Conference Centre, has grown mainly on demolished railway property to the west of the castle, stretching into Fountainbridge, a run-down 19th-century industrial suburb which has undergone radical change since the 1980s with the demise of industrial and brewery premises. This ongoing development has enabled Edinburgh to maintain its place as the United Kingdom's second largest financial and administrative centre after London. Financial services now account for a third of all commercial office space in the city. The development of Edinburgh Park, a new business and technology park covering 38 acres (15 ha), 4 mi (6 km) west of the city centre, has also contributed to the District Council's strategy for the city's major economic regeneration.In 1998, the Scotland Act, which came into force the following year, established a devolved Scottish Parliament and Scottish Executive (renamed the Scottish Government since September 2007). Both based in Edinburgh, they are responsible for governing Scotland while reserved matters such as defence, taxation and foreign affairs remain the responsibility of the Parliament of the United Kingdom in London.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\nSituated in Scotland's Central Belt, Edinburgh lies on the Firth of Forth's southern shore. The city centre is 2 1\u20442 miles (4.0 km) southwest of the shoreline of Leith and 26 miles (42 km) inland, as the crow flies, from the east coast of Scotland and the North Sea at Dunbar. While the early burgh grew up near the prominent Castle Rock, the modern city is often said to be built on seven hills, namely Calton Hill, Corstorphine Hill, Craiglockhart Hill, Braid Hill, Blackford Hill, Arthur's Seat and the Castle Rock, giving rise to allusions to the seven hills of Rome.Occupying a narrow gap between the Firth of Forth to the north and the Pentland Hills and their outrunners to the south, the city sprawls over a landscape which is the product of early volcanic activity and later periods of intensive glaciation.\n Igneous activity between 350 and 400 million years ago, coupled with faulting, led to the creation of tough basalt volcanic plugs, which predominate over much of the area. One such example is the Castle Rock which forced the advancing ice sheet to divide, sheltering the softer rock and forming a 1-mile-long (1.6 km) tail of material to the east, thus creating a distinctive crag and tail formation. Glacial erosion on the north side of the crag gouged a deep valley later filled by the now drained Nor Loch. These features, along with another hollow on the rock's south side, formed an ideal natural strongpoint upon which Edinburgh Castle was built. Similarly, Arthur's Seat is the remains of a volcano dating from the Carboniferous period, which was eroded by a glacier moving west to east during the ice age. Erosive action such as plucking and abrasion exposed the rocky crags to the west before leaving a tail of deposited glacial material swept to the east. This process formed the distinctive Salisbury Crags, a series of teschenite cliffs between Arthur's Seat and the location of the early burgh. The residential areas of Marchmont and Bruntsfield are built along a series of drumlin ridges south of the city centre, which were deposited as the glacier receded.Other prominent landforms such as Calton Hill and Corstorphine Hill are also products of glacial erosion. The Braid Hills and Blackford Hill are a series of small summits to the south of the city centre that command expansive views looking northwards over the urban area to the Firth of Forth.\n\nEdinburgh is drained by the river named the Water of Leith, which rises at the Colzium Springs in the Pentland Hills and runs for 29 kilometres (18 mi) through the south and west of the city, emptying into the Firth of Forth at Leith. The nearest the river gets to the city centre is at Dean Village on the north-western edge of the New Town, where a deep gorge is spanned by Thomas Telford's Dean Bridge, built in 1832 for the road to Queensferry. The Water of Leith Walkway is a mixed-use trail that follows the course of the river for 19.6 kilometres (12.2 mi) from Balerno to Leith.\n\nExcepting the shoreline of the Firth of Forth, Edinburgh is encircled by a green belt, designated in 1957, which stretches from Dalmeny in the west to Prestongrange in the east. With an average width of 3.2 kilometres (2 mi) the principal objectives of the green belt were to contain the outward expansion of the city and to prevent the agglomeration of urban areas. Expansion affecting the green belt is strictly controlled but developments such as Edinburgh Airport and the Royal Highland Showground at Ingliston lie within the zone. Similarly, suburbs such as Juniper Green and Balerno are situated on green belt land. One feature of the Edinburgh green belt is the inclusion of parcels of land within the city which are designated green belt, even though they do not connect with the peripheral ring. Examples of these independent wedges of green belt include Holyrood Park and Corstorphine Hill.\n\n\n=== Areas ===\nEdinburgh includes former towns and villages that retain much of their original character as settlements in existence before they were absorbed into the expanding city of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Many areas, such as Dalry, contain residences that are multi-occupancy buildings known as tenements, although the more southern and western parts of the city have traditionally been less built-up with a greater number of detached and semi-detached villas.\n\nThe historic centre of Edinburgh is divided in two by the broad green swathe of Princes Street Gardens. To the south, the view is dominated by Edinburgh Castle, built high on Castle Rock, and the long sweep of the Old Town descending towards Holyrood Palace. To the north lie Princes Street and the New Town.\nThe West End includes the financial district, with insurance and banking offices as well as the Edinburgh International Conference Centre.\nEdinburgh's Old and New Towns were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995 in recognition of the unique character of the Old Town with its medieval street layout and the planned Georgian New Town, including the adjoining Dean Village and Calton Hill areas. There are over 4,500 listed buildings within the city, a higher proportion relative to area than any other city in the United Kingdom.\nThe Royal Mile runs downhill and terminates at Holyrood Palace. Minor streets (called closes or wynds) lie on either side of the main spine forming a herringbone pattern. The street has several fine public buildings such as St Giles' Cathedral, the City Chambers and the Law Courts. Other places of historical interest nearby are Greyfriars Kirkyard and the Grassmarket. The street layout is typical of the old quarters of many northern European cities.\nThe castle is perched on top of a rocky crag (the remnant of an extinct volcano) and the Royal Mile runs down the crest of a ridge from it. Due to space restrictions imposed by the narrowness of this landform, the Old Town became home to some of the earliest \"high rise\" residential buildings. Multi-storey dwellings known as lands were the norm from the 16th century onwards with ten and eleven storeys being typical and one even reaching fourteen or fifteen storeys. Numerous vaults below street level were inhabited to accommodate the influx of incomers, particularly Irish immigrants, during the Industrial Revolution.\nThe New Town was an 18th-century solution to the problem of an increasingly crowded city which had been confined to the ridge sloping down from the castle. In 1766 a competition to design a \"New Town\" was won by James Craig, a 27-year-old architect. The plan was a rigid, ordered grid, which fitted in well with Enlightenment ideas of rationality. The principal street was to be George Street, running along the natural ridge to the north of what became known as the \"Old Town\". To either side of it are two other main streets: Princes Street and Queen Street. Princes Street has become Edinburgh's main shopping street and now has few of its Georgian buildings in their original state. The three main streets are connected by a series of streets running perpendicular to them. The east and west ends of George Street are terminated by St Andrew Square and Charlotte Square respectively. The latter, designed by Robert Adam, influenced the architectural style of the New Town into the early 19th century. Bute House, the official residence of the First Minister of Scotland, is on the north side of Charlotte Square.The hollow between the Old and New Towns was formerly the Nor Loch, which was created for the town's defence but came to be used by the inhabitants for dumping their sewage. It was drained by the 1820s as part of the city's northward expansion. Craig's original plan included an ornamental canal on the site of the loch, but this idea was abandoned. Soil excavated while laying the foundations of buildings in the New Town was dumped on the site of the loch to create the slope connecting the Old and New Towns known as The Mound.\nIn the middle of the 19th century the National Gallery of Scotland and Royal Scottish Academy Building were built on The Mound, and tunnels for the railway line between Haymarket and Waverley stations were driven through it.\nThe Southside is a residential part of the city, which includes the districts of St Leonards, Marchmont, Morningside, Newington, Sciennes, the Grange and Blackford. The Southside is broadly analogous to the area covered formerly by the Burgh Muir, and was developed as a residential area after the opening of the South Bridge in the 1780s. The Southside is particularly popular with families (many state and private schools are here), young professionals and students (the central University of Edinburgh campus is based around George Square just north of Marchmont and the Meadows), and Napier University (with major campuses around Merchiston and Morningside). The area is also well provided with hotel and \"bed and breakfast\" accommodation for visiting festival-goers. These districts often feature in works of fiction. For example, Church Hill in Morningside, was the home of Muriel Spark's Miss Jean Brodie, and Ian Rankin's Inspector Rebus lives in Marchmont and works in St Leonards.\n\nLeith was historically the port of Edinburgh, an arrangement of unknown date that was confirmed by the royal charter Robert the Bruce granted to the city in 1329. The port developed a separate identity from Edinburgh, which to some extent it still retains, and it was a matter of great resentment when the two burghs merged in 1920 into the City of Edinburgh. Even today the parliamentary seat is known as \"Edinburgh North and Leith\". The loss of traditional industries and commerce (the last shipyard closed in 1983) resulted in economic decline. The Edinburgh Waterfront development has transformed old dockland areas from Leith to Granton into residential areas with shopping and leisure facilities and helped rejuvenate the area. With the redevelopment, Edinburgh has gained the business of cruise liner companies which now provide cruises to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands.\nThe coastal suburb of Portobello is characterised by Georgian villas, Victorian tenements, a beach and promenade and caf\u00e9s, bars, restaurants and independent shops. There are rowing and sailing clubs and a restored Victorian swimming pool, including Turkish baths.\nThe urban area of Edinburgh is almost entirely within the City of Edinburgh Council boundary, merging with Musselburgh in East Lothian. Towns within easy reach of the city boundary include Haddington, Tranent, Prestonpans, Dalkeith, Bonnyrigg, Loanhead, Penicuik, Broxburn, Livingston and Dunfermline. Edinburgh lies at the heart of the Edinburgh & South East Scotland City region with a population in 2014 of 1,339,380.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike most of Scotland, Edinburgh has a temperate, maritime climate which, despite its northerly latitude, is milder than places which lie at similar latitudes such as Moscow and Labrador. The city's proximity to the sea mitigates any large variations in temperature or extremes of climate. Winter daytime temperatures rarely fall below freezing while summer temperatures are moderate, rarely exceeding 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F). The highest temperature recorded in the city was 31.6 \u00b0C (88.9 \u00b0F) on 25 July 2019 at Gogarbank, beating the previous record of 31 \u00b0C (88 \u00b0F) on 4 August 1975 at Edinburgh Airport. The lowest temperature recorded in recent years was \u221214.6 \u00b0C (5.7 \u00b0F) during December 2010 at Gogarbank.Given Edinburgh's position between the coast and hills, it is renowned as \"the windy city\", with the prevailing wind direction coming from the south-west, which is often associated with warm, unstable air from the North Atlantic Current that can give rise to rainfall \u2013 although considerably less than cities to the west, such as Glasgow. Rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. Winds from an easterly direction are usually drier but considerably colder, and may be accompanied by haar, a persistent coastal fog. Vigorous Atlantic depressions, known as European windstorms, can affect the city between October and May.Located slightly north of the city centre, the weather station at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE) has been an official weather station for the Met Office since 1956.\nThe Met Office operates its own weather station at Gogarbank on the city's western outskirts, near Edinburgh Airport. This slightly inland station has a slightly wider temperature span between seasons, is cloudier and somewhat wetter, but differences are minor.\nTemperature and rainfall records have been kept at the Royal Observatory since 1764. In that time, the warmest month on record was July 1779, with an average temperature of 18.4 \u00b0C (65.1 \u00b0F), whereas the coldest was January 1814, with a mean temperature of \u22123.1 \u00b0C (26.4 \u00b0F). The warmest years on record are 1779 and 1846, both with mean temperatures of 9.8 \u00b0C (49.6 \u00b0F). The coldest year on record is 1879, with a mean temperature of 6.6 \u00b0C (43.9 \u00b0F). The wettest month on record was August 1948, with 238.8 millimetres (9.40 in). The driest was February 1934, with 2.3 millimetres (0.091 in). The wettest year on record was 1916, with 992.9 millimetres (39.09 in). The driest year on record was 1826, with 388.0 millimetres (15.28 in) of rainfall.\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\n\n=== Current ===\n\nThe most recent official population estimates are 512,150 (2016) for the Edinburgh settlement (includes Musselburgh) and 518,500 (2018) for the local authority area.Edinburgh has a high proportion of young adults, with 19.5% of the population in their 20s (exceeded only by Aberdeen) and 15.2% in their 30s which is the highest in Scotland. The proportion of Edinburgh's population born in the UK fell from 92% to 84% between 2001 and 2011, while the proportion of White Scottish-born fell from 78% to 70%. Of those Edinburgh residents born in the UK, 335,000 or 83% were born in Scotland, with 58,000 or 14% being born in England.\nSome 13,000 people or 2.7% of the city's population are of Polish descent. 39,500 people or 8.2% of Edinburgh's population class themselves as Non-White which is an increase from 4% in 2001. Of the Non-White population, the largest group by far are Asian, totalling 26,264 people. Within the Asian population, people of Chinese descent are now the largest sub-group, with 8,076 people, amounting to about 1.7% of the city's total population. The city's population of Indian descent amounts to 6,470 (1.4% of the total population), while there are some 5,858 of Pakistani descent (1.2% of the total population). Although they account for only 1,277 people or 0.3% of the city's population, Edinburgh has the highest number and proportion of people of Bangladeshi descent in Scotland. Over 7,000 people were born in African countries (1.6% of the total population) and nearly 7,000 in the Americas. With the notable exception of Inner London, Edinburgh has a higher number of people born in the United States (over 3,700) than any other city in the UK.The proportion of people born outside the UK was 15.9% compared with 8% in 2001.\n\n\n=== Historical ===\nA census by the Edinburgh presbytery in 1592 recorded a population of 8,003 adults spread equally north and south of the High Street which runs along the spine of the ridge sloping down from the Castle. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the population expanded rapidly, rising from 49,000 in 1751 to 136,000 in 1831, primarily due to migration from rural areas. As the population grew, problems of overcrowding in the Old Town, particularly in the cramped tenements that lined the present day Royal Mile and the Cowgate, were exacerbated. Poor sanitary arrangements resulted in a high incidence of disease, with outbreaks of cholera occurring in 1832, 1848 and 1866.The construction of the New Town from 1767 onwards witnessed the migration of the professional and business classes from the difficult living conditions in the Old Town to the lower density, higher quality surroundings taking shape on land to the north.\n Expansion southwards from the Old Town saw more tenements being built in the 19th century, giving rise to Victorian suburbs such as Dalry, Newington, Marchmont and Bruntsfield.Early 20th-century population growth coincided with lower-density suburban development. As the city expanded to the south and west, detached and semi-detached villas with large gardens replaced tenements as the predominant building style. Nonetheless, the 2001 census revealed that over 55% of Edinburgh's population were still living in tenements or blocks of flats, a figure in line with other Scottish cities, but much higher than other British cities, and even central London.From the early to mid 20th century, the growth in population, together with slum clearance in the Old Town and other areas, such as Dumbiedykes, Leith, and Fountainbridge, led to the creation of new estates such as Stenhouse and Saughton, Craigmillar and Niddrie, Pilton and Muirhouse, Piershill, and Sighthill.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nIn 2018 the Church of Scotland had 20,956 members in 71 congregations in the Presbytery of Edinburgh. Its most prominent church is St Giles' on the Royal Mile, first dedicated in 1243 but believed to date from before the 12th century. Saint Giles is historically the patron saint of Edinburgh. St Cuthbert's, situated at the west end of Princes Street Gardens in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle and St Giles' can lay claim to being the oldest Christian sites in the city, though the present St Cuthbert's, designed by Hippolyte Blanc, was dedicated in 1894.Other Church of Scotland churches include Greyfriars Kirk, the Canongate Kirk, St Andrew's and St George's West Church and the Barclay Church. The Church of Scotland Offices are in Edinburgh, as is the Assembly Hall where the annual General Assembly is held.The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh has 27 parishes across the city. The Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh has his official residence in Greenhill, and the diocesan offices are in nearby Marchmont. The Diocese of Edinburgh of the Scottish Episcopal Church has over 50 churches, half of them in the city. Its centre is the late-19th-century Gothic style St Mary's Cathedral in the West End's Palmerston Place. Orthodox Christianity is represented by Pan, Romanian and Russian Orthodox churches. There are several independent churches in the city, both Catholic and Protestant, including Charlotte Chapel, Carrubbers Christian Centre, Bellevue Chapel and Sacred Heart. There are also churches belonging to Quakers, Christadelphians, Seventh-day Adventists, Church of Christ, Scientist, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and Elim Pentecostal Church.\nMuslims have several places of worship across the city. Edinburgh Central Mosque is the largest Islamic place of worship, is located in Potterrow, on the city's Southside, near Bristo Square. Construction was largely financed by a gift from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and was completed in 1998. There is also an active presence of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community.The first recorded presence of a Jewish community in Edinburgh dates back to the late 18th century. Edinburgh's Orthodox synagogue, opened in 1932, is in Salisbury Road and can accommodate a congregation of 2000. A Liberal Jewish congregation also meets in the city.\nA Sikh gurdwara and a Hindu mandir are located in Leith. The city also has a Brahma Kumaris centre in the Polwarth area.The Edinburgh Buddhist Centre, run by the Triratna Buddhist Community, formerly situated in Melville Terrace, now runs sessions at the Healthy Life Centre, Bread Street. Other Buddhist traditions are represented by groups which meet in the capital: the Community of Interbeing (followers of Thich Nhat Hanh), Rigpa, Samye Dzong, Theravadin, Pure Land and Shambala. There is a S\u014dt\u014d Zen Priory in Portobello and a Theravadin Thai Buddhist Monastery in Slateford Road.Edinburgh is home to an active Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community, and a Theosophical Society meets in Great King Street.Edinburgh has an active Inter-Faith Association.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nEdinburgh has the strongest economy of any city in the United Kingdom outside London and the highest percentage of professionals in the UK with 43% of the population holding a degree-level or professional qualification. According to the Centre for International Competitiveness, it is the most competitive large city in the United Kingdom. It also has the highest gross value added per employee of any city in the UK outside London, measuring \u00a357,594 in 2010. It was named European Best Large City of the Future for Foreign Direct Investment and Best Large City for Foreign Direct Investment Strategy in the Financial Times fDi magazine awards 2012/13.\nIn the 19th century, Edinburgh's economy was known for banking, publishing and brewing. Today, its economy is based mainly on financial services, scientific research, higher education, and tourism. In March 2010, unemployment in Edinburgh was comparatively low at 3.6%, and it remains consistently below the Scottish average of 4.5%. Edinburgh is the second most visited city by foreign visitors in the UK after London.\nBanking has been a mainstay of the Edinburgh economy for over 300 years, since the Bank of Scotland was established by an act of the Scottish Parliament in 1695. Today, the financial services industry, with its particularly strong insurance and investment sectors, and underpinned by Edinburgh-based firms such as Scottish Widows and Standard Life Aberdeen, accounts for the city being the UK's second financial centre after London and Europe's fourth in terms of equity assets. The NatWest Group (formerly Royal Bank of Scotland Group) opened new global headquarters at Gogarburn in the west of the city in October 2005. The city is home to the headquarters of Bank of Scotland, Sainsbury's Bank, Tesco Bank, and TSB Bank.\n\nTourism is also an important element in the city's economy. As a World Heritage Site, tourists visit historical sites such as Edinburgh Castle, the Palace of Holyroodhouse and the Old and New Towns. Their numbers are augmented in August each year during the Edinburgh Festivals, which attracts 4.4 million visitors, and generates over \u00a3100m for the local economy.As the centre of Scotland's government and legal system, the public sector plays a central role in Edinburgh's economy. Many departments of the Scottish Government are in the city. Other major employers include NHS Scotland and local government administration. When the \u00a31.3bn Edinburgh & South East Scotland City Region Deal was signed in 2018, the region's Gross Value Added (GVA) contribution to the Scottish economy was cited as \u00a333bn, or 33% of the country's output. But the Deal's partners noted that prosperity was not evenly spread across the city region, citing 22.4% of children living in poverty and a shortage of affordable housing.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Festivals and celebrations ===\n\n\n==== Edinburgh festival ====\n\nThe city hosts a series of festivals that run between the end of July and early September each year. The best known of these events are the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Edinburgh International Festival, the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, the Edinburgh Art Festival and the Edinburgh International Book Festival.\n\nThe longest established of these festivals is the Edinburgh International Festival, which was first held in 1947 and consists mainly of a programme of high-profile theatre productions and classical music performances, featuring international directors, conductors, theatre companies and orchestras.This has since been overtaken in size by the Edinburgh Fringe which began as a programme of marginal acts alongside the \"official\" Festival and has become the world's largest performing arts festival. In 2017, nearly 3400 different shows were staged in 300 venues across the city. Comedy has become one of the mainstays of the Fringe, with numerous well-known comedians getting their first 'break' there, often by being chosen to receive the Edinburgh Comedy Award. The Edinburgh Military Tattoo, occupies the Castle Esplanade every night for three weeks each August, with massed pipe bands and military bands drawn from around the world. Performances end with a short fireworks display.\nAs well as the various summer festivals, many other festivals are held during the rest of the year, including the Edinburgh International Film Festival and Edinburgh International Science Festival.The summer of 2020 was the first time in its 70-year history that the Edinburgh festival was not run, being cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This affected many of the tourist-focused businesses in Edinburgh which depend on the various festivals over summer to return an annual profit.\n\n\n==== Edinburgh's Hogmanay ====\n\nThe annual Edinburgh Hogmanay celebration was originally an informal street party focused on the Tron Kirk in the Old Town's High Street. Since 1993, it has been officially organised with the focus moved to Princes Street. In 1996, over 300,000 people attended, leading to ticketing of the main street party in later years up to a limit of 100,000 tickets. Hogmanay now covers four days of processions, concerts and fireworks, with the street party beginning on Hogmanay. Alternative tickets are available for entrance into the Princes Street Gardens concert and C\u00e8ilidh, where well-known artists perform and ticket holders can participate in traditional Scottish c\u00e8ilidh dancing. The event attracts thousands of people from all over the world.\n\n\n==== Beltane and other festivals ====\nOn the night of 30 April the Beltane Fire Festival takes place on Calton Hill, involving a procession followed by scenes inspired by pagan old spring fertility celebrations. At the beginning of October each year the Dussehra Hindu Festival is also held on Calton Hill.\n\n\n=== Music, theatre and film ===\n\nOutside the Festival season, Edinburgh supports several theatres and production companies. The Royal Lyceum Theatre has its own company, while the King's Theatre, Edinburgh Festival Theatre and Edinburgh Playhouse stage large touring shows. The Traverse Theatre presents a more contemporary repertoire. Amateur theatre companies productions are staged at the Bedlam Theatre, Church Hill Theatre and King's Theatre among others.The Usher Hall is Edinburgh's premier venue for classical music, as well as occasional popular music concerts. It was the venue for the Eurovision Song Contest 1972. Other halls staging music and theatre include The Hub, the Assembly Rooms and the Queen's Hall. The Scottish Chamber Orchestra is based in Edinburgh.\n\nEdinburgh has two repertory cinemas, the Edinburgh Filmhouse and The Cameo, as well as the independent Dominion Cinema and a range of multiplexes.Edinburgh has a healthy popular music scene. Occasionally large concerts are staged at Murrayfield and Meadowbank, while mid-sized events take place at smaller venues such as 'The Corn Exchange', 'The Liquid Rooms' and 'The Bongo Club'. In 2010, PRS for Music listed Edinburgh among the UK's top ten 'most musical' cities. Several city pubs are well known for their live performances of folk music. They include 'Sandy Bell's' in Forrest Road, 'Captain's Bar' in South College Street and 'Whistlebinkies' in South Bridge.\nLike many other cities in the UK, numerous nightclub venues host Electronic dance music events.Edinburgh is home to a flourishing group of contemporary composers such as Nigel Osborne, Peter Nelson, Lyell Cresswell, Hafli\u00f0i Hallgr\u00edmsson, Edward Harper, Robert Crawford, Robert Dow and John McLeod. McLeod's music is heard regularly on BBC Radio 3 and throughout the UK.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\n\n==== Newspapers ====\nThe main local newspaper is the Edinburgh Evening News. It is owned and published alongside its sister titles The Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday by JPIMedia.\n\n\n==== Radio ====\nThe city has two commercial radio stations: Forth 1, a station which broadcasts mainstream chart music, and Forth 2 on medium wave which plays classic hits. Capital Radio Scotland and Eklipse Sports Radio also have transmitters covering Edinburgh. Along with the UK national radio stations, Radio Scotland and the Gaelic language service BBC Radio nan G\u00e0idheal are also broadcast. DAB digital radio is broadcast over two local multiplexes. BFBS Radio broadcasts from studios on the base at Dreghorn Barracks across the city on 98.5FM as part of its UK Bases network\n\n\n==== Television ====\nTelevision, along with most radio services, is broadcast to the city from the Craigkelly transmitting station situated in Fife on the opposite side of the Firth of Forth and the Black Hill transmitting station in North Lanarkshire to the west.\nThere are currently no television stations based in the city. Edinburgh Television existed in the late 1990s to early 2003 and STV Edinburgh existed from 2015 to 2018.\n\n\n=== Museums, libraries and galleries ===\n\nEdinburgh has many museums and libraries. These include the National Museum of Scotland, the National Library of Scotland, National War Museum, the Museum of Edinburgh, Surgeons' Hall Museum, the Writers' Museum, the Museum of Childhood and Dynamic Earth. The Museum on The Mound has exhibits on money and banking.Edinburgh Zoo, covering 82 acres (33 ha) on Corstorphine Hill, is the second most visited paid tourist attraction in Scotland, and currently home to two giant pandas, Tian Tian and Yang Guang, on loan from the People's Republic of China.\nEdinburgh is also home to The Royal Yacht Britannia, decommissioned in 1997 and now a five-star visitor attraction and evening events venue permanently berthed at Ocean Terminal.\nEdinburgh contains Scotland's three National Galleries of Art as well as numerous smaller art galleries. The national collection is housed in the Scottish National Gallery, located on The Mound, comprising the linked National Gallery of Scotland building and the Royal Scottish Academy building. Contemporary collections are shown in the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art which occupies a split site at Belford. The Scottish National Portrait Gallery on Queen Street focuses on portraits and photography.\n\nThe council-owned City Art Centre in Market Street mounts regular art exhibitions. Across the road, The Fruitmarket Gallery offers world-class exhibitions of contemporary art, featuring work by British and international artists with both emerging and established international reputations.The city hosts several of Scotland's galleries and organisations dedicated to contemporary visual art. Significant strands of this infrastructure include Creative Scotland, Edinburgh College of Art, Talbot Rice Gallery (University of Edinburgh), Collective Gallery (based at the City Observatory) and the Edinburgh Annuale.\nThere are also many small private shops/galleries that provide space to showcase works from local artists.\n\n\n=== Shopping ===\nThe locale around Princes Street is the main shopping area in the city centre, with souvenir shops, chain stores such as Boots the Chemist, Edinburgh Woollen Mill, H&M and Jenners. George Street, north of Princes Street, is the preferred location for some upmarket shops and independent stores. At the east end of Princes Street, the St. James Centre is currently being redeveloped  while next to the Balmoral Hotel and Waverley Station is the Waverley Mall. Multrees Walk, adjacent to the St. James Centre, is a recent addition to the central shopping district, dominated by the presence of Harvey Nichols. Shops here include Louis Vuitton, Mulberry and Calvin Klein.Edinburgh also has substantial retail parks outside the city centre. These include The Gyle Shopping Centre and Hermiston Gait in the west of the city, Cameron Toll Shopping Centre, Straiton Retail Park (actually just outside the city, in Midlothian) and Fort Kinnaird in the south and east, and Ocean Terminal in the north on the Leith waterfront.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\n\n=== Local government ===\n\nFollowing local government reorganisation in 1996, the City of Edinburgh Council constitutes one of the 32 council areas of Scotland. Like all other local authorities of Scotland, the council has powers over most matters of local administration such as housing, planning, local transport, parks, economic development and regeneration. The council comprises 58 elected councillors, returned from 17 multi-member electoral wards in the city. Following the 2007 City of Edinburgh Council election the incumbent Labour Party lost majority control of the council after 23 years to a Liberal Democrat/SNP coalition. The 2012 City of Edinburgh Council election saw a Scottish Labour/SNP coalition. The 2017 City of Edinburgh Council election, saw a continuation of this administration, but with the SNP as the largest party.\nThe city's coat of arms was registered by the Lord Lyon King of Arms in 1732.\n\n\n=== Scottish Parliament ===\n\nEdinburgh, like all of Scotland, is represented in the Scottish Parliament. For electoral purposes, the city is divided into six constituencies which, along with 3 seats outside of the city, form part of the Lothian region. Each constituency elects one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) by the first past the post system of election, and the region elects seven additional MSPs to produce a result based on a form of proportional representation.As of the 2016 election, the Scottish National Party have three MSPs: Ash Denham for Edinburgh Eastern, Ben Macpherson for Edinburgh Northern and Leith and Gordon MacDonald for Edinburgh Pentlands constituencies. Alex Cole-Hamilton of the Scottish Liberal Democrats represents Edinburgh Western, Daniel Johnson of the Scottish Labour Party represents Edinburgh Southern constituency, and former Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party, Ruth Davidson currently represents the Edinburgh Central constituency.\n\n\n=== UK Parliament ===\n\nEdinburgh is also represented in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom by five Members of Parliament. The city is divided into Edinburgh North and Leith, Edinburgh East, Edinburgh South, Edinburgh South West, and Edinburgh West, each constituency electing one member by the first past the post system. Edinburgh is currently represented by three MPs affiliated with the Scottish National Party, one Liberal Democrat MP in Edinburgh West and one Labour MP in Edinburgh South.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nEdinburgh Airport is Scotland's busiest airport and the principal international gateway to the capital, handling over 14.7 million passengers, it was also the sixth-busiest airport in the United Kingdom by total passengers in 2019. In anticipation of rising passenger numbers, the former operator of the airport BAA outlined a draft masterplan in 2011 to provide for the expansion of the airfield and the terminal building. In June 2012, Global Infrastructure Partners purchased the airport for \u00a3807 million. The possibility of building a second runway to cope with an increased number of aircraft movements has also been mooted.Travel in Edinburgh is undertaken predominantly by bus. Lothian Buses, the successor company to Edinburgh Corporation Transport Department, operate the majority of city bus services within the city and to surrounding suburbs, with the most routes running via Princes Street. Services further afield operate from the Edinburgh Bus Station off St Andrew Square and Waterloo Place and are operated mainly by Stagecoach East Scotland, Scottish Citylink, National Express Coaches and Borders Buses.\nLothian Buses also operates all of the city's branded public tour buses, night bus service and airport bus link. In 2019, Lothian Buses recorded 124.2 million passenger journeys.\n\nEdinburgh Waverley is the second-busiest railway station in Scotland, with only Glasgow Central handling more passengers. On the evidence of passenger entries and exits between April 2015 and March 2016, Edinburgh Waverley is the fifth-busiest station outside London; it is also the UK's second biggest station in terms of the number of platforms and area size. Waverley is the terminus for most trains arriving from London King's Cross and the departure point for many rail services within Scotland operated by Abellio ScotRail.\nTo the west of the city centre lies Haymarket Station which is an important commuter stop. Opened in 2003, Edinburgh Park station serves the Gyle business park in the west of the city and the nearby Gogarburn headquarters of the Royal Bank of Scotland. The Edinburgh Crossrail route connects Edinburgh Park with Haymarket, Edinburgh Waverley and the suburban stations of Brunstane and Newcraighall in the east of the city. There are also commuter lines to South Gyle and Dalmeny, the latter serving South Queensferry by the Forth Bridges, and to Wester Hailes and Curriehill in the south-west of the city.\nTo tackle traffic congestion, Edinburgh is now served by six park and ride sites on the periphery of the city at Sheriffhall (in Midlothian), Ingliston, Riccarton, Inverkeithing (in Fife), Newcraighall and Straiton (in Midlothian). A referendum of Edinburgh residents in February 2005 rejected a proposal to introduce congestion charging in the city.\n\nEdinburgh Trams became operational on 31 May 2014.  The city had been without a tram system since Edinburgh Corporation Tramways ceased on 16 November 1956. Following parliamentary approval in 2007, construction began in early 2008. The first stage of the project was expected to be completed by July 2011 but, following delays caused by extra utility work and a long-running contractual dispute between the council and the main contractor, Bilfinger SE, the project was rescheduled. The cost of the project rose from the original projection of \u00a3545 million to \u00a3750 million in mid-2011 and some suggest it could eventually exceed \u00a31 billion. The completed line is 8.7 miles (14.0 km) in length, running from Edinburgh Airport, west of the city, to its current terminus at York Place in the city centre's East End. It was originally planned to continue down Leith Walk to Ocean Terminal and  terminate at Newhaven.\nShould the original plan be taken to completion, trams will also run from Haymarket through Ravelston and Craigleith to Granton Square on the Waterfront Edinburgh. Long-term proposals envisage a line running west from the airport to Ratho and Newbridge and another connecting Granton Square to Newhaven via Lower Granton Road, thus completing the Line 1 (North Edinburgh) loop. A further line serving the south of the city has also been suggested.\nLothian Buses and Edinburgh Trams are both owned and operated by Transport for Edinburgh.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThere are three universities in Edinburgh, the University of Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt University and Edinburgh Napier University.\nEstablished by royal charter in 1583, the University of Edinburgh is one of Scotland's ancient universities and is the fourth oldest in the country after St Andrews, Glasgow and Aberdeen. Originally centred on Old College the university expanded to premises on The Mound, the Royal Mile and George Square. Today, the King's Buildings in the south of the city contain most of the schools within the College of Science and Engineering. In 2002, the medical school moved to purpose built accommodation adjacent to the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh at Little France. The University is placed 20th in the QS World University Rankings for 2020.Heriot-Watt University is based at the Riccarton campus in the west of Edinburgh. Originally established in 1821 as the world's first mechanics' institute it was granted university status by royal charter in 1966. It has other campuses in the Scottish Borders, Orkney, United Arab Emirates and Putrajaya in Malaysia. It takes the name Heriot-Watt from Scottish inventor James Watt and Scottish philanthropist and goldsmith George Heriot. Heriot-Watt University has been named International University of the Year by The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2018. In the latest Research Excellence Framework, it was ranked overall in the Top 25% of UK universities and 1st in Scotland for research impact.\nEdinburgh Napier University was originally founded as the Napier College which was renamed Napier Polytechnic in 1986 and gained university status in 1992. Edinburgh Napier University has campuses in the south and west of the city, including the former Merchiston Tower and Craiglockhart Hydropathic. It is home to the Screen Academy Scotland.\nQueen Margaret University was located in Edinburgh before it moved to a new campus just outside the city boundaries on the edge of Musselburgh in 2008. Until 2012 further education colleges in the city included Jewel and Esk College (incorporating Leith Nautical College founded in 1903), Telford College, opened in 1968, and Stevenson College, opened in 1970. These have now been amalgamated to form Edinburgh College. Scotland's Rural College also has a campus in south Edinburgh. Other institutions include the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh which were established by royal charter in 1506 and 1681 respectively. The Trustees Drawing Academy of Edinburgh, founded in 1760, became the Edinburgh College of Art in 1907.There are 18 nursery, 94 primary and 23 secondary schools administered by the City of Edinburgh Council.\nEdinburgh is home to The Royal High School, one of the oldest schools in the country and the world. The city also has several independent, fee-paying schools including Edinburgh Academy, Fettes College, George Heriot's School, George Watson's College, Merchiston Castle School, Stewart's Melville College and The Mary Erskine School. In 2009, the proportion of pupils attending independent schools was 24.2%, far above the Scottish national average of just over 7% and higher than in any other region of Scotland. In August 2013, the City of Edinburgh Council opened the city's first stand-alone Gaelic primary school, Bun-sgoil Taobh na P\u00e0irce.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nThe main NHS Lothian hospitals serving the Edinburgh area are the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, which includes the University of Edinburgh Medical School, and the Western General Hospital, which has a large cancer treatment centre and nurse-led Minor Injuries Clinic. The Royal Edinburgh Hospital in Morningside specialises in mental health. The Royal Hospital for Sick Children, colloquially referred to as 'the Sick Kids', is a specialist paediatrics hospital.\nThere are two private hospitals: Murrayfield Hospital in the west of the city and Shawfair Hospital in the south. Both are owned by Spire Healthcare.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\n\n==== Men's ====\nEdinburgh has three football clubs that play in the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL): Heart of Midlothian, founded in 1874, Hibernian, founded in 1875 and  Edinburgh City, founded in 1966.\nHeart of Midlothian and Hibernian are known locally as \"Hearts\" and \"Hibs\", respectively. The former plays in the Scottish Championship, the second-highest division of professional football in Scotland, while the latter plays in the top-level Scottish Premiership. They are the oldest city rivals in Scotland and the Edinburgh derby is one of the oldest derby matches in world football. Both clubs have won the Scottish league championship four times. Hearts have won the Scottish Cup eight times and the Scottish League Cup four times. Hibs have won the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup three times each. Edinburgh City were promoted to Scottish League Two in the 2015\u201316 season, becoming the first club to win promotion to the SPFL via the pyramid system playoffs.\nEdinburgh was also home to four other former Scottish Football League clubs: the original Edinburgh City (founded in 1928), Leith Athletic, Meadowbank Thistle and St Bernard's. Meadowbank Thistle played at Meadowbank Stadium until 1995, when the club moved to Livingston and became Livingston F.C. The Scottish national team has very occasionally played at Easter Road and Tynecastle, although its normal home stadium is Hampden Park in Glasgow. St Bernard's' New Logie Green was used to host the 1896 Scottish Cup Final, the only time the match has been played outside Glasgow.The city also plays host to Lowland Football League clubs Civil Service Strollers, Edinburgh University and Spartans, as well as East of Scotland League clubs Craigroyston, Edinburgh United, Heriot-Watt University, Leith Athletic, Lothian Thistle Hutchison Vale, and Tynecastle.\n\n\n==== Women's ====\nIn women's football, Hearts, Hibs and Spartans play in the SWPL 1. Hutchison Vale play in the SWPL 2.\n\n\n=== Rugby ===\nThe Scotland national rugby union team and the professional Edinburgh Rugby team play at Murrayfield Stadium, which is owned by the Scottish Rugby Union and also used for other events, including music concerts.

Murrayfield Stadium has hosted the Magic Weekend where all Super League matches are played in the stadium over one weekend.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\nThe Scottish cricket team, which represents Scotland internationally, play their home matches at the Grange cricket club.The Murrayfield Racers are the latest of a succession of ice hockey clubs in the Scottish capital. Previously Edinburgh was represented by the Edinburgh Capitals (who folded in 2018), the original Murrayfield Racers (who folded in 1996) and the Edinburgh Racers. The club play their home games at the Murrayfield Ice Rink and have competed in the eleven-team professional Scottish National League (SNL) since the 2018\u201319 season.Next door to Murrayfield Ice Rink is a 7-sheeter dedicated curling facility where curling is played from October to March each season.\nCaledonia Pride are the only women's professional basketball team in Scotland. Established in 2016, the team compete in the UK wide Women's British Basketball League and play their home matches at the Oriam National Performance Centre. Edinburgh also has several men's basketball teams within the Scottish National League. Boroughmuir Blaze, City of Edinburgh Kings, Edinburgh Lions and Edinburgh University all compete in Division 1 of the National League, and Pleasance B.C. compete in Division 2. Boroughmuir won the league in 2016, and won the playoffs in the same year, beating the University in the final.\nThe Edinburgh Diamond Devils is a baseball club which won its first Scottish Championship in 1991 as the \"Reivers.\" 1992 saw the team repeat the achievement, becoming the first team to do so in league history. The same year saw the start of their first youth team, the Blue Jays. The club adopted its present name in 1999.Edinburgh has also hosted national and international sports events including the World Student Games, the 1970 British Commonwealth Games, the 1986 Commonwealth Games and the inaugural 2000 Commonwealth Youth Games. For the 1970 Games the city built Olympic standard venues and facilities including Meadowbank Stadium and the Royal Commonwealth Pool. The Pool underwent refurbishment in 2012 and hosted the Diving competition in the 2014 Commonwealth Games which were held in Glasgow.In American football, the Scottish Claymores played WLAF/NFL Europe games at Murrayfield, including their World Bowl 96 victory. From 1995 to 1997 they played all their games there, from 1998 to 2000 they split their home matches between Murrayfield and Glasgow's Hampden Park, then moved to Glasgow full-time, with one final Murrayfield appearance in 2002. The city's most successful non-professional team are the Edinburgh Wolves who play at Meadowbank Stadium.The Edinburgh Marathon has been held annually in the city since 2003 with more than 16,000 runners taking part on each occasion. Its organisers have called it \"the fastest marathon in the UK\" due to the elevation drop of 40 metres (130 ft). The city also organises a half-marathon, as well as 10 km (6.2 miles) and 5 km (3.1 mi) races, including a 5 km (3 miles) race on 1 January each year.\nEdinburgh has a speedway team, the Edinburgh Monarchs, which, since the loss of its stadium in the city, has raced at the Lothian Arena in Armadale, West Lothian. The Monarchs have won the Premier League championship five times in their history, in 2003 and again in 2008, 2010, 2014 and 2015.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\n \n\nEdinburgh has a long literary tradition, which became especially evident during the Scottish Enlightenment. This heritage and the city's lively literary life in the present led to it being declared the first UNESCO City of Literature in 2004. Prominent authors who have lived in Edinburgh include the economist Adam Smith, born in Kirkcaldy and author of The Wealth of Nations, James Boswell, biographer of Samuel Johnson; Sir Walter Scott, creator of the historical novel and author of works such as Rob Roy, Ivanhoe, and Heart of Midlothian; James Hogg, author of The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner; Robert Louis Stevenson, creator of Treasure Island, Kidnapped, and The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes; Muriel Spark, author of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie; Irvine Welsh, author of Trainspotting, whose novels are mostly set in the city and often written in colloquial Scots;\n Ian Rankin, author of the Inspector Rebus series of crime thrillers, Alexander McCall Smith, author of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, and J.

Rowling, creator of Harry Potter, who began her first book in an Edinburgh coffee shop and who lives in the Cramond area of the city.\n\nScotland has a rich history of science and engineering, with Edinburgh producing a number of leading figures. John Napier, inventor of logarithms, was born in Merchiston Tower and lived and died in the city. His house now forms part of the original campus of Napier University which was named in his honour. He lies buried under St. Cuthbert's Church. James Clerk Maxwell, founder of the modern theory of electromagnetism, was born at 14 India Street (now the home of the James Clerk Maxwell Foundation) and educated at the Edinburgh Academy and the University of Edinburgh, as was the engineer and telephone pioneer Alexander Graham Bell.

The small Skye Terrier reputedly kept vigil over his dead master's grave in Greyfriars Kirkyard for 14 years in the 1860s and 1870s, giving rise to a story of canine devotion which plays a part in attracting visitors to the city.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\n\nThe City of Edinburgh has entered into 14 international twinning arrangements since 1954.

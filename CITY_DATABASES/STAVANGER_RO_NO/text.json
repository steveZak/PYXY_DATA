          "Learn all about Stavanger\u2019s history with canned fish production, in this case sardines. It\u2019s much better to get the museum curator to explain the process and work the machines for you, rather than wander round on your own. Really interactive for kids (and adults!) with sardine",
          "What a great place to visit. The place was brought alive by the elderly gent who demonstrated the equipment and described the importance of sardines/piltchards etc to the history of Norway and Stavanger. You simply must do his guided tour. The film after the tour was fun and as",

          "We loved this Museum but I think because we ran into the tour guide (not a very crowded museum) and he offered us a tour it made Sardines so much more interesting. These little smoked fish have been the backbone of the area since the 1800's....very important commodity! The",
          "Despite my total lack of interest in sardines I found this a fascinating museum (next week I am off to visit a shoe museum in Zlin so maybe my standards need revision). There was lots of interesting stuff about how the sardines (sprats actually) were treated, processed and",

          "We were suggested to visit this museum by the information tourist bureau which we don\u2019t regret it. It is situated in the old town area, not far from where the dock of our cruise ship was. We were greeted by friendly staff , they offered a guided tour which is a good thing since",
          "We crused through the city with electro bikes and our first stop was this museum because of trip advisor. It was stunning! You need to start at the top with the silent film then it is way better. It\u2018s unbelievable how the sardine cans were made more than a hundred years ago.",
          "Opens your eyes to how hard the people worked. When we tried to get 12 sardines in a tin our fingers were not nimble enough. Watching the old black and white movies was GREAT!!! You saw step by step how the canning process. Now I want to read the biography of Angus Watson.",
          "Very interesting to see how sardines were caught, processed and canned.This was a major industry prior to oil. You can see how very Labour intensive it was and the mechanization that was introduced. We had a very helpful guide who explained the process and the social history.",

It\u2019s very entertaining and we learned all we needed to know about the herring industry and canning. It\u2019s a bit of a guddle and not easy to make your way",
          "Interesting and unique, but this facility needs better lighting and more thought given to the order of presentation and how the flow of items and information should be handled. In my opinion, Stavanger should consider combining several of their museums into one large facility.",
          "I've seen the museum a few times while walking around Stavanger and finally decided today was the day to visit. It's only small but people are on hand to explain things to you. There are also things you can do for yourself like trying to put the fish into the cans in a very",

          "This museum is well worth visiting. Situated in the \"Old Stavanger\" giving an interesting history of the past and once an important industry in Stavanger. There also a small cafe with coffee and \"Waffles\". Sardines were exported in large quantities up to about 1960.",
          "Now this might not sound like the most thrilling place to visit, but I absolutely loved it! The canning museum is in the old part of Stavanger, close to the harbour, and is housed in some gorgeous old factory buildings. There is a ton of authentic old machinery at the museum,",

          "This visit reminded me of a student job I had in a Shetland herring factory. There was even the same smell from the smoking rooms! The guides were very willing to explain the various factory machines and let us try to pack pretend sardines into a can. The original workers did",

          "This is really Stavanger's history - it was a fishing town before the discovery of oil. This is a small museum, developed in a premises where a small canning factory operated until the 1950s. We have all probably eaten sardines that were canned there and exported to UK and",

          "If your ship docks in Stavanger take the time to do a 10 minute walk around the end of the harbour and visit the Stavanger Cathedral. It is beautiful! The first thing that strikes you as you enter is the simplicity and grandeur of this old house of worship. I think we are all",
          "We were lucky to visit while a rehearsal was going on so we not only got to enjoy the strong architecture and beautiful lighting, but also the acoustics. Recommend enjoying both the inside and the surrounding grounds.",
          "Not the most interesting place to spend time in. 5min will do. They even charged an entrance fee of 50NOK.",
          "Beautiful cathedral , amazing inside and out. Set in a lovely square you can still see parts that were not destoryed by fire several hundred years ago",
          "The Cathedral will be celebrating 900 years in 2025, so they will soon be giving it a face lift. Don't know if it will be closed to the public then or not. It is amazing how it has stood this number of years, despite a fire that destroyed it's roof. It is a blend of Gothic",
          "It is in the midle of the city and the only Norwegian cathedral in continuous use since the 1300s. Norway\u2019s best-kept cathedral is located only a stone\u2019s throw from the Stavanger harbour. This is the only cathedral from the Middle Age that has kept its original",
          "St Swithun\u2019s is well worth a visit. Unfortunately the frontage was all covered with scaffolding and sheeting when we were there but the inside is well worth 30 minutes of your time",
          "There is something different about this church compared to similar churches. This was built to last and has wonderful masterpieces to view on the walls and there is no charge. Look back up at the organ and there is glass boxes on the floor with old artefact. There is currently",
          "With limited time available came to visit but couldn\u2019t get in. Had to make do with walking round outside. Appreciate the Cathedral was built around 1150 and it appears to have some interesting windows. It\u2019s age alone would make this a worthwhile visit. Easy walking distance",
          "We didn't actually go inside this cathedral as we were time limited but it looked beautiful from the outside. There was some renovation going on and there were boards telling you what was going on. Worth a look although there is an entrance fee.",
          "Having spent the last couple of years visiting many spectacular cathedrals in Spain and Italy, we didn\u2019t expect much from Stavanger. This cathedral, however, has a fascinating history and a feeling of solidity that sits well in this Norwegian town. The pulpit is stunning, as are",
          "Norway\u2019s oldest cathedral built early 12th century lies near the harbor and along a picturesque lake. When I first visited in 1979 the entrance to this cathedral was free. \u201cAbout eight years ago,\u201d as I was told, \u201cthe church started charging\u201d\u201450kr/$5.00USD\u2014with the influx of",
          "Entrance costs 25 NOK and discourage to visit. From outside looks nice but doesn\u2019t knock down on knees ;-)",
          "Although they charge to go in (either NOK or credit card), the church actually has some unique features that are worth seeing. The wooden plaques (not sure what to call them) from 1650's are very well done by the woodcarver and are in excellent shape.",
          "Very pretty cathedral. Nice for a quick visit. Do have to pay to get into the Cathedral and some renovation work is going on.",
          "This cathedral is listed as the oldest in Norway and situated in the centre of the town. The main stain glass windows were being refurbished and won't be back in place until 2025, but the rest of the building is still worth a visit. It's about \u00a35 entry.",
          "Lovely place easily walked from the cruise terminal unfortunately it is currently renovated but is due to be complete in October 2019. The surrounding areas and lake are stunning and well worth a visit with fabulous scenery",
          "Very beautiful smaller cathedral. Very interesting history and construction. Under renovation. Lovely architecture. Well worth the visit.",
          "This cathedral is interesting to walk through with numerous items of worth noting. It is actually not very large, though, and our visit ended up being rather brief. For us, worth the short walk.",
          "This is a beautiful little cathedral which is quite nice to spend some time in. I did especially love the pulpit-- one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. Rick Steves' book had a nice tour including some easter eggs on the pillars which were fun to find.",
          "Highlights of this church include half is Roman,  half is gothic. The Pulpit is amazing,  one of the best we've ever seen. So much detail. Worth the visit. There are 5 large carvings on the wall by the same artist which are also very detailed. The stained glass they advertised",
          "Slightly disappointing to find the front of the cathedral covered, apparently the restoration work won't be finished until 2025. Inside the cathedral was simply impressive especially the 7 wooden epitaphs.",
          "A stunning example of old traditional Nirwegian Cathedral. The interior is minimalist until.you look more closely at the stunning art work on the walls and the highly ornate decorative pulpit.",
          "You pay a fee to enter but it is worth it. The inside and outside of this ancient cathedral are gorgeous and they allow photos. There are informational panels by the different features. Also, listen for the bells to chime the hour.",
          "Not a huge cathedral but it\u2019s in keeping with the charming city of Stavanger. Not far from the shopping area and the cruise terminal.",
          "Also known as Domkirken or St Swithun\u2019s Cathedral, it is the oldest Cathedral in Norway. Once inside, you will see one of the best-preserved medieval cathedrals in Europe. Established in 1125 as a Lutheran church, the Cathedral was the resting place for the arm of St Swithun.",
          "Looked beautiful and interesting from the outside. Did not get to see anything else as under renovation.",
          "It's a bit tricky to get into the building, queuing can occur due to the limited ticket sale facilities and volunteers, who try to manage the flow of tourists through the structure. Small structure inside, not easy to take photos, very crowded. Still, impressively old, building",
          "The fact that the cathedral was undergoing some renovation did not diminish its appeal! The most impressive feature is its beautifully ornate, brightly-painted and carved pulpit!!!!!!",
          "Expensive for the size of the facility but isn't everything expensive in Norway, particularly food. The interior is interesting particularly the wooden carvings of the pulpit.",
          "The original glass stained glass windows are being renovated, such a shame because the pictures of the originals show that this would have been a lovely place to visit on a walk around Stavanger. Small yet interesting place and the entrance fee, given the main attraction weren't",
          "The cathedral is in the process of renovation prior to a major anniversary celebration so it is not possible to see the whole of the exterior at the moment. It is tiny for a cathedral but delightful and contains some wonderful carvings done by an English craftsman. There",
          "It cost 50 NOK which is understandable, but I am not sure if I would say it is worth the money if you, like us, have visited many churches.",
          "The wooden pulpit and wooden effigies are amazing examples of the craft. However, the dom is under renovation, so it is difficult to see everything one would like. Taking photos is allowed.",
          "This beautiful cathedral was so different from the Catholic Cathedrals of Europe. It is Lutherian and it's beauty is in its simplicity. Beautiful carved wood pulpits and memorials. The stonework is so solid, tactile, wonderful atmosphere. Well worth visiting.",
          "Sorry Stavanger Cathedral but you are not worth the 50 Krone entrance fee. Small dank cathedral with pretty windows. Think more money would be gained by lowering the entrance fee to entice visitors in and then its likely more donations would be given. My advice is to stay",
          "A small Cathedral not far from the quayside. Unfortunately lots of scaffolding around the building so unable to admire fully. Lovely narrow cobbled streets to get there",
          "a fantastic space maybe based on winchester. its small in comparison but still worth looking through and taking a quiet moment. i think its norways oldest cathederal.",
          "Compact Cathedral unfortunately front covered in scaffolding when we visited but good architectural interest. Set in a small park with large pond full of ducks and swan",
          "Cathedral wise this isn't a very big building but what it hasn't in size it has in history built in 1225 and some excellent interior epitaphs and the pulpit which to me is the main feature which covers the complete history of the bible starting with Adam and Eve.There are other",
          "Built in 1225, it is Norway's oldest cathedral. It is beautiful both inside & outside. It is just off the town center & easy to get to.",
          "The building itself has a long and rich history, and the range of architectural styles used in construction should be enough to keep anyone mildly interested in architecture happy for 30 minutes.",
          "The Stavanger Cathedral , aka \"Domkirken\" is located in down-town Stavanger. It was build in 1125 and the Cathedral has been a focal Stavanger town. One little challenge \"Domkirken\" is that there is always some maintenance work going on.",
          "I have been to dozens of Middle Ages churches, both stone and stavkirke. This is the best in Norway, much better than Trondheim. Make sure you look for the detail carvings on the columns, top and bottom. They are all different and tell a story. I find this to be a very holy",
          "Has history to this cathedral. Once inside there is a sense of calm and tranquility. The artwork inside is phenomenal.",
          "This is a very significant cathedral - built in 1125. Unfortunately, it was closed for renovations while we were here but my husband managed to sneak a look when the cleaning crew let him in. By his accounts, it was fascinating",
          "This is a a lovely cathedral with an amazing carved wood pulpit. It is a bit less elaborate in general, as it is in part Romanesque. However, it is harder to find such wonderful examples of Romanesque architecture.",
          "Walked past here several times during my stay in Stavanger. Just a normal cathedral to be honest. All cathedrals have nice architecture in general but this one had no wow factor that makes it a must visit.",
          "There is an admission fee, but it's a fascinating visit--and a dry place on a rainy day. Smaller than cathedrals to the south, this one has a fascinating history worth exploring.",
          "The Stavanger cathedral was there before the city was there. Built in ca.1125 this was the start for the entire city. Norway\u00b4s most ancient cathedral in continuous use for almost 900 years. Petite, intimate, cosy and majestic at the same time. The famous Andrew Smith carved",
          "A stunning Cathedral that, although is being currently renovated at the moment, has still lots to offer the visitor. The gem within is the hand carved pulpit, highly decorated and imposing. The immediate surrounding area is also somewhere to relax, especially near the Old",
          "It's more of a church size than a cathedral but it is lovely inside. You pay the mandatory admission fee (30 NKr) but then you are free to spend as much time as you like in there. The decor is a bit of a mixture of styles but the detail is fascinating.",
          "The stone Stavanger Cathedral was built in 1125. As many of these older churches it started out Catholic and then shifted to Lutheran after the Reformation. Our guide told us that the cathedral was built in exchange for a divorce by Bishop Raynalt of England. The style is both",
          "A nice place to visit, especially the adventurous. People here are friendly though some of them prefer you to speak their languages. However, they are eager to help you as long as you make your questions understandable.",
          "A beautiful and ancient old cathedral. Massive ancient hard carved stone columns and a high wood beam roof. An amazing pipe organ and beautiful huge carved memorial plaques carved in the 1600\u2019s to honor past leaders of the church. One of the most impressive and beautiful",

          "Stavanger Domkirke is the Oldest Cathedral still in use in Norway. The original structure was built in the 1100s approximately. From the outside, it looks impressive with one exception. There is some renovation being done at the front of the church. The inside was not open",
          "900 year old church see during a cruise excursion. Lovely carvings and stained glass with interesting interior.",
          "Cost money to see this Cathedral, I liked the vibe and it was worth taking a look. Old style and vibe",
          "Really dramatic and takes the best photos EVER! Its very peaceful and in walking distance from almost everything. It is worth visiting while you are in Stavanger!",
          "Only saw from the outside...it was late and I think they were charging admission to see this really small place. I don't pay to go into church and I'm Catholic.",
          "Almost 900 yrs old now under renovation. We eere lucky to visit a christening. Church music is something special. Worth the visit.",
          "This is a nice quick stop while in the tourist section of town. The cathedral itself is pretty from the outside with great stone work. Inside the carvings from the 1600s are nice as well the pipe organ. Worth a quick look.",
          "This may be special in stavanger, but in global terms it is a small highly restored church with no notable features. There are some nice carvings, but nothing memorable or special. It is an expensive place to pray.",
          "It is a very old cathedral built in 1125. It is closed for at least 2 more years for renovations. They told us that they still have concerts held there but right now none.",
          "While I cannot comment on the interior of the cathedral (it was closed due to a local private concert), the exterior of the building and the building\u2019s history is quit formidable. The area surrounding the cathedral is very quaint, with many local ships selling authentic",
          "Visited this cathedral whilst in Stavanger. What a beautiful church it is! It was very busy as was raining outside and please follow the signs you enter and exit different doors! Very pretty and so peaceful and colourful Highly recommend \ud83d\ude01",
          "This nearly 900 old church is situated in the center of Stavanger. It is undergoing restauration work, and will be closed for public in 2020, but are no open and worth a visit. Tourist needs to pay a fee to visit the cathedral, to cover the cost of caretakers and cleaning. Well",
          "The epitaph carvings were very intricate and worked by an Alexander Smith. I have been unable to find him on Google.",
          "Walked past this beautiful landmark, if you are going to Stavanger you need to come and see this. We learnt about the history of the cathedral and how the two ends are built differently, and that Englishmen built it.",
          "I did a walking tour of this lovely town. The Cathedral was beautiful, built over 50 years between 1100 and 1150 by the English Bishop Reinald. and unchanged over that time frame, worth visiting.",

          "The cathedral is an attractive building. Inside it is not ostentatious. There are only a few stained glass windows, with nature pictures rather than saints. There are also some epitaphs from the 1600's. There is an admission charge of around $6 US, you can pay by credit",
          "This medieval church has some of the most beautiful wood carvings I have ever seen! The church was established in 1125 and is located in the city center.",
          "So close to the cruise port, and a quiet refuge. The 17th century family portraits incorporated into elaborate are a snapshot of a lost period, the carved pulpit ditto.",
          "Up on the hillock overlooking the harbour is the Domkirk - Stavanger's cathedral. It's not the most amazing church I've been in but there are some really nice 17th century monuments (made by a Scot would you know!) Other than that the pulpit is definitely worth a look! Being",
          "As we went to the shopping district, we wandered and found this beautiful cathedral. There is an entrance fee of 50 NOK but worth it ..great things to see.",
          "We were encourged to go to the church because the stained glass was wonderful. When we got there the windows looked almost asian in design and when we asked we were told that the were being repaired and wouldn't be reinstalled till 2019. If we knew that we may have skipped it",
          "You have to pay to go in but only 50 NOK so worth going in. Great artefacts and things to see. Well worth the trip up to the entrance.",
          "Crunched for time, we took a look around the Cathedral before heading into the shopping district for just a short time as well. So much to do, and so little time, since our afternoon was taken up by a boat tour to Pulpit Rock. Still some nice photos.",
          "While walking around Stavanger we come apond the cathedral you can not miss it so high on the sky line. This Cathedral is of gothic style and dates back to around 1125 the wood caved pulpit and the organ were wonderful unfortunately some of the facade is under renovation.",
          "It's a bit disappointing that the cathedral will be under renovation, with parts of the famous facade blocked from view. The renovations are in preparation for the church's 900th anniversary. But it's still a sight to see a structure older than most countries. The cathedral is",
          "I was lucky enough to catch an organ recital in this graceful 10th century church, complete with harpsichord and choir - just lucky! I\u2019m a bit of a fan of medieval European churches, and this Norwegian medieval has all the elements including inspiring medieval masonry etc. It\u2019s",
          "Walking distance from the cruise port. Historic building and free of charge. Definitely worth a visit when in town.",

          "This is the oldest cathedral in Norway built in 1150s with gothic style architecture. It is well maintained with beautiful stained glass at the back but unfortunately was under repair at the time of our visit. My only complaint is that there is an entrance fee of 50 Nkk",
          "Construction of the Cathedral started around 1100 and it was finished around 1150. In 1272 the Cathedral was heavily damaged by the city's fire. Lots of paintings and the pulpit was done by Andrew Smith.Today the Cathedral is again undergoing restorations.",
          "What more can I say, it's a church with some impressive decorated windows, which unfortunately get broken by the local people quite often, so there are often reparations going on.",
          "Lovely small cathedral right by the harbour, very intricate detail to the pulpit. Well worth going inside, even if you don\u2019t have much time.",
          "Nice Cathedral in a good location. The Cathedral has a nice front as well as back, which does not look like back side actually. You\u2019ll never miss it when you go to the city center. It\u2019s big and beautiful.",
          "This cathedral is a building you will not miss as it is central to the main town and has the local park with pond. It has a long history which they are trying to maintain through renovation work.",
          "Originally a Catholic cathedral in 1125 it has seen many changes. Definitely worth the visit when it is open.",
          "A amazing Cathedral in Stavanger, Norway, raised in year 1125. Located in downtown Stavanger and you can`t miss seeing the Cathedral wherever you are. Only one thing which is a bit negative: The Cathedral is more or less covered with some scaffoldings due to maintenance, but",
          "Another on the \u201cto visit list\u201d , my late mother loved visiting churches and this one with its stunning architecture outside and especially in would have been a winner in her eyes . Its a iconic Stavanger Cathedral and well worth a visit .\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude07",
          "It was closed when I went but it is beautiful from outside! It is next to a lake and the scenario during winter is bucolic and romantic.",
          "It appears to have great architecture but they are working on one side so it\u2019s covered. It\u2019s near the harbor and worth the walk.",
          "we visited during a busy day or else its always very busy. A small donation to enter and the walk round is worth it. the Pulpit was hadn't carved by a brit who went to Norway several hundred years ago, it is covered in art work and painted to such a standard it takes your",
          "We\u2019d seen so many beautiful churches by the time we stepped in here that maybe we were bound to be disappointed. It\u2019s quite plain and there\u2019s very little to see. It\u2019s interesting for being so old but that was about it for us.",
          "I was in stavanger for couple of days. The cathedral was under renovation but it was so beautiful. Totally recommend it",
          "It's medieval foundation dates back to the 1100's; subsequent revisions after natural disasters resulted in revisions of a more modern character. There is a fee to enter and it is tricky to figure out how and where that works. Go to the Tourist Information to find out where",
          "I almost didn't go into this cathedral but I am so glad I did. It was really beautiful in there and it smelled so old. Everyone talks about the pulpit and it is quite spectacular but I find that kind of thing a bit off putting and overwrought. What was great about this church",
          "From the 12th century! The carved wooden Pulpit is exquisite! Unfortunately, the stained glass windows were being repaired and restored so we were not able to see them. ( but we did see a picture of what they will look like when finished and I hope to see them like that",
          "On our visit to Stavanger sought out the Cathedral to visit not because of religious interest - purely historical interest. Unfortunately for some reason the doors were locked shut.",
          "The cathedral is just a short stroll from where the cruise ships dock. There is a small entrance fee but it is well worth the money. There is lots of information around the church in English which is worth reading but it's an amazing place to just sit and take it all in. The",
          "It is very interesting to visit the cathedral in Stavanger. It has the old design and well maintained. I liked the bell sound every hour.",
          "It is always a privilege to be in a place that has stood witness to significant change. That is certainly so for the once Roman Catholic but now Lutheran Cathedral. The no-fuss building says something of the matter-of-fact faith of sea-faring folk.",
          "Sadly there are renovating the exterior so that view wasn't the best for us but beautiful inside. About 30-35NOK to enter can't remember exactly but nice to see the Norwegian church style as someone who loves church hopping in Europe! Lovely stone detailing and the carved",
          "Cathedral is located at top of square, easy walking from Cruise terminal. Entrance fee is required but entry is very efficiently handled. Taking photographs is permitted. Lots of placards are tastefully located giving explanations of what you are looking at.",
          "A nice cathedral, but compared with others you are likely to come across in Norway nothing exceptional.... but certainly worth a visit. There is a nominal entrance fee, as with all cathedrals we came across in Norway and I believe that photography is prohibited, but very few",
          "You have to pay a small entrance charge which I don't mind if there is something to see. The church was having an organ moved which meant you could not get close to the pulpit or altar. Said a quick prayer and lit a candle.",
          "When we approached the cathedral, from the harbour area, we thought that it small and modest, and nearly didn't go in. Boy, am I glad we didn't walk on by! The inside is surprisingly large (almost Tardis-like!), and really beautiful. Coming from Durham City, my first impression",
          "As my sister and I were wandering in the city, we saw this church and entered it. There was no line, so we could just enter it. At the moment there was a Bach-serie. Sounds good. However, the church looks quite (below) average compared to churches in my country. Would still",
          "This church is within walking distance from the cruise port. It is on an elevated location and there is a line for the ticket sales. It was unusual because the churches in general do not charge admission. We walked around the church, it was peaceful to sit in a bench and watch",
          "The walls whisper history. Very well maintained and restored after a major fire. Most of the oldest relics were pillaged, but the architecture and carved stone are exquisite.",
          "Built in 1125, oldest functioning church in Norway. So interesting and accessible. Beautiful pipe organ and ornate decor. What a treat!",
          "It is not the thing you'd regret if you do not give a go. But the situation makes it attractive for pictures.",
          "As you stroll around Stavanger, be sure to stop in to the Cathedral and check it out. The cathedral is lined with crests of the noble families and each is truly a work of art. So stop by and see this truly beautiful Cathedral.",
          "Just located at the central of Stavanger, it's easy to find, you can go around and take some pictures.",
          "The stavanger Dom is under restauration. There was no way to visit the inside. The back side is covered.",
          "I have spent many quiet hours inside the Cathedral. Very historic, lovely interior and impressive in its construction. There are eight angel lights on the side walls that are lovely. At the time of my visits, it was open on Sunday morning for visitors to walk inside.",
          "Even if you're not catholic or religious, it's nice to see how well kept it is even being from the 1100's. I was surprised to see some others commenting it was free, I was charged to get in this year.",
          "This is a big old church. The stained glass and wood carvings are particularly beautiful. The roof, we were told, is made in the fashion of a ship. Worth a visit.",
          "Visited while in Stavanger on a cruise ship. Located right off the harbor in the old town. A small fee to enter. Simple interior that is wrapped in history. The stained glass windows are undergoing repair and are covered over with simple drawing of the windows. Worth a visit.",
          "Always nice to drop by, as it is close to everything in Stavanger. And the best of all, it is free :)",
          "In Trondheim I encountered the same; and entrancefee to come inside. My opinion still is that a visit to a church must be free and accesible for everybody. If you want to pay for a guided tour, thats fine as its a extra service. But to fot only to come inside is for me a no go.",
          "I'm not necessarily a fan of cathedrals but we were lucky enough to have a personal guide who had fascinating stories about its history. It made all of the difference to me.",
          "This is Stavanger's most important place of worship. It is located in a pedestrian area only a few hundred metros from the harbour. The inside is interesting and worth a look. There is no admission charge..",
          "Nine different faith traditions are gathering for a peace meal in the cathedral on Thursday 20th as part of the food festival. Inspiring",
          "This is the oldest building in Stavanger and worth a visit. True, is undergoing a huge restoration project that won't be finished till 2019, but I can't wait to see the results. The stained glass window will be the most impressive, with over 10,000 pieces it is a painstaking",
          "Walked to church from cruise or town no transport required cost 10NOK to visit, allowed to take photos.",
          "Right in the heart of Stravanger is this beautify cathedral. \u20ac3 in each, toddler free. They have a Visa card reader as we didn't have local currency.",
          "It always upsets me to pay to see a church no matter what the denomination. This was no exception so did not go inside. Was also nice told stained glass window was under renovation.",
          "I don't believe in charging people to go inside a church so that left a bad taste in my mouth. Don't know the real reason behind it as I doubt that they are so lack of money. It's a beautiful building right in town with lots of history. Looks strong like a castle.",
          "We saw this as part of a group tour, but I suspect it would be better to experience during a service. The interior combines early Medieval, late Medieval, Baroque, and even post-Reformation, from the fascinating remains of pre-Reformation wall paintings under the whitewash, to",
          "Far away from home and longing for the Christmas spirit? Attend the service two days before boxing day at Stavanger Domkirke, where anyone can join and sing traditional Christmas carols in English.",
          "We visited Stavanger Cathedral on a Sunday afternoon. Entry is 30 NoK (approx \u00a32.70). The Cathedral has very plain architecture and no stained glass windows, although behind the altar area there is what looks like a modern painted window. The pulpit is very ornate and there",
          "Our family and in-laws visited this great historical site as part of our tour thru old Stavanger. It was informative and interesting. A good stop. Worth the time.",
          "Only 30 kroner to enter, it is very peaceful inside, you could pay a few more kroner to light a candle. There is a beautifully decorated pulpit. There is some restoration work being undertaken on one side of the catherdral but regardless it is a great place to see from inside",
          "The group I was with went to Stavanger to sing in the Cathedral. The acoustics were amazing and the cathedral was beautiful.",

          "Stavanger Cathedral is located in the heart of Old Town. You need to buy a ticket which was a little surprising as it is a church. It cost 30 nok. Construction of cathedral started around 1100 and it was finished around 1150. However the city of Stavanger counts 1125 as its",
          "Small cathedral in use since 1125, within walking distance from cruise ship docks. Small charge to view the interior and yes they take credit cards. Wood carvings are exceptional along with painted epitaphs that date back to 1600's. Interior is very simple. Stained glass windows",
          "We enjoyed spending time in this peaceful place. Quite a small Cathedral but with some beautiful carvings. Unfortunately the stain glass windows were being restored.",

          "This is a beautiful church that should be visited, the wood craving inside the church are very beautiful it is hard to believe that these are done by hand. There is leaflets about the church in many different languages which are free.",

          "Beautiful church - i think it is the oldest in Norway. Amazing architecture and so beautiful on the inside. If you are in to old buildings, like churches or are even just in Stavanger, definitely pop in and look around. It is stunning.",
          "Interesting building, open all day. Good for studying decoration or just for a quiet moment alone...",
          "Stavanger Cathedral has been in continuous use for 900 years and is very well preserved. There is a small entrance fee but well worth a visit. The stained glass window by the alter was being restored and in its place examples of the four seasons.",
          "The Stavanger Cathedral stands as a testimony to the power of the churches in past centuries. Only the kings could rival the churches in resources to build such massive and lasting constructions. Your feelings are mixed between awe for its beauty and sadness for the human",
          "Took a quick walk here in the sun. Ungortunately there is some construction going on. But a pretty sight. The adjacent pond is a very nice place to sit and enjoy the nature.",
          "The Cathedral at Stavanger is small by English standards but well worth a visit. The most interesting feature is the colourful painted pulpit dating from the 1650s and executed by a Scottish craftsman Andrew Smith. It was helpful in telling the stories of the bible at a time",
          "I went to the Cathedral during a visit to Stavanger, it originates in the 12th century. The pulpit is of a very interesting design with many carvings. There is much of historical interest to be seen, recommended.",

          "Visiting Stavanger? Then you must visit the Cathedral, it is a lovely Cathedral and in nice wheather you can sit on a bench outside and enjoy the life. The park near by is very nice and you can enjoy Bredevannet with the ducks and swans.",
          "Charming 1000 year old cathedral offering an escape from the noise and bustle on the harbourside. Christmas services are particularly lovely even if you don't speak norsk. Surrounded by colourful flowers in the Summer and fronting the lake besides which is often to be found",

          "While enjoying a nice walk around Stavanger we came upon the Cathedral not far from the harbour and in a lovely park area . A lovely stone building which we learnt was finished about 1150 so it is very old and sure could tell some historic tales . Apparently it is Norways",

          "Love to visit old cathedrals, for the history, the serenity and to pray! Was surprised to see how such an old building, if not for spiritual reasons, but historical reasons would be allowed to be 'mistreated' by tourists who were allowed to touch anything and everything. Was a",

          "Some fantastic carving work inside but shame the stained glass window is currently under renovation and replaced by paper facsimile",
          "Unless you've never been to a cathedral before, it's not worth it to pay to get in here. I was a bit surprised that they charged for entry and was disappointed once in there- it really is nothing special and I felt a bit ripped off. I think we were in there for less than 10",
          "It really is worth looking at although smaller than many parish churches it is decorated in an unusual style and that makes it worthy of a visit. The carvings are quite ornate although the faces of the figures are somewhat obscured, possibly through time. The stained glass",

          "A lovely piece of Stavanger history. Beautiful old epitaphs from the 1600's. Amazing to see the transition from Viking to Christian culture. Unfortunately the stained glass windows were being restored when I visited but the temporary art pieces made by the students of the art",
          "Attending a concert at the cathedral is a great way to experience this venue - and if it's a free concert, there is no admission fee. The interior is beautiful.",
          "Don't miss visiting this old cathedral right in the heart of Stavanger- beautiful art work inside, intricate wood carvings, a lovely small pipe organ. I would have loved to hear some music! There is a small entry fee, but well worth the visit. The front is being restored right",
          "This is the first cathedral I've seen where the interior is mostly made of wood versus stone. Stunning artwork!",
          "This church certainly has the feel of the 1600's. Fabulous wood carved pulpit and wooden memorials on the walls made by a woodcarver of the 1600's. Church is well preserved and cared for. Small book available about the church and the decorations. A wonderful treasure in",
          "This very beautiful cathedral is manned by friendly staff who all, to my knowledge, speak excellent English. If I remember correctly the fee to get in worked out at about \u00a33 per adult and free for children. They allow photography as well. Well worth a visit.",
          "The carvings in the church are outstanding. No charge to get in. Lots of info posted for each work of art. Easy to find by old Stavanger.",
          "A church facing the harbour. It's small but inside the wood carving is so unique. A place must visit during stay at Stavanger.",
          "This church is not ornate but rather is rich in history. The baptismal font dates back to the 1300's. It costs 30 NOK (about 3 Euro 30 Cent) entrance fee. I'd suggest you take the time to ask the people giving out the tickets, questions about the church. They have expert",
          "This is a very old cathedral situated by the main square at the back of the harbour. As others have commented you do have to pay to go in (30NOK) but it is not that expensive. Once inside it is not as large as many cathedrals (it is not that big), but it is still a lovely",
          "This church is from 1100 and is a historical church in the middle of Stavanger center. This church is made of stones and behind the church there is small nice park with a water pond called Breiavannet. It is very beautifull inside with detailed treeooden details and nice glass",
          "It is right in the heart of stavanger old town. Very impressive on its outside. They do not explain why they charge for inside visit.",
          "A Cathedral that's stands out looking over the port of Stavanger not very easy to get in if you have a mobility problem but worth the try.",
          "It\u2019s nice preserved building , but I found it a shame that you have to pay (30 NOK) to enter into a religious place!! For that reason I refused to visit it.",
          "Right in the heart of Stavanger city overlooking the town square and a lake. The building itself is quite gothic and is just as interesting on the inside as the outside.",
          "Well preserved midieval church that looks down on the main harbor of Stavanger. One of the main highlights in the town and worth a quick visit. You can link this up with a walk around the picturesque lake adjacent to the cathedral (Breiavatnet). Lots of waterfowl inhabit the",
          "This Cathedral is old and beautiful. I've never seen such beautiful wood carvings along with art work combined. Stone pillars are huge. Really a look back in time. Worth the small admission fee. The fee is used for ongoing restoration and upkeep. It is the oldest Cathedral in",
          "We made a brief visit to Stavanger Cathedral when our cruise ship made a stop there. The cathedral is easy walking distance, just slightly uphill, from the pier. We made sure to make this visit because we knew this is the oldest cathedral in Norway. Admission was 30 NOK",
          "Stavanger Cathedral is not the biggest but certainly makes up for this with its history. A lot older than one imagines and is well worth the very modest entrance fee.",
          "This is a stunning cathedral in the centre of Stavanger. It is open to the public and the architecture is very interesting.",
          "We were pleased to have decided to pop in and have a look at Stavanger Cathedral. Quite an experience - very different feel to Central and Southern European examples, but very characterful and atmospheric nonetheless..",
          "A historical building at the center of town. Very impressive that the city has well preserved it's interior and grounds. Domkirke is a inspiring spot for Christians and nonbelievers alike.",
          "The carvings decorating the walls and the amazing beautifully carved pulpit were a surprise, and will stay in my memory. With a peaceful atmosphere, the cathedral was both welcoming and calm. This was a cathedral on a human scale and a place for personal reflection.",
          "Could only view the outside of the Cathedral as there was a wedding on the day that we docked. Would have loved to have a look at the stonework inside as well as outside.",
          "This old and beautiful cathedral is situated next to the lake and overlooking the harbour in Stavanger, and is well worth a look if you are a lover of architecture. It's not large by UK standards but it is attractive and peacefull.",
          "We visited the Cathedral on the Friday that we arrived and were most impressed we took photo's and soaked up the atmosphere of the beautiful building, We returned on Sunday at 11-00 to attend the service with a bonus of two christenings with the family's being in traditional",
          "A very impressive by its history and modesty cathedral. Dating over 750 years ago you would not recognize the age as it feels new and improved. The park and the street next to it have lots to tell as well. Visit the serenity of the town center vibrancy.",
          "Very cool structure, but under Renovation. Stained glass above the alter was gone, construction in the back.",
          "Nice church downtown in Stavanger Norway that you can visit, but in the summertime it costs money to come inside and it should not be like that. Its just sad that the church take money from tourists and visitors just to let them inside to se a church thats open for Norvegians",
          "Visited in June 2015, the exteriors looks beautiful, Gothic structure among flowers and lake. The place was closed for inside visit which was a disappointment, although the atmosphere around the place made up for it. The site is in the center of the small town, on one side of",
          "Nice cathedral, in the centre of Stavanger. Wonderful architecture and great history. Worth a visit when in Stavanger!",
          "A very quiet, beautiful respite from the world. I'm a bit biased because my family comes from this area and have probably gone to this cathedral for generations. I've visited twice now, once almost 40 years ago and again quite recently, impressive both times.",
          "It is beautiful historical building. But this has not outstanding point than other european cathedrals.",
          "We went to Stavanger in June and planned to visit the Cathedral. It was closed for work to be carried out.. Very disappointing.",
          "The Gothic cathedral is an impressive sight and has two high towers. It is close to the waterfront and overlooks a lovely square which is often full of market stalls. There are plenty of seats outside when you have had a chance to look at the stained glass windows.",
          "The Cathedral is some sort of a meeting point for a lot of people. It is easy to get to and has a beautiful at the front with a fountain. Nice place to chill down after a longer walk.",
          "Although tourist literature will tell you that the Domkirk is open again after extensive restoration, it is still closed - with no date given for re-opening. The exterior is of pleasing design, and at the edge of the churchyard you can see one of the many identical Anthony",
          "One of the oldest Gothic churches in Norway that went through hectic history...have to see lovely vitric-painted windows and carved work in wood all around the church. Consider yourself lucky if you can listen to some music concert inside :D. Pity they do not organize it more",
          "The cathedral dates from 1125, and is an impressive building with two impressive towers. It stands high above the waterfront, close by a lake - Breiavatnet, where people went skating in the winter. A lovely peaceful location. We didn't have time to go inside the cathedral, as",
          "The Cathedral was closed due to renovations as of late August 2015. The outside is beautiful the work those builders did is spectacular. I would have loved to see the inside of it but nothing I could do about it.",
          "Stavanger was an amazing stop over on our trek through Norway - we stayed 5 days and explored the city and surrounding areas - Our favorite thing we did was hiking Pulpit Rock.",
          "small not impressive roman style cathedral. Near by garden and fountain are more fun. Close to the old city and leisure places (cafes restaurants and bars)",
          "Don't forget to take a look mean while you are in town also check if they are doing some restaurations because if that is the case they would not let you go in the main hall of the church",
          "Yes the outside is beautiful and I was really looking forward to seeing the interior. Have visited the domkirke in Oslo and a beautiful little local church in Ulvik and had hoped to compare them with this, but unfortunately this domkirke was closed all summer, so sadly can't",
          "The oldest cathedral in Norway. It is really beautiful to look at and is located at the very center of the town, so no excuses on not having a look.",
          "It is located in Stavanger centrum in front of a wonderful lake. If sky is blue during sunset, a post card picture will add emotion to your visit.",
          "the cathedral is in a great conservation state. interesting place to visit and learn about the early christian movement in norway.",
          "The cathedral is closed through September for internal renovations. I have heard the exterior is more impressive than the interior. Take a quiet stroll around the church and drop down to the lake and park behind it.",
          "It was great being in Stavanger, two years ago. One of the loveliest places was the Cathedral, magnificent, very well located and a place that invites you to meditation!",
          "The cathedral was quiet and peaceful, but not particularly impressive. More like a place for locals. No need to feel sad if miss it.",
          "Went to Stavanger for a friend's wedding in July 2014 (end of review says Sept 14, as I couldn't select July!). The cathedral is a very pretty building - it was perhaps further enhanced by some gorgeous sunshine! It was a wonderful setting for a wedding, and well worth a visit!",
          "A very interesting building even from the outside. While it was officially closed when we visited, for internal repairs, we were lucky enough to be allowed in by a staff member. Decorative interior that while not exceptionally old, has been done in a style of several centuries",
          "This new one is built in the Gothic style,to replace an Anglo Norman basilica which was damaged by fire .The baptismal font is beautifully carved from stones.",
          "Old church in the middle of Stavanger City. Really a beautiful church we call Stavanger Domkirke. The areas near the hotel are also beautiful. Breiavannet with the waterfountain. Rememebr to take your camera with you to shoot a lot of great pictures :)",
          "Not like the beautiful wooden churches of Norway. The cathedral has been changed at different periods, with different styles, currently undergoing renovation. You do have to visit this cathedral if you go to Stavanger, but it is unfortunately no masterpiece.",
          "Beautiful church both inside and outside, amazing work of art where ever you look. Take you time to look around and see beauty all over",
          "The church is not like Nidaros or those beautiful wooden churches, but if you know something about architecture and about symbols in church you might find it more interesting. Here's some interesting facts: there are a monster-fish on one if side of the church close to a side",
          "One of the main attractions in Stavanger, not worth a travel though. The church is nothing special, don't expect to see any kind of art. Bare and bleak nordic architecture.",
          "The Cathedral was initially built in 1125 and rebuilt and updated many times until the present day. The outside is not impressive but the mix of architecture is interesting. We visited the Bishops Chapel that is part of the complex. the chapels hold maybe 40 people, is simply",
          "This is a 10 minute stroll from where the cruise ships dock. Small church and park - one of Stavanger's few attractions",
          "I am amazed at how old the cathedral is. It is right in Old Stavanger town and it is kept in amazing condition. Truly beautiful.",
          "Impressive cathedral & lovely lake area in front of it, with some interesting wildlife, including swans. Very peaceful, and a great contrast to the rest of the city.",
          "We went to the cathedral and met a man coming out of the church and he told us the cathedral was closed for repairs during the summer. You can walk around the outside but all of the doors were locked.",
          "Unfortunately closed for the refurbishment of the organ. Parts of the outside covered in scaffolding . The outside of the building was impressive.",
          "Beautiful old church built in 1125, currently undergoing repair and renovation. This church sits in a park in the middle of Stavanger and should be a must see on your visit to the area.",
          "The Cathedral is being repaired so it's closed to the public, There's a scaffold on one side, but you can take pictures of the sides and the rear of the Cathedral.",
          "Unfortunately the Domkirke was closed due to the installation of a new main organ. So I don\u00b4t know how the church looed inside. The exteriour was not too impressive ( o.k. , I admit that I\u00b4m from L\u00fcbeck so I have a big variety of brick made gothic cathedrals ). The three points",
          "Nice Cathedral in a very beautiful city. It is easily to visit this cathedral, placed in the center of the city and very closed to the sea. Pay attention to the lake nearly located: very beautiful!",
          "This landmark from the 10 century built by Norman stonemasons is a must when in Stavanger town. The simplicity and beauty of this cathedral is awesome..",
          "Cathedral was about to stage an opera indoors when we were there so we couldn't look around properly. A quick glimpse in and it looked like a beautiful calm place.",
          "very big, design is cool, location ideal in the middle of the city, really nice fast, expierence , recommended for archietcural buffs",
          "Apparently Gothic on the outside but inside it's simple undamaged Romanesque ('Norman'). Some lovely memorials - but not a load of clutter. Lovely location, by itself, surrounded by a simple garden just above the lake. It was free to visit - and very peaceful - in January 2015.",
          "This cathedral really touched my heart, the wood carvings are spectacular. So beautiful! The garden around the cathedral is such a peaceful place to relax.",
          "This large (for the area) Stone Cathedral makes a strong statement in its locale. Internally it is worth the small fee to encompass the structure and decor. The setting by the park is a peaceful one. Walk all the way around and then walk around the lake next to it too. Enjoy the",
          "I am told that this cathedral was built by some of the same craftsmen that built Durham cathedral. There are similarities. Does anyone know the facts?",
          "The Cathedral has been re-buildt. It is not a big Cathedral but it holds its quality and you can feel the characters of it. There are weddings being held here time to time. The surroundings are perfect for an afternoon walk. Remember to walk at back of the Catherdral and stay",
          "Nice to visit this old cathedral and just have a quiet time. A small fee to get in. Refurbishement ongoing",
          "What a feat for craftsmen of the 12th century. One has to marvel at the architectural achievement for the time period. We were most fortunate to have the opportunity to hear an evening choir practice. A point of interest NOT to be missed.",
          "a kool church that goes into the history of stavanger n the area. a intressting place to visit while in town and nice with a calm place and the park around it is good for a pic mic too!",
          "Stavanger Cathedral dates back to 1125 and visitors are strongly advised to go and see it when they are in town. The stone church was constructed partly in Roman and partly in Gothic style. Still, the two parts blend harmoniously. It is also a much appreciated concert venue,",
          "Nice cathedral to visit and admire the architecture. Also in a park, lake area to have a stroll and sit on park benches. A few cafe s nearby",
          "If you have time you may want to stop in for a quick visit. A short distance from the port it is easy to walk to the Cathedral. There is a small fee. Inside you can appreciate the details in the design and carvings. There is scaffolding on the front of the Cathedral which is",
          "Unfortunately was unable to see the outside. Very interested to see the inside. I was the only person in there. There was a charge to go in. The carved wooden pulpit is absolutely stunning. It was so peaceful.",
          "This small incredibly well maintained cathedral is so well worth a visit. Close to the centre of town built in the 12th and 13th centuries it has been preserved since that time with very little damage from world changing events. The carved pulpit is amazing and apparently was",
          "Worth visiting when walking around the Old town area in Stavanger. The interior is a bit spartan but the external architecture is beautiful.",
          "I personally like to photo buildings,this one is lovely,you can enter to see inside ,but was closed on day we were there.",
          "What beautiful work of art as well as a building. They were repairing part of it when we visited but I could not believe the quality and beauty of the 1100 AD era workmanship.",
          "Fairly impressive for the most part, but currently it is undergoing a 'sympathetic' restoration, and most of the clock tower is behind scaffolding.",
          "Nothing to dislike, it's part of Stavanger's rich heritage and sits in the centre of Stavanger, amongst the new and the old town.",
          "The impressive lofty building, the beautifully carved pulpit and a pianist practising for a wedding, filling the cathedral with heavenly music!",
          "From the moment you first approach the cathedral you become entranced by the beautiful lines and colours in the stained glass window. In fact the whole trip to Norway was stunning with such cool crisp weather and beautiful sights to see. Bergan, Flaam, Hellesylt, Geiranger,",
          "only a few minutes walk from the port the cathedral stands beside the park .the front is being restored and ans is covered up .it has a small admission price . the inside is wonderful with a beautiful stain glass window .a great example of a early Norwegian church",
          "After our ship docked in the High St, we decided to visit the cathedral but we were waylaid with the World Tour Beach Volleyball championships. Once we got there and inside the place was very serene and calming, then a Norwegian lady introduced a Cello player who's music was",
          "After being burned once and ripped off its original state, the modern state of the church is not far from its share of beauty and awe. The exteriors are reflective of gothic architecture. The interiors of the place are filled with beautiful statues and works and have pretty good",
          "It is well worth the cost to go into the cathedral. It offered some really stunning views. The carvings in the church were amazing.",
          "The cathedral is located at what was once the focal point of the harbor (now surrounded by banks and big business - the flower and fish market prior to the North Sea oil are all gone.) Built in the 12th century the architecture for the nave is Romanesque, but the altar area was",
          "The Cathedral is located at the center of town on the lake. Inside are lots of artwork and a small chancel. At first glance, it does not seem impressive but sit down, pray & enjoy the Church. As you do you will notice lots of little touches that make the place unique and",
          "Stavanger Cathedral is situated in the heart of the city. Its a fairly typcial cathedral, similar to others I have seen around the world and in the UK. At the time we visited, there were renovation works ongoing.",
          "The outside of the Cathedral is really beautiful. This inside is... well, this is a cathedral. Nothing special that justify to pay a price for the visit.",
          "This cathedral is in no way monumental, then again it corresponds to the area it is built in. It's interior was very lovely and a nice change from the interior of Cathedrals in the Mediterranean. Really Enjoyed my visit.",
          "Has little quirks you won't find in just any medieval cathedral. Pay attention to angle of view on the pulpit.",
          "This is really nice cathedral is construction around the year 1100. It is located in the middle of centrum, with good view over the lake and the harbor. The guide said Norways oldest cathedral. A relly must see objekt, inside and outside:)",
          "This is a relatively small cathedral and won't take you more than 15 minutes - half an hour to visit (depending on your visiting style of course). It's been around longer than you might think, dating back to the 12th Century - around the time of Notre Dame in Paris and the time",
          "This cathedral is in the heart of the town and the pulpit inside is a must see. Considering it was made circa 1658 it is something else. Ok it's not the sistine chapel but if you're in town then take a little time to appreciate this cathedral. Free to get in and just a nice",
          "When you see this church, keep in mind it was built in the early 1100s! How they built such a beautiful building way back then boggles the mind. It's right in the center of Stavanger near the harbor so it's hard to miss.",
          "Beautiful old church situated in the middle of town, a great place for a holiday photo with the family or alone.",
          "Stavanger Cathedral is located in the heart of the city center and what a striking Gothic cathedral it is. Wonderful hand carved wooden epitaphs. Don't miss!",
          "Beautiful pulpit - windows could be kept better to allow the light to come in and the colours to show. Overall nice. Beautiful stone work and little explanations every here and there.",
          "As it is in the middle of the city, close to the harbour, it is easy to go to and is worth to have a look at if you are in the area.",
          "We were in Stavanger as a cruise port visit. Just a few blocks from the cruise ship terminal we found the cathedral facing a small lake called Breiavatnet, There is no fee for visiting the cathedral with its gothic features. As we walked around the church, we admired the",
          "This beautiful cathedral is an impressive, medieval stone cathedral.The cathedral dates back to 1125 and originally built in Anglo-Norman style.",
          "like most of the Norwegian cathedrals its worth a visit, very impressive building with surrounding attractions!",
          "During our cruise ship stop we took the few moments to walk to the Stavanger Cathedral. Worth the stroll.",
          "This is one of the oldest cathedrals in Norway. It is medium size, very well maintained and easy to visit. You don't need more that 15 minutes at this historical objective.",
          "The church is a short walk from the harbor. Be sure to walk around the building to see the other side, beautiful. The interior has some awe inspiring woodwork, including the pulpit, as well as a great tapestry right inside the entrance. We were there on a cruise ship but went",
          "It was 30 NK to enter. I asked how much to pray - 30 NK. I was told it is free after 4pm when the cruise ships leave and that it's not suitable for praying as it is more like a museum. I expressed my view that God might disagree, blessed the woman and prayed outside. Let the",
          "Do not miss seeing this lovely church. It is an architectural beauty. There is a serene sense of worship there and you feel like you are in a church, not just a historical site. The carved alter is truly a work of art as are the paintings situated around the cathedral.",
          "Very impressive not far from the centre restaurants nearby shopping streets nearby not far from the port",
          "I lived in Winchester and was delighted to note the association with that city courtesy of St Swithun. This is a beautiful gothic building and though in the heart of secular and protestant Norway has a very Catholic appeal",
          "We arrived in Stavanger on a Sunday and had to wait until the morning worship service was over to enter the cathedral. The exterior is extremely impressive with it's Gothic style. Although not as ornate on the inside as many of the churches in Europe, it was still a",
          "Elegant, but austere interior of this stone church is complemented by a range of wood carvings, including an extremely elaborate pulpit and 5 epitaphs, and a set of wonderful chandeliers + stained glass windows. Worth a look.",
          "I visited this cathedral with my grandmother and we both loved the history behind the origin and the carvings. Its unusual structure and parts are fascinating, for example we were told that the wooden construction of the ceiling was held up with only joints, not a single nail. I",
          "We visited as part of a booked tour and as such entered as a group. Our guide gave us a very informative talk about the history of the cathedral and left us there to explore on our own. Marvellous building very ornate. Photos allowed Within easy walking distance of the harbour",
          "Overviewing the Marketplace, Stavanger cathedral is a place of silence and history. You should try to join a concert in this impressive stone building located right in the centre of Stavanger.",
          "That is what it took for Bishop Reinald to come to this part of Norway back in the 12th century. It is very rustic and striking and though not as famous at the Cathedral in Trondheim..I found it very beautiful if having had a number of restorations in the last 900 years. It has",
          "STAVANGER in the sunshine is a real pleasure to stroll around. We visited this Norwegian town during a cruise on board P&O\u2019s 116,000-ton Venture and what an excellent stop it was. The morning was spent on a wonderful coach tour which took us through some rugged lake and mountain",
          "The 30 kr entry seems to end about 3:15. Once said after the cruise ship folks leave. Perhaps. I would have enjoyed viewing the structural aspects of the church built initially around 1100. Unfortunately that sort of information seemed unavailable. The chandeliers were designed",
          "I guess when you've been to churches and cathedrals all over Europe they stop being very exciting, and this one is nothing to write home about. I walked in for about three minutes, walked around and back out. It is fine to look at. Make sure to go when the cruise ship is not in",
          "Very beautiful. Right on top of the main square by the water. I think you could get guided help if you wanted to.",
          "The cathedral was incredible. The carvings on the walls and the pulpit were gorgeous. There was a short prayer walk in English available for those wanting to use the time to reflect. We arrived at 6pm, and had the building to ourselves for quite a while.",
          "Quite a small cathedral, pleasant, nice stained glass window. There was an entry fee of Kr30 all day, but removed when the cruise ship sailed, not a very Christian approach in our view.",
          "Centrally located old cathedral with some interesting features. has an ornately carved wooden pulpit on the right side of the chancel - the stained glass windows are rather dark and also rather recent - from 1950's. There is a pipe organ in the back and there are several CD's",
          "One of the more interesting medieval churches you're likely to see in Europe, we didn't catch it open but it was worth checking out for a glance at the architecture.",
          "Located in a high position above the harbour, with nice gardens and a lake behind. We waited for the Cathedral to open at the published time on the notice board outside. The time passed and a crowd gathered, but the doors remained shut. Half an hour later the doors opened and",
          "Being charged for this visit was certainly for worth it. The cathedral was very small and offered little sights and history within it.",
          "A must visit ! The smell , feel , look of the place takes you back to 1600 century ! Lovely place , the lake outside the cathedral looks fantastic with ducks floating on them !",
          "The Stavanger Catherdral is a very nice structure and well worth the visit. The interior is certainly prodestant in decoration, simple and clean. The Catherdal was really built over two periods and styles. The Original was romanesque with larger columns and rounded arches, then",
          "The first bishop of Stavanger was Reinald of Winchester and the cathedral was built for him. Exciting history! The cathedral was built in anglo-roman style in 1125 and a gothic part was added later.",
          "The Medieval romanesque/gothique is very beautiful. Not often you will find dhese two architecturel styles in the same church. Here the aisle is romanesque but the choir was added later and consequently finished in gothic style. The citizens are justly very proud of their",
          "The Cathedral is very beautiful, it built with stones. I went there twice (night, morning) both was great, but if you like to take pictures you should also go at night.",

The structures are phenomenal, and you get a good idea of the risks and rewards from the oil, you end up wondering what happened to the money in the \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7. Some of the exhibits weren\u2019t working,",

          "This modern museum is located in the harbour, the building will appeal to lovers of modern architecture, its very eye catching. Once inside there is plenty to see and do for all ages. You can try on a oil mans suit, clamber inside a life raft or slide down an oil rig escape",

          "This was a fantastic and interesting way to find out about the history of Norway and how The North Sea oil fields have influenced and affected a country once on the brink of starvation and poverty. There is so much to see and do in the museum. I\u2019d recommend the escape route",

          "While this is a very interesting museum there is much to see and do outside in this charming town which is why I give it only an average rating. If one were to be here for more than a day and had a particular interest in museums or the petroleum industry the rating would be much",

          "If you are interested in museum and how the oil rigs look like, etc. Then go for it. It might be a bit pricey for non-norwegians, but students get a bit of discount, just show your ID. Personally, I had fun. Cool things to see. I wouldn't say that it is a must for tourists",
          "I work in the oil industry and took the chance to visit the museum after work meetings. It\u2019s a revelation! The oil industry is many complex things - geology, technology, engineering, human endeavour, risky, occasionally fatal, and the source of power - both financial and energy",

          "A really surprising museum, which presents a lot of information about the oil manufacturing, and especially the development of this industry in Norway. The place raises many morale questions of right and wrong, which it leaves for the visitor to ponder about. Good place to visit",
          "This far exceeded our expectations. Very well done and worth the money to go. If you have children you could spend half a day here. I know mine would have loved it both big and small.",
          "I had some time to waste on my last day in Stavanger. Me and my baby son visited this place, and I was surprised that a baby could enjoy a petroleum museum that much. I guess he would have been even more amused if the was a few years older. And I enjoyed the museum very much",
          "Having been to Stavanger a few times and having walked past this place we decided on our next trip we would visit. I was a bit dubious as I thought it wouldn't be very interesting but I was very surprised, I really enjoyed myself. Lots of things to do and see. There are film",
          "This is a modern museum that really gives a great history of the oil discovery and industry in Norway. It is interactive and child-friendly. Though as a young adult couple, we also enjoyed it thoroughly! English accessible and definitely worth a visit!",
          "We simply got to the museum late in the day and really wish we could have spent more time. It lays out the oil history of Norway and the films are excellent. If you have only a day in Stavanger do not miss this museum.",
          "Very nice museum and attractive for kids and adult to watch the Norwegian petroleum history. I spent 3 hours and found very interesting experience to look at such great history.",
          "Despite its rather bland name, the Norwegian Petroleum Museum is absolutely fascinating! Just about every way to engage audiences of all ages are tried, invariably successfully, and we came away much more knowledgeable about oil, and the way it has transformed Norwegian society",

          "Excellent museum showing growth of the oil industry in Norway. Museum is quite busy and it is probably best to go on a guided tour although everything is well labelled and explanations are provided. Gift shop and coffee shop inside building.",
          "This could not be a more honest display of how the oil industry effected Stavanger positively and negatively.",
          "Worth visiting for architectural beauty of the building hosting the museum and for all the knowldge it will pass to visitors in interactive, engaging and very interesting way. You will learn all the oil details and how it serves Norway. Lots of movies, models, games and contests",
          "The museum is interesting and shows you how Norway ticks financially. It's good value for money has plenty of things to find for younger children. Restaurant serves great coffee!!",
          "The Norwegian Petroleum Museum in Stavanger is one of a kind museum which only goes back 50 years. Norway found oil in 1966, but found a large field in 1969 which still produces. The museum shows you a lot of history through active parts (for instance helicopter flying and how",
          "Amazing museum about the history of oil exploration in Norway. The film was pretty anti oil but moving. The exhibits showing the oil rigs were ingeniously designed and the part where it simulated being on an oil rig was excellent.",
          "Don't be put off by the oil theme - there is a lot to see and interact with in this stylish, modern museum. Touching on the geographic and economic story of Norwegian Oil Drilling, there is a wealth of stuff here to see, touch and in some cases - climb in. Well worth a visit,",
          "This museum has exhibits, models, video and everything in between to highlight the Norwegian oil industry and it's impact on Norway and the world petroleum stage. Plenty of activities for kids and lots of big oil drill bits and machinery for Dad. The two films they run there are",
          "We visited on a stopover with our cruise. The museum was a short walk from the boat. Lots of information, equipment and interactive exhibits. Lovely play area for children, inside so the weather doesn't matter. Everything was in English.",
          "As predicted by our guidebook, this is the kind of museum where you will spend longer than anticipated. There is a wide range of media used to tell all aspects of Norway's oil story. Interactive displays, real equipment, boats, escape pods, audio visual, film, all done to the",
          "We were on a cruise port day and visited the museum which is not far from the cruise port. The museum was excellent, very informative and enjoyable. I visited with my teenage daughter and we both liked it. You will learn about how and where oil is found and the history of",
          "The discovery of oil in Norway impacted the country in a profound way. This museum is effective in providing visitors with insight into the Norwegain petroleum industry, as well as its history and politics. While it may sound dry, several of its exhibits are hands on making it",
          "We visited on the recommendation of the owner of the house we were staying in. It is a fully interactive museum all in English and Norwegian. We spent three hours our teenage children really enjoyed it. For younger children there is a trail to follow. Also your entrance ticket",
          "It will keep you engaged for the first hour, but I really doubt that a typical visitor would enjoy it for much longer. Kids have their playground inside, so you do not have to worry they will get too bored for you to appreciate your own visit. A great choice for a rainy",
          "We visited two museums in Stavanger- the canning museum and the petroleum museum. While very different they are both equally interesting. Petroleum museum is a great place to visit with kids. They have all kinds of activities to keep the children busy and engaged, there are two",
          "This is the top attraction in Stavanger, and I would have thought I won't be interested in the museum. Boy was I wrong. We spent many hours here, right till its closing! Very interesting exhibits and stories about the industry and its influence and effects over Stavanger and",
          "Very interesting displays and videos. Brought the people element to the local industry. Some political views expressed but definitely worth the visit.",
          "If you have time, check this museum out. The whole area was cool too including the playground built from recycled materials.",
          "Big modern museum showing the history of the oil industry, spread over various floors. It tells the story, including the darker aspects (such as accidents) from the first prospecting for oil in the North sea until the present day. And some insights into future developments. They",
          "The idea of an oil museum doest sound a tractive or interesting. But it's better than it seems lots of information about oil and the oil business. Very interactive and lots of models of ships, oil platform etc.",
          "As it could look like, it is not only for engineers or technical people. Norvegian peole are very proud of this part of their history: how the o\u00efl discovery changed their lives, and how they manage the wealth so differently from other countries. Everywhere in the museum, you",
          "OK, I was not sure that I could ever enjoy a Petroleum Museum, but the story contained herein is truly amazing. The wealth that Norway has accumulated from the production of oil is depicted carefully in the museum and I left with a much clearer understanding of how careful the",

          "I wasn't thrilled to go at the beginning, but I was curious enough to go. It's very pedagogical and you really learn a lot about Norway's economy in this museum. I think it must be great for families since there's a lot of activities and ways to interact, and there's information",
          "With limited indoor option on occasional rainy days, the oil Museum would definitely be my first suggestion for a visit. The museum is very interactive with 2 very interesting screenings (one for children on the origin of oil; the other being a simulation on a rig-submarine.",
          "The museum has a large collection of petroleum industry equipment on display. There are regular screenings of interesting and informative short films related to the petroleum industry - the one I remember from my visit is \"Oil kid\" a Norwegian film about how the 50 year old oil",
          "Well worth the visit - a thoughtful and thorough representation of the industry, with many viewpoints represented. Great for kids as well.",
          "The museum tells the fascinating story of the origins of the petroleum industry on Norway till present days, not only from the technological point of view but also economical, social and political aspects. The museum is not too big and worth spending a couple of hours in the",
          "We visited the museum as it seemed appropriate while in Stavanger. The displays and scale models are really informative, but the film's and the ability to get up close to real life controls and equipment really bring it to life. We spent a very enjoyable 4 hours here.",
          "This museum was a surprise. There is a lot of information about oil exploration and the history of oil mining in Norway. We thought that we would be in and out, but spent a good hour there.",

          "There are a few museums around Stavanger, linked to its maritime heritage. This seemed to be the biggest and best. Very modern, very informative and interactive - lots to experience and try for yourself. I spent a good couple of hours here. Worth a visit.",
          "I visited with my parents and we all found something to interest us, from the history of the industry to the engineering exhibits to how the money is spent - an excellent way to spend a few hours.",
          "This provides an excellent depiction of the 'old' and 'new' ways gas and oil are harvested from the seas. There are some excellent models as well as actual machinery and accessories.",
          "Very informative, yet not too much information. The combination of videos, scale model depictions, pictures charts and text extremely well done. Great way to spend a couple of hours.",
          "Tells you all about the oilindustry, from how oil exists till how its get out of the ground. And ofcourse its focused on the Norwegian industry. Also very interesting to know how the goverment has organised the oilroyalties; now you know how Norway becomes so wealthy and why",
          "This is an extremely interesting museum, which really explains the effect that the discovery of oil has had on the Norwegian economy. We really had been unaware of its importance and impact. The displays are interesting and signage is in English.",
          "OK, as an Engineer this was amazing. Spent an hour looking at all the different drill heads. However I think there is so much to read about here in relation to how Norway got to where it is today. Lots of write ups lots of scale models and full scale or original pieces. This is",
          "The highlight of the visit was looking at the scale models of the rigs, ships and other structures associated with the oil industry. it is difficult to appreciate the clever complexity of an oil platform without this kind of presentation. The actual structures- life rafts etc.",
          "This is a great museum explaining the Norwegian history and importance of oil and gas since 1972. There are many great exhibits that are interactive and make for an interesting experience. This museum really gives you a flavour of Stavenger. The museum is open until 7 pm in",

          "Most people would think, \"I have no interest in this industry\", well this museum will prove that thinking wrong. A very well set out museum telling the history of oil and gas in Norway, which is not only fascinating but also give you an idea of the complexity involved of",
          "Great place to visit if you are only here for the day as we were. The museum provides a great overview of ocean oil drilling and that it entails. Many interactive displays.",
          "It's hard to get ones head around a petroleum museum but this is not only about the discovery of oil and gas, it is about modern Norway. Learn about how it nearly never happened!",
          "Although the title of the museum may be boring, the inside is anything but. The Petroleum museum had hit the nail on the head with a brilliant balance of entertainment and education which can be enjoyed by all! From evacuation rooms to brilliant animations about life as a North",

          "Have been there many times, like the visit. Get new stuff oten and new experience from. Everytime i visit",
          "Loved every minute of the visit. You get to peek in a world that is normally either hundreds of miles from shore or under thousands of meters of ocean. Really impressive.",
          "Norsk Oljemuseum is a \"must see\" for all tourists (and locals) in Stavanger. It offers information and history about Norway's Oil industry. There is a lot of text in this museum, but it also displays oil drills and diving clocks as part of the exhibition. A great thing about",
          "So classy, modern, tactile, cool, interesting, interactive. Loved it. Great for kids and adults and good level of detail. The film was great. It was a little bit desperate to push the point that Norway has a dilemma which seemed less like a unbiased museum and more like",
          "Very nice museum displaying how oil is explored, retrieved and processed in todays time. The hands on parts of the museum is incredible. You walk through what it like on an oil rig platform and can even try on survival gear. Very nice display of different types of oil rigs",
          "This is the main attraction in Stavanger since this city plays an important role in Norway oil industry. Go in for a visit if you are interested in this.",
          "You could spend an entire day here. It details the history, engineering, technology, dangers of the entire Norwegian oil industry with well designed models, displays and films. There's also an informative bit about the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund which was set up in the",
          "Is a must if you are visiting Stavanger. It has some funny interactive expositions as well as more serious expositions with facts. Be sure to watch cinema in the end of all expositions. Without it you will not understand what a big deal oil is for Norway.",
          "Interesting history of the oil platforms in Norway and a pretty quick tour if you have an hour or two. It's basically a big open room that you can just walk through to what interests you. The two upper rooms house an interactive area that simulates some parts of a rig (kids will",
          "Don't skip the oil museum. I learned so much in just a few hours. It is well worth the entrance fee and several hours to be spent indoors checking equipment and watching informative movies. It is also good fun for kids!",
          "Very comprehensive collection of artefacts relating to oil production in Norway. Very informative with lots of activities for children. We particularly liked the detailed coverage of Global warming and energy management.",
          "The museum is very well installed in a new building ! I specially liked the numerous models of the different type of rigs ! All the musem is made to make us understand how the process is done in the sea. It is also very interesting the part about the environmental and social",
          "If you're not interested in oil this isn't a great place to visit. It mainly revolves around the way oil is found and refined. A reasonably interesting part of the museum is dedicated to the environmental and societal impact of the oil industry. Tickets are pretty expensive",
          "Modern museum with modern installations and up to date information. Just enough information to get an overview on the oil age and it's implications. Well worth a visit.",
          "This was our second visit to Stavanger and having toured the town on a 'hop on hop off' during our first trip, we decided to use our feet on this occasion and visited the 'Oil Rig Museum' as I liked to call it. Perfectly located, it was no more than a 10 minute walk from where",

          "I thought I would be bored here but it was a really interesting museum full of scale models of boats, oil rigs and pipelines showing how the oil is extracted from the sea bed. Great for children of all ages as a lot of interactive things to do. Good way to spend a couple of",
          "We were surprised at how interesting this museum was. Fascinating exhibits that explored the history and inner workings of the oil industry in Norway. The museum was informative and inventive in how it told the story of petroleum. This was our second visit to Stavanger and we",
          "My husband worked in an industry that was attached to the oil industry and had been on rigs etc. He loved the museum and delighted in explaining some aspects. There was quite an emotional film shown which highlighted the human story of men being away from wives and children",
          "We were both in awe of this museum. It was very interesting to read the facts about oil and actually see for yourself the different stages etc. that take place and the dangers they go to, to extract oil. I myself was quite shocked at how dangerous the whole 'oil rig' operation",
          "We had a conference at Stavanger and a banquet on the last evening in Petroleum Museum. Close to the city centre the situation was appropriate for us visitors. It started from 20:00 and we enjoyed a three-course meal with champagne, wine and apple juice. The food was lovely,",
          "As a geography teacher, I frequently teach about oil and natural resources, so this museum helped me to put everything into context. There's a lot more to oil extraction than you might think. A must visit!",
          "A must see museum to understand the history of Norway, how they were able to find their gas resources and amazingly collect them. I learned how united they were in their economic goal, thinking about the whole country and the generations after them. They are truly a good example",
          "This was our first stop in stavanger and we found it a very interesting museum. Having cruised past the rigs yesterday it made it more interesting.",
          "On a rainy day in Stavanger we decided to visit the 'Oil Museum'. Entrance fees are: 120 NOK per adult 69 NOK per child On entry you are given a guide in the language of your choice and was told that you can come and go as much as you like, showing this guide to get back into",
          "Since 1969 Stavanger is a hub of oil and gas activity. This replica oil platform represents the symbol of economic prosperity. This museum describes oil in all its glory from discovery to refining and ultimately its multiple uses. The museum also contains multiple artifacts",
          "This museum are fascinating in many ways. Here You will lern about the oil history of Norway and in general how oil are created. The place is a wery good place to, in a simpel way, lern somthing in dept. The exebiction are good for all ages and spesily for children. Try to",

          "I was at first reluctant to do this - at about \u00a312 for an adult, it's quite expensive (like everything in Norway, though !). However I was really glad we did. We spent 3.5 hours there, and only left then because it was closing time. There are many very interesting exhibits",
          "Very interesting museum treating about oil and gas exploration in Norway and its impact on environment. Many attractions for kids: evacuation slide, escape suits, dark room in addition to playground . Many models of the installation. Economic model of Norwegian oil exploration",
          "Been there several times and the displays have not changed much over the years as far as I can notice. Not too exciting. The oil museum in Petronas towers in Kuala Lumpur is much better.",
          "This is a great historic exhibit of the history of oil in general and the way the petroleum industry has affected Norway specifically. The museum is very interactive and suitable for children. There are models of off shore oil rigs and exhibits that you walk, crawl, climb and",

          "I work in the oil sector (hence why I was in Stavanger) and even I learned loads in what is a fantastic museum. It really brings it all home when you get to see real bits and pieces in front of you (rather than on PowerPoint presentation courses), particularly about the",

          "A short visit, but very informative. Tells the saga of how Norway found oil and made Norway rich! Interesting models of oilrigs. The guide was very good, told the history well. Pretty interesting to see how things work in oilrigs and how everything is done out in the sea.",
          "Approximately \u00a312 entry per adult. Information in English. Interactive and good ecological message. There is a cafe but check out the prices",
          "This museum gives us the history of Norwegian wealth and oil ventures. Lots of info for children and novices to the oil industry. I like the many hands on ie items you can touch and play with in the museum. Museums with all their displays only in glass cages are boring. This",
          "Great Museum As someone who works in the oil and gas industry around level measurement in separators, it was great to see other aspects such as ROVs, drilling etc. Great range of exhibits which are well presented, not just in the museum, but also outside. Seems to of grown",

          "My father-in-law is a retired petroleum engineer. He really enjoyed the museum and thought they did a good job. There were exhibits that would appeal to all ages, young children to adults. The design of the building, and its location on the waterfront is very nice.",
          "As an offshore oil and gas worker, I was interested to see how it would be portrayed. A quick trip would take no less than 2 hours, because there is such a wide scope of information and real exhibits to absorb. Not only is there great technology, but also the environmental",

          "This museum is small but well worth visiting. It covers the history of oil in the North Sea and does shy away from covering the accidents that have occurred. It also shows how wise the Norwegians have been in conserving the funds from the North Sea.",
          "This won't be for everyone, but if you want to see how the Norwegian oil & gas sector works then you could do a lot worse. There are a lot of models and real equipment to see - all laid out logically. There was a geology day when I visited today - fascinating to see the actual",

          "Very good interactive museum. For example panic room and \"escape stairs\" was very interesting. Highly recommended.",
          "Wow, so much energy and money was spent to create a great experience for visitors both young and old. Kids will especially like interactive features, including a quiz that lets you post selfies and opinions about oil. Want to experience the danger of an oil platform? I didn't",
          "What I have loved about the museums in Stavanger is that they are all bite sized and not overwhelming like many in the UK and other parts of Europe. We had a dull rainy day and we're all recovering from the hike to pulpit rock the day before. So, decided a museum day in order.",

          "We visited Stavanger as part of a cruise and it was our first stop. Not having any idea what was there we hadn't planned anything so simply went for a walk and stumbled across this museum. It's not big, but it's very informative and worth a look if you don't mind a bit of a walk",
          "This was a slightly rushed stop for our cruise ship coach load, who needed to allocate more time to this. However, it was interesting - the local guides inside the museum were good and it was interesting to look around. We were particularly interested in the polar bear",

          "I defined it as short and sweet since it gives enough information and exhibits a number of artefacts which are sufficient to understand lifestyles, traditons and culture of the north people. It is fit for accompanied children and adolescents. Take time to read more than just",
          "We went to this museum as part of a tour. Coming from the UK it was brilliant to see how the Vikings really lived. The artefacts are brilliant and opened up more of the Viking world for me. We were guided round by a lovely young Viking who showed us chain mail and also",

          "Super museum close to the city centre, easy to find. The Viking exhibit is very informative, and there's a boat of marauding Viking to have a photo taken with. Staff are extremely friendly, and even took the time. To find out the bus route to the Swords for us.",
          "An excellent museum explaining the life of the Vikings, their craft work is incredible and it was interesting to find out about the links with a skeleton found at Stonehenge. Well worth a visit and good value too.",

          "I visited the museum with my sister and my father. We were amazed at how old the artifacts were (8,000 yr old human remains)and rich Viking history of this region of Norway. Plan at least two hours to read all the exhibits and enjoy the gift shop.",

          "This isn't a must-see, but there are some interesting artefacts. The focus is heavily on the Vikings, which is fine by me. English translations were often limited to the item descriptions, so perhaps I missed some of the bigger picture - I would have liked to see a more",
          "Cool museum! Very interesting exhibits about life in the Bronze and Iron Ages. Viking stuff! Learn about the region's past. Great cafe too.",
          "Took the 'hop on hop off' tour (would recommend) and this was one of the stops. My daughter and I have always been fans of Norse mythology and Vikings (which by the way this museum explains quite well what 'viking' really means) so thought I would give it a try and I am very",

          "We took the City Sightseeing bus straight to this museum, and our bus ticket gave us 25% of the museum price (75k final price for the two of us). We finished it off in about forty minutes, but a forty minutes well spent! My husband's favorite moment was learning about the size",
          "Impressive to see everything they have found from the viking era. You can Learn alot from going to this museum. Are you interested in history, it's worth a visit. It's also possible to dress up as a viking, and even as an adult, that's fun.",

          "It was a rainy day as is normal for Stavangar so we spent time looking around the museum it was good but sadly too much was only written up in Norwegian and not in English. There were some interactive displays but no English version for the instructions on how to use or",
          "We cruised to Scandinavia reading Viking literature and with an on-board lecture on the Vikings, from the ship's captain no less, so the opportunity to visit the exhibit on Vikings at this museum could not have been more timely!",

          "Not enough signage pointing the way to this facility. We were happy with the reasonable entry fee but disappointed with the quality of the finds. Even with the gold and silver displays and stones filled with runes, we found the place to be a bit sparse. It would have been",

          "This is a small museum but plenty of artefacts to see in a modern setting and good for kids. It is logically set out and easy to follow, though some more English information boards would have been nice, given that most of Stavanger seems to speak the language and many English",
          "The artifacts were just laid out. There was some explanation, but nothing really engaged you...and they didn't really frame the rather general display explanations in any historical context. Honestly, if you are interested in Viking artifacts, go to the Field Museum in Chicago",
          "Lots of artefacts but dryly laid out. Worth it for old Norse and history enthusiasts but less interesting for the general public. Non-sequential layout felt repetitive and confusing.",

          "The Vikings left very little (in comparison to the Egyptians and Romans) and that is clearly shown in this museum. There is a bit of jewelry, pottery, tools, and other fragments, but not really a great exhibit. Lots of reading, and quite a few show cases. The fee was $50 kr,",

          "We arrived too late in the afternoon for a full tour. However the desk assistant was very kind in allowing our entry without charge. Very thoughtful. I would have enjoyed this museum more if I could read Norwegian. What was interesting was the strong role of women in the Viking",

          "We accidentally wandered onto the street that led up to this Tower. We saw a few paths that were a combination of stairs and cobblestone roads. The views facing the harbor were not good due to the trees and large cruise ship docked on the side closest to the Tower. We saw",
          "We were wandering around Stavanger and decided to go to this place for a view which was magnificent across the town. It was built for watchmen to look for fire or smoke across the town, historically, but is now a lovely piece of architecture which is worth a look. We didn't go",
          "The climb to the water tower is a must to appreciate fantastic views of Stavanger and beyond. It wasn't very well sign posted so we had to ask.",
          "Enjoy nice view over the city from this easily reachable viewing point. You will not be disappointed.",
          "In the 1800s, a watchman kept watch over the city looking for smoke and fire. The watchman had multiple jobs including acting as a fireman, police officer to maintain the peace, and often sang watchman songs to the residents. Construction was completed in 1853. The tower was",
          "50 kroner for a view through some windows from a little higher level than the surroundings was way overpriced in our opinion. There\u2019s no possibility to pay with card.",
          "Decided to go up the steep approach to this tower, unfortunately couldnt go in for a look, nice views of surrounding areas, this is not good for anyone with knee or ankle problems or in a wheelchairs in my opinion",
          "As a structure in its own right this is nothing spectacular but it has historic interest and its location on the top of a mound means that it does command some good views.",
          "Even though the old wooden fire tower has been upgraded by stone and concrete, it is definitely still worth a few minutes visit during the city walk. If nothing else, then the scenic view over the Old Stavanger. When you think back in the history, seeing the old wooden buildings",
          "... so can only review that. Like the view over the city, but as we had been to Pulpit Rock during the night and early morning, this was not really anything in comparison.",
          "The tower catches the eye. Good view from the site! When wandering about the port pop up for a view.",
          "one of the eye catching things as you enter the port, it\u2019s a bit of a steep climb but gives a nice view of surrounding area, also in a nice part of Stravanger to walk",
          "This is well worth the few minutes it takes to walk to the top of the tower. It offers great views of Stavanger and is inexpensive to visit.",
          "Walking around Stavanger, came across the Valbergtarnet watch tower by accident. Short steep walk up, but rewarded with great views across the waters of the harbor.",
          "The view is super nice when you are next to the tower - you can see the whole Stavanger from there! \u2764\ufe0f",
          "A short walk from the center of Stavanger. Great view of the city. A good cafe nearby, with great lunch menu.",
          "Old tower that tops the city center of Stavanger, of moderate interest as a piece of atchitecture, but still a nice place on the top of the hill to get a good view over the entire old Stavanger and the harbour.",

          "Friday 7th September and we were in Stravanger on the final leg of our cruise of the Norwegian Fjords and we were out and about exploring and sightseeing. We visited this tower, which is one of the landmarks of Stavanger's skyline. It was built between1850 and 1853 and was an",
          "Good view of the old town of Stavanger, such a shame there was a cruise ship blocking half of the view.",

          "We walked the lovely winding streets of Stavanger until we came across this fire watch tower built in the 1850\u2019s. As all the buildings were wood there was a need to watch for smoke before a fire broke out. It\u2019s on top of a small hill and it was a place to see the view from. We",
          "Centrally located this former fire watch tower was a nice way to spend a few minutes. It was 50 krone to climb the tower and the entrance fee was taken by a lady who recorded your entry by way of a line on a five bar gate. It is a relatively short climb with glimpses into the",
          "It\u2019s a lovely way to see Stavanger from above. It\u2019s only a few steps to the top and up a little hill above the port. It\u2019s a nice way to learn a little something about the history of Stavanger",
          "It's in the older part of town and was built 1850-3 to provide a high lookout for fires. The watchers then warned the locals who aided the firemen.The problem being that indoor warmth was and still is needed in winter and as with all naked flames there is a possibility of fire.",
          "A little climb up but well worth it as you can get some really nice panoramic views of Stavanger, its surroundings and the quayside.",
          "This is a attraction we just visited to take a picture and biked away... Views are not worth it... Haven\u2018t been on top because it was closed (sunday afternoon)",

          "We climb up the steep road to the watch tower to have a look and see the view apparently the tower was used for fire alarm back in the day as then most of Stavanger houses were made of wood. Entire fee is 50 NOK pp the tower was closed at the time & then it started to rain so we",
          "We walked up to the tower through some lovely shopping streets. We didn't bother paying the 50NOK entrance to climb higher because we had a fairly decent view once we arrived at the street level at the top of the hill",
          "We came here to see the views but to be honest you get better ones from other places. The tower was shut so we couldn't go inside but doubt it would be much better there.",
          "A bit of a climb up but does give some good photo opportunities towards the port area. It is possible to pay and go in.",
          "Great photo opportunity, it was closed when i visited but took a piccie of the guns #asyoudo , well worth the climb up , worth a look \ud83d\udc40 just for the view looking down",
          "There is a small museum-like collection upon entry and the hours are 10 am to 3 or 4 pm daily (closed Mondays). Admission fee translates to 5 English pounds for adults. Time did not permit us to go in and take a tour (cruise ships don't wait for anyone) but we did appreciate",
          "I was a little disappointed by this experience as I thought you could get to the little tower on the top, but actually it's just to the room below. The views were nice but the glass is very old so the view is distorted a little. I really think this was overpriced for what you",
          "Not worth going out of your way for but worth seeing if you're passing. Its right by the shopping area so hard to miss it. Not a great view of the city, plenty of better places for that like Valandstarnet (15 min walk out of centre in Valandsparken)",
          "No need to pay to get Inside, all the historic stuff is available. The view from the hill is worth the few steps up the streets.",
          "The tower is right in the shopping district. There are only 48 steps to the top. There is some historical information to be read, but to me, I climb towers for the view. At the top there are small windows for taking photos. The views are pretty limited, with most being just",
          "The story of being a watchtower, mainly for fires, for the city is well explained on the first floor with some panels. Also the several artifacts from the era are interesting. But don't think its a big exhibition orso, its tiny in a cozy way. The Second, top, floor gives very",
          "Valbergtarnet is a cool historical building and is worth a visit. The only reason I was a little stingey with the stars is because it is a very short and limited experience. It is a historic building with a fascinating fire-watch history that takes just a few minutes to see in",
          "Built as a fire watch tower it is imposing and dominates the hill overlooking the harbor. Young children will love climbing the steps to the top. Lots of displays on each level. There is a small charge to visit.",
          "This watchtower is right in the middle of the shopping district up on the top of the hill. Great views of the city and the harbor. I thought it was a light house at first but found out that it was a fire station. Interesting old building that's worth a visit.",
          "Right in the heart of Stavanger. Easy to get to. Good climb to the viewing area and an excellent view from the top. Interesting things to read about on the way up. Small charge.",
          "Great spot in Stavanger - the kids will love the cannonballs around as well! Good spot to come for a walk, take in the views and get some nice photos. When in Stavanger, you can see everything!",
          "Just take a detour and trot up here. Great views of the city, although windy. Probably a good place to bring your coffee on a sunny day.",
          "Its a tower and a good point to use to establish your position in the city. It does have a good position to look out over the harbour",
          "Valbergtarnet is an old fire watch tower with a terrace that offers great views over Stavanger all the way to Sandnes. There are a lot of foot paths around, so combine it with a nice walk. In summer the tower is sometimes open at the weekends for coffee and cake!",
          "Great view to the harbour. It takes a while to get there as it is high up on a hill but it worth the effort",
          "Great piece of architecture Visable from most places in the city Really interesting to read the history about the watch tower.",
          "formerly is a city watch tower (when fire alarm system technology invented yet). From the tower when the watchman detect fire outbreaks and could notify residents by bell ringing and cannon shots. Now This tower became a museum, you can walk uphill and saw the view of the city",
          "There are numerous points in Stavanger from where you can experience great views but this one is really in the heart of the city so you get there very quickly. The view is amazing!",
          "You get a great view of Stavanger city and partly of the fjord and marina. For that you don't have to climb up the tower. Ticket costs 50 Nok to climb up the tower. In my opinion you get a great view from outdoors too.",
          "not sure why they ask for 50kr for the ticket, general nothing much to see but i assume thats the highest point in Stavanger city? It is a good chance to grab the overview of the stavanger city and partly of the fjord.",
          "We found Valbergtarnet and walked up the small incline to see the views. It was certainly worth the effort, great views over Stavanger and the harbour. You could pay approx \u00a35 to walk up the steps in the tower to get an even better view, but we thought that was too expensive!",
          "We walked up to the tower and were rewarded with great views of the town and fjord however other tourists who paid to enter the tower did not feel it was value for money.",
          "50Kr per a person to climb two floors that had limited views and history. We thought it was hardly worth the time and money.",
          "You can see most if the modern stavanger city from standing there. there is also a canon there which was situated to defend the city from viking attack. most of the time the tower remain close so make sure about the timing,",
          "Yes it's a tall tower and yes it has history but very little else can drag you in. Good sunny day helped. Yes it's up high and you can see most of Stavanger from the top but nothing of major interest for me.",
          "Built as a lookout for fires, the tower affords nice views of the city and teaches about the history of firefighting in Stavanger.",
          "Nice view on a sunny day but unfortunately no viewing platform so one needs to take pictures/look through the windows.",
          "The only tall building surrounding by the shops. It's a nice place to visit to see the surrounding area. It's close during my visit but it's good to see it and view the shops n harbour.",

          "The old firehouse got a decent view of the town, got few exhibits of erstwhile firefighting equipment (refer pic) but can\u2019t really be called a museum. Not worth the entry fees as was done with it within 5 to 10 minutes. Visited June 2015",

          "During a cruise visit to Stavanger I visited the Valbergtarnet (watch tower and look-out point). There is a small charge (NOK 30) to enter the museum element (mainly the upper floors of the tower) where there are a few exhibits and some information boards explaining the history",
          "Built for its views of the olde city to keep watch for fires. Though some say it was to watch over the waterways for those contemplating invading.... (I go with the fire theory). Makes sense with a city of wooden houses and structures. From all around the city you can witness",
          "Well, its a tower over the city The short history is that the fire-marchal, lived here and looked over the city incase of a fire. So an early firefighter. There is a nice view from the top over the city!",

          "This was a nice place to get some great views and pics over Stavanger. During the day the tower is open, and for \u20ac4 you can tour inside. Middle floor is a small tiny museum that talks about the history of the tower, the top floor has 360 views of the city and harbor.",
          "Valbergt\u00e5rnet used to be the watch tower in Stavanger. The guardians would be on the lookout for fire. Today it is a charming sight in the 'skyline' of Stavanger and offers a nice view over the Stavanger harbour."

          "RIB with guide to Lysefjord We had four stops on the trip. The trip and the length as well as the boatman ship was perfect. The selected stops as well. What made this trip a two and not five was the lack of information and guiding. We\u2019ve done RIB trips before where there were",
          "An unforgettable trip to Fl\u00f8rli and the Lysefjord! Fantastic views after reaching the top of the Fl\u00f8rli stairs, (4444 steps.) But the highlight was still with the RIB boat, and its excellent guide and captain at the FjordEvents AS!",

          "Fl\u00f8rli 4444, take a great RIB ride into Lysefjorden with a challenging hike up the 4444 stairs to the mountain of Fl\u00f8rli. Roundtrip is recomended with \u00abrallarvegen\u00bb when walking down again. Fjordevent has a great crew with a lot of knowledge of Lysefjorden. They will speed up",
          "Enjoyed every minute! From putting on the suits provided, through to the fast ride up the fjord, together with the stops to gaze at the natural beauty, it was just an incredible experience. Then just when you think it can\u2019t get any better, we stop as two sea eagles are spotted",

          "We chose this activity because we were too late to book the hiking tour to Preikestolen. We have no regrets at all! The boat goes fast (70 km per hour), but it is not scary at all. We felt safe because of the comfortable seats and the life jackets. We were very close to the",

          "I don't see how you could visit Stavanger & miss seeing Lysefjord & Pulpit Rock, albeit from sea level. If we'd had more time I'd have hiked to the top. The only complaint for me is that the ship should have more outside seats. Pricey too but that's just Norway. The scenery is",
          "Very good trip to see Pulpit Rock and luckily it was a clear day although bitterly cold. We were on an organised tour through P&O Ventura and it included a stop for waffles and coffee. Excellent tour and we got to see the Fjord and learn about the local history. We sat on the",

          "I booked this boat trip direct when I knew we were stopping in Stavanger on our cruise itinerary (it cost double to book via Royal Caribbean) Their website makes it so easy to book & only a few minute walk from where the cruise ship docks. Brilliant tour! Shame about people",
          "This review is a little late. We took this cruise on our first port stop en route to North Cape and it was a great introduction to the Norwegian Fjords. We were pleasantly surprised at how picturesque it all is. We saw the waterfall, Pulpit Rock, seals and goats. As others",

          "Loved this ride out and around the fjords! Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and a small snack bar that served beer! The crew authorized and opened the doors on the bow of the ship when there were great photo opportunities! We booked on our own, thru their website for about",
          "I was on a 12 day cruise and booked this independently to save myself money. It was a sunny day and it was a three hour cruise. It is so beautiful here. We saw Pulpit Rock from the boat and the boat came super close to a large waterfall. I was on the top and could not believe",
          "Prior to our 8 day Norway cruise, I found this Fjord cruise on line and got all the details such as where the cruise boat was moored and prices etc. The Roedne cost was \u00a345.00 per person whereas our cruise ship was charging \u00a3102.00 per person so it pays to researth the tour",

          "This is a fun activity to do with visitors. It's a long boat ride, I think about 3 hours. It's interesting to hear the descriptions about the sites and a nice way to see the fjord. My advice is to bring enough warm clothes so that you can sit outside in any weather! I definitely",
          "I would tell you not to miss this Cruise. It is a wonderful way to see the fjords around Stavanger. The scenery is breath taking, The ships crew were excellent and very helpful to point out points of interest. At one point they took the ship close to a major beautiful waterfall",
          "Study the weather forecasts on BBC weather and Yr.com to see when it won;t be raining. Then go online on the rainless day and book your tickets with Roedne in spring and autumn, or Tide in the summer, and do the Lysefyord cruise. 3 hours of real pleasure with stunning views plus",
          "In the UK this trip would cost about \u00a315 a head. Here it is nearer \u00a350. But then the UK doesn't have fjords, mountains or scenery like this! Worth every penny. If you penny-pinch in Norway you will hate, bow the budget and have some memories worth having.",
          "The cruise to reach the fjord took about an hour, then you spend half an hour in the fjord looking at the famous pulpit rock and waterfalls and then another hour back to Stavanger. The fjord lived up to expectations although it was not easy to get a true appreciation of the",

          "This cruise was excellent, the scenery was stunning. The snow topped hills in the background and the fjords themselves were incredible! We sat on deck it was a chilly but sunny day hat an scarfs were required. There was a guide played in English throughout the tour informing us",
          "We took Roedne Fjord Cruise's Lysefjord Cruise in mid-October, and were very struck by the beauty of the leaves changing on trees along the fjord. The waterfalls were also prominent, fed by recent rain and snow. This is a fantastic albeit somewhat pricey activity for families,",
          "It was very easy for us to walk from our cruise ship to catch this fjord cruise. Bought our tickets right on the dock. This is the best trip to Lysefjord and Pulpit Rock! Enjoyed every minute of the trip and well worth our time and money. Don't miss this one!!",
          "If you are spending the day in Stavanger, this is the best way to experience a Norwegian fjord. The boat ride takes you out to the Lysefjord where every minute of the cruise is majestic.",
          "Seeing Pulpit Rock from below makes you really appreciate just how high up you are when standing on top of it. Well worth the few hours that this trip takes. My only recommendation would be to do this before you hike up to Pulpit Rock and not afterwards, although we didn't",
          "I cannot recommend this tour enough! We set off on a cloudy Saturday morning, the weather as it seems to do in Norway can be grey one minute and a glorious range of colours not long after and we weren't disappointed! The blues of the fjord, the autumn colours around it were",
          "Took this cruise on a lovely Fall Saturday in October from Stavanger. Departed at 11 and returned around 2 from the dock near the major hotels in downtown. Boat arrived at 1030 and I bought my ticket from the crew. I would recommend you buy online especially during high season;",

          "I walked up, purchased a ticket and jumped on board. The cruise was about 3 hours, and offered nice views of the coastal fiords that is all of western Norway. The cruise was well narrated, included dramatic music, and ended up well into the Lysefjord directly under Pulpit",
          "We came to this part of Norway for the Lysefjord. We were staying in Forsand and did not want to go up into Stavanger to get the boat. We were able to book online and get picked up at Lysefjordsenteret which saved us a lot of time. The cruise had very good views of the fjord.",
          "We booked through this tour company months before we were due to be in Stavanger, and all we had to do was walk up to the boat on the day of our tour, and our name was on the list. Otherwise, you can just walk up and buy a ticket, although, pre booking may be a good idea if a",

          "This was a great tour from our cruise ship, even though it was a bit overcast. The boat was great, plenty of windows to look out. We also went out on the deck in the front and rear, as well as the upper deck. Plenty of great viewing options. David was our tour guide on the ship.",
          "On a recent fjord cruise this was our first port of call. The excursion offered by P&O was very expensive and we didn't want to book ahead since Norwegian weather is unpredictable. The Roedne 3 hour trip was full at 10 but another left at 1 so we bought our tickets before",
          "Well, Norway is expensive and this Cruise was more so as it was booked via the Cruise Ship, little choice really as the ship left 30 minutes after we finished the cruise. The Cruise boat was in my opinion very dated and the windows not that big, surely it would make sense to",

          "I unfortunately chose a rainy day to go, but the views were still incredible. The information given is nice, the snack bar was good to have, the length of the tour was just right. Only complaint was the size of the viewing deck. At any of the stops the decks get overcrowded and",
          "Unfortunately it was raining when we took this trip, but we were very glad to be on the great boat, be on the fjord and see waterfalls and superb scenery. Recommend pre-booking as it is very popular and a wonderful alternative to cruise ship pricey excursions.",
          "We enjoyed our tour with Roedne Fjord cruise in June. I was impressed with the view and opportunity to see the goats, taste the water from the water fall, see Pulpit Rock from the fjord and enjoy the beauty of Norway. It was a bit chaotic when we first left with many people",

          "We took this cruise the day after we actually hiked up the Lysefjord. It was really fun to see from the bottom and look up at where we had been the day before. Definitely put things in to perspective. There was a lot of open space up top but no seating. Beautiful views and up",
          "We took this cruise as an extra excursion with our Viking Ocean Cruise. The ship is comfortable though there are only a limited number of window seats so act fast. Luckily, people were moving around to take photos and go onto the other decks to watch the fjord and passing",

          "Very friendly staff who speaks Norwegian, English and German. The views are amazing! My only comment would be that the audio guide on the ship wasn't loud enough. In addition, I found the audio to be quite limited in the number of information it gave us. I would prefer to hear",

          "We were on a cruise, but I booked this myself directly with Roedne before we left on the cruise. price was so much more reasonable! We enjoyed the ride and narration- useful info but not continuous. Someone complained about the music- I thought it was great 'cause when he",
          "There was seating inside and out, if you really want to sit outside, make sure you arrive early although it was not a problem for the ride we were on. There were a few stops on the way to Pulpit Rock with narration. Pulpit Rock itself is not as exciting from the water side,",
          "We took this cruise twice, one of them combined with the Pulpit Rock trek. Enjoyed it thoroughly. The boats are comfortable and the staff courteous. I only wish they had headphones for the narration instead of over a speaker so you could hear better and get more content in",
          "Although the scenery is nice, we weren't blown away by the music playing at every boat stop and the overall \"tourist trap\" atmosphere. Half the boat was asleep on the way back and the boat was very crowded. Definitely a bit expensive for what you get out of it. For younger or",

          "We booked online a few weeks before just in case but in the end, they were still selling on the day and it was not full (aug 28th). The trip is entertaining; not the best fjord but if you are in stavanger you must see Lysefjorden. It takes it's time going out, stopping at a few",
          "So yeah, the trip was gorgeous but there was limited seating with views to outside. And when you do go outside to stand, there are few places to do that as well. In addition, the microphone was not working and there were no backups that could replace the broken one. I did",
          "A well organized, value for money tour that takes you away from city life to absolutely beautiful scenery. As you cruise the fjords one bit of natural beauty follows the next. Birdlife, sea animals, waterfalls and scenery abounds. You may sit indoors or stand out on the deck.",

          "During our visit to Stavanger, our tour with Rodne Fjord Cruises to Lysefjord and Pulpit Rock was certainly the highlight. We had arrived by cruise ship and although we had already been cruising through the fjords, this excursion with a smaller boat was absolutely worth it.",

          "This was my first time trying VR, and I loved it. The VR-movie takes place in a Viking ship. The staff is dressed in Viking clothes and the whole place has a great atmosphere. I don\u2019t want to give away any spoilers about the movie other than that I really recommend it. It\u2019s",
          "I tried the new VR experience, sitting in the Viking ship with my collegues having this headset on that gave us an almost real experience of going back in time to see a story about King Harald Fairhair. It was awesome to experience this and I have never before seen this anywhere",
          "Wow, I got totally amazed .sitting down in the wiking ship and putting on the vr glasses and transported back hundred of year to the spectacular wiking history and life . Can really recommend to everyone\u2764"

          "If your ship docks in Stavanger take the time to do a 10 minute walk around the end of the harbour and visit the Stavanger Cathedral. It is beautiful! The first thing that strikes you as you enter is the simplicity and grandeur of this old house of worship. I think we are all",
          "We were lucky to visit while a rehearsal was going on so we not only got to enjoy the strong architecture and beautiful lighting, but also the acoustics. Recommend enjoying both the inside and the surrounding grounds.",
          "Not the most interesting place to spend time in. 5min will do. They even charged an entrance fee of 50NOK.",
          "Beautiful cathedral , amazing inside and out. Set in a lovely square you can still see parts that were not destoryed by fire several hundred years ago",
          "The Cathedral will be celebrating 900 years in 2025, so they will soon be giving it a face lift. Don't know if it will be closed to the public then or not. It is amazing how it has stood this number of years, despite a fire that destroyed it's roof. It is a blend of Gothic",
          "It is in the midle of the city and the only Norwegian cathedral in continuous use since the 1300s. Norway\u2019s best-kept cathedral is located only a stone\u2019s throw from the Stavanger harbour. This is the only cathedral from the Middle Age that has kept its original",
          "St Swithun\u2019s is well worth a visit. Unfortunately the frontage was all covered with scaffolding and sheeting when we were there but the inside is well worth 30 minutes of your time",
          "There is something different about this church compared to similar churches. This was built to last and has wonderful masterpieces to view on the walls and there is no charge. Look back up at the organ and there is glass boxes on the floor with old artefact. There is currently",
          "With limited time available came to visit but couldn\u2019t get in. Had to make do with walking round outside. Appreciate the Cathedral was built around 1150 and it appears to have some interesting windows. It\u2019s age alone would make this a worthwhile visit. Easy walking distance",
          "We didn't actually go inside this cathedral as we were time limited but it looked beautiful from the outside. There was some renovation going on and there were boards telling you what was going on. Worth a look although there is an entrance fee.",
          "Having spent the last couple of years visiting many spectacular cathedrals in Spain and Italy, we didn\u2019t expect much from Stavanger. This cathedral, however, has a fascinating history and a feeling of solidity that sits well in this Norwegian town. The pulpit is stunning, as are",
          "Norway\u2019s oldest cathedral built early 12th century lies near the harbor and along a picturesque lake. When I first visited in 1979 the entrance to this cathedral was free. \u201cAbout eight years ago,\u201d as I was told, \u201cthe church started charging\u201d\u201450kr/$5.00USD\u2014with the influx of",
          "Entrance costs 25 NOK and discourage to visit. From outside looks nice but doesn\u2019t knock down on knees ;-)",
          "Although they charge to go in (either NOK or credit card), the church actually has some unique features that are worth seeing. The wooden plaques (not sure what to call them) from 1650's are very well done by the woodcarver and are in excellent shape.",
          "Very pretty cathedral. Nice for a quick visit. Do have to pay to get into the Cathedral and some renovation work is going on.",
          "This cathedral is listed as the oldest in Norway and situated in the centre of the town. The main stain glass windows were being refurbished and won't be back in place until 2025, but the rest of the building is still worth a visit. It's about \u00a35 entry.",
          "Lovely place easily walked from the cruise terminal unfortunately it is currently renovated but is due to be complete in October 2019. The surrounding areas and lake are stunning and well worth a visit with fabulous scenery",
          "Very beautiful smaller cathedral. Very interesting history and construction. Under renovation. Lovely architecture. Well worth the visit.",
          "This cathedral is interesting to walk through with numerous items of worth noting. It is actually not very large, though, and our visit ended up being rather brief. For us, worth the short walk.",
          "This is a beautiful little cathedral which is quite nice to spend some time in. I did especially love the pulpit-- one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. Rick Steves' book had a nice tour including some easter eggs on the pillars which were fun to find.",
          "Highlights of this church include half is Roman,  half is gothic. The Pulpit is amazing,  one of the best we've ever seen. So much detail. Worth the visit. There are 5 large carvings on the wall by the same artist which are also very detailed. The stained glass they advertised",
          "Slightly disappointing to find the front of the cathedral covered, apparently the restoration work won't be finished until 2025. Inside the cathedral was simply impressive especially the 7 wooden epitaphs.",
          "A stunning example of old traditional Nirwegian Cathedral. The interior is minimalist until.you look more closely at the stunning art work on the walls and the highly ornate decorative pulpit.",
          "You pay a fee to enter but it is worth it. The inside and outside of this ancient cathedral are gorgeous and they allow photos. There are informational panels by the different features. Also, listen for the bells to chime the hour.",
          "Not a huge cathedral but it\u2019s in keeping with the charming city of Stavanger. Not far from the shopping area and the cruise terminal.",
          "Also known as Domkirken or St Swithun\u2019s Cathedral, it is the oldest Cathedral in Norway. Once inside, you will see one of the best-preserved medieval cathedrals in Europe. Established in 1125 as a Lutheran church, the Cathedral was the resting place for the arm of St Swithun.",
          "Looked beautiful and interesting from the outside. Did not get to see anything else as under renovation.",
          "It's a bit tricky to get into the building, queuing can occur due to the limited ticket sale facilities and volunteers, who try to manage the flow of tourists through the structure. Small structure inside, not easy to take photos, very crowded. Still, impressively old, building",
          "The fact that the cathedral was undergoing some renovation did not diminish its appeal! The most impressive feature is its beautifully ornate, brightly-painted and carved pulpit!!!!!!",
          "Expensive for the size of the facility but isn't everything expensive in Norway, particularly food. The interior is interesting particularly the wooden carvings of the pulpit.",
          "The original glass stained glass windows are being renovated, such a shame because the pictures of the originals show that this would have been a lovely place to visit on a walk around Stavanger. Small yet interesting place and the entrance fee, given the main attraction weren't",
          "The cathedral is in the process of renovation prior to a major anniversary celebration so it is not possible to see the whole of the exterior at the moment. It is tiny for a cathedral but delightful and contains some wonderful carvings done by an English craftsman. There",
          "It cost 50 NOK which is understandable, but I am not sure if I would say it is worth the money if you, like us, have visited many churches.",
          "The wooden pulpit and wooden effigies are amazing examples of the craft. However, the dom is under renovation, so it is difficult to see everything one would like. Taking photos is allowed.",
          "This beautiful cathedral was so different from the Catholic Cathedrals of Europe. It is Lutherian and it's beauty is in its simplicity. Beautiful carved wood pulpits and memorials. The stonework is so solid, tactile, wonderful atmosphere. Well worth visiting.",
          "Sorry Stavanger Cathedral but you are not worth the 50 Krone entrance fee. Small dank cathedral with pretty windows. Think more money would be gained by lowering the entrance fee to entice visitors in and then its likely more donations would be given. My advice is to stay",
          "A small Cathedral not far from the quayside. Unfortunately lots of scaffolding around the building so unable to admire fully. Lovely narrow cobbled streets to get there",
          "a fantastic space maybe based on winchester. its small in comparison but still worth looking through and taking a quiet moment. i think its norways oldest cathederal.",
          "Compact Cathedral unfortunately front covered in scaffolding when we visited but good architectural interest. Set in a small park with large pond full of ducks and swan",
          "Cathedral wise this isn't a very big building but what it hasn't in size it has in history built in 1225 and some excellent interior epitaphs and the pulpit which to me is the main feature which covers the complete history of the bible starting with Adam and Eve.There are other",
          "Built in 1225, it is Norway's oldest cathedral. It is beautiful both inside & outside. It is just off the town center & easy to get to.",
          "The building itself has a long and rich history, and the range of architectural styles used in construction should be enough to keep anyone mildly interested in architecture happy for 30 minutes.",
          "The Stavanger Cathedral , aka \"Domkirken\" is located in down-town Stavanger. It was build in 1125 and the Cathedral has been a focal Stavanger town. One little challenge \"Domkirken\" is that there is always some maintenance work going on.",
          "I have been to dozens of Middle Ages churches, both stone and stavkirke. This is the best in Norway, much better than Trondheim. Make sure you look for the detail carvings on the columns, top and bottom. They are all different and tell a story. I find this to be a very holy",
          "Has history to this cathedral. Once inside there is a sense of calm and tranquility. The artwork inside is phenomenal.",
          "This is a very significant cathedral - built in 1125. Unfortunately, it was closed for renovations while we were here but my husband managed to sneak a look when the cleaning crew let him in. By his accounts, it was fascinating",
          "This is a a lovely cathedral with an amazing carved wood pulpit. It is a bit less elaborate in general, as it is in part Romanesque. However, it is harder to find such wonderful examples of Romanesque architecture.",
          "Walked past here several times during my stay in Stavanger. Just a normal cathedral to be honest. All cathedrals have nice architecture in general but this one had no wow factor that makes it a must visit.",
          "There is an admission fee, but it's a fascinating visit--and a dry place on a rainy day. Smaller than cathedrals to the south, this one has a fascinating history worth exploring.",
          "The Stavanger cathedral was there before the city was there. Built in ca.1125 this was the start for the entire city. Norway\u00b4s most ancient cathedral in continuous use for almost 900 years. Petite, intimate, cosy and majestic at the same time. The famous Andrew Smith carved",
          "A stunning Cathedral that, although is being currently renovated at the moment, has still lots to offer the visitor. The gem within is the hand carved pulpit, highly decorated and imposing. The immediate surrounding area is also somewhere to relax, especially near the Old",
          "It's more of a church size than a cathedral but it is lovely inside. You pay the mandatory admission fee (30 NKr) but then you are free to spend as much time as you like in there. The decor is a bit of a mixture of styles but the detail is fascinating.",
          "The stone Stavanger Cathedral was built in 1125. As many of these older churches it started out Catholic and then shifted to Lutheran after the Reformation. Our guide told us that the cathedral was built in exchange for a divorce by Bishop Raynalt of England. The style is both",
          "A nice place to visit, especially the adventurous. People here are friendly though some of them prefer you to speak their languages. However, they are eager to help you as long as you make your questions understandable.",
          "A beautiful and ancient old cathedral. Massive ancient hard carved stone columns and a high wood beam roof. An amazing pipe organ and beautiful huge carved memorial plaques carved in the 1600\u2019s to honor past leaders of the church. One of the most impressive and beautiful",
          "The church is undergoing major renovations. There was a 50 kroner entrance fee with pleasant, polite young people at the door. Very impressive inside with fabulous wood carvings.",
          "This Cathedral is known as St Swithins and in in the heart of the city of Stravanger, in Cathedral Square.The entrance fee was 50 Krone (roughly \u00a35 each). Currently there is some restoration work been undertaken on the Cathedral so that it will be fully restored in time for its",
          "Stavanger Domkirke is the Oldest Cathedral still in use in Norway. The original structure was built in the 1100s approximately. From the outside, it looks impressive with one exception. There is some renovation being done at the front of the church. The inside was not open",
          "900 year old church see during a cruise excursion. Lovely carvings and stained glass with interesting interior.",
          "Cost money to see this Cathedral, I liked the vibe and it was worth taking a look. Old style and vibe",
          "Really dramatic and takes the best photos EVER! Its very peaceful and in walking distance from almost everything. It is worth visiting while you are in Stavanger!",
          "Only saw from the outside...it was late and I think they were charging admission to see this really small place. I don't pay to go into church and I'm Catholic.",
          "Almost 900 yrs old now under renovation. We eere lucky to visit a christening. Church music is something special. Worth the visit.",
          "This is a nice quick stop while in the tourist section of town. The cathedral itself is pretty from the outside with great stone work. Inside the carvings from the 1600s are nice as well the pipe organ. Worth a quick look.",
          "This may be special in stavanger, but in global terms it is a small highly restored church with no notable features. There are some nice carvings, but nothing memorable or special. It is an expensive place to pray.",
          "It is a very old cathedral built in 1125. It is closed for at least 2 more years for renovations. They told us that they still have concerts held there but right now none.",
          "While I cannot comment on the interior of the cathedral (it was closed due to a local private concert), the exterior of the building and the building\u2019s history is quit formidable. The area surrounding the cathedral is very quaint, with many local ships selling authentic",
          "Visited this cathedral whilst in Stavanger. What a beautiful church it is! It was very busy as was raining outside and please follow the signs you enter and exit different doors! Very pretty and so peaceful and colourful Highly recommend \ud83d\ude01",
          "This nearly 900 old church is situated in the center of Stavanger. It is undergoing restauration work, and will be closed for public in 2020, but are no open and worth a visit. Tourist needs to pay a fee to visit the cathedral, to cover the cost of caretakers and cleaning. Well",
          "The epitaph carvings were very intricate and worked by an Alexander Smith. I have been unable to find him on Google.",
          "Walked past this beautiful landmark, if you are going to Stavanger you need to come and see this. We learnt about the history of the cathedral and how the two ends are built differently, and that Englishmen built it.",
          "I did a walking tour of this lovely town. The Cathedral was beautiful, built over 50 years between 1100 and 1150 by the English Bishop Reinald. and unchanged over that time frame, worth visiting.",
          "A very beautiful and old-fashioned cathedral in Stavanger, it looks very nice and it was worth the trip.",
          "Stavanger. Old town. Lovely white wooden houses, narrow streets and loads of flowers, especially roses. Town centre has a large lake with a fountain which is pleasant to walk round. The cruise ship terminal is right by the old town and 5 minutes from the cathedral and the",
          "The cathedral is an attractive building. Inside it is not ostentatious. There are only a few stained glass windows, with nature pictures rather than saints. There are also some epitaphs from the 1600's. There is an admission charge of around $6 US, you can pay by credit",
          "This medieval church has some of the most beautiful wood carvings I have ever seen! The church was established in 1125 and is located in the city center.",
          "So close to the cruise port, and a quiet refuge. The 17th century family portraits incorporated into elaborate are a snapshot of a lost period, the carved pulpit ditto.",
          "Up on the hillock overlooking the harbour is the Domkirk - Stavanger's cathedral. It's not the most amazing church I've been in but there are some really nice 17th century monuments (made by a Scot would you know!) Other than that the pulpit is definitely worth a look! Being",
          "As we went to the shopping district, we wandered and found this beautiful cathedral. There is an entrance fee of 50 NOK but worth it ..great things to see.",
          "We were encourged to go to the church because the stained glass was wonderful. When we got there the windows looked almost asian in design and when we asked we were told that the were being repaired and wouldn't be reinstalled till 2019. If we knew that we may have skipped it",
          "You have to pay to go in but only 50 NOK so worth going in. Great artefacts and things to see. Well worth the trip up to the entrance.",
          "Crunched for time, we took a look around the Cathedral before heading into the shopping district for just a short time as well. So much to do, and so little time, since our afternoon was taken up by a boat tour to Pulpit Rock. Still some nice photos.",
          "While walking around Stavanger we come apond the cathedral you can not miss it so high on the sky line. This Cathedral is of gothic style and dates back to around 1125 the wood caved pulpit and the organ were wonderful unfortunately some of the facade is under renovation.",
          "It's a bit disappointing that the cathedral will be under renovation, with parts of the famous facade blocked from view. The renovations are in preparation for the church's 900th anniversary. But it's still a sight to see a structure older than most countries. The cathedral is",
          "I was lucky enough to catch an organ recital in this graceful 10th century church, complete with harpsichord and choir - just lucky! I\u2019m a bit of a fan of medieval European churches, and this Norwegian medieval has all the elements including inspiring medieval masonry etc. It\u2019s",
          "Walking distance from the cruise port. Historic building and free of charge. Definitely worth a visit when in town.",
          "Celebrating its milleniium in existence soon. Beautiful building. Being renovated at the moment. Not open very often but recommend you try on a Sunday",
          "This is the oldest cathedral in Norway built in 1150s with gothic style architecture. It is well maintained with beautiful stained glass at the back but unfortunately was under repair at the time of our visit. My only complaint is that there is an entrance fee of 50 Nkk",
          "Construction of the Cathedral started around 1100 and it was finished around 1150. In 1272 the Cathedral was heavily damaged by the city's fire. Lots of paintings and the pulpit was done by Andrew Smith.Today the Cathedral is again undergoing restorations.",
          "What more can I say, it's a church with some impressive decorated windows, which unfortunately get broken by the local people quite often, so there are often reparations going on.",
          "Lovely small cathedral right by the harbour, very intricate detail to the pulpit. Well worth going inside, even if you don\u2019t have much time.",
          "Nice Cathedral in a good location. The Cathedral has a nice front as well as back, which does not look like back side actually. You\u2019ll never miss it when you go to the city center. It\u2019s big and beautiful.",
          "This cathedral is a building you will not miss as it is central to the main town and has the local park with pond. It has a long history which they are trying to maintain through renovation work.",
          "Originally a Catholic cathedral in 1125 it has seen many changes. Definitely worth the visit when it is open.",
          "A amazing Cathedral in Stavanger, Norway, raised in year 1125. Located in downtown Stavanger and you can`t miss seeing the Cathedral wherever you are. Only one thing which is a bit negative: The Cathedral is more or less covered with some scaffoldings due to maintenance, but",
          "Another on the \u201cto visit list\u201d , my late mother loved visiting churches and this one with its stunning architecture outside and especially in would have been a winner in her eyes . Its a iconic Stavanger Cathedral and well worth a visit .\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude07",
          "It was closed when I went but it is beautiful from outside! It is next to a lake and the scenario during winter is bucolic and romantic.",
          "It appears to have great architecture but they are working on one side so it\u2019s covered. It\u2019s near the harbor and worth the walk.",
          "we visited during a busy day or else its always very busy. A small donation to enter and the walk round is worth it. the Pulpit was hadn't carved by a brit who went to Norway several hundred years ago, it is covered in art work and painted to such a standard it takes your",
          "We\u2019d seen so many beautiful churches by the time we stepped in here that maybe we were bound to be disappointed. It\u2019s quite plain and there\u2019s very little to see. It\u2019s interesting for being so old but that was about it for us.",
          "I was in stavanger for couple of days. The cathedral was under renovation but it was so beautiful. Totally recommend it",
          "It's medieval foundation dates back to the 1100's; subsequent revisions after natural disasters resulted in revisions of a more modern character. There is a fee to enter and it is tricky to figure out how and where that works. Go to the Tourist Information to find out where",
          "I almost didn't go into this cathedral but I am so glad I did. It was really beautiful in there and it smelled so old. Everyone talks about the pulpit and it is quite spectacular but I find that kind of thing a bit off putting and overwrought. What was great about this church",
          "From the 12th century! The carved wooden Pulpit is exquisite! Unfortunately, the stained glass windows were being repaired and restored so we were not able to see them. ( but we did see a picture of what they will look like when finished and I hope to see them like that",
          "On our visit to Stavanger sought out the Cathedral to visit not because of religious interest - purely historical interest. Unfortunately for some reason the doors were locked shut.",
          "The cathedral is just a short stroll from where the cruise ships dock. There is a small entrance fee but it is well worth the money. There is lots of information around the church in English which is worth reading but it's an amazing place to just sit and take it all in. The",
          "It is very interesting to visit the cathedral in Stavanger. It has the old design and well maintained. I liked the bell sound every hour.",
          "It is always a privilege to be in a place that has stood witness to significant change. That is certainly so for the once Roman Catholic but now Lutheran Cathedral. The no-fuss building says something of the matter-of-fact faith of sea-faring folk.",
          "Sadly there are renovating the exterior so that view wasn't the best for us but beautiful inside. About 30-35NOK to enter can't remember exactly but nice to see the Norwegian church style as someone who loves church hopping in Europe! Lovely stone detailing and the carved",
          "Cathedral is located at top of square, easy walking from Cruise terminal. Entrance fee is required but entry is very efficiently handled. Taking photographs is permitted. Lots of placards are tastefully located giving explanations of what you are looking at.",
          "A nice cathedral, but compared with others you are likely to come across in Norway nothing exceptional.... but certainly worth a visit. There is a nominal entrance fee, as with all cathedrals we came across in Norway and I believe that photography is prohibited, but very few",
          "You have to pay a small entrance charge which I don't mind if there is something to see. The church was having an organ moved which meant you could not get close to the pulpit or altar. Said a quick prayer and lit a candle.",
          "When we approached the cathedral, from the harbour area, we thought that it small and modest, and nearly didn't go in. Boy, am I glad we didn't walk on by! The inside is surprisingly large (almost Tardis-like!), and really beautiful. Coming from Durham City, my first impression",
          "As my sister and I were wandering in the city, we saw this church and entered it. There was no line, so we could just enter it. At the moment there was a Bach-serie. Sounds good. However, the church looks quite (below) average compared to churches in my country. Would still",
          "This church is within walking distance from the cruise port. It is on an elevated location and there is a line for the ticket sales. It was unusual because the churches in general do not charge admission. We walked around the church, it was peaceful to sit in a bench and watch",
          "The walls whisper history. Very well maintained and restored after a major fire. Most of the oldest relics were pillaged, but the architecture and carved stone are exquisite.",
          "Built in 1125, oldest functioning church in Norway. So interesting and accessible. Beautiful pipe organ and ornate decor. What a treat!",
          "It is not the thing you'd regret if you do not give a go. But the situation makes it attractive for pictures.",
          "As you stroll around Stavanger, be sure to stop in to the Cathedral and check it out. The cathedral is lined with crests of the noble families and each is truly a work of art. So stop by and see this truly beautiful Cathedral.",
          "Just located at the central of Stavanger, it's easy to find, you can go around and take some pictures.",
          "The stavanger Dom is under restauration. There was no way to visit the inside. The back side is covered.",
          "I have spent many quiet hours inside the Cathedral. Very historic, lovely interior and impressive in its construction. There are eight angel lights on the side walls that are lovely. At the time of my visits, it was open on Sunday morning for visitors to walk inside.",
          "Even if you're not catholic or religious, it's nice to see how well kept it is even being from the 1100's. I was surprised to see some others commenting it was free, I was charged to get in this year.",
          "This is a big old church. The stained glass and wood carvings are particularly beautiful. The roof, we were told, is made in the fashion of a ship. Worth a visit.",
          "Visited while in Stavanger on a cruise ship. Located right off the harbor in the old town. A small fee to enter. Simple interior that is wrapped in history. The stained glass windows are undergoing repair and are covered over with simple drawing of the windows. Worth a visit.",
          "Always nice to drop by, as it is close to everything in Stavanger. And the best of all, it is free :)",
          "In Trondheim I encountered the same; and entrancefee to come inside. My opinion still is that a visit to a church must be free and accesible for everybody. If you want to pay for a guided tour, thats fine as its a extra service. But to fot only to come inside is for me a no go.",
          "I'm not necessarily a fan of cathedrals but we were lucky enough to have a personal guide who had fascinating stories about its history. It made all of the difference to me.",
          "This is Stavanger's most important place of worship. It is located in a pedestrian area only a few hundred metros from the harbour. The inside is interesting and worth a look. There is no admission charge..",
          "Nine different faith traditions are gathering for a peace meal in the cathedral on Thursday 20th as part of the food festival. Inspiring",
          "This is the oldest building in Stavanger and worth a visit. True, is undergoing a huge restoration project that won't be finished till 2019, but I can't wait to see the results. The stained glass window will be the most impressive, with over 10,000 pieces it is a painstaking",
          "Walked to church from cruise or town no transport required cost 10NOK to visit, allowed to take photos.",
          "Right in the heart of Stravanger is this beautify cathedral. \u20ac3 in each, toddler free. They have a Visa card reader as we didn't have local currency.",
          "It always upsets me to pay to see a church no matter what the denomination. This was no exception so did not go inside. Was also nice told stained glass window was under renovation.",
          "I don't believe in charging people to go inside a church so that left a bad taste in my mouth. Don't know the real reason behind it as I doubt that they are so lack of money. It's a beautiful building right in town with lots of history. Looks strong like a castle.",
          "We saw this as part of a group tour, but I suspect it would be better to experience during a service. The interior combines early Medieval, late Medieval, Baroque, and even post-Reformation, from the fascinating remains of pre-Reformation wall paintings under the whitewash, to",

          "We visited Stavanger Cathedral on a Sunday afternoon. Entry is 30 NoK (approx \u00a32.70). The Cathedral has very plain architecture and no stained glass windows, although behind the altar area there is what looks like a modern painted window. The pulpit is very ornate and there",

          "Only 30 kroner to enter, it is very peaceful inside, you could pay a few more kroner to light a candle. There is a beautifully decorated pulpit. There is some restoration work being undertaken on one side of the catherdral but regardless it is a great place to see from inside",
          "The group I was with went to Stavanger to sing in the Cathedral. The acoustics were amazing and the cathedral was beautiful.",
          "this was a great church with lots to offer - stepping inside and looking at the massive pillars and organ and pipes, it was a fabulous visit. something to see when visiting Stavanger.",
          "Stavanger Cathedral is located in the heart of Old Town. You need to buy a ticket which was a little surprising as it is a church. It cost 30 nok. Construction of cathedral started around 1100 and it was finished around 1150. However the city of Stavanger counts 1125 as its",
          "Small cathedral in use since 1125, within walking distance from cruise ship docks. Small charge to view the interior and yes they take credit cards. Wood carvings are exceptional along with painted epitaphs that date back to 1600's. Interior is very simple. Stained glass windows",
          "We enjoyed spending time in this peaceful place. Quite a small Cathedral but with some beautiful carvings. Unfortunately the stain glass windows were being restored.",

          "Interesting building, open all day. Good for studying decoration or just for a quiet moment alone...",
          "Stavanger Cathedral has been in continuous use for 900 years and is very well preserved. There is a small entrance fee but well worth a visit. The stained glass window by the alter was being restored and in its place examples of the four seasons.",
          "The Stavanger Cathedral stands as a testimony to the power of the churches in past centuries. Only the kings could rival the churches in resources to build such massive and lasting constructions. Your feelings are mixed between awe for its beauty and sadness for the human",
          "Took a quick walk here in the sun. Ungortunately there is some construction going on. But a pretty sight. The adjacent pond is a very nice place to sit and enjoy the nature.",
          "The Cathedral at Stavanger is small by English standards but well worth a visit. The most interesting feature is the colourful painted pulpit dating from the 1650s and executed by a Scottish craftsman Andrew Smith. It was helpful in telling the stories of the bible at a time",
          "I went to the Cathedral during a visit to Stavanger, it originates in the 12th century. The pulpit is of a very interesting design with many carvings. There is much of historical interest to be seen, recommended.",

          "A lovely cathedral built in the style of Winchester cathedral and must be one of the oldest buildings in Norway. Open with a nominal charge to enter(no mean thing in Norway). It is pretty inside and the pulpit is especially nice. As is the extremely large organ Externally it",

          "Very interesting building and church. Everyone very friendly and welcoming. Plenty to see. I really enjoyed my brief visit and would have liked to stay for longer. Interesting history. Easy to find.",
          "Visiting Stavanger? Then you must visit the Cathedral, it is a lovely Cathedral and in nice wheather you can sit on a bench outside and enjoy the life. The park near by is very nice and you can enjoy Bredevannet with the ducks and swans.",
          "Charming 1000 year old cathedral offering an escape from the noise and bustle on the harbourside. Christmas services are particularly lovely even if you don't speak norsk. Surrounded by colourful flowers in the Summer and fronting the lake besides which is often to be found",

          "When you visit Stavanger you have a lot of churches to visit but this is one of the best to see! Now is still in restoration so you cannot visit 100% but is still a nice visit to see the arquitecture and the colour glasses in the windows.",
          "Much of the original 12th century church remain intact with striking similarities to Winchester and St Germans in Cornwall. Well worth a visit if you enjoy a walk around the historic sites of Stavanger",
          "Set in the centre of Stavanger, this Cathedral was built in the Norman style and has remained largely unaltered. Well worth visiting for the ornate wooden pulpit and five epitaphs carved by the Scot Andrew Lawrenceson Smith, and to hear the magnificent organ...",
          "While enjoying a nice walk around Stavanger we came upon the Cathedral not far from the harbour and in a lovely park area . A lovely stone building which we learnt was finished about 1150 so it is very old and sure could tell some historic tales . Apparently it is Norways",
          "its a nice big cathedral located near the harbour and in the heart of city. there is a nice park near it and a nice place to take some cool pic. the harbour is near so u can get plenty of places to eat. u will love to sit here and enjoy the sights and sounds.",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral, very different from the ones in England. The stained glass window is in pastel shades and very pretty. This is not open all day, but there is plenty to look at in the locality. There is a lovely lake with a fountain nearby and the market was on the",

          "Love to visit old cathedrals, for the history, the serenity and to pray! Was surprised to see how such an old building, if not for spiritual reasons, but historical reasons would be allowed to be 'mistreated' by tourists who were allowed to touch anything and everything. Was a",
          "A small cathedral in the town centre which is worth it to visit during a center round trip. It is at the corner of the Byparken and in front of the port which are also very beautiful.",
          "Some fantastic carving work inside but shame the stained glass window is currently under renovation and replaced by paper facsimile",
          "Unless you've never been to a cathedral before, it's not worth it to pay to get in here. I was a bit surprised that they charged for entry and was disappointed once in there- it really is nothing special and I felt a bit ripped off. I think we were in there for less than 10",
          "It really is worth looking at although smaller than many parish churches it is decorated in an unusual style and that makes it worthy of a visit. The carvings are quite ornate although the faces of the figures are somewhat obscured, possibly through time. The stained glass",

          "....... well it got us out of the rain. Last port of call on our cruise and the worst weather. But to be honest if you're going to have a bad day weather wise this is the place to get it. Cathedral is nice but being renovated when we visited - very cheap to get entry, GBP3",
          "Interesting historic cathedral. It was raining, but still hot an exterior photo. Next time get a photo from the back as well. Looks entirely different. Beautifully caved pulpit. Look for Samson!",
          "St Svithuns Kathedral, Stavanger Domkirke is just about as close as you can get to the cruise harbour of Stavanger. It was built in the early 12th century and many of the carved stones around the columns and window frames of those beautiful Gothic windows bear witness to the",

          "This church is located right in the middle of the city and has some very nice features. The window at the back of the church is fantastic as are some of the candle holders and the altar. The history of the church is also very interesting as it shows the close links between",
          "What a lovely place Stavanger Cathedral is - we were fortunate it was a sunny day to walk around. We arrived early and visited the cathedral whilst it was quiet - got busy later! Beautiful carvings in the church. People very friendly & helpful. Expensive but worth the visit.",

          "Stavanger Cathedral is small but beautifull inside with some amazing carved wood commemorative plaques around the building celebrating the past history of the incumbents. Well worth sitting and studying is the amazingly carved pulpit. It was very quiet when we visited so we had",
          "A lovely piece of Stavanger history. Beautiful old epitaphs from the 1600's. Amazing to see the transition from Viking to Christian culture. Unfortunately the stained glass windows were being restored when I visited but the temporary art pieces made by the students of the art",

          "Don't miss visiting this old cathedral right in the heart of Stavanger- beautiful art work inside, intricate wood carvings, a lovely small pipe organ. I would have loved to hear some music! There is a small entry fee, but well worth the visit. The front is being restored right",
          "This is the first cathedral I've seen where the interior is mostly made of wood versus stone. Stunning artwork!",
          "This church certainly has the feel of the 1600's. Fabulous wood carved pulpit and wooden memorials on the walls made by a woodcarver of the 1600's. Church is well preserved and cared for. Small book available about the church and the decorations. A wonderful treasure in",
          "This very beautiful cathedral is manned by friendly staff who all, to my knowledge, speak excellent English. If I remember correctly the fee to get in worked out at about \u00a33 per adult and free for children. They allow photography as well. Well worth a visit.",

          "This church is not ornate but rather is rich in history. The baptismal font dates back to the 1300's. It costs 30 NOK (about 3 Euro 30 Cent) entrance fee. I'd suggest you take the time to ask the people giving out the tickets, questions about the church. They have expert",
          "This is a very old cathedral situated by the main square at the back of the harbour. As others have commented you do have to pay to go in (30NOK) but it is not that expensive. Once inside it is not as large as many cathedrals (it is not that big), but it is still a lovely",

          "Well preserved midieval church that looks down on the main harbor of Stavanger. One of the main highlights in the town and worth a quick visit. You can link this up with a walk around the picturesque lake adjacent to the cathedral (Breiavatnet). Lots of waterfowl inhabit the",
          "This Cathedral is old and beautiful. I've never seen such beautiful wood carvings along with art work combined. Stone pillars are huge. Really a look back in time. Worth the small admission fee. The fee is used for ongoing restoration and upkeep. It is the oldest Cathedral in",
          "We made a brief visit to Stavanger Cathedral when our cruise ship made a stop there. The cathedral is easy walking distance, just slightly uphill, from the pier. We made sure to make this visit because we knew this is the oldest cathedral in Norway. Admission was 30 NOK",

          "A very impressive by its history and modesty cathedral. Dating over 750 years ago you would not recognize the age as it feels new and improved. The park and the street next to it have lots to tell as well. Visit the serenity of the town center vibrancy.",

          "Nice church downtown in Stavanger Norway that you can visit, but in the summertime it costs money to come inside and it should not be like that. Its just sad that the church take money from tourists and visitors just to let them inside to se a church thats open for Norvegians",
          "Visited in June 2015, the exteriors looks beautiful, Gothic structure among flowers and lake. The place was closed for inside visit which was a disappointment, although the atmosphere around the place made up for it. The site is in the center of the small town, on one side of",
          "Nice cathedral, in the centre of Stavanger. Wonderful architecture and great history. Worth a visit when in Stavanger!",
          "A very quiet, beautiful respite from the world. I'm a bit biased because my family comes from this area and have probably gone to this cathedral for generations. I've visited twice now, once almost 40 years ago and again quite recently, impressive both times.",

          "We went to Stavanger in June and planned to visit the Cathedral. It was closed for work to be carried out.. Very disappointing.",

          "One of the oldest Gothic churches in Norway that went through hectic history...have to see lovely vitric-painted windows and carved work in wood all around the church. Consider yourself lucky if you can listen to some music concert inside :D. Pity they do not organize it more",

          "Went to Stavanger for a friend's wedding in July 2014 (end of review says Sept 14, as I couldn't select July!). The cathedral is a very pretty building - it was perhaps further enhanced by some gorgeous sunshine! It was a wonderful setting for a wedding, and well worth a visit!",
          "A very interesting building even from the outside. While it was officially closed when we visited, for internal repairs, we were lucky enough to be allowed in by a staff member. Decorative interior that while not exceptionally old, has been done in a style of several centuries",

          "Old church in the middle of Stavanger City. Really a beautiful church we call Stavanger Domkirke. The areas near the hotel are also beautiful. Breiavannet with the waterfountain. Rememebr to take your camera with you to shoot a lot of great pictures :)",
          "Not like the beautiful wooden churches of Norway. The cathedral has been changed at different periods, with different styles, currently undergoing renovation. You do have to visit this cathedral if you go to Stavanger, but it is unfortunately no masterpiece.",
          "Beautiful church both inside and outside, amazing work of art where ever you look. Take you time to look around and see beauty all over",
          "The church is not like Nidaros or those beautiful wooden churches, but if you know something about architecture and about symbols in church you might find it more interesting. Here's some interesting facts: there are a monster-fish on one if side of the church close to a side",
          "One of the main attractions in Stavanger, not worth a travel though. The church is nothing special, don't expect to see any kind of art. Bare and bleak nordic architecture.",
          "The Cathedral was initially built in 1125 and rebuilt and updated many times until the present day. The outside is not impressive but the mix of architecture is interesting. We visited the Bishops Chapel that is part of the complex. the chapels hold maybe 40 people, is simply",

          "Unfortunately the Domkirke was closed due to the installation of a new main organ. So I don\u00b4t know how the church looed inside. The exteriour was not too impressive ( o.k. , I admit that I\u00b4m from L\u00fcbeck so I have a big variety of brick made gothic cathedrals ). The three points",
          "Nice Cathedral in a very beautiful city. It is easily to visit this cathedral, placed in the center of the city and very closed to the sea. Pay attention to the lake nearly located: very beautiful!",

          "Apparently Gothic on the outside but inside it's simple undamaged Romanesque ('Norman'). Some lovely memorials - but not a load of clutter. Lovely location, by itself, surrounded by a simple garden just above the lake. It was free to visit - and very peaceful - in January 2015.",

          "I am told that this cathedral was built by some of the same craftsmen that built Durham cathedral. There are similarities. Does anyone know the facts?",
          "The Cathedral has been re-buildt. It is not a big Cathedral but it holds its quality and you can feel the characters of it. There are weddings being held here time to time. The surroundings are perfect for an afternoon walk. Remember to walk at back of the Catherdral and stay",
          "Nice to visit this old cathedral and just have a quiet time. A small fee to get in. Refurbishement ongoing",
          "What a feat for craftsmen of the 12th century. One has to marvel at the architectural achievement for the time period. We were most fortunate to have the opportunity to hear an evening choir practice. A point of interest NOT to be missed.",

          "Stavanger Cathedral dates back to 1125 and visitors are strongly advised to go and see it when they are in town. The stone church was constructed partly in Roman and partly in Gothic style. Still, the two parts blend harmoniously. It is also a much appreciated concert venue,",

          "If you have time you may want to stop in for a quick visit. A short distance from the port it is easy to walk to the Cathedral. There is a small fee. Inside you can appreciate the details in the design and carvings. There is scaffolding on the front of the Cathedral which is",
          "Unfortunately was unable to see the outside. Very interested to see the inside. I was the only person in there. There was a charge to go in. The carved wooden pulpit is absolutely stunning. It was so peaceful.",
          "This small incredibly well maintained cathedral is so well worth a visit. Close to the centre of town built in the 12th and 13th centuries it has been preserved since that time with very little damage from world changing events. The carved pulpit is amazing and apparently was",
          "Worth visiting when walking around the Old town area in Stavanger. The interior is a bit spartan but the external architecture is beautiful.",
          "I personally like to photo buildings,this one is lovely,you can enter to see inside ,but was closed on day we were there.",
          "What beautiful work of art as well as a building. They were repairing part of it when we visited but I could not believe the quality and beauty of the 1100 AD era workmanship.",
          "Fairly impressive for the most part, but currently it is undergoing a 'sympathetic' restoration, and most of the clock tower is behind scaffolding.",
          "Nothing to dislike, it's part of Stavanger's rich heritage and sits in the centre of Stavanger, amongst the new and the old town.",
          "The impressive lofty building, the beautifully carved pulpit and a pianist practising for a wedding, filling the cathedral with heavenly music!",
          "From the moment you first approach the cathedral you become entranced by the beautiful lines and colours in the stained glass window. In fact the whole trip to Norway was stunning with such cool crisp weather and beautiful sights to see. Bergan, Flaam, Hellesylt, Geiranger,",
          "only a few minutes walk from the port the cathedral stands beside the park .the front is being restored and ans is covered up .it has a small admission price . the inside is wonderful with a beautiful stain glass window .a great example of a early Norwegian church",
          "After our ship docked in the High St, we decided to visit the cathedral but we were waylaid with the World Tour Beach Volleyball championships. Once we got there and inside the place was very serene and calming, then a Norwegian lady introduced a Cello player who's music was",
          "After being burned once and ripped off its original state, the modern state of the church is not far from its share of beauty and awe. The exteriors are reflective of gothic architecture. The interiors of the place are filled with beautiful statues and works and have pretty good",
          "It is well worth the cost to go into the cathedral. It offered some really stunning views. The carvings in the church were amazing.",
          "The cathedral is located at what was once the focal point of the harbor (now surrounded by banks and big business - the flower and fish market prior to the North Sea oil are all gone.) Built in the 12th century the architecture for the nave is Romanesque, but the altar area was",
          "The Cathedral is located at the center of town on the lake. Inside are lots of artwork and a small chancel. At first glance, it does not seem impressive but sit down, pray & enjoy the Church. As you do you will notice lots of little touches that make the place unique and",
          "Stavanger Cathedral is situated in the heart of the city. Its a fairly typcial cathedral, similar to others I have seen around the world and in the UK. At the time we visited, there were renovation works ongoing.",
          "The outside of the Cathedral is really beautiful. This inside is... well, this is a cathedral. Nothing special that justify to pay a price for the visit.",
          "This cathedral is in no way monumental, then again it corresponds to the area it is built in. It's interior was very lovely and a nice change from the interior of Cathedrals in the Mediterranean. Really Enjoyed my visit.",
          "Has little quirks you won't find in just any medieval cathedral. Pay attention to angle of view on the pulpit.",
          "This is really nice cathedral is construction around the year 1100. It is located in the middle of centrum, with good view over the lake and the harbor. The guide said Norways oldest cathedral. A relly must see objekt, inside and outside:)",
          "This is a relatively small cathedral and won't take you more than 15 minutes - half an hour to visit (depending on your visiting style of course). It's been around longer than you might think, dating back to the 12th Century - around the time of Notre Dame in Paris and the time",
          "This cathedral is in the heart of the town and the pulpit inside is a must see. Considering it was made circa 1658 it is something else. Ok it's not the sistine chapel but if you're in town then take a little time to appreciate this cathedral. Free to get in and just a nice",
          "When you see this church, keep in mind it was built in the early 1100s! How they built such a beautiful building way back then boggles the mind. It's right in the center of Stavanger near the harbor so it's hard to miss.",
          "Beautiful old church situated in the middle of town, a great place for a holiday photo with the family or alone.",
          "Stavanger Cathedral is located in the heart of the city center and what a striking Gothic cathedral it is. Wonderful hand carved wooden epitaphs. Don't miss!",
          "Beautiful pulpit - windows could be kept better to allow the light to come in and the colours to show. Overall nice. Beautiful stone work and little explanations every here and there.",
          "As it is in the middle of the city, close to the harbour, it is easy to go to and is worth to have a look at if you are in the area.",
          "We were in Stavanger as a cruise port visit. Just a few blocks from the cruise ship terminal we found the cathedral facing a small lake called Breiavatnet, There is no fee for visiting the cathedral with its gothic features. As we walked around the church, we admired the",
          "This beautiful cathedral is an impressive, medieval stone cathedral.The cathedral dates back to 1125 and originally built in Anglo-Norman style.",
          "like most of the Norwegian cathedrals its worth a visit, very impressive building with surrounding attractions!",
          "During our cruise ship stop we took the few moments to walk to the Stavanger Cathedral. Worth the stroll.",
          "This is one of the oldest cathedrals in Norway. It is medium size, very well maintained and easy to visit. You don't need more that 15 minutes at this historical objective.",
          "The church is a short walk from the harbor. Be sure to walk around the building to see the other side, beautiful. The interior has some awe inspiring woodwork, including the pulpit, as well as a great tapestry right inside the entrance. We were there on a cruise ship but went",
          "It was 30 NK to enter. I asked how much to pray - 30 NK. I was told it is free after 4pm when the cruise ships leave and that it's not suitable for praying as it is more like a museum. I expressed my view that God might disagree, blessed the woman and prayed outside. Let the",
          "Do not miss seeing this lovely church. It is an architectural beauty. There is a serene sense of worship there and you feel like you are in a church, not just a historical site. The carved alter is truly a work of art as are the paintings situated around the cathedral.",
          "Very impressive not far from the centre restaurants nearby shopping streets nearby not far from the port",
          "I lived in Winchester and was delighted to note the association with that city courtesy of St Swithun. This is a beautiful gothic building and though in the heart of secular and protestant Norway has a very Catholic appeal",
          "We arrived in Stavanger on a Sunday and had to wait until the morning worship service was over to enter the cathedral. The exterior is extremely impressive with it's Gothic style. Although not as ornate on the inside as many of the churches in Europe, it was still a",
          "Elegant, but austere interior of this stone church is complemented by a range of wood carvings, including an extremely elaborate pulpit and 5 epitaphs, and a set of wonderful chandeliers + stained glass windows. Worth a look.",
          "I visited this cathedral with my grandmother and we both loved the history behind the origin and the carvings. Its unusual structure and parts are fascinating, for example we were told that the wooden construction of the ceiling was held up with only joints, not a single nail. I",
          "We visited as part of a booked tour and as such entered as a group. Our guide gave us a very informative talk about the history of the cathedral and left us there to explore on our own. Marvellous building very ornate. Photos allowed Within easy walking distance of the harbour",
          "Overviewing the Marketplace, Stavanger cathedral is a place of silence and history. You should try to join a concert in this impressive stone building located right in the centre of Stavanger.",
          "That is what it took for Bishop Reinald to come to this part of Norway back in the 12th century. It is very rustic and striking and though not as famous at the Cathedral in Trondheim..I found it very beautiful if having had a number of restorations in the last 900 years. It has",
          "STAVANGER in the sunshine is a real pleasure to stroll around. We visited this Norwegian town during a cruise on board P&O\u2019s 116,000-ton Venture and what an excellent stop it was. The morning was spent on a wonderful coach tour which took us through some rugged lake and mountain",
          "The 30 kr entry seems to end about 3:15. Once said after the cruise ship folks leave. Perhaps. I would have enjoyed viewing the structural aspects of the church built initially around 1100. Unfortunately that sort of information seemed unavailable. The chandeliers were designed",
          "I guess when you've been to churches and cathedrals all over Europe they stop being very exciting, and this one is nothing to write home about. I walked in for about three minutes, walked around and back out. It is fine to look at. Make sure to go when the cruise ship is not in",
          "Very beautiful. Right on top of the main square by the water. I think you could get guided help if you wanted to.",
          "The cathedral was incredible. The carvings on the walls and the pulpit were gorgeous. There was a short prayer walk in English available for those wanting to use the time to reflect. We arrived at 6pm, and had the building to ourselves for quite a while.",
          "Quite a small cathedral, pleasant, nice stained glass window. There was an entry fee of Kr30 all day, but removed when the cruise ship sailed, not a very Christian approach in our view.",
          "Centrally located old cathedral with some interesting features. has an ornately carved wooden pulpit on the right side of the chancel - the stained glass windows are rather dark and also rather recent - from 1950's. There is a pipe organ in the back and there are several CD's",
          "One of the more interesting medieval churches you're likely to see in Europe, we didn't catch it open but it was worth checking out for a glance at the architecture.",
          "Located in a high position above the harbour, with nice gardens and a lake behind. We waited for the Cathedral to open at the published time on the notice board outside. The time passed and a crowd gathered, but the doors remained shut. Half an hour later the doors opened and",
          "Being charged for this visit was certainly for worth it. The cathedral was very small and offered little sights and history within it.",
          "A must visit ! The smell , feel , look of the place takes you back to 1600 century ! Lovely place , the lake outside the cathedral looks fantastic with ducks floating on them !",
          "The Stavanger Catherdral is a very nice structure and well worth the visit. The interior is certainly prodestant in decoration, simple and clean. The Catherdal was really built over two periods and styles. The Original was romanesque with larger columns and rounded arches, then",
          "The first bishop of Stavanger was Reinald of Winchester and the cathedral was built for him. Exciting history! The cathedral was built in anglo-roman style in 1125 and a gothic part was added later.",
          "The Medieval romanesque/gothique is very beautiful. Not often you will find dhese two architecturel styles in the same church. Here the aisle is romanesque but the choir was added later and consequently finished in gothic style. The citizens are justly very proud of their",
          "The Cathedral is very beautiful, it built with stones. I went there twice (night, morning) both was great, but if you like to take pictures you should also go at night.",
          "In the middle of the little city centre is this majestic looking cathedral. You don't have to be religious to want to go inside. It's stunning and humbling, and has lots of history. Worth to check out.",
          "I was visiting the Chatedral last weekend while I was in Stavanger. It was a peaceful atmosphere, and so much history in it's walls. It's a impressive peace of woodwork inside the chatedral. But the colourful window were taking most of my attention while I was there. That was",

          "We were in Stavanger on a Sunday and found it was only closed during services, so we managed to visit it in the afternoon. We were very impressed by the amazing and coiourful wood carvings which had been created by a Scottish craftsman, Andrew Smith in the 17th century. The",
          "St Swithun's Cathedral is not open all day. Yopu have to time your visit to fit the opening hours. As people who visit many cathedrals and churches we found this to be a haven of peace but without anything to make a memorable visit other than the staff who took our entrance fee"

          "I love Norway, I live here, however Kongeparken is the best example of a hyper-cost culture that you can tell as a story to those not familiar with Norway's expensive ways. Before I start I have to say that its a good day out, and there's more good news; the park is clean, the",

          "Nice child friendly entertainment. The staff were friendly. It's worth buying the free refill cups if you plan to return. All you can eat grill buffet at \"grillstova\" is worth the price.",

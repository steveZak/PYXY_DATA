        "wiki": "Malm\u00f6 (; Swedish: [\u02c8m\u00e2lm\u00f8\u02d0] (listen); Danish: Malm\u00f8 [\u02c8m\u00e6lm\u02cc\u00f8\u02c0]) is the largest city in the Swedish county (l\u00e4n) of Sk\u00e5ne (Scania). It is the third-largest city in Sweden, after Stockholm and Gothenburg, and the sixth-largest city in Scandinavia, with a population of 316,588 (municipal total 338,230 in 2018). The Malm\u00f6 Metropolitan Region is home to over 700,000 people, and the \u00d8resund Region, which includes Malm\u00f6, is home to 4 million people.Malm\u00f6 was one of the earliest and most industrialized towns in Scandinavia, but it struggled to adapt to post-industrialism. Since the construction of the \u00d6resund Bridge, Malm\u00f6 has undergone a major transformation, producing new architectural developments, supporting new biotech and IT companies, and attracting students through Malm\u00f6 University and other higher education facilities. The city contains many historic buildings and parks, and is also a commercial center for the western part of Scania.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest written mention of Malm\u00f6 as a city dates from 1275. It is thought to have been founded shortly before that date, as a fortified quay or ferry berth of the Archbishop of Lund, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) to the north-east. Malm\u00f6 was for centuries Denmark's second-biggest city. Its original name was Malmhaug (with alternate spellings), meaning \"Gravel pile\" or \"Ore Hill\".\nIn the 15th century, Malm\u00f6 became one of Denmark's largest and most visited cities, reaching a population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. It became the most important city around the \u00d8resund, with the German Hanseatic League frequenting it as a marketplace, and was notable for its flourishing herring fishery. In 1437, King Eric of Pomerania (King of Denmark from 1396 to 1439) granted the city's arms: argent with a griffin gules, based on Eric's arms from Pomerania. The griffin's head as a symbol of Malm\u00f6 extended to the entire province of Scania from 1660.\nIn 1434, a new citadel was constructed at the beach south of the town. This fortress, known today as Malm\u00f6hus, did not take its current form until the mid-16th century. Several other fortifications were constructed, making Malm\u00f6 Sweden's most fortified city, but only Malm\u00f6hus remains.\n\nLutheran teachings spread during the 16th century Protestant Reformation, and Malm\u00f6 became one of the first cities in Scandinavia to fully convert (1527\u20131529) to this Protestant denomination.\nIn the 17th century, Malm\u00f6 and the Scanian region (Sk\u00e5neland) came under control of Sweden following the Treaty of Roskilde with Denmark, signed in 1658. Fighting continued, however; in June 1677, 14,000 Danish troops laid siege to Malm\u00f6 for a month, but were unable to defeat the Swedish troops holding it.\nBy the dawn of the 18th century, Malm\u00f6 had about 2,300 inhabitants. However, owing to the wars of Charles XII of Sweden (reigned 1697\u20131718) and to bubonic plague epidemics, the population dropped to 1,500 by 1727. The population did not grow much until the modern harbor was constructed in 1775. The city started to expand and the population in 1800 was 4,000. 15 years later, it had increased to 6,000.\n\nIn 1840, Frans Henrik Kockum founded the workshop from which the Kockums shipyard eventually developed as one of the largest shipyards in the world. The Southern Main Line was built between 1856 and 1864; this enabled Malm\u00f6 to become a center of manufacture, with major textile and mechanical industries. In 1870, Malm\u00f6 overtook Norrk\u00f6ping to become Sweden's third-most populous city, and by 1900 Malm\u00f6 had strengthened this position with 60,000 inhabitants. Malm\u00f6 continued to grow through the first half of the 20th century. The population had swiftly increased to 100,000 by 1915 and to 200,000 by 1952.\n\n\n=== 1900\u20131969 ===\n\nIn 1914 (15 May to 4 October) Malm\u00f6 hosted the Baltic Exhibition. The large park Pildammsparken was arranged and planted for this large event. The Russian part of the exhibition was never taken down, owing to the outbreak of World War I.\nOn 18 and 19 December 1914, the Three Kings Meeting was held in Malm\u00f6. After a somewhat infected period (1905\u20131914), which included the dissolution of the Swedish-Norwegian Union, King Oscar II was replaced with King H\u00e5kon VII in Norway, who was the younger brother of the Danish King Christian X. As Oscar died in 1907, and his son Gustav V became the new King of Sweden, the tensions within Scandinavia were still unclear, but during this historical meeting, the Scandinavian Kings found internal understanding, as well as a common line about remaining neutral in the ongoing war.\nWithin sports, Malm\u00f6 has mostly been associated with football. IFK Malm\u00f6 participated in the first ever edition of Allsvenskan 1924/25, but from the mid-1940s Malm\u00f6 FF started to rise, and ever since it has been one of the most prominent clubs within Swedish football. They have won Allsvenskan 23 times in all (as of February 2018) between 1943/44 and 2017.\n\n\n=== 1970s and later ===\nBy 1971, Malm\u00f6 reached 265,000 inhabitants, but this was the peak which would stand for more than 30 years. (Svedala was, for a few years in the early 1970s, a part of Malm\u00f6 municipality.)\nBy the mid-1970s Sweden experienced a recession that hit the industrial sector especially hard; shipyards and manufacturing industries suffered, which led to high unemployment in many cities of Scania. Kockums shipyard had become a symbol of Malm\u00f6 as its largest employer and, when shipbuilding ceased in 1986, confidence in the future of Malm\u00f6 plummeted among politicians and the public. In addition, many middle-class families moved into one-family houses in surrounding municipalities such as Vellinge Municipality, Lomma Municipality and Staffanstorp Municipality, which profiled themselves as the suburbs of the upper-middle class. By 1985, Malm\u00f6 had lost 35,000 inhabitants and was down to 229,000.The Swedish financial crises of the early 1990s exacerbated Malm\u00f6's decline as an industrial city; between 1990 and 1995 Malm\u00f6 lost about 27,000 jobs and its economy was seriously strained. However, from 1994 under the leadership of the then mayor Ilmar Reepalu, the city of Malm\u00f6 started to create a new economy as a center of culture and knowledge. Malm\u00f6 reached bottom in 1995, but that same year marked the commencement of the massive \u00d6resund Bridge road, railway and tunnel project, connecting it to Copenhagen and to the rail lines of Europe. The new Malm\u00f6 University opened in 1998 on Kockums' former dockside. Further redevelopment of the now disused south-western harbor followed; a city architecture exposition (Bo01) was held in the area in 2001, and its buildings and villas form the core of a new city district. Designed with attractive waterfront vistas, it was intended to be and has been successful in attracting the urban middle-class.\nSince 1974, the Kockums Crane had been a landmark in Malm\u00f6 and a symbol of the city's manufacturing industry, but in 2002 it was disassembled and moved to South Korea. In 2005, Malm\u00f6 gained a new landmark with completion of Turning Torso, the tallest skyscraper in Scandinavia. Although the transformation from a city with its economic base in manufacturing has returned growth to Malm\u00f6, the new types of jobs have largely benefited the middle and upper classes.\nIn its 2015 and 2017 reports, Police in Sweden placed the Roseng\u00e5rd and the S\u00f6dra Sofielund/Seved district in the most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMalm\u00f6 is located at 13\u00b000' east and 55\u00b035' north, near the southwestern tip of Sweden, in the province of Scania.\nThe city is part of the transnational \u00d6resund Region and, since 2000, has been linked by the \u00d6resund Bridge across the \u00d6resund to Copenhagen, Denmark. The bridge opened on 1 July 2000, and measures 8 kilometres (5 miles) (the whole link totalling 16 km), with pylons reaching 204.5 metres (670.9 feet) vertically. Apart from the Helsingborg-Helsing\u00f8r ferry links further north, most ferry connections have been discontinued.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nMalm\u00f6, like the rest of southern Sweden, has an oceanic climate. Despite its northern location, the climate is mild compared to other locations at similar latitudes, mainly because of the influence of the Gulf Stream and also its westerly position on the Eurasian landmass. Owing to its northern latitude, daylight lasts 17 hours in midsummer, but only around seven hours in midwinter. According to data from 2002\u20132014 Falsterbo, to the south of the city, received an annual average of 1,895 hours of sunshine while Lund, to the north, received 1,803 hours. The sunshine data in the weather box is based on the data for Falsterbo.Summers are mild with average high temperatures of 20 to 23 \u00b0C (68 to 73 \u00b0F) and lows of around 11 to 13 \u00b0C (52 to 55 \u00b0F). Heat waves during the summer arise occasionally. Winters are fairly cold and windy, with temperatures steady between \u22123 to 4 \u00b0C (27 to 39 \u00b0F), but it rarely drops below \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F).\nRainfall is light to moderate throughout the year with 169 wet days. Snowfall occurs mainly in December through March, but snow covers do not remain for a long time, and some winters are virtually free of snow.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\u00d6resund Line trains cross the \u00d6resund Bridge every 20 minutes (hourly late night) connecting Malm\u00f6 to Copenhagen, and the Copenhagen Airport. The trip takes around 35\u201340 minutes. Additionally, some of the X 2000 and Intercity trains to Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Kalmar cross the bridge, stopping at Copenhagen Airport. In March 2005, excavation began on a new railway connection called the City Tunnel, which opened for traffic on 4 December 2010. The tunnel runs south from Malm\u00f6 Central Station through an underground station at the Triangeln railway station to Hylliev\u00e5ng (Hyllie Meadow). Then, the line comes to the surface to enter Hyllie Station, also created as part of the tunnel project. From Hyllie Station, the line connects to the existing \u00d6resund line in either direction, with the \u00d6resund Bridge lying due west.\nBesides the Copenhagen Airport, Malm\u00f6 has an airport of its own, Malm\u00f6 Airport, today chiefly used for domestic Swedish destinations, charter flights and low-cost carriers.\nThe motorway system has been incorporated with the \u00d6resund Bridge; the European route E20 goes over the bridge and then, together with the European route E6 follows the Swedish west coast from Malm\u00f6\u2013Helsingborg to Gothenburg. E6 goes further north along the west coast and through Norway to the Norwegian town Kirkenes at Barents Sea. The European route to J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping\u2013Stockholm (E4) starts at Helsingborg. Main roads in the directions of V\u00e4xj\u00f6\u2013Kalmar, Kristianstad\u2013Karlskrona, Ystad (E65), and Trelleborg start as freeways.\nMalm\u00f6 has 410 kilometres (250 mi) of bike paths; approximately 40% of all commuting is done by bicycle.\n\n\n=== Ports ===\nThe city has two industrial harbors; one is still in active use and is the largest Nordic port for car importation. It also has two marinas: the publicly owned Limhamn Marina (55\u00b035\u2032N 12\u00b055\u2032E) and the private Lagunen (55\u00b035\u2032N 12\u00b056\u2032E), both offering a limited number of guest docks.\nPublic transport consisted of a tram network from 1887 until 1973. Afterwards, it was replaced by a bus network.\n\n\n=== Malm\u00f6 S-Train ===\nA local train line with circular traffic at seven stations was opened in December 2018. The stations are Malm\u00f6 Central Station (underground platforms) \u2013 Triangeln station \u2013 Hyllie station \u2013 Malm\u00f6 South/Sv\u00e5gertorp \u2013 Persborg \u2013 Roseng\u00e5rd \u2013 \u00d6sterv\u00e4rn \u2013 Malm\u00f6 Central Station (main overground terminus). Some trains arrive from Kristianstad and finish with a lap around Malm\u00f6, whilst other trains at this circular line, never drive outside the city limits. There is at least a 30 minutes service between each departure, but far more between the Central Station and Hyllie. Extension plans of a minor network system exists.\n\n\n=== Proposed metro ===\nThe \u00d6resundsmetro is a proposed rapid transit network linking Malm\u00f6 with the existing Copenhagen Metro through a 22 km tunnel under the \u00d6resund.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nMalm\u00f6 Municipality is an administrative unit defined by geographical borders, consisting of the City of Malm\u00f6 and its immediate surroundings.\nMalm\u00f6 (Malm\u00f6 t\u00e4tort) consists of the urban part of the municipality together with the small town of Arl\u00f6v in the Burl\u00f6v Municipality. Both municipalities also include smaller urban areas and rural areas, such as the suburbs of Oxie and \u00c5karp. Malm\u00f6 t\u00e4tort is to be distinguished from Malm\u00f6 stad (the city of Malm\u00f6), which is a semi-official name of Malm\u00f6 Municipality.\nThe leaders in Malm\u00f6 created a commission for a socially sustainable Malm\u00f6 in November 2010. The commissions were tasked with providing evidence-based strategies for reducing health inequalities and improve living conditions for all citizens of Malm\u00f6, especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged and issued its final report in December 2013.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nMalm\u00f6 has a young population by Swedish standards, with almost half of the population under the age of 35 (48.2%).After 1971, Malm\u00f6 had 265,000 inhabitants, but the population then dropped to 229,000 by 1985. The total population of the urban area was 280,415 in December 2010. It then began to rise again, and had passed the previous record by the 1 January 2003 census, when it had 265,481 inhabitants. On 27 April 2011, the population of Malm\u00f6 reached the 300,000 mark. In 2017 the total population of the city was 316,588 inhabitants out of a municipal total of 338,230.In 2019, approximately 55.5% of the population of Malm\u00f6 municipality (190,849 residents) had at least one parent born abroad. The Middle East, Horn of Africa, former Yugoslavia and Denmark are the main sources of immigration. In addition, 14.8% (50 999 residents) of the population in 2019 were foreign nationals.Foreign-born population by country, 31 December 2018:\n\nGreater Malm\u00f6 is one of Sweden's three officially recognized metropolitan areas (storstadsomr\u00e5den) and since 2005 is defined as the municipality of Malm\u00f6 and 11 other municipalities in the southwestern corner of Scania. As of 2019, its population was recorded as 740,840. The region covers an area of 2,522 square kilometres (974 sq mi). The municipalities included, apart from Malm\u00f6, are Burl\u00f6v, Esl\u00f6v, H\u00f6\u00f6r, K\u00e4vlinge, Lomma, Lund, Skurup, Staffanstorp, Svedala, Trelleborg and Vellinge. Together with Lund, Malm\u00f6 is the region's economic and education hub.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Malm\u00f6 was traditionally based on shipbuilding (Kockums) and construction-related industries, such as concrete factories. The region's leading university, along with its associated hi-tech and pharmaceutical industries, is located in Lund about 16 kilometres (10 miles) to the north-east. As a result, Malm\u00f6 had a troubled economic situation following the mid-1970s. Between 1990\u20131995, 27,000 jobs were lost, and the budget deficit was more than one billion Swedish krona (SEK). In 1995, Malm\u00f6 had Sweden's highest unemployment rate.However, during the last two decades, there has been a revival. One contributing factor has been the economic integration with Denmark brought about by the \u00d6resund Bridge, which opened in July 2000. Also the university founded in 1998 and the effects of integration into the European Union have contributed. In 2017 the unemployment rate is still high but Malm\u00f6 has, in the last 20 years, had one of the strongest employment growth rates in Sweden. But a lot of those jobs are taken by workers outside the neighboring municipalities.As of 2016, the largest companies were:\nSkanska \u2013 heavy construction\nNobina \u2013 transport\nPostNord \u2013 postal services\nP\u00e5gen \u2013 bakery\nIKEA \u2013 furnitureAlmost 30 companies have moved their headquarters to Malm\u00f6 during the last seven years, generating around 2,300 jobs. Among them are IKEA who has most of its headquarter functions based in Malm\u00f6.The number of start-up companies is high in Malm\u00f6. Around 7 new companies are started every day in Malm\u00f6. In 2010, the renewal of the number of companies amounted to 13.9%, which exceeds both Stockholm and Gothenburg. Especially strong growth is in the gaming area with Massive entertainment and King being the flagship companies for the industry. Among the industries that continue to increase their share of companies in Malm\u00f6 are transport, financial and business services, entertainment, leisure and construction.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMalm\u00f6 has the country's ninth-largest school of higher education, Malm\u00f6 University, established in 1998. It has 1,600 employees and 24,000 students (2014).\nIn addition nearby Lund University (established in 1666) has some education located in Malm\u00f6:\n\nMalm\u00f6 Art Academy (Konsth\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nMalm\u00f6 Academy of Music (Musikh\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nMalm\u00f6 Theatre Academy (Teaterh\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nThe Faculty of Medicine, which is located in both Malm\u00f6 and Lund.The United Nations World Maritime University is also located in Malm\u00f6. The World Maritime University (WMU) operates under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized agency of the United Nations. WMU thus enjoys the status, privileges and immunities of a UN institution in Sweden.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Film and television ===\nA striking depiction of Malm\u00f6 (in the 1930s) was made by Bo Widerberg in his debut film Kvarteret Korpen (Raven's End) (1963), largely shot in the shabby Korpen working-class district in Malm\u00f6. With humour and tenderness, it depicts the tensions between classes and generations.  The movie was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1965. In 2017, the film Medan Vi Lever (While We Live) was awarded the prize for best film by an African living abroad at the Africa Movie Academy Awards. It was filmed in Malm\u00f6 and Gambia, and deals with identity, integration and everyday racism.The cities of Malm\u00f6 and Copenhagen are, with the \u00d6resund Bridge, the main locations in the television series The Bridge (Bron/Broen).\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\nIn 1944, Malm\u00f6 Stadsteater (Malm\u00f6 Municipal Theatre) was established with a repertoire comprising stage theatre, opera, musical, ballet, musical recitals and experimental theatre. In 1993 it was split into three units, Dramatiska Teater (Dramatical Theatre), Malm\u00f6 Musikteater (Music Theatre) and Sk\u00e5nes Dansteater (Scanian Dance Theatre) and the name was abandoned. The ownership of the last two were transferred to Region Sk\u00e5ne in 2006 Dramatiska Teatern regained its old name. In the 1950s Ingmar Bergman was the Director and Chief Stage Director of Malm\u00f6 Stadsteater and many of his actors, like Max von Sydow and Ingrid Thulin became known through his films. Later stage directors include Staffan Valdemar Holm and G\u00f6ran Stangertz. Malm\u00f6 Musikteater were renamed Malm\u00f6 Operan and plays operas and musicals, classics as newly composed, on one of Scandinavia's large opera scenes with 1,511 seats. Sk\u00e5nes dansteater is active and plays contemporary dance repertory and present works by Swedish and international choreographers in their house in Malm\u00f6 harbor.Since the 1970s the city has also been home to independent theatre groups and show/musical companies. It also hosts a rock/dance/dub culture; in the 1960s The Rolling Stones played the Klubb Bongo, and in recent years stars like Morrissey, Nick Cave, B.B. King and Pat Metheny have made repeated visits.\nThe Cardigans debuted in Malm\u00f6 and recorded their albums there. On 7 January 2009 CNN Travel broadcast a segment called \"MyCity_MyLife\" featuring Nina Persson taking the camera to some of the sites in Malm\u00f6 that she enjoys.\nThe Rooseum Center for Contemporary Art, founded in 1988 by the Swedish art collector and financier Fredrik Roos and housed in a former power station which had been built in 1900, was one of the foremost centers for contemporary art in Europe during the 1980s and 1990s. By 2006, most of the collection had been sold off and the museum was on a time-out; by 2010 Rooseum had been dismantled and a subsidiary of the National Museum of Modern Art inaugurated in its place.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nIn 1992 and in 2013 Malm\u00f6 was the host of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nModerna Museet Malm\u00f6 was opened in December 2009  in the old Rooseum building. It is a part of the Moderna Museet, with independent exhibitions of modern and contemporary art. The collection of Moderna Museet holds key pieces of, among others, Marcel Duchamp, Louise Bourgeois, Pablo Picasso, Niki de Saint Phalle, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Carolee Schneemann, Henri Matisse and Robert RauschenbergMalm\u00f6 Museum (Malm\u00f6 Museer) is a municipal and regional museum. The museum features exhibitions on technology, shipping, natural history and history. Malm\u00f6 Museum has an aquarium and an art museum. Malm\u00f6hus Castle is also operated as a part of the museum.\nExhibitions are primarily shown at Slottsholmen and at the Technology and Maritime Museum (Teknikens och sj\u00f6fartens hus).Malm\u00f6 Konsthall is one of the largest exhibition halls in Europe for contemporary art, opened in 1975.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMalm\u00f6's oldest building is St. Peter's Church (Swedish: Sankt Petri). It was built in the early 14th century in Baltic Brick Gothic probably after St Mary's Church in L\u00fcbeck. The church is built with a nave, two aisles, a transept and a tower. Its exterior is characterized above all by the flying buttresses spanning its airy arches over the aisles and ambulatory. The tower, which fell down twice during the 15th century, got its current look in 1890. Another major church of significance is the Church of Our Saviour, Malm\u00f6, which was founded in 1870.\nAnother old building is Tunneln, 300 metres (1,000 ft) to the west of Sankt Petri Church, which also dates back to around 1300.\nThe oldest parts of Malm\u00f6 were built between 1300\u20131600 during its first major period of expansion. The central city's layout, as well as some of its oldest buildings, are from this time. Many of the smaller buildings from this time are typical Scanian: two-story urban houses that show a strong Danish influence.Recession followed in the ensuing centuries. The next expansion period was in the mid 19th century and led to the modern stone and brick city. This expansion lasted into the 20th century and can be seen by a number of Art Nouveau buildings, among those in the Malm\u00f6 synagogue. Malm\u00f6 was relatively late to be influenced by modern ideas of functionalist tenement architecture in the 1930s.\nAround 1965, the government initiated the so-called Million Programme, intending to offer affordable apartments in the outskirts of major Swedish cities. But this period also saw the reconstruction (and razing) of much of the historical city center.Since the late 1990s, Malm\u00f6 has seen a more cosmopolitan architecture. V\u00e4stra Hamnen (The Western Harbor), like most of the harbor to the north of the city center, was industrial. In 2001 its reconstruction began as an urban residential neighbourhood, with 500 residential units, most were part of the exhibition Bo01. The exhibition had two main objectives: develop self-sufficient housing units in terms of energy and greatly diminish phosphorus emissions. Among the new building's towers were the Turning Torso, a skyscraper with a twisting design, 190 metres (620 ft) tall, the majority of which is residential. It became Malm\u00f6's new landmark. The most recent addition (2015) is the new development of Malm\u00f6 Live. This new building features a hotel, a concert hall, congress hall and a sky bar in the center of Malm\u00f6. Point Hyllie is a new 110 m commercial tower that is under construction as of 2018.\n\n\n=== Other sights ===\n\nThe beach Ribersborg, by locals usually called Ribban, south-west of the harbor area, is a man-made shallow beach, stretching along Malm\u00f6's coastline. Despite Malm\u00f6's chilly climate, it is sometimes referred to as the \"Copacabana of Malm\u00f6\". It is the site of Ribersborgs open-air bath, opened in the 1890s.\nThe long boardwalk at The Western Harbor, Scaniaparken and Daniaparken, has become a favorite summer hang-out for the people of Malm\u00f6 and is a popular place for bathing. The harbor is particularly popular with Malm\u00f6's vibrant student community and has been the scene of several impromptu outdoor parties and gatherings.\n\n\n=== Annual events ===\n\nIn the third week of August each year a festival, Malm\u00f6festivalen, fills the streets of Malm\u00f6 with different kinds of cuisines and events.\nBUFF International Film Festival, an international children and young people's film festival, is held in Malm\u00f6 every year in March.\nNordisk Panorama \u2013 Nordic Short & Doc Film Festival, a film festival for short and documentary films by filmmakers from the Nordic countries, is held every year in September.\nMalm\u00f6 Arab Film Festival (MAFF), the largest Arabic film festival in Europe, is held in Malm\u00f6.\nThe Nordic Game conference takes place in Malm\u00f6 every April/May. The event consists of conference itself, recruitment expo and game expo and attracts hundreds of gamedev professionals every year.\nMalm\u00f6 also hosts other 3rd party events that cater to all communities that reside in Malm\u00f6, including religious and political celebrations.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nSydsvenskan, founded in 1870, is Malm\u00f6's largest daily newspaper. It has an average circulation of 130,000. Its main competitor is the regional daily Sk\u00e5nska Dagbladet, which has a circulation of 34,000. The tabloid Kv\u00e4llsposten still has a minimal editorial staff but is today just a version of a Stockholm tabloid. The Social Democratic Arbetet was edited and printed at Malm\u00f6 between 1887 and 2000.In addition to these, a number of free-of-charge papers, generally dealing with entertainment, music and fashion have local editions (for instance City, Rodeo, Metro and N\u00f6jesguiden). Malm\u00f6 is also home to the Egmont Group's Swedish magazine operations. A number of local and regional radio and TV broadcasters are based in the Greater Malm\u00f6 area.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\n\n==== Football ====\n\nSports in southern Sweden are dominated by football. Over the years the city's best football teams have been Malm\u00f6 FF who play in the top-level Allsvenskan Malm\u00f6 FF had their most successful periods in the 1970s and 1980s when they won the league several times. In 1979, they advanced to the final of the European Cup defeating AS Monaco, Dynamo Kiew, Wisla Krakow and Austria Wien (Vienna) but lost in the final at the Munich Olympic Stadium against Nottingham Forest by a single goal just before half time scored by Trevor Francis. To date, they are the only Swedish football club to have reached the final of the competition. Malm\u00f6 FF is the club where for instance, Bosse Larsson and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 began their football careers.  A second football team, IFK Malm\u00f6 played in Sweden's top flight for about 20 years and the club's quarterfinal in the European Cup is the club's greatest achievement in its history. Today, the club resides in the sixth tier of the Swedish league system.\nFC Roseng\u00e5rd (former LdB Malm\u00f6) are playing in the top level in Damallsvenskan, women's football league. FC Roseng\u00e5rd girls have won the league 10 times and the national cup title 5 times. In 2014, they reached the semi-final in Champions League, which they ultimately went on to lose to the German side 1. FFC Frankfurt. Brazilian football player Marta, widely regarded the best female football player of all time, played in FC Roseng\u00e5rd between 2014 and 2017.\nAt the 1958 FIFA World Cup Malm\u00f6 Stadion was inaugurated in combination with the opening match of the cup, as World Champions West Germany defeated Argentina 3\u20131, in front of 31,156, a record attendance for Malm\u00f6 in general. Another two games were decided at the stadium.\n\n\n==== Other sports ====\nMalm\u00f6 has athletes competing in a variety of sport.\n\n\n===== Ice hockey =====\nThe most notable other sports team is the ice hockey team Malm\u00f6 Redhawks. They were the creation of millionaire Percy Nilsson and quickly rose to the highest rank in the early to mid-1990s and won two Swedish championships, but for a number of years have found themselves residing outside of the top flight. \n\n\n===== Handball =====\nA first division handball team, HK Malm\u00f6, attracts a fair amount of attendance. \n\n\n===== Rugby =====\nRugby union team, Malm\u00f6 RC, founded in 1954, have won 6 national championships. The club has teams for men, women and juniors.\n\n\n===== Gaelic football =====\nGaelic football has also been introduced to Malm\u00f6. The men of Malm\u00f6 G.A.A. have won the Scandinavian Championships twice and the women once.\n\n\n===== Additional Team and Individual Sport =====\nOther notable team a sports are baseball, American football and Australian football.\nAmong non-team sports, badminton and athletics are the most popular, together with east Asian martial arts and boxing. Basketball is also fairly a big sport in the city, including the clubs Malbas and SF Srbija among others.\nWomen are permitted by the city council to swim topless in public swimming pools. Everyone must wear bathing attire, but covering of the breasts is not mandatory.\n\n\n== Notable events ==\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nScania\nMalm\u00f6 Bulltofta Airport\nChapter 4 Concerning the Friary in Malm\u00f8 in Chronicle of the Expulsion of the Greyfriars\nList of governors of Malm\u00f6hus County\nPorts of the Baltic Sea\n\n\n== References ==\nFacts & Figures about Malm\u00f6, 2005 at the Wayback Machine (archived 7 October 2006) \u2013 in English.

          "There\u2019s an aquarium in the Castle where you find out a lot about the inhabitants of the oceans, seas and lakes. The museum is meant for visitors of all ages - both kids and grown ups learn something new every time.  I  recommend it to the families with children.",
          "Very informative, you should def. visit the Holocaust-Survivers exhibition!",
          "It's pretty interesting, definitely worth a visit.\nThough would recommend to get an organized tour otherwise you'll get pretty lost.\nThe castle itself is awesome and very historic.\nThere's also a small restaurant there for food and drink, plenty of parking outside and all that",
          "Finding the entrance to the internal museum is a task. I guess there is one but we never found it we just walked in what turned out to be the exit. \n\nVery interesting exhibit on the history of the fort throughout the ages. Excellent personal stories of the refugees the Swedes rescued from the Nazi's. Definitely worth visiting.",
          "Lovely medieval Renaissance castle with some picturesque features. Its worth a visit.",
          "Relatively limited castle with small museum especially focusing on the period when it served as a prison and then a refugee centre after the war for concentration camp survivors. The other museums that you access with the ticket are \u2026",
          "A bit underwhelming... I guess it would be good if you plan to visit the museums that it hosts, but not as an attraction itself. On the other hand, to get there you can go via the park, which is quite lovely, and from there it is quite fast to walk to the Turning Torso (although the road is not very scenic, to say the least)",
          "Very beautiful in sunny weather. Small But has a museum and nice restaurant.",
          "The castle is pretty underwhelming.. It's just a standard looking red brick building that you can't even go inside (other than for the interesting but completely unrelated museum). There's a couple placards describing the castle's history, \u2026",
          "Time to visit(castle, aquarium, art gallery): 3 hours and beyond\nTicket (castle is free): 40 SEK\n\nHuge castle with very interesting depiction of its past from the life of royalties, soldiers and the prisoners.\nCastle has audio, video and \u2026",
          "The castle is part of the other museum entry and large in volume but lacking adequate signage in English. It felt a bit disjointed from room to room and generally could be curated better. Some areas not very child friendly but this is advised before entry.",
          "Amazing . You can go inside the old castle and learn a little bit of the history.  There is also a museum where you can learn about aquatic animals and others and at the other floor they have regular art expo. That have lockers to keep you things while you are walking on the museum. Also is a nice restaurant in the interior .",
          "For those who plan to go there, you should know that the castle is from outside only. Inside it's a natural history museum. Well, I don't want to underestimate it... To be honest for a little city like Malm\u00f6 it's a good place to go with a child once in a while. Unfortunately this is not a historical sight.",
          "Really nice area to explore and walk around. Especially loved the exhibit dedicated to the White Buses and everyone that participated in that program to save Jews and others persecuted by the Nazis.",
          "Aquarium and Animal Exhibition was great. The current Art exhibition is rather small and lacks any real cognitive interaction, there is hardly anything to read or discover. The topic itself \u2014 Migration \u2014 is introduced nicely, but the artwork shown is not linked back to the topic in a meaningful way.",
          "I have rated this 3 because it\u2019s a castle and I found absolutely nothing to do with the military history side other than a couple of info boards. As far as I know you couldn\u2019t walk the ramparts or visit the bastion and there was no \u2026",
          "I expected to find a castle filled with royal treasures such as were in castles in Copenhagen. This is more of a cultural museum with art exhibits relative to the area's history.",
          "Fantastic aquarium and natural history museum with a great modern art gallery upstairs. 40SEK entry fee and kids go free. Bargain of the year.",
          "Value for money ! I particularly liked the Aquarium and the reptile exhibition. We had a lot of fun.",
          "Some of the exhibitions were closed for renovation. No access to the original castle.Lack of information as to what was available to see",
          "Take me there every day and I will not be bored! In another words, an amazing place where history and future blend splendidly.",
          "A great castle/museum with a long history full of twists, all explained through a great exhibit.\nThe place also has a nice aquarium/terrarium and a small section on evolution and modern mammals.\nOn top of these things there is also a \u2026",
          "Nice location to be visited. It is not a simple Castle but is a museum. Enjoy the visit.",
          "Super cheap entrance for all the information you get to learn. At some parts interesting ideas to interact the person with history og Sweden. The castle was much bigger to walk around then it seems like from the outside.",
          "What a wonderful experience this Castle had to offer. From learning about the history of the castle over the centuries, the animal exhibits down in the basement and the history of how exercise got its start made for a fun historical \u2026",
          "Amazing experience of visiting this 15th century castle with a Natural History Museum and a Aquarium as a bonus. The entry is very cheap as well. The grand rooms, the stairs, the showcasing of castle's history takes you back 300-400 years. \u2026",
          "Amazing building. We didn't make a tour so I can't tell much abut.",
          "Lot's of exciting exhibitions. Something for everybody. Affordable day out for a family with children. History, animals and much more! Can easily spend 3 hours here.",
          "Access is around \u00a33, and gets you access to the cast itself, science museum, small aquarium and art exhibit. The castle was interesting but felt a bit unloved in favour of the other parts of the museum, which is a shame because it has quite a history.",
          "Worth a visit but only on a nice day",
          "Wonderful place to spend a day with kids.",
          "There\u2019s an aquarium in the Castle where you find out a lot about the inhabitants of the oceans, seas and lakes. The museum is meant for visitors of all ages - both kids and grown ups learn something new every time.  I  recommend it to the families with children.",
          "Very interesting castle and okeanarium. Staff was very good and  friendly. We were happy to attended this place. Thank U!",
          "Just land yourself into the History and enjoy the past",
          "Great museum, 40 kroner (less than 4 euro) or half if you're a student for all of the Malm\u00f6 museums is incredibly cheap, take enough time, you can easily spend all day here. Very family friendly.",
          "Great place , many museum a lot history",
          "Not worth a special trip. Nice gardens outside of the castle",
          "Had a nice experience here. It was interesting to learn about the history of the castle and many other things (which I think it depends on the exhibition). Oh, I also like the zoo, it was fun.",
          "It's a great place to take kids. Unfortunately a lot of the area was being renovated while I was there. It's no longer a Castle. It's a museum now.",
          "I loved malm\u00f6 castle inside museum.. Try it",
          "I was expecting it to be a Castle but actually it is a 2x1. First we saw the museum, with the aquarium and then we went to the castle. Students have discounts by showing their school/university card and in the end it was only 2 euros to get \u2026",
          "This castle is very deceiving from the outside. There is so much to do, aquarium, terrarium, area all about the ice age animals and so much more. I would definitely recommend this as a day out as you can easily spent 3 hours or more here.",
          "Nice place to spend some hours",
          "This was one of the most worthwhile visits to a museum/castle/aquarium (yes, they\u2019re all housed in one big building!) during our 2 weeks in Sweden. The entrance cost 40Kr which was entirely worth it for all the activities and information \u2026",
          "History merries weekend in a nice way in Malm\u00f6 Castle, conveniently placed in a big park in central Malm\u00f6",
          "Pretty awesome castle. Great place to spend few hours with kids or without. We really enjoyed out time there.",
          "Great art and exhibitions. We just wandered in on a day trip to Malmo and we were really glad we came here. Good price.",
          "it was cool ,you should check",
          "we took the train from Copenhagen across to Malm\u00f4 And we really enjoyed wandering around the town. Great place the castle to learn about the history",
          "You could skip it without remorse",
          "A really interesting well priced museum and castle with a good range of things to see. The aquarium was good but the best bit was the cannon tower which had lots of interesting historical information. It also very cheap for what you get to see.",
          "Completely worth every cent. You get everything in this museum, from animals through art to history. It's very English friendly and you can spend a lot of time here. I'd easily recommend this as the best place in Malm\u00f6.",
          "Nice place and they have very informative museums inside. It's nice that there are also areas where the kids can play.",
          "Was only there for a brief visit but lovely castle",
          "Great castle to visit the city in one day, a perfect stop for the lover of nature and history",
          "This place must be visited when you are in Malm\u00f6. The tickets give access to a smal gallery and other exhibitions in the castle. The place is quite fun for family",
          "Looks more like an old mill than a castle. The surrounding park is much nicer and worth going to.",
          "Cute historic tour to understand more about Malm\u00f6, friendly receptionists.",
          "The castle is wonderful and the museum inside is worth a visit. The cost is only 4\u20ac/ 40k ~.",
          "A mix of a little of this and a little of that, kind of strange at first. An aquarium in a castle is a bit different. I found myself thinking when do I get to see the actual castle and tower but then alas there it was! Very lovely but a bit scattered as far as \u201cwhere to go next\u201d. A really great value and a must see.",
          "Nice place to visit.",
          "Good views, museum inside the castle and a good walk around the gardens. More than just the photos below. A few row and pedal boats available to see the views from a different angle",

          "A lot of things to see for the kids. I recommend it.",
          "Something for everyone though for a solo English walkabout it was hard to figure out what some of the exhibits were about. Beautiful architecture and fun history",
          "Nice place to walk around.",
          "Great museum and aquarium inside!",
          "It was not so big but i liked",
          "Great place for a walk. The gardens are beautiful. Entrance to castle is 40kr. Food served also",
          "So, we didn't have long in Malm\u00f6 and I love a good castle so I dragged our group down there and was a bit disappointed really. I'm sure the museum is interesting but it looked rather small. There is a courtyard where you can sit on an \u2026",
          "Lovely historic castle!  Had some nice frozen yogurt at the little cafe there too.",
          "Great place but not much to do",

          "Castle had a lot of non-translated information. Quite sad. Otherwise good.",

          "Outside looks amazing and inside is a museum.",
          "The aquarium is nice after it was rebuilt. There is also a nice Christmas maker there every year",
          "One of the places that makes Malm\u00f6 Malm\u00f6. As a local born and bred one of my fav spots in the world hands down.",
          "Nice castle with a great nature exhibition. Some of the nicest small aquariums I have seen.",
          "Castle converted to offices. Not much character",
          "Nice little castle that has a very pretty surrounding of a moat and a park. If you're around this place definitely worth a try to look at. Nice stroll option, has a small little museum built in, actually two different museums. If you have a free couple of hours and in Malm\u00f6, go and take a look \ud83d\ude0a",
          "There\u2019s an aquarium in the Castle where you find out a lot about the inhabitants of the oceans, seas, and lakes. The museum is meant for visitors of all ages, both kids and grown-ups learn something new every time.",
          "An excellent value for money trip to Malm\u00f6 mueseums and Scandinavia's oldest standing renaissance castle. It is possible to enter the King's apartment and cannon rooms to really immerse yourself in how it used it be. \n\nEntry to the natural \u2026",
          "An impressive, very well-appointed museum for all ages, housed in a formiddable old castle.",
          "The atmosphere is awesome! Perceived by the spirit of the ancient ages. There is a very good restaurant with rich dishes and very modest prices. You can also find a very nice souvenir shop there. I bought there an album with a watercolor by Josef Frank.",

          "Norhing interesting to do inside there. Very expensive entrance. Not worth it",

          "Great city :)",
          "Fairly basic as castles go.",
          "Words cannot describe my experience. As a lover of history, this place was heaven! I had so much little time so I went straight into the castle and wow! I wish to go back one day. You'll need a full day to fully exhaust this place. Rich in \u2026",
          "Best castle i have been. There are a lot of castles in the world. But this one was not just to display the royal properties but has the real atmosphere of being in the castles. I can feel the history reappear in front of me. Most importantly this is not over crowded and cheap. Worth it.",
          "Not as special as I thought, there\u2019s a museum inside but it\u2019s more for children (with dinosaurs?) not much of a castle experience it still cool, the gardens free and worth visiting",
          "Awesome! For kids and for science!",
          "Currently a museum and a place for different art exhibitions.",
          "Remains of the castle most of which now seems to have been converted to a museum plus what appears to be offices or municipal buildings. Odd. I believe that there may be an aquarium or something inside also. We did not go in as we did not \u2026",
          "There is a animal/bird museum inside. Didn't get  time to visit and I also wasnt interested but the castle itself was ok and some construction work is going on so you will be able to take photos just from outside",

          "Well i couldn't get in as it was closed (usually open 10am-5pm) but seemed like a lovely place. The bus outside was a good one, had sad historical stories of saved prisoners, history can be interesting...",

          "Great exhibition and aquarium at a very reasonable price.",
          "I am not much into museums in general but the aquarium downstais is awesome! They even have horseshoe crab which now is one of my favourite creatures. Tickets are also relatively cheap as for Sweden. Walking distance from the city center. A must see in Malm\u00f6.",
          "Malm\u00f6 Castle is beautiful inside and out. I recommend taking a nice stroll around the perimeter of the castle and taking in the beauty of the grass and water features against the castle itself. Inside the castle there is no shortage of \u2026",

          "Much more given than expected for the price of 4 euro: castle, tower, excib itions, zoo museum and very good aquarium. For comparison, aquarium in Copenhagen is bigger but costs 25 euro.",

          "We were very happy visiting this place. Unfortunately we could not see the entire place as we were to catch a train back to Copenhagen.",
          "Pretty cool castle museum with an interestingly wide variety of exhibits. The history portion is top notch but a little twisty-turns in its layout. For me that just added to its charm. There was a portion on the military and royal history \u2026",

          "Cool historic castle in a nice seeing. Must see in Malmo.",

          "Lots to do here! Aquarium, natural history, castle rooms and other exhibits.  Reasonable price for entry as well.  Hands on activities for children are good and translations in many languages. You could easily spend several hours here.  The ticket was also good for the science museum but our feet were too tired.  ",
          "Lots to see, lots to explore! You could easily spend an entire day here, losing track of time among the vast and informative exhibits and attractions.

          "Not really a Castle but good to see",
          "We didn't expect much and just sought a place to escape the rain. But our mind was blown when we found out just how much there is to explore. From the history of the castle,  nature and animals to modern arts and design. I guess it depends on what kind of exhibition is on display. I would recommend it as a must visit when in Malm\u00f6.",
          "Very interesting place. Went there in night time and they had projections on the castle windows showing the life during those times. Really nice areA to walk in the evening",

          "An oddball collection of aquarium, natural history museum, special exhibitions and the history of the castle itself.

          "5 demands, not 1 less!!!",
          "There are lots of castles in Sweden but this for me is the most interesting. The structure is massive, with huge halls, several rooms representing the glory of a bygone era. On the other hand, it also shows the opposite side of the \u2026",
          "Great exhibits of the past it was very engaging for children.",
          "Nice castle.. Wish thee was some audio guide.",
          "Good value for money. It's more a natural history museum come art gallery than a castle in my opinion, with lots to do and see in the aquarium and in the animal exhibits so make sure you leave plenty of time as there is lots to do.",
          "A wonderful museum. A current temporary exhibit is of long lost photos from the Spanish Civil war .  History of Malmo is fascinating.",
          "Surprisenly very nice exhibitions. One part with aquariums (with fish and other animals that lifes under the surface) and terrariums (with reptiles).

          "The castle is nice but it looks modern, it is not, this is how it was built, inside you can visit some exhibitions and see some information, like it but I wouldn\u2019t be sad to miss it; yet the windmill near it is nice :D",

          "The museum starts with a room where you can play old games, continues with a room about fashion. After that you can find more rooms with the history of the malm\u00f6hus. It was super interestingly exhibited! I'd recommend going there :)",

          "Malm\u00f6 castle museum is very different from other castle museum. Themed around the Malm\u00f6 plague in 18th century, it is nicely decorated to scare you. Dark theme and scary background sounds add to your experience. You get to read about how \u2026",
          "Beautiful",

        "wiki": "Malm\u00f6 (; Swedish: [\u02c8m\u00e2lm\u00f8\u02d0] (listen); Danish: Malm\u00f8 [\u02c8m\u00e6lm\u02cc\u00f8\u02c0]) is the largest city in the Swedish county (l\u00e4n) of Sk\u00e5ne (Scania). It is the third-largest city in Sweden, after Stockholm and Gothenburg, and the sixth-largest city in Scandinavia, with a population of 316,588 (municipal total 338,230 in 2018). The Malm\u00f6 Metropolitan Region is home to over 700,000 people, and the \u00d8resund Region, which includes Malm\u00f6, is home to 4 million people.Malm\u00f6 was one of the earliest and most industrialized towns in Scandinavia, but it struggled to adapt to post-industrialism. Since the construction of the \u00d6resund Bridge, Malm\u00f6 has undergone a major transformation, producing new architectural developments, supporting new biotech and IT companies, and attracting students through Malm\u00f6 University and other higher education facilities. The city contains many historic buildings and parks, and is also a commercial center for the western part of Scania.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest written mention of Malm\u00f6 as a city dates from 1275. It is thought to have been founded shortly before that date, as a fortified quay or ferry berth of the Archbishop of Lund, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) to the north-east. Malm\u00f6 was for centuries Denmark's second-biggest city. Its original name was Malmhaug (with alternate spellings), meaning \"Gravel pile\" or \"Ore Hill\".\nIn the 15th century, Malm\u00f6 became one of Denmark's largest and most visited cities, reaching a population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. It became the most important city around the \u00d8resund, with the German Hanseatic League frequenting it as a marketplace, and was notable for its flourishing herring fishery. In 1437, King Eric of Pomerania (King of Denmark from 1396 to 1439) granted the city's arms: argent with a griffin gules, based on Eric's arms from Pomerania. The griffin's head as a symbol of Malm\u00f6 extended to the entire province of Scania from 1660.\nIn 1434, a new citadel was constructed at the beach south of the town. This fortress, known today as Malm\u00f6hus, did not take its current form until the mid-16th century. Several other fortifications were constructed, making Malm\u00f6 Sweden's most fortified city, but only Malm\u00f6hus remains.\n\nLutheran teachings spread during the 16th century Protestant Reformation, and Malm\u00f6 became one of the first cities in Scandinavia to fully convert (1527\u20131529) to this Protestant denomination.\nIn the 17th century, Malm\u00f6 and the Scanian region (Sk\u00e5neland) came under control of Sweden following the Treaty of Roskilde with Denmark, signed in 1658. Fighting continued, however; in June 1677, 14,000 Danish troops laid siege to Malm\u00f6 for a month, but were unable to defeat the Swedish troops holding it.\nBy the dawn of the 18th century, Malm\u00f6 had about 2,300 inhabitants. However, owing to the wars of Charles XII of Sweden (reigned 1697\u20131718) and to bubonic plague epidemics, the population dropped to 1,500 by 1727. The population did not grow much until the modern harbor was constructed in 1775. The city started to expand and the population in 1800 was 4,000. 15 years later, it had increased to 6,000.\n\nIn 1840, Frans Henrik Kockum founded the workshop from which the Kockums shipyard eventually developed as one of the largest shipyards in the world. The Southern Main Line was built between 1856 and 1864; this enabled Malm\u00f6 to become a center of manufacture, with major textile and mechanical industries. In 1870, Malm\u00f6 overtook Norrk\u00f6ping to become Sweden's third-most populous city, and by 1900 Malm\u00f6 had strengthened this position with 60,000 inhabitants. Malm\u00f6 continued to grow through the first half of the 20th century. The population had swiftly increased to 100,000 by 1915 and to 200,000 by 1952.\n\n\n=== 1900\u20131969 ===\n\nIn 1914 (15 May to 4 October) Malm\u00f6 hosted the Baltic Exhibition. The large park Pildammsparken was arranged and planted for this large event. The Russian part of the exhibition was never taken down, owing to the outbreak of World War I.\nOn 18 and 19 December 1914, the Three Kings Meeting was held in Malm\u00f6. After a somewhat infected period (1905\u20131914), which included the dissolution of the Swedish-Norwegian Union, King Oscar II was replaced with King H\u00e5kon VII in Norway, who was the younger brother of the Danish King Christian X. As Oscar died in 1907, and his son Gustav V became the new King of Sweden, the tensions within Scandinavia were still unclear, but during this historical meeting, the Scandinavian Kings found internal understanding, as well as a common line about remaining neutral in the ongoing war.\nWithin sports, Malm\u00f6 has mostly been associated with football. IFK Malm\u00f6 participated in the first ever edition of Allsvenskan 1924/25, but from the mid-1940s Malm\u00f6 FF started to rise, and ever since it has been one of the most prominent clubs within Swedish football. They have won Allsvenskan 23 times in all (as of February 2018) between 1943/44 and 2017.\n\n\n=== 1970s and later ===\nBy 1971, Malm\u00f6 reached 265,000 inhabitants, but this was the peak which would stand for more than 30 years. (Svedala was, for a few years in the early 1970s, a part of Malm\u00f6 municipality.)\nBy the mid-1970s Sweden experienced a recession that hit the industrial sector especially hard; shipyards and manufacturing industries suffered, which led to high unemployment in many cities of Scania. Kockums shipyard had become a symbol of Malm\u00f6 as its largest employer and, when shipbuilding ceased in 1986, confidence in the future of Malm\u00f6 plummeted among politicians and the public. In addition, many middle-class families moved into one-family houses in surrounding municipalities such as Vellinge Municipality, Lomma Municipality and Staffanstorp Municipality, which profiled themselves as the suburbs of the upper-middle class. By 1985, Malm\u00f6 had lost 35,000 inhabitants and was down to 229,000.The Swedish financial crises of the early 1990s exacerbated Malm\u00f6's decline as an industrial city; between 1990 and 1995 Malm\u00f6 lost about 27,000 jobs and its economy was seriously strained. However, from 1994 under the leadership of the then mayor Ilmar Reepalu, the city of Malm\u00f6 started to create a new economy as a center of culture and knowledge. Malm\u00f6 reached bottom in 1995, but that same year marked the commencement of the massive \u00d6resund Bridge road, railway and tunnel project, connecting it to Copenhagen and to the rail lines of Europe. The new Malm\u00f6 University opened in 1998 on Kockums' former dockside. Further redevelopment of the now disused south-western harbor followed; a city architecture exposition (Bo01) was held in the area in 2001, and its buildings and villas form the core of a new city district. Designed with attractive waterfront vistas, it was intended to be and has been successful in attracting the urban middle-class.\nSince 1974, the Kockums Crane had been a landmark in Malm\u00f6 and a symbol of the city's manufacturing industry, but in 2002 it was disassembled and moved to South Korea. In 2005, Malm\u00f6 gained a new landmark with completion of Turning Torso, the tallest skyscraper in Scandinavia. Although the transformation from a city with its economic base in manufacturing has returned growth to Malm\u00f6, the new types of jobs have largely benefited the middle and upper classes.\nIn its 2015 and 2017 reports, Police in Sweden placed the Roseng\u00e5rd and the S\u00f6dra Sofielund/Seved district in the most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMalm\u00f6 is located at 13\u00b000' east and 55\u00b035' north, near the southwestern tip of Sweden, in the province of Scania.\nThe city is part of the transnational \u00d6resund Region and, since 2000, has been linked by the \u00d6resund Bridge across the \u00d6resund to Copenhagen, Denmark. The bridge opened on 1 July 2000, and measures 8 kilometres (5 miles) (the whole link totalling 16 km), with pylons reaching 204.5 metres (670.9 feet) vertically. Apart from the Helsingborg-Helsing\u00f8r ferry links further north, most ferry connections have been discontinued.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nMalm\u00f6, like the rest of southern Sweden, has an oceanic climate. Despite its northern location, the climate is mild compared to other locations at similar latitudes, mainly because of the influence of the Gulf Stream and also its westerly position on the Eurasian landmass. Owing to its northern latitude, daylight lasts 17 hours in midsummer, but only around seven hours in midwinter. According to data from 2002\u20132014 Falsterbo, to the south of the city, received an annual average of 1,895 hours of sunshine while Lund, to the north, received 1,803 hours. The sunshine data in the weather box is based on the data for Falsterbo.Summers are mild with average high temperatures of 20 to 23 \u00b0C (68 to 73 \u00b0F) and lows of around 11 to 13 \u00b0C (52 to 55 \u00b0F). Heat waves during the summer arise occasionally. Winters are fairly cold and windy, with temperatures steady between \u22123 to 4 \u00b0C (27 to 39 \u00b0F), but it rarely drops below \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F).\nRainfall is light to moderate throughout the year with 169 wet days. Snowfall occurs mainly in December through March, but snow covers do not remain for a long time, and some winters are virtually free of snow.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\u00d6resund Line trains cross the \u00d6resund Bridge every 20 minutes (hourly late night) connecting Malm\u00f6 to Copenhagen, and the Copenhagen Airport. The trip takes around 35\u201340 minutes. Additionally, some of the X 2000 and Intercity trains to Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Kalmar cross the bridge, stopping at Copenhagen Airport. In March 2005, excavation began on a new railway connection called the City Tunnel, which opened for traffic on 4 December 2010. The tunnel runs south from Malm\u00f6 Central Station through an underground station at the Triangeln railway station to Hylliev\u00e5ng (Hyllie Meadow). Then, the line comes to the surface to enter Hyllie Station, also created as part of the tunnel project. From Hyllie Station, the line connects to the existing \u00d6resund line in either direction, with the \u00d6resund Bridge lying due west.\nBesides the Copenhagen Airport, Malm\u00f6 has an airport of its own, Malm\u00f6 Airport, today chiefly used for domestic Swedish destinations, charter flights and low-cost carriers.\nThe motorway system has been incorporated with the \u00d6resund Bridge; the European route E20 goes over the bridge and then, together with the European route E6 follows the Swedish west coast from Malm\u00f6\u2013Helsingborg to Gothenburg. E6 goes further north along the west coast and through Norway to the Norwegian town Kirkenes at Barents Sea. The European route to J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping\u2013Stockholm (E4) starts at Helsingborg. Main roads in the directions of V\u00e4xj\u00f6\u2013Kalmar, Kristianstad\u2013Karlskrona, Ystad (E65), and Trelleborg start as freeways.\nMalm\u00f6 has 410 kilometres (250 mi) of bike paths; approximately 40% of all commuting is done by bicycle.\n\n\n=== Ports ===\nThe city has two industrial harbors; one is still in active use and is the largest Nordic port for car importation. It also has two marinas: the publicly owned Limhamn Marina (55\u00b035\u2032N 12\u00b055\u2032E) and the private Lagunen (55\u00b035\u2032N 12\u00b056\u2032E), both offering a limited number of guest docks.\nPublic transport consisted of a tram network from 1887 until 1973. Afterwards, it was replaced by a bus network.\n\n\n=== Malm\u00f6 S-Train ===\nA local train line with circular traffic at seven stations was opened in December 2018. The stations are Malm\u00f6 Central Station (underground platforms) \u2013 Triangeln station \u2013 Hyllie station \u2013 Malm\u00f6 South/Sv\u00e5gertorp \u2013 Persborg \u2013 Roseng\u00e5rd \u2013 \u00d6sterv\u00e4rn \u2013 Malm\u00f6 Central Station (main overground terminus). Some trains arrive from Kristianstad and finish with a lap around Malm\u00f6, whilst other trains at this circular line, never drive outside the city limits. There is at least a 30 minutes service between each departure, but far more between the Central Station and Hyllie. Extension plans of a minor network system exists.\n\n\n=== Proposed metro ===\nThe \u00d6resundsmetro is a proposed rapid transit network linking Malm\u00f6 with the existing Copenhagen Metro through a 22 km tunnel under the \u00d6resund.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nMalm\u00f6 Municipality is an administrative unit defined by geographical borders, consisting of the City of Malm\u00f6 and its immediate surroundings.\nMalm\u00f6 (Malm\u00f6 t\u00e4tort) consists of the urban part of the municipality together with the small town of Arl\u00f6v in the Burl\u00f6v Municipality. Both municipalities also include smaller urban areas and rural areas, such as the suburbs of Oxie and \u00c5karp. Malm\u00f6 t\u00e4tort is to be distinguished from Malm\u00f6 stad (the city of Malm\u00f6), which is a semi-official name of Malm\u00f6 Municipality.\nThe leaders in Malm\u00f6 created a commission for a socially sustainable Malm\u00f6 in November 2010. The commissions were tasked with providing evidence-based strategies for reducing health inequalities and improve living conditions for all citizens of Malm\u00f6, especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged and issued its final report in December 2013.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nMalm\u00f6 has a young population by Swedish standards, with almost half of the population under the age of 35 (48.2%).After 1971, Malm\u00f6 had 265,000 inhabitants, but the population then dropped to 229,000 by 1985. The total population of the urban area was 280,415 in December 2010. It then began to rise again, and had passed the previous record by the 1 January 2003 census, when it had 265,481 inhabitants. On 27 April 2011, the population of Malm\u00f6 reached the 300,000 mark. In 2017 the total population of the city was 316,588 inhabitants out of a municipal total of 338,230.In 2019, approximately 55.5% of the population of Malm\u00f6 municipality (190,849 residents) had at least one parent born abroad. The Middle East, Horn of Africa, former Yugoslavia and Denmark are the main sources of immigration. In addition, 14.8% (50 999 residents) of the population in 2019 were foreign nationals.Foreign-born population by country, 31 December 2018:\n\nGreater Malm\u00f6 is one of Sweden's three officially recognized metropolitan areas (storstadsomr\u00e5den) and since 2005 is defined as the municipality of Malm\u00f6 and 11 other municipalities in the southwestern corner of Scania. As of 2019, its population was recorded as 740,840. The region covers an area of 2,522 square kilometres (974 sq mi). The municipalities included, apart from Malm\u00f6, are Burl\u00f6v, Esl\u00f6v, H\u00f6\u00f6r, K\u00e4vlinge, Lomma, Lund, Skurup, Staffanstorp, Svedala, Trelleborg and Vellinge. Together with Lund, Malm\u00f6 is the region's economic and education hub.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Malm\u00f6 was traditionally based on shipbuilding (Kockums) and construction-related industries, such as concrete factories. The region's leading university, along with its associated hi-tech and pharmaceutical industries, is located in Lund about 16 kilometres (10 miles) to the north-east. As a result, Malm\u00f6 had a troubled economic situation following the mid-1970s. Between 1990\u20131995, 27,000 jobs were lost, and the budget deficit was more than one billion Swedish krona (SEK). In 1995, Malm\u00f6 had Sweden's highest unemployment rate.However, during the last two decades, there has been a revival. One contributing factor has been the economic integration with Denmark brought about by the \u00d6resund Bridge, which opened in July 2000. Also the university founded in 1998 and the effects of integration into the European Union have contributed. In 2017 the unemployment rate is still high but Malm\u00f6 has, in the last 20 years, had one of the strongest employment growth rates in Sweden. But a lot of those jobs are taken by workers outside the neighboring municipalities.As of 2016, the largest companies were:\nSkanska \u2013 heavy construction\nNobina \u2013 transport\nPostNord \u2013 postal services\nP\u00e5gen \u2013 bakery\nIKEA \u2013 furnitureAlmost 30 companies have moved their headquarters to Malm\u00f6 during the last seven years, generating around 2,300 jobs. Among them are IKEA who has most of its headquarter functions based in Malm\u00f6.The number of start-up companies is high in Malm\u00f6. Around 7 new companies are started every day in Malm\u00f6. In 2010, the renewal of the number of companies amounted to 13.9%, which exceeds both Stockholm and Gothenburg. Especially strong growth is in the gaming area with Massive entertainment and King being the flagship companies for the industry. Among the industries that continue to increase their share of companies in Malm\u00f6 are transport, financial and business services, entertainment, leisure and construction.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMalm\u00f6 has the country's ninth-largest school of higher education, Malm\u00f6 University, established in 1998. It has 1,600 employees and 24,000 students (2014).\nIn addition nearby Lund University (established in 1666) has some education located in Malm\u00f6:\n\nMalm\u00f6 Art Academy (Konsth\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nMalm\u00f6 Academy of Music (Musikh\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nMalm\u00f6 Theatre Academy (Teaterh\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nThe Faculty of Medicine, which is located in both Malm\u00f6 and Lund.The United Nations World Maritime University is also located in Malm\u00f6. The World Maritime University (WMU) operates under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized agency of the United Nations. WMU thus enjoys the status, privileges and immunities of a UN institution in Sweden.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Film and television ===\nA striking depiction of Malm\u00f6 (in the 1930s) was made by Bo Widerberg in his debut film Kvarteret Korpen (Raven's End) (1963), largely shot in the shabby Korpen working-class district in Malm\u00f6. With humour and tenderness, it depicts the tensions between classes and generations.  The movie was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1965. In 2017, the film Medan Vi Lever (While We Live) was awarded the prize for best film by an African living abroad at the Africa Movie Academy Awards. It was filmed in Malm\u00f6 and Gambia, and deals with identity, integration and everyday racism.The cities of Malm\u00f6 and Copenhagen are, with the \u00d6resund Bridge, the main locations in the television series The Bridge (Bron/Broen).\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\nIn 1944, Malm\u00f6 Stadsteater (Malm\u00f6 Municipal Theatre) was established with a repertoire comprising stage theatre, opera, musical, ballet, musical recitals and experimental theatre. In 1993 it was split into three units, Dramatiska Teater (Dramatical Theatre), Malm\u00f6 Musikteater (Music Theatre) and Sk\u00e5nes Dansteater (Scanian Dance Theatre) and the name was abandoned. The ownership of the last two were transferred to Region Sk\u00e5ne in 2006 Dramatiska Teatern regained its old name. In the 1950s Ingmar Bergman was the Director and Chief Stage Director of Malm\u00f6 Stadsteater and many of his actors, like Max von Sydow and Ingrid Thulin became known through his films. Later stage directors include Staffan Valdemar Holm and G\u00f6ran Stangertz. Malm\u00f6 Musikteater were renamed Malm\u00f6 Operan and plays operas and musicals, classics as newly composed, on one of Scandinavia's large opera scenes with 1,511 seats. Sk\u00e5nes dansteater is active and plays contemporary dance repertory and present works by Swedish and international choreographers in their house in Malm\u00f6 harbor.Since the 1970s the city has also been home to independent theatre groups and show/musical companies. It also hosts a rock/dance/dub culture; in the 1960s The Rolling Stones played the Klubb Bongo, and in recent years stars like Morrissey, Nick Cave, B.B. King and Pat Metheny have made repeated visits.\nThe Cardigans debuted in Malm\u00f6 and recorded their albums there. On 7 January 2009 CNN Travel broadcast a segment called \"MyCity_MyLife\" featuring Nina Persson taking the camera to some of the sites in Malm\u00f6 that she enjoys.\nThe Rooseum Center for Contemporary Art, founded in 1988 by the Swedish art collector and financier Fredrik Roos and housed in a former power station which had been built in 1900, was one of the foremost centers for contemporary art in Europe during the 1980s and 1990s. By 2006, most of the collection had been sold off and the museum was on a time-out; by 2010 Rooseum had been dismantled and a subsidiary of the National Museum of Modern Art inaugurated in its place.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nIn 1992 and in 2013 Malm\u00f6 was the host of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nModerna Museet Malm\u00f6 was opened in December 2009  in the old Rooseum building. It is a part of the Moderna Museet, with independent exhibitions of modern and contemporary art. The collection of Moderna Museet holds key pieces of, among others, Marcel Duchamp, Louise Bourgeois, Pablo Picasso, Niki de Saint Phalle, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Carolee Schneemann, Henri Matisse and Robert RauschenbergMalm\u00f6 Museum (Malm\u00f6 Museer) is a municipal and regional museum. The museum features exhibitions on technology, shipping, natural history and history. Malm\u00f6 Museum has an aquarium and an art museum. Malm\u00f6hus Castle is also operated as a part of the museum.\nExhibitions are primarily shown at Slottsholmen and at the Technology and Maritime Museum (Teknikens och sj\u00f6fartens hus).Malm\u00f6 Konsthall is one of the largest exhibition halls in Europe for contemporary art, opened in 1975.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMalm\u00f6's oldest building is St. Peter's Church (Swedish: Sankt Petri). It was built in the early 14th century in Baltic Brick Gothic probably after St Mary's Church in L\u00fcbeck. The church is built with a nave, two aisles, a transept and a tower. Its exterior is characterized above all by the flying buttresses spanning its airy arches over the aisles and ambulatory. The tower, which fell down twice during the 15th century, got its current look in 1890. Another major church of significance is the Church of Our Saviour, Malm\u00f6, which was founded in 1870.\nAnother old building is Tunneln, 300 metres (1,000 ft) to the west of Sankt Petri Church, which also dates back to around 1300.\nThe oldest parts of Malm\u00f6 were built between 1300\u20131600 during its first major period of expansion. The central city's layout, as well as some of its oldest buildings, are from this time. Many of the smaller buildings from this time are typical Scanian: two-story urban houses that show a strong Danish influence.Recession followed in the ensuing centuries. The next expansion period was in the mid 19th century and led to the modern stone and brick city. This expansion lasted into the 20th century and can be seen by a number of Art Nouveau buildings, among those in the Malm\u00f6 synagogue. Malm\u00f6 was relatively late to be influenced by modern ideas of functionalist tenement architecture in the 1930s.\nAround 1965, the government initiated the so-called Million Programme, intending to offer affordable apartments in the outskirts of major Swedish cities. But this period also saw the reconstruction (and razing) of much of the historical city center.Since the late 1990s, Malm\u00f6 has seen a more cosmopolitan architecture. V\u00e4stra Hamnen (The Western Harbor), like most of the harbor to the north of the city center, was industrial. In 2001 its reconstruction began as an urban residential neighbourhood, with 500 residential units, most were part of the exhibition Bo01. The exhibition had two main objectives: develop self-sufficient housing units in terms of energy and greatly diminish phosphorus emissions. Among the new building's towers were the Turning Torso, a skyscraper with a twisting design, 190 metres (620 ft) tall, the majority of which is residential. It became Malm\u00f6's new landmark. The most recent addition (2015) is the new development of Malm\u00f6 Live. This new building features a hotel, a concert hall, congress hall and a sky bar in the center of Malm\u00f6. Point Hyllie is a new 110 m commercial tower that is under construction as of 2018.\n\n\n=== Other sights ===\n\nThe beach Ribersborg, by locals usually called Ribban, south-west of the harbor area, is a man-made shallow beach, stretching along Malm\u00f6's coastline. Despite Malm\u00f6's chilly climate, it is sometimes referred to as the \"Copacabana of Malm\u00f6\". It is the site of Ribersborgs open-air bath, opened in the 1890s.\nThe long boardwalk at The Western Harbor, Scaniaparken and Daniaparken, has become a favorite summer hang-out for the people of Malm\u00f6 and is a popular place for bathing. The harbor is particularly popular with Malm\u00f6's vibrant student community and has been the scene of several impromptu outdoor parties and gatherings.\n\n\n=== Annual events ===\n\nIn the third week of August each year a festival, Malm\u00f6festivalen, fills the streets of Malm\u00f6 with different kinds of cuisines and events.\nBUFF International Film Festival, an international children and young people's film festival, is held in Malm\u00f6 every year in March.\nNordisk Panorama \u2013 Nordic Short & Doc Film Festival, a film festival for short and documentary films by filmmakers from the Nordic countries, is held every year in September.\nMalm\u00f6 Arab Film Festival (MAFF), the largest Arabic film festival in Europe, is held in Malm\u00f6.\nThe Nordic Game conference takes place in Malm\u00f6 every April/May. The event consists of conference itself, recruitment expo and game expo and attracts hundreds of gamedev professionals every year.\nMalm\u00f6 also hosts other 3rd party events that cater to all communities that reside in Malm\u00f6, including religious and political celebrations.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nSydsvenskan, founded in 1870, is Malm\u00f6's largest daily newspaper. It has an average circulation of 130,000. Its main competitor is the regional daily Sk\u00e5nska Dagbladet, which has a circulation of 34,000. The tabloid Kv\u00e4llsposten still has a minimal editorial staff but is today just a version of a Stockholm tabloid. The Social Democratic Arbetet was edited and printed at Malm\u00f6 between 1887 and 2000.In addition to these, a number of free-of-charge papers, generally dealing with entertainment, music and fashion have local editions (for instance City, Rodeo, Metro and N\u00f6jesguiden). Malm\u00f6 is also home to the Egmont Group's Swedish magazine operations. A number of local and regional radio and TV broadcasters are based in the Greater Malm\u00f6 area.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\n\n==== Football ====\n\nSports in southern Sweden are dominated by football. Over the years the city's best football teams have been Malm\u00f6 FF who play in the top-level Allsvenskan Malm\u00f6 FF had their most successful periods in the 1970s and 1980s when they won the league several times. In 1979, they advanced to the final of the European Cup defeating AS Monaco, Dynamo Kiew, Wisla Krakow and Austria Wien (Vienna) but lost in the final at the Munich Olympic Stadium against Nottingham Forest by a single goal just before half time scored by Trevor Francis. To date, they are the only Swedish football club to have reached the final of the competition. Malm\u00f6 FF is the club where for instance, Bosse Larsson and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 began their football careers.  A second football team, IFK Malm\u00f6 played in Sweden's top flight for about 20 years and the club's quarterfinal in the European Cup is the club's greatest achievement in its history. Today, the club resides in the sixth tier of the Swedish league system.\nFC Roseng\u00e5rd (former LdB Malm\u00f6) are playing in the top level in Damallsvenskan, women's football league. FC Roseng\u00e5rd girls have won the league 10 times and the national cup title 5 times. In 2014, they reached the semi-final in Champions League, which they ultimately went on to lose to the German side 1. FFC Frankfurt. Brazilian football player Marta, widely regarded the best female football player of all time, played in FC Roseng\u00e5rd between 2014 and 2017.\nAt the 1958 FIFA World Cup Malm\u00f6 Stadion was inaugurated in combination with the opening match of the cup, as World Champions West Germany defeated Argentina 3\u20131, in front of 31,156, a record attendance for Malm\u00f6 in general. Another two games were decided at the stadium.\n\n\n==== Other sports ====\nMalm\u00f6 has athletes competing in a variety of sport.\n\n\n===== Ice hockey =====\nThe most notable other sports team is the ice hockey team Malm\u00f6 Redhawks. They were the creation of millionaire Percy Nilsson and quickly rose to the highest rank in the early to mid-1990s and won two Swedish championships, but for a number of years have found themselves residing outside of the top flight. \n\n\n===== Handball =====\nA first division handball team, HK Malm\u00f6, attracts a fair amount of attendance. \n\n\n===== Rugby =====\nRugby union team, Malm\u00f6 RC, founded in 1954, have won 6 national championships. The club has teams for men, women and juniors.\n\n\n===== Gaelic football =====\nGaelic football has also been introduced to Malm\u00f6.

        "wiki": "Turning Torso is a neo-futurist residential skyscraper in Sweden and the tallest building in Scandinavia.Located in Malm\u00f6 on the Swedish side of the \u00d6resund strait, it was built and is owned by Swedish cooperative association HSB. It is regarded as the first twisted skyscraper in the world.The project was designed by Spanish architect, structural engineer, sculptor and painter Santiago Calatrava and officially opened on 27 August 2005. The tower reaches a height of 190 metres (623 ft) with 54 stories and 147 apartments.In August 2015, it was announced that the building was the winner of the 10 Year Award from the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. It won the 2005 Gold Emporis Skyscraper Award.\n\n\n== Design ==\nTurning Torso is based on a sculpture by Calatrava, called Twisting Torso, which is a white marble piece based on the form of a twisting human being.  It is the first \"twisting\" tower.In 1999, HSB Malm\u00f6's former managing director, Johnny \u00d6rb\u00e4ck, saw the sculpture in a brochure presenting Calatrava in connection with his contribution to the architectural competition for the \u00d6resund Bridge. It was on this occasion that  \u00d6rb\u00e4ck was inspired to build HSB Turning Torso. Shortly afterwards he travelled to Zurich to meet Calatrava, and ask him to design a residential building based on the idea of a structure of twisting cubes.\n\nThis is a solid, immobile building constructed in nine segments of five-story pentagons that twist relative to each other as it rises; the topmost segment is twisted 90 degrees clockwise with respect to the ground floor. Each floor consists of an irregular pentagonal shape rotating around the vertical core, which is supported by an exterior steel framework. The two bottom segments are intended as office space. Segments three to nine house 147 apartments.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nConstruction started in the summer of 2001. One reason for building Turning Torso was to re-establish a recognisable skyline for Malm\u00f6 since the removal in 2002 of the Kockums Crane, which was located less than one kilometre (0.62 mi) from Turning Torso. The local politicians deemed it important for the inhabitants to have a new symbol for Malm\u00f6 in lieu of the crane that had been used for shipbuilding and somewhat symbolised the city's blue collar roots.The construction of part of this building was featured on Discovery Channel Extreme Engineering TV programme which showed how a floor of the building was constructed.\nPrior to the construction of Turning Torso, the 86-metre (282 ft) Kronprinsen had been the city's tallest building.The apartments were initially supposed to be sold, but insufficient interest resulted in the apartments being let. The owner has several times unsuccessfully tried to sell the building. The construction costs were almost double the estimate.\n\n\n== Events ==\nOn 18 August 2006, Austrian skydiver Felix Baumgartner parachuted onto the Turning Torso, and then jumped off it.Floor 49 is home to the public observation deck while floors 50\u201352 contain a private club, meeting events, the reception, and the venue restaurant.\nFloor 53 and 54 in the Turning Torso are conference floors booked and managed by Sky High Meetings. Since 2009 the owner, HSB, has decided to let the public visit these floors but only on special scheduled days, and pre-booking is required.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tallest buildings in the world\nList of tallest buildings in Europe\nList of tallest buildings in Sweden\nList of twisted buildings\nShanghai Tower, much larger twisting building\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nFullscreen panorama from Turning Torso\nPERI GmbH - From a sculpture to a building\nThe New Yorker, October 31 2005, \"The Sculptor\" Link broken, Nov 2011\nTorso Tower Blog\nShort films of Turning Torso from various locations",

          "The Turning Torso is a modern landmark in Malm\u00f6 worth visiting if you are in town. It is a short walk from the centre (15-20 mins from the Central Station depending on how fast you walk) in an interesting neighbourhood. Seeing the building itself only takes a few minutes, but",
          "Beautiful building build in early 2000. Like most travelers mentioned. It is not open to public. If you really want to see it up close, like we did. There is a open car park in front of the entrance. There is some information about the building at the ground floor. There is a",
          "Interesting architecture. But we weren't able to go up and the fountains weren't turned on when we went there. Can be seen from Oresund Bridge. From the central station, best to take the bus going there unless you like long walks.",
          "I was staying in Malmo. I took a ride to the turning tower hoping to go up to the top... to no avail. So, I stood outside and looked up at the building... not so much fun.",
          "It is an impressive building, and residents are really quite proud of this building since it was built in the early 2000s. It\u2019s unfortunate you can\u2019t go to the top and see the view, the best chance of that is visiting the sky bar.",
          "We visited Ribersborg stranden to experience an awesome sunset and got a great view of HSB Turning Torso. Stunning architecture.",
          "No need to spend long here. You can see for miles away. Worth having a look as it is a very interesting building.",
          "This can be seen from many places in the city. We were in a nearby hotel and walked passed it most days on the way to the seafront - several useful platforms on seafront for use by bathers. No access to the Turning Torso at the time of our visit but understood there is a",
          "Ok, it is nice it is visible from so many angles, it is great to build such a shaped tower, but it really feels overrated.",
          "Looks the same from the distance as up close. Save your feet and don\u2019t bother with walking out there to get up close and personal, there\u2019s not much happening in this part of town.",
          "Magnificent architecture, beautiful to see and provides an interesting landscape! Impossible to get in or to go up to see the view as they are private apartments, which is such a loss! there is a cute eye architectural thing at the door that blinks if you stare at it :D",
          "Maybe my views are skewed having lived in Tokyo, a city of crazy architecture. Turning torso is an interesting modern building but that is it...You can not got up the tower unless you live there. Once you see the building...you've seen it. No real reason to go to Malmo, but if",
          "We say the turning torso on the boat cruise which was ok ..enjoyed the boat cruise and it's sights with commentaries",
          "Pretty cool building and structure & worth it to see up close although it is visible from many spots in Malm\u00f6. Although a residential building, looks like there is a restaurant and some shops. The area (V\u00e4stra Hamnen) is nice with the Ribersborgs beach only a few steps",
          "Hard to make some nice photos so don't expect much. It's a building with a different design, but nothing WOW. It's in a great location, 2-minute walk to the seaside where you have a nice view and you can also see from far (of course) the Oresund bridge. Overall it's just another",
          "This is a great photo option for tourists. But keep in mind you cannot visit the top since it is a residential building.",
          "First of all I have no idea why one of the other reviewers was shocked that this tower didn\u2019t actually turn. The structure give the appearance of a turning tower - that should be fairly obvious. Don\u2019t go here expecting the entire tower to revolve. There\u2019s not a lot of point",
          "So called turning torso is a skyscraper in the New harbour housing area in Malm\u00f6. It doesnt turn! It is said that flats there are round, therefore difficult to furnish. However, they might be so expensive that you have to buy another kind flat! Anyway, this skyscraper",
          "Very unique place and building. Its beautiful architecture can only viewed from outside. I have yet not been able to get into the building. They make it so complicated to book a visit. Mostly you have to be in a group. Or there are only certain time of the year that you can book",
          "I was surprised to see this skyscraper in \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea Sweden. I was told that this structure was tallest in Scandinavia but i never thought it could be this amazing.",
          "such a lovely site to see...a very unique architecture i have lots of questions in mind. since it is foggy, sometimes we didnt see the whole structure but still manage to have picture with it",
          "We thought Turning Torso is an architectural masterpiece but it made a disappointment. The building is located in the middle of nowhere out of the town, surrounded with really weird people. Be careful what time you are walking along these streets as they might be unsecure.",
          "It is really amazing how such structure was built and stabilize... Simply made but an awesome display of craftmanship...",
          "Interesting building, unique and very tall. Good landmark, pity you cannot go up to see the view. Not a lot else to say.",
          "We were going to walk to see this after a visit to the castle but it didn't look that impressive from afar so it seemed a pointless walk",
          "It may be an architectural wonder but I was not impressed when I visited. The building was located on a nondescript road in Malmo. There was nothing around it to enhance the visit. No information, no viewing from inside.",

          "This building in the town of Malmoe, Sweden is just amazing. This site is just 20 minutes by train from Copenhagen. This building consists mainly of condos and offices. Unfortunately you can not enter the building but the view from outside is just amazing.",

          "Turning torso is Malm\u00f6s tallest building and is located at v\u00e4stra hamnen. It is a nice and modern neighbourhood where you can enjoy the view of this twisted wonder as you grab a coffee.",
          "Like the Oresund Bridge, this is another prime example of modern Swedish engineering. Not only must it be difficult to design, but also it must be difficult to construct. I looked closely at the exterior panels that connect to clad the building. Where does the architect go to",
          "One more high building.nothing more.its private,so we couldnt go inside and get in a high floor,se we just saw it from outside..",
          "The Turning Torso is a well pictures building that signifies Malmo\u2019s redeveloped area. It is a great building to go and look at, but sadly it is a private block, so visitors hoping to be able to go to the top to get views will be disappointed. Definitely worth visiting to look",
          "I enjoyed walking around the building; was a bit upset that we were not able to get inside for the view - check in advance if it is opened for general public before the visit",
          "This building is west of Malmo harbour along the waterfront promenade. The building is a tall skyscraper with the design turning and twisting as it goes up. Surprisingly, this is the tallest skyscraper in Scandinavia. Built in 2005, it is 190 metres high with 54 floors. This",

          "Fascinating building - from close up or a distance. Yes, you can't go in but just standing below it and catching various angles is mesmerising. Blue sky helped but you just keep seeing it from everywhere - the roof terrace of our hotel, as you walk along the water, from the",
          "AS per other reviews it is only open to visitors at certain times of the year. We happened to go on a nice bright sunny September Sunday - so was pleasant enough. Lots of road works in the area which confused the sat nav so you might have to rely on instinct as you get closer.",
          "Amazing bulidning that rises like a \u201cscrew\u201d into the sky. The area is also interesting in general for its architecture, not only Turning Torso!",
          "Nice walk to the outskirts, also a great place to get to by bike. The whole walk from town is along the water. Took some snaps of the building and then went to the massive superstore nearby to stock up on snacks and treats. The Maxi is huge and has a wide range of just about",
          "The only thing to see it nicely is from a distance. Is indeed a beautiful twisted tower surrounded with modern buildings",
          "The picture says it all. Did not expect this incredible structure in this small town. Amazing ! We walked from the train station down via the HSB turning torso, to the water. Great landmark !",
          "Recommend to view from a distance only as you cannot go up the tower. It's a residential area so not worth the walk from city centre.",
          "impressive structure with intriguing shape .We did not go in , but went around and saw it from different angles.",
          "This is a fantastic piece of architecture. I walked around and got a good view of it, and I also walked right past it. I don\u2019t believe you can enter it unless you have a purpose to be in there.",

          "While impressive, without a guide to explain the tower and surrounding buildings this is not worth coming close to see. We did go as part of a tour and it was quite interesting to find out the history about why it was built and likewise why the the structures nearby built by",
          "The turning torso dominates the Malmo skyline, it's quite striking. I think most people will visit when in Malmo. It's down in the new section of the town near the best place to get veiws of the bridge. We didn't do the tour as it was quite expensive.",
          "Boring! Really boring building and surroundings! Genuine disappointed - go see something else in the city.",
          "We were happy to have seen the Turning Torso but it wasn't a huge highlight. If you're in Malmo, do go see it, but don't go out of your way if Malmo isn't on your itinerary. A neat building. Not sure how it will age.",

It is unfortunate, yet understandable as it\u2019s residential, you can\u2019t go inside; however, there is an interesting information board outside. Be sure to wonder around he residential area near",

          "One of those buildings u can see but there\u2019s nothing special. It\u2019s kind a simple tower in the middle of the town. Don\u2019t waste your time with this one.",
          "Just took a little stroll to it after visiting Malmo castle and before heading back to the station. Didn\u2019t even try to go in, not sure if you can? Stands out on the skyline. Sure it would be interesting to architecture students. You can see if from all over Malmo. Did look more",
          "You'd be hard pressed to even miss this piece of architecture whilst going around Malmo. Since we were cycling, we headed over to the waterfront for a closer look. Sure enough, it was an interesting piece of architecture. But, it was neither very special nor extraordinary.",

          "Having spoken to a few locals, the consensus seemed to be that this building is actually more of a blight than a feature of the Malmo skyscape. I would have to agree. It's not really that interesting visually or architecturally. It comes of as more of a tacky gimmick than",
          "I recently visited the Turning Torso tower on my recent visit to Malmo. It's a strange building that you can see from lots of vantage points including while you're crossing the Oresund Bridge into Malmo. The Tower was designed by, I believe, a Spanish architect and houses",

          "Turning Torso building can be observed from the Malmo's train station, but it is worth a 25 minutes walk to get to it up and close. First building of its kind, looks very impressive. We didn't try to get in, just looking from outside is interesting enough.",

          "The turning torso is a stunning tower in Malmo. We couldn't go up, but even from down is really astonishing",
          "Though only seen from a distance, this building is pretty amazing. It has a central core which presumably allows the rest of the building something to 'cling' to as it spirals clockwise. Though most of the architecture in Malm\u00f6 is pretty ordinary, the are a few buildings like",
          "The gem of Malmo - amazing apartment complex Turning Torso - so light yet so strong. The Spanish architect was inspired by lines of turning human Torso witch is absolutely visible in this building. Try to get up and enjoy the view !",

          "It's a city icon. This tower is very big and you can see it in severla parts of the city. The funny about it, it's that it seems that it is a bit wry.",
          "It's right across town, but Malmo is small so it's worth going to see. It's just a skyscraper, but it's pretty and the area around it is gorgeous. Lovely to see the new eco friendly zone, with its cohousing and beautiful architecture. Also it's right on the sea and accessible by",
          "What an unusual building but better to take a shot from a distance away. I am not sure that it is worth the trip to get real close to this building.",
          "This architectural miracle and human being engineering at its best, is the tallest residential building in the Nordic countries. It is a neo-futurist residential skyscraper, designed by Spanish architector, structural engineer, sculptor and painter, Santiago Calatrava. That",
          "I would certainly recommend an excursion to see the Turning Torso building and to marvel at this amazing feat of design and engineering. You can also appreciate a decent view of the Oresund bridge from the lovely promenade on the sea front. You get the no 2 bus from the central",
          "Definitely a must see for fans of unique architecture. Close to a park, organic grocery store and the seashore",
          "This symbol of Malm\u00f6 definitely worth to visit. My wife and I even took one of our wedding photo shoots with this in the background. But, apart from taking pics, there was nothing else to do.",
          "Well you have probably seen an even taller building than Malmo's Turning Torso. But never designed by this Catalan architect. It is beautiful and it will make your torso turn of pure joy. It is located in the new part of the city on old shipyard grounds. Easy access from central",
          "This building can be seen from a long way a way. I think almost from Copenhagen. Driving around it give you a strange feeling, you wonder how you would stand straight inside, maybe next time I will see if I can do that. I think looking at it it give one a kind of queasy",
          "Took a day trip to Malmo from Copenhagen. Our tour guide took us by this building. It's very cool and unique in its architecture.",
          "View is stunning and the area around it is great for running and biking and other outdoors activities",
          "Crossed the Oresund bridge between Sweden and Denmark and enjoyed the sights. The Torso was a 190 metre high apartment block designed by Santiago Calatravas. Malmo is a modern city as well as historical. Malmo's Little Square is a good place to relax",
          "I love it when we encounter unique interesting unexpected things in our travels. For the next two nights we're staying at a small town in Southern Sweden for some downtime before heading to Copenhagen. We didn't expect to see or do anything spectacular here but low and behold",
          "The building is very extreme, a unique spot. It is visible from most parts of Malm\u00f6. Pity you can't get to the top but both the building and its surroundings are worth a visit.",
          "You can see the Turning Torso from the sea, from the air and from parts of Malmo. The architecture of it very interesting.",
          "a different building worth seeing especially from a distance. It looks strange and rather unsuitable to the area but definitely outstanding.",
          "Beautiful and very light building it seems to be looking back at the surrounding world and, spinning, tries to reach sky-high heights. It is good visible from all sides. Now the city is proud of it. And the guests will never know what efforts it cost the author of the idea the",
          "I don't normally like modern architecture but this building is very cool. It twists like a corkscrew. Art gallery on the first floor. Pretty cool.",
          "This building is a true gem!I really liked visiting :) It is breathtaking from the outside, I highly recommend paying a visit!",
          "Just be the must see for Malm\u00f6. It's not tourist place but still many people visit. 54 floors with office and apartment",
          "It is an interesting design, but I was left wondering why it is the only high rise in the neighborhood? How was it ever built here? Locals are obviously proud of the structure. The architect is Santiago Calatrava from Spain. It is an interesting neighborhood to visit to walk",
          "What should I say, I love that tower, because it's special. But honesty, nothing more. It seems like you can see the Torso from everywhere in Malm\u00f6. But you can't do something special with it. Of course, you can go to that place. But nothing else. There's no possibility to get",
          "It is the biggest buildingnot just in whole Sweded but in Scandinavia as well with 55 floors. If there are many clouds in the sky then you can't even see the top. However you can just take a few pictures from the ground. Don't expect to go inside in the top floor for a coffee or",
          "This architecturally interesting building is an apartment. The folks who live here likely pay a pretty high rent, and probably don't want tourists trying to use their elevator all the time. The man at the reception was kind, but clearly sick of it. Check this building out from",
          "Tip #1: If you arrive in Malmo from CPH, your train ticket will allow you to take bus number 2 ( direction Mot Vastra Hamnen) to Turning Torso stop (4 stops from Malmo Central Station). In my experience, The trip took about 10 minutes. Once you get off, you will see this awesome",
          "This tower has a quite unique architecture that worth a visit. The neighbourhood and the sea front next to it are also nice to see. On the downsides: it's not possible to get in the tower (private apartments) or on top of it, and it's a bit outside of the city center.",
          "Many cities are building unusual or unique buildings and this is one of Malmo's. Is it erect and just a bit spiral or what - I couldn't decide definitively so there's a bit of intrigue too - but I guess it's erect and just the illusion? Worth a look and there's a small park",
          "So that's the reason I have it 5 points/stars. To be fair I don't even know what's inside of it, offices? Apartments? Hogwarts? Could be, for all I know. I'm just really fascinated by the colour of it. That's obviously a joke since it's the amount windows that's really",
          "A worth visiting as soon as you get to Malmo City, very impressive building, unfortunately it is not allowed to enter inside, I would like to take some pictures, I think the view should be amazing but, I got a nice ones anyway!!!",
          "We took a 30 min train ride from Copenhagen to reach Sweden and we went down in Malmo. This building is one of the nearer attraction from the train station. Nothing much to see, just the odd shape.",
          "There are lots of impressive buildings across the planet, but this one is something worth seeing in person. I took a day trip from Copenhagen to check out Malmo. The return train fare is $27 USD $35 USD in First. (less people)....last minute purchase. Upon arrival at Malmo",
          "Really enjoyed getting to see the building. Unfortunately, only from the outside in the morning. It is interesting how it is in a residential area and towers over everything else in the region. Wish I would have been able to get up to the sky bar.",
          "One of the tallest buildings in the area, and deffinetly a building wearth a visit. But be aware, You will not be able to visit the inside, since a vast part of it consists of private apartments with residents. Nice surroundings and a couple of nice caf\u00e9s in the neighbourhood.",

          "The tower is worth visiting, since it is located in modern part of Malmo, which is still under construction. The modern part is very nice, clean, amazing for a walk, which you can connect with the walk to the seaside and with the view on the Oresund bridge.",
          "If you have any interest in design or architecture, then wander down and have a look at this building. OK you can't go inside but you can appreciate the creativity and ingenuity....plus you have a view of the magnificent Oresund Bridge.",
          "Despite some of the things I've heard about Malm\u00f6, this town was the complete opposite. Calm and quiet. Everyone that we've met was very nice and helpful",
          "This building is remarkable! You can see the building all over the the town. It's spectacular to get close. It's huge! Wow! It's located in a very nice neighborhood by the water close to the water.",
          "I saw it since I was crossing the Oresund bridge. Its a unique and nice design, located in a nice area. I really dont know what I expected and was like ok, Im here, take some photos and move on but walk down to the seaside to watch the bridge, its truely amazing.",
          "Yes, you have to see it, it's the city's main attraction, etc. But unless you are interested in architecture, you will be just seeing a building. No fuss.",
          "Difficult to imagine what attracts people to a building. Up close it's boring, and afar it is interesting but towers above everything else around it. Like some insecure person seeking attention.",
          "It takes a while to walk from central Malm\u00f6 to the Turning Torso but it is worth going to stand in what feels like the end of the world. In winter it is particularly bracing at the plane where the Baltic and North Sea meet. There is a brace park and marina with houseboats. You",
          "Cool, seen from a great distance, twisted, belongs to the group of attractions in Malmo worth seeing.",

          "Turning Torso may just be a building, which you can't enter. But seeing it from a distance (the beach for example) it makes a cool silhouette to Malm\u00f6s skyline. Once you get close it's impressive high and the whole area in the west harbor is worth a visit!",
          "This is a little off the beaten path but easily viewable on a clear day. It is a nice piece of architecture, but that's about it.",
          "Turning Torso is located in Malmos architectural \"Bo01\" area, also called V\u00e4stra Hamnen, which means West Harbour. The area is beautiful sometime as it is situated just by the ocean. The atmosphere and style is a must for those who like city and house architects. A perfect place",

          "One of the most spectacular skyscrapers in Europe! The twist is 90 degrees from top to bottom and you really feel a little weird in your head while staring up. The building is nicely located in a rarely new developed area next to the water. It's a great walk from the city",
          "Can't quite give it an excellent even though the architecture is pretty unique and very cool. Ultimately after a pretty long walk I can across this, took some pictures and then moved on. Can't quite think of much more to say \ud83d\ude00",

          "Went for a day out to Malm\u00f6 from Copenhagen for my birthday. It was an easy train ride and within 1/2 hour we were there to see and visit the Turning Torso - the tallest skyscrapper of Scandinavia. We walked and walked until we got close enough for pictures. It is oddly located",
          "The actual construction of this building is pretty impressive, both from a further distance and up close. However, it didn't fit in with the buildings around it and was a bit out of the way to a lot of other tourist sights. A good photo opportunity.",

          "You don't have to approach very closely - this outstanding building is visible from many points on the Malmo's North. And of course, it's worth to see Swedish tallest skyscraper. Brilliant!",

          "Definitely is something unique, he tallest building in scandinavia and was the winner of the 10 Year Award from the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. Beside that building stands out where is located, to me is not that relevant itself.",
          "We walked from the Central Station in Malm\u00f6 down to the Turning Torso, and saw beautiful parts of the city you wouldn't ordinarily see. The building itself is lovely to look at, but there is no way to enter the tower, you can only observe from a ground level. Close to it is the",
          "There is nothing very special about this buidling. It a quite unique looking but there is nothing more to it. You cant enter the building or go to the top unless you know someone that lives there. So if you do go to see it, i recommend that you budget about 10minutes.",
          "Visited on a day trip from Copenhagen, it's stands out compared to other buildings in area, but nothing special",
          "You get right next to the building. I'd recommend walking / driving south from it to the shoreline and along the new housing complexes. Some lovely apartments with a good view towards the \u00d6rebro bridge.",
          "An amazing building nothing like i've ever seen. It contorts its way up from the ground and seems to defy gravity. Very iconic and definately worth seeing just for its novelty value",
          "Highest building in Malmo fortunately one of my friend lives there and I visited his house. Amazing architecture from outside. basement is filled with old wine and top is having best scenic view",
          "Enjoyed a visit to this fabulous building. An amazing design and a pleasant, reasonably good walk from the town centre. I would recommend eating in the railway station - excellent value.",
          "Nice interesting and unique building. It seems different from different angels. Really seams that the building is turning around :)",
          "I visited Malmo and was disappointed by the Turning Torso. I would describe the tower as mildly interesting however felt that it is over rated. I feel there is significantly more interesting buildings in Lund, less than ten minutes away by train.",
          "You can see this as you approach Malmo as well as when there. It looks tremendous and is an exciting design. Depending on the angle it looks like it is leaning over. You won't miss it if you go to Malmo.",
          "The turning torso is a spectaculare architecturel landmark for Malmoe , but the surrounding area is also very interesting , small channels and brand new colourfull houses in different styles , coastline nearby and a gourmet supermarket right next to the torso (Greens) go and see",
          "Literally outstanding from the low landscape of Malm\u00f6, this architectural miracle always attracts your eyes and camera from every point of the town.",
          "I were there with my work, we had a conference room on the second highest floor. It was the perfect weather and we couldn't start working the first 20 minutes. Were just so amazed about the view over Malm\u00f6 and \u00d6resund. The service was really good aswell as the breakfast and",
          "We visited the Turning Torso on our first day in Malm\u00f6. It was getting dark, but we didn't know how much time we'd have on the other days of the visit, so we walked to its feet from the city center (it was less than 30 minutes). It was really stunning, even that we could see",
          "A turning building which you see from airplane when entering airport Kastrup in Danmark. The inside of the private flats are interesting because every inside wall is curved. This means it is difficult to hang any painitngs or family pictures anywhere.",
          "Sure. .A different kind of building but, still just a building. Situated in an stiff and unpersonal surroinding. You can't get up in the building so you can just look at it from the outside. If you're a tourist save a bit of time and take a picture from the far and spend your",
          "We seen this building during our very short visit to Malmo. Uniquely designed and built. We didn't go near to this building due to lack of time but it was wonderful to see from a distance itself. If your in Malmo dont miss this.",
          "One of the nicest buildings I've seen. Definitely a tourist point for people interested in architecture. Fortunately the surroundings aren't that nice but the coast is really close and you can continue sightseeing.",
          "Interesting building, great meeting space, excellent views. 58 floors. Also has apartments. Staff very attentive. In newer part of town with good bus service to Malm\u00f6 C",
          "if you like modern architecture it's a must see. I didn't go inside (i'm not sure if you can as it's a residential building) but from the Malmo castle I had a stunning view of the turning torso.",
          "So apart from not being able to go inside this building its stunning and surrounded by a beautiful atmosphere it is near the coast and you can look out towards Denmark !! Great for architect lovers",
          "It not special cause you cannot come up on tower. And area arround the tower not to visit. Boring and not special. I expected more",
          "As the one who've lived in the building 2 times;) for few years, I'd say you are welcome to have a look at that from the outside. To get inside - you need to contact HSB since there is no enter to the building for the visitors and guiding tours are rare organized. Overwise",
          "Genuine idea and construction :) See and explore Malmo and Copenhagen in one single turn! Congrats for the idea and finish!",
          "Even if I my window at work is facing this building, I still think it's very nice and unique. I often see tourists taking pictures of it and they seem very happy to at least have seen it. The best day to take a nice selfie here, is of course when the sky is blue and the sun is",
          "It is the tallest building of the area and it looks nice for it's shape, however, it would be great to enjoy the views from it's top but it is a private building.",
          "A must see building if you visit Malm\u00f6. Really impressive building because of the futuristic architecture. Apartments can be rented in the building, not sure if any available at the moment.",
          "I have seen so many photos of the Turning Torso, so when I went to Malm\u00f6 I decided to visit it. I went to the Sk\u00e5netrafiken and asked them how I can take me to the Torso. They told me to take the bus number 2 from the platform D and the Torso has his own bus stop, Turning Torso.",
          "After a 20 minute walk through an industrial estate the place was closed and we couldn't go in or do anything. It wasn't worth the walk and we could see it just as well from the city centre.",
          "When you come to Malmoe you must visit Vastra Hamnen.The home tof he famous Skyscraper Turning Torso.The area is also worldwide known as a arcitectul wonder. People from al over the world travel here just to see the exceptional buildings.Summertime its also a famous bath are for",
          "This is a fabulous building that demands an up close look. I walked here from Central Station and the stroll along the yacht harbour was lovely. Fabulous views from here to the Oresund Sound as well.",
          "Awesome place with breathtaking view on a bridge that connects Sweden and Denmark. Great place for taking photos. It's a must to visit if you're in Malmo!",
          "I'm a huge fan of Santiago Calatrava's work, combining bold architecture with engineering taken to an unimaginable level. This building is another beautiful example of Calatrava contemplation for human forms applied to buildings. The building is magical, giving you an (false)",
          "Is incredible this building. Is a must to see it. Is an Icon in Malm\u00f6. The architect must be unique. I recommend 100% to go there.",
          "This building is so special so you have never seen anything like this one. Near the building is caf\u00e9s and restaurants. If you walk a little bit to the nearplaced beach you have a wonderful view over the bridge to Denmark = \" \u00d6resundsbron\"",
          "I was on a day visit to Copenhagen but couldn't resist making the short trip over to Malmo by train to visit a building which I had learnt so much about at university. The Turning Torso is roughly a 20-30 minute walk from Malmo Central Station but well worth the treck. Looking",
          "I specifically went to photograph the Turning Torso just after sunset as it's such an interesting building. It was well worth the journey. Absolutely loved photographing in the area as we approached the tower. Really happy with the photos too!",
          "One of the must see when you visit Malm\u00f6. Personally I think it is architecturally interesting to see the building twist but that's pretty much it.",
          "Turning Torso it is the tallest building in Malmo and Sweden . It has 190m and 54 floors, it is built of 9 blocks stacked and rotated 90 degrees",
          "this twisted torso building designed by a Spaniard is seen clearly from afar. I was cycling and stopped to see the HSB torso Tower. Strange and unique",
          "Work of the marvellous Calatrava, you can admire the tower far in the distance from almost every place in the city. It is very suggestive when sourrounded by the clouds, it seems like it's going to move from one moment to an other.",
          "very good architecture. very unique. Its worth visiting the wonderful turning torso of malmo. It's of the main attraction of Malmo city",
          "One of the newest structures in Malmo, the tower is one of the most interesting spot in the city, although it's outside the main city centre. If you like modern structures, this is worth the side trip to see.",
          "Some people say it's not worth going to where this tower is. I think it's an amazing part of the city of Malmo that people who are really interested in knowing the city needs to visit. Everything is basically new. The architecture of the whole area and the way the city has been",
          "It probably would've been nice if we were in the bike tour; but we foolishly decided to walk here. There is a unique here, and nothing else.",
          "It looks great from afar but when you come up closer its dirty. Nothing special to do there. Only apartments around. You have to go the sea to get to some cafes. It gets super windy and cold.",
          "It's ok to see from far and the beach near the Turning Torso has a very nice view of the Oresund bridge.",
          "Interesting architecture that's visible for miles. Walk the ten minutes to it and after you are rewarded with a beach walk that offers great Oresund bridge views.",
          "The building is beautiful and exciting to see. However, it is located near the industrial side of Malmo, making it a little difficult to get to on foot. Also, you cannot go inside the building.",
          "Turning torso itself is absolutely not worth the trip out to the harbour. I have never tried, but i am pretty sure you cant even get in there, unless you work or live in the building, and even if you can get in, it is not a tourist attraction, just a recidential and office",
          "The architecture of this building is like something i've never seen before, try standing below it and look up, it looks like its almost tipping over. The only bad thing is that you can't go to the top to enjoy the view of Malm\u00f6, \u00d8resund and Copenhagen. That would have been",
          "In this modern area , along the sea with a breath-taking view of the bridge , rises up a incredible building.",
          "Got to visit the 38th floor to see the city by night. It is quite a remarkable spectacle on the skyline of Malmo.",
          "This building stand out of all in Malmo and can be seen near and far. Quite a famous landmark in Malmo Unfortunately you cannot go in and it is a residential building and offices. But a lovely sight to look at and it is very close to the beach and caf\u00e9. We rode our hired bike",
          "An architectural marvel! Watching the turning building was an exceptional experience, the building has an eye for detail, and by eye I literally mean an Eye. The view from the building to the bridge and tunnel that connects the Nordic countries is amazing",
          "Not the nicest looking building, but very impressive design. The grounds around the building really focus the attention on the clean lines. The view from the marina is very attractive.",
          "The highest building in Sweden designed by renowned Santiago Calatrava of Spain (bridge in Jerusalem, Olympic Stadium in Athens, buildings in Valencia and all over the world). Intriguing handles on the entrance door :) The view from 42 floor - spectacular (if no fog!).",
          "As one of the tallest buildings in Sweden, you can't miss the 'Turning Torso'. Perhaps a hit with architectural enthusiasts, it can be enjoyed from a distance and seems to be a local attraction in itself. Nothing spectacular though.",
          "This is a really important structure and I was eager to see it. But the surprise for me was the fascinating residential neighborhood surrounding the building and the nearby waterfront. What amazing homes. Love the examples of modern Swedish design. Well worth the two hours we",
          "Took a walk from the Rail Station in Malmo down to the Turning Torso building and it is really quite spectacular. I enjoyed the walk to the area, as it was near some new residential sustainable developments, but this is all overshadowed by the Torso which is unlike any other",
          "The building is really cool. It's something you never see normally. The architecture is very impressive, but it's closed off to visitors. It's a little sad you can't go inside. It also seems pretty vacant, so it would be nice if they did something with it like put in a museum or",
          "Even if the building itself is nothing superb, it\u00b4s located in a new residential are close to the sea, with beautiful promenades, bridges over channels, and houses. A pleasant place to do a walk.",
          "Chose to take the walk from the bridge and towards the Turning Torso. It is quite cool to see it far away and when you come closer and closer the building grows larger and larger. It is definitely a cool building and worth seeing. Unfortunately you cannot go to the top of it....",
          "At first glance you are impressed with this building but as you can't go in and the area around it is currently under construction, so there isn't much else to do. Don't go out of your way to see it, but if in passing, have a look.",
          "Turning Torso is the tallest building in the Nordic countries. Located in Malm\u00f6, Sweden on the Swedish side of the \u00d6resund strait.It was designed by the famous Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava based on a sculpture. I wanted so much to see that building, it\u00b4s simply great...",
          "the design is interesting but seems so only because there are no other modern buildings in Malmo. Maybe that's why it stands out. The surrounding area around the building is a very quiet, residential area and there is no hustle bustle that is usually a part of any tourist",
          "It certainly is worth riding by and looking at. There isn't much to see though because you can't go inside.",
          "From a distance this building was interesting enough but a walk in the park surrounding it to get closer was better. It was fascinating to look at and try to figure out how it looked the way it did and still have livable components.",
          "Being a residential building, the Calatrava's architectural work cannot be visited! I wonder if is possible to make a roof restaurant in order to give the chance for visitors to admire the landscape. Anyway, the Turning Torso Tower is tremendous and the surrouding area is",
          "Been here december 2014, the design of building is amazing, but only as a apartment. But its nice to be a modern building in a small town.",
          "I visited Turning Torso for the purpose of meeting potential collegues. The personell helped me find my way there and the view was simply remarkable! The corridores have sci-fi vibe to them but the appartements are very pretty.",
          "Thank you Fredrik Pahlett for showing me and my brother this unique building! We really liked the surrounded area and driving along the coast. Sweden is beautiful!",
          "Wow! Needless to say I love this building. The design is obviously extremely rare and interesting. Stading below it gives you a small sense how high and special it is. In combination with Malm\u00f6 being flat as a city and Turning Torso being high and one of a kind, you can see it",
          "..now ive been here and saw it, whats up next? Stood beside the building and looked at it, then went south along the coast to a open green area and looked at it. 20min of my life, just gone with the wind.",
          "We used this as a guide on where to walk, as it's the tallest building in Scandinavia it's pretty hard to miss! The area around looks like it's under construction but there's a few parks dotted around.",
          "The turning torso is an architectural marvel. It has a twisted shape. You can see it from outside but you can't visit it from inside as the building is owned by a private company.",
          "Calatrava made a fantastic architectural work. The civil enginneers who built it up did it as well. Now the torso is very well known in whole world and all people know Malmo as the home of a fantastic work of art.",
          "We walked to turning torso from our hotel near the little square. The area surrounding the tower is under a lot of construction, so it's a bit hard to get a good photo. It is interesting to see from different angles so ,ale sure to walk around it a bit.",
          "It\u2019s a tower with an interesting architecture. It\u2019s worth to go close to it for the surroundings as it\u2019s close to the sea where you can have a nice view of the Oresund bridge. Unfortunately I couldn\u2019t go up the tower as the tours were only allowed on certain days. Also the sign",
          "We called on at the turning torso on a day trip to Malmo and guided talks were being offered to the top. The concierge kindly squoze us in as we had not booked. Unfortunately the hour long talk about the tower was only in Swedish with no subtitles. A bit of a waste if time for",
          "We came here after being in Dubai for a few days and the Turning Torso seemed very ordinary after the spectacular buildings in Dubai.",
          "Most probably those who commented on Tripadvisor doesn't know, that one of the greatest architects our days, the Spanish Satiago Calatrava designed this building. Spectacular, and Malm\u00f6 is very proud to have such a modern building in the city. Even if you are not for modern",
          "nice to see from a distance. not worth the trek to it though, its in a newly built area of housing and nothing around it really to see. you cant go in as its flats, but it was amazing.",
          "We didn't go into the building as I don't think they were taking people through on the day we were in town (also the sign wasn't in english so we couldn't work out how to arrange this). It is a spectacular building to go and visit anyway. There are nearby coffee shops and",
          "The HSB Turning Torso, which is a remarkably unique building architecturally, is a commercial office building and rental apartments that was completed on August 27, 2005. The Turning Torso reaches 623 feet high into the air. Its' top floor, floor 54, is at 586.58 feet high.",
          "Turning Torso in a residential building, unfortunately tourists are not able to enter the building. We passed the creek and walked to the water front where cool apartments are around. Of course You can also take a look from the distance away. That is all about.",
          "A marvellous piece of modern architectural design that can be viewed from many location around the area. Not open to public as residential.",
          "The building is visually quite cool, but it's an office building. So I wouldn't say it's a very 'touristy' attraction...",
          "We couldn't go up on the top. The turning Torso is from far is good building as well. It is not worth walking there",
          "So its curved, high and designed. Can\u00b4t really say whats the big deal. And yo can\u00b4t even go up to the top.",
          "Gorgeous to see from the bottom and I need to book to go up to the top! A great addition to the Malm\u00f6 skyline",
          "I liked the design of the tower. It is very different from other buildings. The tower is seen from all over the city",
          "The area is an interesting architectural and social attempt. I liked the design of the tower. A cafe on the top would be very popular!",
          "I walked around here to see different arciteture, and enjoy this pretty neighbourghhood. Caf\u00e9es along the coast. I would like to come here again for a relaxing walk with friends and/or family.",
          "Worth going to get a view - just, but it doesn't turn and it doesn't look like a torso. Yes, it's relatively interesting architecturally and you get a good view of the sea and the Oresund bridge nearby, but you can't go up it and it's quite a walk from town.",
          "\"Turning Torso\" - a twisting building by the water is a big deal for Malm\u00f6 and it has become a landmark. Standing alone and towering above the new housing estate that surrounds it, it is not really worth the trek. No access to the higher floors is a shame as tourists would have",
          "Interesting architecture and great to see it from the distance. But visitors are not allow in to see the view from above.",
          "It is often cited as a top attraction in the city of Malm\u00f6, but I am not quite so sure why. It is a landmark, no doubt about that; visible from many parts of the city, and indeed the outer limits of Copenhagen. But beyond that it does not really do much other than house people",
          "Apparently, this is Europe's second-tallest residential building with apartments renting for up to \u20ac3,500/month -- it certainly dominates the city's skyline. Its very distinctive shape gives the appearance of a 90\u00b0 twist between top and bottom. Worth a look and walk around if",
          "Really unusual. Worth a visit to see the different architecture. Very different. Lovely modern development area. Nice bars on the waterfront.",
          "From the photos it looks like it's turning but not when you see it up close. The building is different and unique in a way.",
          "It is a residential building with a look like it is turned. It is not too impressive as other icon buildings from around the world/ For Malmo there are other buildings that can be considered icons.",
          "It is difficult to understand why such as tower has been built in a city where space is not really an issue. We took a taxi to drive around the city. We passed in front of the HSBC tower. Its shape is interesting.",
          "Our first view of this building was from the train journey across the bridge from Denmark, and it is eye-catching. However, when we went for a walk in the district around this tower block it seemed less impressive. This may be because there is an awful lot of construction going",
          "The Turning Torso is nice to get a view of and the architecture is impressive, but apart from that there's not much to it. You can't go inside or get to the top because the building is full of residential apartments. Come to the west harbor on a warm day, see the Torso, have a",
          "I was just astonished at this amazing structure, even make so when I realised it was residential and not a bank or an office block investment. Amazing and a real miracle how it seems to defy the laws of physics!",
          "I dislike this building as whole Vesterhamn. It is crazy place with number so caled modern, but in reality crazy and ugly buildings. It doesn't worth to visit.",
          "There's not much to say about Turning Torso. There's not much to see either except for its futuristic appearance on the outside. It's definitely worth a visit but being close to the sea, I wouldn't recommend doing it on a rainy/windy day. I would recommend though when seeing",
          "The turning torso is located near the sea in a beautiful location, and on the way you pass through several beautiful parks. It's worth visiting for the walk alone.",

          "It is a different sort of building that you may view from the outside only. We caught the bus from Malmo station as we wanted to see it but more importantly, our real quest was to view \"The Bridge\". After sighting the building, we then walked back as near as possible to the",
          "The building certainly is unusual in its design but it is stuck right in the middle of a building site surrounded by cranes & is quite a walk from Lilla Torg.",

          "This dominates the skyline near the castle. It's a slightly twisting skscraper. I think there are nicer things to see in Malmo. It isn't worth walking to as you can see it from lots of places.",
          "It is a beautiful and high (the highest I think in Malmo) building. Only this doesn't deserve a visit but the surrounding area is really beautiful. You have sea view and you can also see the very impressive Oresund Bridge. If the weather is rainy, I don't highly recommend a",
          "The Turning Torso itself is nice, but it's even better to take a stroll through the neighbourhood and along the seashore.",
          "There's a nice stretch of apartments surrounding Turning Torso, including a small park and access to the water front / beach area. The apartments are interesting, architecturally, and showcase a diversity of housing designs. They're new and innovative and have, I believe, young",
          "Calatrava made an outstanding object in a great area with lots of improving surroundings - the twist of the Tower is spectacular",
          "Although it's a long and windy walk from the hotel in the city centre. This is totally worth looking at as the structure is very special. The view at sunset is spectacular and it's photo worthy!",
          "We had a lovely walk from the train station and it is definitely a great piece of architecture. The sea front was such a good place to see the bridge and plenty of cafes to enjoy too.",
          "It is a really exciting and beautiful building. And the surroundings is too. That is the best thing and worst. If you are not at all interested in architecture, then the torso is not much to experience.",
          "This building is private housing so you don't get to go in. We were interested in seeing how it met the ground, so we took a walk. I expected a really big bottom - not at all. There is a very open park across the street for photo ops. If you are not very interested in modern",
          "A refreshing piece of design, this is a skyscraper that appears to be like a body twisting and convoluting on its own longitudinal axis. It contains offices and a hotel.",
          "You can't enter the building, but it is an amazing piece of architecture to view from outside and this is iconic of Malmo. The trip is made all the more worthwhile by the Green/organic supermarket next door which has a cafe with fab food (cheese cake especially good).",

          "No wonder that the mind behind the Turning Torso is the Spanish archistar Santiago Calatrava's. Its design is very original: a 190 metres tall skyscraper, twisting 90 degrees from top to bottom. If you are in Malm\u00f6, it would be difficult to miss this futuristic building but I",

          "This is certainly an interesting looking building from an architectural point of view. It is a head turner but don't expect to get in because it's part residential so you'll need a code to enter the building. Snap a few pictures from afar and walk on. Some constructions are",
          "To get there from the central train station you will pass through the industrial part of the city as well as the the harbour. Some people may find it sketchy and not interresting, but i kind of loved it. We discovered plenty of cool playgrounds around the tower. Let me tell you,",

          "It's a residential building, so one can only look from the outside. We walked out there from our hotel. kicked it at the skateboard park watch kids skate for a bit before continuing on to the Turning Torso. Took quite a few pictures from different distance. It's definitely",

          "Not much to say about this - it's a cool tower from an architectural standpoint. However you can't go in it or up to the top for a view. Worth a look if you're in the area but don't go specifically to see it.",
          "Although you can't visit the Turning Torso, or enjoy the view from the top, it is still a treat to see Santiago Calatrava's creation from close bye. Impressive as it is, you'll feel very small and a bit dizzy looking up from the foot. Modern architecture at its best!.",
          "...so if you're in harbour's area you should go a few steps closer. Nice architecture but still a pity that there's no viewing platform: it's a 100% private house. There are better solutions for vistors in other cities having such extraordinary buildings.",

          "I cycled out to see the Turning Torso, which was a great journey but when it comes down to it, it's just a cool tower! You can actually get great views of it from Slottsparen and Pildammarna (the two parks in town) so unless you have a bike, don't bother walking all the way out",
          "The Turning Torso is amazing to look at. The artitecture is fantastic and every time I go to The Tower, I something new to look at! The area in V\u00e4stra Hamnen is also worth paying a visit.",
          "This is certainly the only significant attraction in Malm\u00f6. The architecture of the Tower is really impressive. but after spending 10 minutes at ist foot, quick back in the car and drive away. The district is really not worth spending too much time. When visiting Copenhague,",
          "If you have even a passing interest in architecture, this is a must-see in the city. I must have taken a hundred shots of it from all angles... a truly stunning building. It also helps that it has a delightful collection of modern apartments in a range of styles close by, set",
          "This is definitely worth a visit if you are interested in architecture, design or the Malm\u00f6 Murder novels of Torquil McLeod.

          "Friends in gothenburg suggested we pop down as we were in Malmo for the day. It's a decent trot from city centre along the harbour and then through mostly industrial and business parks with a fair bit of regeneration construction at the time. You get a pretty good view of the",

          "The Turning Torso is impressive to see, especially in good weather (we have been there when it is foggy, and you can't see the top!); however, you can't access it, as it is mostly residential apartments. It would definitely be worth making a specific visit if there was a",

          "If I consider the Turning Torso as a piece of architecture, it is marvellous and well worth seeing. If I think of it as a tourist attraction, it doesn't have much to offer. Do I go there? Yes. Often: No. It is a residential building which doesn't give tourists access. There is",

          "Worth a visit as its different, more of a site to see, best viewed from the skate park as you get a good view of the whole tower, the skate park is also good if you have children in tow, next to the tower is Green Matmarknad, a green food market also worth a visit, then walk",
          "Very interesting building with a unique design that is worth looking at from different angles. Worth visiting up close if you have time but don't go out of your way to see it as it is located in a modern residential area with not much else around, although it is next to a park",

          "A unique and beautiful place. Don't forget to take the time and venture into the neighbourhood. Sure it is beautiful by the ocean but there is a lot to discover walking further into the West Harbour. Somewhat weather dependent ofcourse but worth a visit even on a rainy day. The",
          "We had a few hours to kill in Malmoe before getting our train so we walked all the way from the central station to this building (about 2km) - a bit more if you want to go through Kungsparken. The architecture is really weird from afar and and even more when you're close. If",

          "Yes, it's a fabulous building and we saw it on a gloriously blue skied day so the photos will be great, but\u2026. You can't go inside and see amazing views, so not totally sure why it's on the must do list. You can see it from all over town, so don't necessarily have to be up close",

          "Pop into the tourist information centre to pick up a map and make your way towards the Turning Torso. The walk is an experience in itself as the area is undergoing extensive regeneration. You are not allowed inside because it is a residential building but don't let that put you",
          "This is certainly one of the most impressive building we have seen! We have seen it from the air when flying into Copenhagen and from very near and close when visiting Malmo. It is an amazing piece of architecture, worthwhile to take a trip just to see it. The twisting of the",

        "wiki": "Jumbo Jet is a steel roller coaster located at Chelyuskintsev Park in Minsk, Belarus. It originally operated from 1972 to 1978 at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio. The roller coaster is a prefabricated model that features an electric spiral lift mechanism, and it was one of the earliest known coasters to use this lift mechanism.\n\n\n== Ride layout ==\nThe Jumbo Jet, like all electric spiral lift roller coasters, reached the top of its lift hill by way of a gently-graded spiraling helix, before beginning its first drop. Unlike many roller coasters, which use a traditional chain lift, the Jumbo Jet was propelled with small wheel motors up the incline of the helix. These sort of coasters soon became a very common type of steel roller coaster in the 1970s, and were distinguished from later steel roller coaster designs that were characterized by their thicker, tubular-steel tracks. After climbing the 56-foot-tall (17 m) spiral lift, riders plunge into a series of tight turns using a figure-eight pattern and ending with a double-helix. When it debuted, Jumbo Jet was billed as the fastest of its kind and was known for its views of Lake Erie and steeply banked turns (some at up to 70 degrees).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nJumbo Jet was manufactured by notable roller coaster designer Anton Schwarzkopf, and was the first of the Jet Star 3 model in the Jumbo Jet line. The coaster was located in the same beachfront location where a wooden roller coaster called Cyclone once stood before. It was also the location that housed the now-defunct Disaster Transport, an indoor roller coaster, as well as the location where GateKeeper stands presently. While at Cedar Point, Jumbo Jet carried between 1.6 and 1.8 million passengers every year. Jumbo Jet was eventually replaced in 1979 by the new WildCat coaster. Although Jumbo Jet was only at Cedar Point for a short time, the roller coaster subsequently moved to a number of different amusement parks, including Palace Playland in Maine, Malm\u00f6 Folkets Park in Sweden, Beoland in Russia, Dreamland in Belarus, and its present location of Chelyuskintsev Park also located in Belarus.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Lost Coaster, a blog devoted to discovering the ultimate fate of Jumbo Jet\nYouTube video of a Jumbo Jet recreation using the No Limits program",

The bridge runs nearly 8 kilometres (5 miles) from the Swedish coast to the artificial island Peberholm in the middle of the strait. The crossing is completed by the 4-kilometre (2.5 mi) Drogden Tunnel from Peberholm to the Danish island of Amager.\nThe \u00d6resund Bridge was the longest combined road and rail bridge in Europe in 2000\u20132019 and connects two major metropolitan areas: Copenhagen, the Danish capital city, and the Swedish city of Malm\u00f6. It connects the road and rail networks of the Scandinavian Peninsula with those of Central and Western Europe. A data cable also makes the bridge the backbone of internet data transmission between central Europe and Sweden (and, prior to 2016 also Finland).The international European route E20 crosses via road, the \u00d8resund Line via railway. The construction of the Great Belt Fixed Link (1988-1998), connecting Zealand to Funen and thence to the Jutland Peninsula, and the \u00d6resund Bridge have connected Central and Western Europe to Scandinavia by road and rail.\nThe \u00d6resund Bridge was designed by the Danish engineering firm COWI. The justification for the additional expenditure and complexity related to digging a tunnel for part of the way, rather than raising that section of the bridge, was to avoid interfering with air traffic from the nearby Copenhagen Airport, to provide a clear channel for ships in good weather or bad, and to prevent ice floes from blocking the strait.\nThe \u00d6resund Bridge crosses the border between Denmark and Sweden. Although the Schengen Agreement and the Nordic Passport Union should mean no routine passport inspections, since January 2016, identity and visa checks have been imposed by Sweden on travellers from Denmark due to the European migrant crisis.Construction began in 1995, with the bridge opening to traffic on 1 July 2000. The \u00d6resund Bridge received the 2002 IABSE Outstanding Structure Award.\n\n\n== History ==\nIdeas for a fixed link across the \u00d6resund were advanced as early as the first decade of the 20th century. In 1910, proposals were put to the Swedish Parliament for a railway tunnel across the strait, which would have comprised two tunnelled sections linked by a surface road across the island of Saltholm. The concept of a bridge over the \u00d6resund was first formally proposed in 1936 by a consortium of engineering firms who proposed a national motorway network for Denmark.The idea was dropped during World War II, but picked up again thereafter and studied in significant detail in various Danish-Swedish government commissions through the 1950s and 1960s. However, disagreement existed regarding the placement and exact form of the link, with some arguing for a link at the narrowest point of the sound at Helsing\u00f8r\u2013Helsingborg, further north of Copenhagen, and some arguing for a more direct link from Copenhagen to Malm\u00f6. Additionally, some regional and local interests argued that other bridge and road projects, notably the then-unbuilt Great Belt Fixed Link, should take priority. The governments of Denmark and Sweden eventually signed an agreement to build a fixed link in 1973. It would have comprised a bridge between Malm\u00f6 and Saltholm, with a tunnel linking Saltholm to Copenhagen, and would have been accompanied by a second rail tunnel across the \u00d6resund between Helsing\u00f8r and Helsingborg.However, that project was cancelled in 1978 due to the economic situation, and growing environmental concerns. As the economic situation improved in the 1980s, interest continued and the governments signed a new agreement in 1991.\nAn OMEGA centre report identified the following as primary motivations for construction of the bridge:\nto improve transport links in northern Europe, from Hamburg to Oslo;\nregional development around the \u00d6resund as an answer to the intensifying globalisation process and Sweden's decision to apply for membership of the European Community;\nconnecting the two largest cities of the region, which were both experiencing economic difficulties;\nimproving communications to Kastrup airport, the main flight transportation hub in the region.A joint venture of Hochtief, Skanska, H\u00f8jgaard & Schultz and Monberg & Thorsen (the same of the previous Great Belt Fixed Link), began construction of the bridge in 1995 and completed it 14 August 1999.  Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden met midway across the bridge-tunnel on 14 August 1999 to celebrate its completion. The official dedication took place on 1 July 2000, with Queen Margrethe II, and King Carl XVI Gustaf as the host and hostess of the ceremony. Because of the death of nine people, including three Danes and three Swedes, at the Roskilde Festival the evening before, the ceremony opened with a minute of silence. The bridge-tunnel opened for public traffic later that day. On 12 June 2000, two weeks before the dedication, 79,871 runners competed in Broloppet, a half marathon from Amager, Denmark, to Sk\u00e5ne, Sweden.Despite two schedule setbacks \u2013 the discovery of 16 unexploded World War II bombs on the seafloor and an inadvertently skewed tunnel segment \u2013 the bridge-tunnel was finished three months ahead of schedule.\nAlthough traffic between Denmark and Sweden increased by 61 percent in the first year after the bridge opened, traffic levels were not as high as expected, perhaps due to high tolls. However, since 2005, traffic levels have increased rapidly.  This may be due to Danes buying homes in Sweden to take advantage of lower housing prices in Malm\u00f6 and commuting to work in Denmark. In 2012, to cross by car cost DKK 310, SEK 375 or \u20ac43, with discounts of up to 75% available to regular users. In 2007, almost 25 million people travelled over the \u00d8resund Bridge: 15.2 million by car and bus and 9.6 million by train. By 2009, the figure had risen to 35.6 million by car, coach or train.\n\n\n== Link features ==\n\n\n=== Bridge ===\n\nAt 7,845 m (25,738 ft), the bridge covers half the distance between Sweden and the Danish island of Amager, the border between the two countries being 5.3 km (3.3 mi) from the Swedish end.  The structure has a mass of 82,000 tonnes and supports two railway tracks beneath four road lanes in a horizontal girder extending along the entire length of the bridge.  On both approaches to the three cable-stayed bridge sections, the girder is supported every 140 m (459 ft) by concrete piers.  The two pairs of free-standing cable-supporting towers are 204 m (669 ft) high allowing shipping 57 m (187 ft) of head room under the main span, but most ships' captains prefer to pass through the unobstructed Drogden Strait above the Drogden Tunnel. The cable-stayed main span is 491 m (1,611 ft) long. A girder and cable-stayed design was chosen to provide the specific rigidity necessary to carry heavy rail traffic, and also to resist large accumulations of ice.\nThe bridge experiences occasional brief closures during very severe weather, such as the St. Jude storm of October 2013.Due to high longitudinal and transverse loads acting over the bridge and to accommodate movements between the superstructure and substructure, it has bearings weighing up to 20 t each, capable of bearing vertical loads up to 96,000 kN in a longitudinal direction and up to 40,000 kN in transverse direction. The design, manufacturing and installation of the bearings were carried out by the Swiss civil engineering firm Mageba.Vibration issues, caused by several cables in the bridge moving under certain wind and temperature conditions, were combatted with the installation of compression spring dampers installed in pairs at the centre of the cables. Two of these dampers were equipped with laser gauges for ongoing monitoring. Testing, development and installation of these spring dampers was carried out by specialists European Springs.\n\n\n=== Peberholm ===\n\nThe bridge joins Drogden tunnel on the artificial island of Peberholm (Pepper Islet). The Danes chose the name to complement the natural island of Saltholm (Salt Islet) just to the north. Peberholm is a designated nature reserve built from Swedish rock and the soil dredged up during the bridge and tunnel construction, approximately 4 km (2.5 mi) long with an average width of 500 m (1,640 ft). It is 20 m (66 ft) high.\n\n\n=== Drogden Tunnel ===\n\nThe connection between Peberholm and the artificial peninsula at Kastrup on Amager island, the nearest populated part of Denmark, is through the 4,050-metre (13,287 ft) long Drogden Tunnel (Drogdentunnelen). It comprises a 3,510-metre (11,516 ft) immersed tube plus 270-metre (886 ft) entry tunnels at each end. The tube tunnel is made from 20 prefabricated reinforced concrete segments \u2013 the largest in the world at 55,000 tonnes each \u2013 interconnected in a trench dug in the seabed. Two tubes in the tunnel carry railway tracks, two carry roads and a small fifth tube is provided for emergencies. The tubes are arranged side-by-side.\n\n\n== Rail transport ==\n\nThe rail link is operated jointly by the Swedish Transport Administration and Danish railways. Passenger train service is commissioned by Sk\u00e5netrafiken and the Danish transport agency under the \u00d8resundst\u00e5g brand, with Transdev and DSB being the current operators. A series of new dual-voltage trains was developed, linking the Copenhagen area with Malm\u00f6 and southern Sweden as far as Gothenburg and Kalmar. SJ operates X2000 trains over the bridge, with connections to Gothenburg and Stockholm. Copenhagen Airport at Kastrup has its own railway station close to the western bridgehead. Trains operate every 20 minutes, once an hour during the night, in both directions. An additional couple of \u00d8resundstrains are operated at rush hour. Freight trains also use the crossing.\nThe rail section is double track 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1\u20442 in) standard gauge and capable of speeds of up to 200 kilometres per hour (120 mph), slower in Denmark, especially in the tunnel section. There were challenges related to the difference in electrification and signalling between the Danish and Swedish railway networks. The solution chosen is to switch the electrical system from Swedish 15 kV, 16.7 Hz to Danish 25 kV, 50 Hz before the eastern bridgehead at Lernacken in Sweden. The line is signalled according to the standard Swedish system across the length of the bridge. On Peberholm the line switches to Danish signalling, which continues into the tunnel.\nTrains run on the left in Sweden, and on the right in Denmark. Initially the switch was made at Malm\u00f6 Central Station, a terminus at that time. After the 2010 inauguration of the Malm\u00f6 City Tunnel connection, a flyover was built at Burl\u00f6v, north of Malm\u00f6, where the two southbound tracks cross over the northbound pair. The railway in Malm\u00f6 thus uses the Danish standard.\n\n\n== Border checks ==\nBoth Sweden and Denmark are signatories to the Schengen Agreement, which removes border and passport controls between two participant countries. However, in January 2016, during the European migrant crisis, Sweden was granted a temporary exemption under the terms of the Schengen Agreement in order to mandate that all travellers across the bridge had photographic proof of identity. As such, travellers into Sweden from Denmark (but not the reverse) must show a valid passport or national ID card (citizens of EU/EEA countries) or passport and entry visa (if required) for nationals of other non-EU/EEA countries. The move marked a break with 60 years of passport-free travel between the Nordic countries.For the rail connection, these checks were initially enforced by legally requiring the train companies to verify the identities of travellers into Sweden, with a fine of SEK 50,000 as punishment for serving those without such identity documents. This led to the enforcement of checks by private security guards at the rail station in Kastrup airport in Denmark - an unpopular move with passengers, due to the delays imposedFrom 2017, Sweden removed this requirement and instead replaced it with more extensive direct checks by the Swedish police on entry into the country. This now takes place on board the train at Hyllie station on trains arriving from Denmark, with the checks at Kastrup fully removed.The border controls were renewed on 12 May 2019, and will remain in place until 12 November 2019, with likely further temporary renewal after.\n\n\n== Costs and benefits ==\n\nThe cost for the \u00d8resund Connection, including motorway and railway connections on land, was DKK 30.1 billion (~\u20ac4.0 billion) according to the 2000 year price index, with the cost of the bridge expected in 2003 to be recouped by 2037. In 2006, Sweden began work on the Malm\u00f6 City Tunnel, a SEK 9.45 billion connection with the bridge that was completed in December 2010.\nThe connection will be entirely user-financed. The owner company is owned half by the Danish state and half by the Swedish state. This owner company has taken loans guaranteed by the governments to finance the connection and the user fees are its only income. After the increase in traffic, these fees are enough to pay the interest and begin repaying the loans, which is expected to take about 30 years.\nTaxpayers have paid for neither the bridge nor the tunnel, but tax money has been used for the land connections. On the Danish side, the land connection has domestic benefits, mainly to connect the airport to the railway network. The Malm\u00f6 City Tunnel has the benefit of connecting the southern part of the inner city to the rail network and allowing many more trains to and from Malm\u00f6.\nAccording to The \u00d6resund Committee, the bridge has made a national economic gain of DKK 57 billion, or SEK 78 billion SEK (~\u20ac8.41 billion) on both sides of the strait by increased commuting and lower commuting expense.  The gain is estimated to be SEK 6.5 billion per year but this could be increased to 7.7 billion by removing the three biggest obstacles to integration and mobility, the two largest being that non-EU nationals in Sweden are not allowed to work in Denmark and that many professional qualifications and merits are not mutually recognised.\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\nThe \u00d6resund Bridge gave its name to the Nordic noir television series The Bridge, as the series was set in the region around the bridge.\nWhen Malm\u00f6 hosted the Eurovision Song Contest in 2013, the \u00d6resund Bridge was used as a symbol for the connection between Sweden and the rest of Europe.\nIt was the inspiration behind the 2014 song \"Walk Me to the Bridge\" by Manic Street Preachers from their album Futurology.\n\n\n== Environmental effects ==\nThe underwater parts of the bridge have become covered in marine organisms and act as an artificial reef.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nFehmarn Belt Fixed Link\nHH Tunnel, a proposed second \u00d8resund fixed link connecting Helsing\u00f8r and Helsingborg\nList of bridge\u2013tunnels\nList of road-rail bridges\nOld Little Belt Bridge (opened 1935) and New Little Belt Bridge (opened 1970)\n\u00d8resund Region\n\u00d8resundsmetro\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial English website\n\u00d8resund Bridge at Structurae\n\u00d8resund Tunnel at Structurae\n\u00d8resund Link at Structurae\n\u00d8resund bridge project information from Road Traffic Technology\nImpossible Bridges: Denmark to Sweden (MegaStructures documentary, 2006)\nVideo on Arup's website and on Youtube showing Arup Legends: Jorgen Nissen\nLive WebCam",

          "We wanted to go over the bridge so did the trip form Copenhagen, which you can do by car bus or train very easily at reasonable cost, it took us around 60 minutes to Malmo over the bridge to Sweden which for those who don't know starts as a tunnel which comes out on a island and",
          "What an amazing bridge! We passed through this bridge on our way from Gothenburg to Copenhagen, I was really impressed with the size and the design of this bridge, I just wished that there is like an area nearby dedicated for visitors to stop by and look at the bridge with cafe,",

          "We drove over the bridge from Copenaghen to Malm\u00f6 and back. We bought the pass ahead since we saw it was cheaper. The view it's pretty and the bridge it's in good condition, but still quite expensive.",
          "Yes it is an amazing structure and you feel like you are driving on the bridge for ages and you certainly have a great view, much better than the train that we returned on after returning our hire car to the airport. The cost I think is over the top, the largest one we have ever",
          "We flew into Copenhagen airport and took the train to Malmo across the bridge however unlike a previous visit we did not have our passport checked. There is a great view of the bridge from the harbour and beach in Malmo. Amazing structure which revived Malmo's fortunes.",
          "From Copenhagen, enter a tunnel of 7 kms and then drive above the sea to get a great view. This is a toll (pay) bridge, but worth the experience.",
          "It does the job. Gets you across the water. Book a ticket in advance if you can. Outrageaously expensive if you just put your card in the slot.",
          "Wow just wow, to drive this was a total amazing experience. Absolute stunning piece of engineering. We had cruised underneath it a nd then decided we needed to drive over it. Was a tad pricey to cross but well worth it.",

          "Travelling with the Oresunds train over the bridge between Denmark and Sweden is something- A smooth ride with a very silent and comfortable train.- You have a stunning view from the train with the windmills in the horizion. Wauw! Give it a try Lis and Bjoern",

          "We passed this wonderful bridge and mastery of architecture twice: Once by car crossing from Denmark over to Sweden during daytime. Once by going under the bridge in the middle of the night by using a ferry from Malm\u00f6 to Travem\u00fcnde (see pictures). In both cases a breathing",
          "The bridge connects Denmark and Sweden. It is not free though! The toll is quite high. If you want to visit Sweden from Germany it is cheaper and faster to take a ferry from Germany then driving through Denmark. Once you fall in love with the view of the bridge. Watch the TV",
          "It's far too expensive to pass this bridge. So bummed there is no student discount or anything like that, the fee eats up way too much of my monthly budget. Makes me reluctant to go to Copenhagen at all. Nice view tho.",

          "Worth coming here, it is quite impressive, even though, passing through is quite expensive, but a short way from Malm\u00f6 to Copenhagen",
          "We loved the views from the bridge, and it was so easy to drive over, way more flexible than ferries.",
          "As a rail enhusist I had to ride over this. It's pretty anti climatic. Smooth and a nice view of the straight.",

          "The bridge that connects Sweden to Denmark is really very impressive to look at, as is the view from bridge looking out to the sea and the city. If you\u2019re staying in Malm\u00f6 or Copenhagen, then you really can\u2019t miss taking a trip",
          "Interrailing across Europe, this is a piece of impressive architecture snd engineering. Worth crossing!",
          "We drove two times this bridge with wonderful views. We visited legoland and chose this road on our way from Finland. Driving and paying was really easy with \"bropass\".",

          "Amazing construction that connects sweeden and Danmark. It is really impressive and beautiful bridge. It is quite expensive, one way costs 450 Danish crones (420 if you prepay online). You are going underwater for some kilometers. I would recommend a buss or a ferie because of",

          "Passing by with train this evening \u00d6resund on both sides calm No wind just amazing to see great view",
          "Pretty crazy to think a bridge over the ocean connects two countries. Do yourself a favour and walk along the seaside to get an amazing view of this place.",
          "This could be seen from our hotel and the nearby seafront. Passed along it on train from Copenhagen airport.",
          "Lot is said about this. In short if u go to Malmo u should take this Bridge with Bus instead of Train. So u can have Great view and small Tour of malmo also. Malmo Near central station where u can spend 4 to 5 hrs by walking around Little Square and city square.",
          "The bridge is a fantastic achievement from an architectural perspective. From the train, you cannot see to much, unfortunately. We were hoping for a better experience..",
          "Viewed this bridge from my hotel (21st floor) and from the grassy foreshore, and also travelled over it by train three times. You DO need good weather but it\u2019s an amazing engineering achievement and well worth viewing if you\u2019re in Malmo or Koebenhavn.",
          "What an amazing and incredibly designed bridge of which I was excited to go over this from Copenhagen to Malmo. Just to think how the designer then the builders had to go through to complete this marvel.",

          "Oresund Bridge is an incredibly convenient way to travel to Sweden from Copenhagen. We were initially unsure if we would make the trip, but are so glad we did. Whether by train or by bus, you'll get to see what's going on - but neither are great for photo ops, and there's",
          "The only reason we were able to go to Malmo, Sweden from Copenhagen, Denmark was because of this bridge, so we really appreciated the time and effort that was put into building it all, make this a quick way to get across! You can drive by car, or you can go by bus or train. We",
          "After watching a documentary on the construction of the oresund bridge I kind of expected a lot more. I can't say that I was disappointed but I expected it to be grander and a lot longer to travel. This bridge handles both cars and railway, and it's a pretty quick and convenient",
          "This bridge was fantastic! We just jumped on the train and the bridge took us all the way across the sea to Denmark! Ok, so it had some help by a tunnel at the end, but who cares? If You ever need to cross the sound, this bridge will do the job. Much recommended!",
          "Travelled by bus from Copenhagen to Malmo using this bridge. It start in a tunnel that rises out of the water and then across the sea. No delays at tolls but are expensive if you travel by car. When flying out of Copenhagen you get to really appreciate the structure and see it",

          "Did not drive the bridge, but took the train from Copenhagen Central Station to Malmo, Sweden. Highly recommended for a day trip. About 1 hour travel time. Any way the Copenhagen side of the bridge is above water, and then half way across as you arrive at a small bit of land",
          "I\u2019d booked a short holiday to Copenhagen and Malmo and didn\u2019t actually consider the bridge toll. I actually thought it might be free or at most something like 10 euro. When collecting our hire car the company informed us we\u2019d be looking at close to 50 euro each way, totally",
          "Finally got to drive over \u201cThe Bridge\u201d, being a fan of the series. Previously done it on the train, but the experience of the design and engineering excellence can ally be appreciated by driving in both directions. Actually, just trying to justify why I hired a car to simply",
          "An awesome feat of civil engineering. What more can you say. Good views from Malmo on the shore by the Turning Torso.",
          "Fast road - maybe this was my second time to use this bridge. At least from the bus you didn\u2019t see anything. Good for the economy, maybe and passport controllers. You need a passport/identity cars and it is really controlled at the border. Old times have returned.",
          "It was experience like no else a bridge i the fog. If you are visiting have a walk you Will not be sory.",
          "Anyone who has watched the famous TV series, 'The Bridge', will be well aware of it. I went across by train from Copenhagen to Malmo and it was not possible to see any of it from the train window. I suspect the journey by car is far better. The train journey is inexpensive",
          "To say i was nervous about going over this bridge is an understatement.. however.. the train was the PERFECT way to go from Copenhagen to Malmo using the Oresund Bridge!! (We walked everywhere in both Copenhagen and Malmo- except when we took trains) The train was smooth~ I",
          "The bridge to freedom for some Swedish people! On the other side is the beer descent priced. It\u2019s the capital of Nordic.",
          "Beautiful piece of architecture, you would be able to enjoy it by car. But also there is a view point on the swedish side that you can really appriciate great bridge and even there is a path to walk right beneath it.",
          "This is the third time I have travelled over the bridge. It's almost one of the wonders of the world. Magnificent structure soaring over the sea. Great view of you have a second or two to look when driving. Splendid engineering. Their website is full of abreiviations that meant",
          "During my visit to Copenhagen i thought of making a short escape to Malmo and crossing the oresund bridge was really a great experience. Getting into the tunnel and coming back over the water again makes u feel super exciting. However, it would be great to experience the ride",
          "it was foggy and cold when we went to the site, the bridge showed a little bit. just enough to witness its beauty. the tour guide said the best time to see malmo is May to septembee",
          "train is super fast. cars can be too. best on a clear and bright morning - really beautiful views - worth the trip",
          "Um, it\u2019s a bridge. Seems to work very well. I drove from one side to the other and didn\u2019t end up in the sea, so I\u2019m obviously very satisfied.",
          "Excellent well worth a visit, particularly for fans of the TV show. We travelled by public bus from Copenhagen",
          "coming in on the ferry from Travemunde to Malmo - supper was being served (they made me me the most amazing vegan food) and sitting watching the bridge slowly appearing before me was just beautiful. I travelled by train to Copenhagen too - the bridge was fascinating from that",
          "We flew into Copenhagen Airport and took a flixbus to Malmo. Did this specifically to see the bridge and tunnel. It is very impressive up close. The bus is the cheapest way to get into Malmo from the airport, only \u20ac2.66 return trip.",
          "We traveled by train across from Copenhagen takes around 25/30minutes remember to take your passport!",
          "Last July, we were part of a package tour, which crossed the bridge by mini bus. It was good. We could see most of it, and enjoyed the experience. This time was by train, and we were looking forward to it. Forget it. We hardly saw a thing.",
          "Stating the obvious but if you are on the train on the bridge you don't get to see the bridge! Nice view from the plane, and good views of the breeding grounds for windfall from the train.",
          "Easy to use and the tolls aren\u2019t that bad. There is a police control between the two countries. Passports/ drivers licences are showed for entry. If you have a Brobizz in your window you can zoom through the toll gates and pay later!",
          "The engineers, masons, builders, etc... of this bridge are really awesome... The view from the bridge is amazing... Very well done...",
          "We went by train when it\u2019s quite hard to see the sweep of the bridge, but it\u2019s so brilliant to be able to go to Sweden for the day so easily! Do it!",
          "I like the bridge! Tourists should google \"bropas\", before going! You can save a lot of money. It is not recommended to stop on the bridge to enjoy the view.",
          "Went over to Malm\u00f6 by a The Bridge. Really enjoyed it, don't forget your passport or ID card though! Liked Malm\u00f6, some stunning architecture and cheaper than Denmark!",
          "Driving across this bridge from Copenhagen to Malmo, Sweden was quite enjoyable and smooth. This is one of the most breathtaking bridges in the world in my opinion because it has a panoramic views of the sea on either side; and you can even see as you leave Denmark and encroach",

          "It\u2019s a marvelous thing to travel between two countries both on the bridge and under the ocean. It\u2019s rather expensive if you not are member of the \u00d8resundsbron. We often go by train under the bridge. It\u2019s absolutely the best way when you are going to the airport.",
          "As a fan of the TV series The Bridge this was a must do on my visit to Copenhagen. I looked at various ways to get to see it and found the cheapest by far was the 999 bus from Copenhagen Central train station it leaves a couple of times a day takes about forty minutes directly",
          "If you are visiting Malm\u00f6 in Sweden, it is most likely that you will cross the \u00d6resund Bridge, because it connects the Swedish city to Copenhagen. The \u00d6resund Bridge goes for 7 kilometers, making this the longest combined railway and road bridge in Europe! Fun fact; it inspired",
          "A very convenient and beautiful way to go between Sweden and Denmark. Stunning view especially sunrise and sunset",
          "Malmo Sweden and Copenhagen Denmark are close together thanks to the one of a kind stunning Oresund Bridge. My friend and I took the train from Copenhagen to Malmo, and spent a couple of nights in friendly and lovely Malmo. I only wish I could have had better views of the water.",
          "Took a bus over to Denmark via the bridge on a still clear day with a beautiful cloudless blue sky and what a view awaited us as we climbed uphill out of the tunnel. What an ingenious piece of engineering makes you wonder what else men could build if they just applied their",
          "Flying into Copenhagen airport on a crisp winters day, got excellent views of the Oresund Bridge. Wasn't there the last time I crossed the Oresund straight, so a much needed transport addition. Stunning at anytime of day, but especially sunset. Part bridge, part tunnel - a",

          "I always wanted to take the Oresund Bridge. While visiting Copenhagen in December, my family and I took the train to Malm\u00f6 and spend the day visiting museums and shops. The bridge is beautiful and the train ride pleasant.",
          "Visiting Copenhagen, we were obliged to take the bridge to Malm\u00f6. We booked round trip train tickets and went to Malm\u00f6 for the day. The bridge is beautiful and the train ride well worth doing. We love Sweden and found Malm\u00f6 to be wonderful for the arts and seafood. We had a fine",
          "The Oresund bridge is the bridge after which the detective is named. Connecting Sweden to Denmark it is quite a drive over sea. Not cheap but worth it...",
          "Great access to Malmo from Copenhagen. Got train from Terminal 3 and took 20 minutes. Easy to buy for about \u00a311. Busy but efficient. Would cost around \u00a3120 in taxi",
          "This huge bridge unifies the town of Malm\u00f6, Sweden to the capital Copenhagen area in Danmark. The construction is massive and sybolizes in a remarkable way the present European strives for a common future of the continent. Have a proper look at the bridge, as your plane is",

          "We rented a car one day in Copenhagen and decided to cross the bridge. We didn't research what it would cost. It was in the afternoon but raining and dark at this point so the view was compromised. When we got to Malmo we didn't immediately see any reason to get out of the",
          "Heard how big and fantastic this bridge was. Heard how long it took and how much money they spent on it. When we saw it, I was very very confused as we have many MANY larger bridges locally where I live that are as big and many larger. However, it's easy to get from Denmark to",
          "Nice views crossing the bridge. Took the train over - so handy having this quick link between Copenhagen and Malmo!",
          "This bridge is the gateway into the rest of Scandinavia, providing both ground vehicle and train transportation options.",
          "We crossed the bridge back and forth the same day. We experienced one of the most windy days of Denmark that day. The bridge was closed until 11 am and there were weather alerts so that the bridge was about to be closed by 6 pm. The alert forced us to make the fastest tour of",
          "We crossed this on a day trip from Copenhagen to Malmo, the train ride was just over 30 minutes and well worth doing.",
          "We took the train from Copenhagen, which is only 39 mins to Malmo, in part, so we could cross the bridge. It was a beautifully clear day & the view didn't disappoint, neither did sight seeing in Malmo.",
          "Fantastic bridge great for transportation and impressive to look at. There is no view from the train. For the best view up close, go to the end of \"Utsiktsv\u00e4gen\". For a great panoramic view go to the area V\u00e4stra Hamnen which is where the Turning Torso is located as well.",
          "We travelled across this bridge by train this week,definitely worth doing.Daytime will give the best views,but just knowing how this joins the two countries, makes the train trip and the experience worth it.",
          "We took the train across the bridge to Sweden for a day trip. Passports were checked when we stopped on the Swedish side but not when we re-entered Denmark. As the train from Central Copenhagen stops at the airport then this is a quick way to access Sweden.",
          "Crossing strait between Denmark and Sweden is easy and in sunny daylight the view is fantastic. Both the off-shore wind park south and Turning Torso is spectacular.",
          "A spectacular bridge-tunnel system connecting Denmark and Sweden. This is not an attraction you drive to, it will be part of your journey further north.",
          "Huge bridge and really impressive the fact they built it, however you can't see anything meaningful whilst on the train! Perhaps you can get a better view or walk/cycle it in warmer months.",
          "This man-made engineering wonder over the Oresund Straits connects 2 countries and made traveling between Denmark and Sweden a breeze. I took the 35 minutes journey from Copenhagen to Malmo via this bridge, and though I couldn\u2019t admire the beauty of the bridge from within the",

          "We were visiting Copenhagen and took the opportunity to visit Sweden ( Malmo and Lund) by train as it meant a short trip over the famous bridge. We bought our ticket at a machine in Norreport Station in Copenhagen which was very straight forward. The journey took us to",
          "I took the bridge last week between Kastrup Airport and the Arenas Slott castle in Grumslov Sweden. The outbound trip was late in the afternoon on a clear evening. The view is quite stunning, From the Danish side, you go through a tunnel to around halfway across the Oresund.",
          "We live very close to the bridge and the view over the bridge is overwhelming and beautiful, especially on a clear day. Sometimes we walk to the harbour to enjoy the view and listen to the water splashing on the rocks and I have to say that it is a most realxing experience.",
          "Driving between Malm\u00f6, Sweden and Denmark (the first exit is for Kastrup Airport) and back is an interesting experience. The roadway is very high over the water and there are views of a wind farm to the South, the Twisted Torso in Malm\u00f6 to the West, and the outskirts of",
          "We actually had to go to Copenhagen from Malm\u00f6, and the Oresund Bridge by train is the easiest way to go. The trip is only 20 minutes and the tickets can be bought easily online.",
          "This marvellous structure that joins Denmark (Copenhagen) with Sweden (Malmo) was opened in 2000. The bridge spans nearly 8 kilometres across the Oresund Strait from the Swedish coast to an artificial island in the middle of the strait before continuing a further 4 kilometres",
          "Nice piece of architecture, not breathtaking or special. Good for a quick trip to Malmo on the train.",
          "The \u00d6resund bridge between Sweden and Denamrk is the absolute best way to go between the contries. Yes, it's a bit pricey, but using the Bro Bizz (50% off each trip) it's not so bad.",
          "Much cheaper and quicker than using the ferry. Bro-Pass makes life easy and although a little expensive, worth the money.",
          "It really must be seen. It is a beautiful work of architecture that connects Sweden and Denmark. It is modern and elegant.",
          "I consider the bridge to be functional and practical, but not a destination in and of itself. It is not worth diverting from a travel route to see.",
          "A really impressive bridge which emerges from the sea at the Copenhagen end. It is really a beautiful piece of engineering.",
          "The bridge is quite amazing to see / go across. I did so from the train and the views were still very good. Not much to say other than it is a bridge so they'll be no long-term relationship or anything but was neat to go across and see the water and both countries.",
          "We had planned to cross the Oresund Bridge by bus so that we could see everything from the top deck but our bus did not arrive so we had to take the train. The bridge is very long if you take all the run up and run off islands into account. We were on the lower deck and saw the",
          "We have been under it five times around it once and now we have completed our wish list and been over it twice. It is an iconic structure incorporating fixed spans and a suspension bridge together with a tunnel. It is worth going on a coach to make the best of the views which",

          "What is the connection - well it is a day tour from Copenhagen which takes you up the coast road to Helsinger (Elsinore in English) and Hamlet's castle thence by ferry to Sweden and the medieval university town of Lund with its beautiful cathedral then on to Malmo, returning to",
          "Nothing special to say since I crossed it by train, but all the story about it, about its construction and all the details - it's amazing!",

          "I went because of the TV series \"Bron/Broen\" but also because I love Sweden. I went over to the Kaldbadhus to take pictures of it from there in Malmo, but I also took the train across it twice. Just a lovely experience and I'm glad I got to see it in person, even if people might",
          "This incredible bridge joining Sweden and Denmark is a wonderful structure, be it travelling along it on the train or admiring it from Malmo harbour.",
          "What surprises me about this bridge is that from Copenhagen airport station to the Swedish station takes about 10 minutes. It\u2019s important to remember to get a ticket in the station as you can\u2019t buy one on the train",
          "We took the flixbus to cross the bridge and I would never use that company again. They were 20 minutes past leaving time and once we got across the bridge into Sweden , we were stalled 1 1/2 hours so they could kick a family off the bus. I dont see an advantage to taking the bus",
          "Building a bridge more than 13kms long over the water is not an easy feat. Considering it also connects a part of Sweden that once belonged to Denmark back to Denmark, this bridge represents a triumph of human engineering as well as the development of man of figuratively",
          "I\u2019m not really into bridges however this one is quite impressive. A unique piece of engineering. We went across to Malmo on the top deck and returned on the train on the lower deck.",
          "I expected a bit higher speed of trains crossing the Oresund:-) Yes of course Im joking: being able to get from Sweden to Denmark in less than 20 mins is perfect! And you have plenty of time to admire all the beauty of this special place known from Bron tv series:-)",
          "We used this bridge to travel from malmo to copenhagen and back.We saw ocean as we traveled over the bridge and the bridge extended into a tunnel as we continued to travel under the ocean. we could not stop at any point over the bridge for pictures. We entered the bridge at",

          "Difficult to appreciate this bridge fully, but we stayed at an hotel at Amagerstrand and we could see the bridge from the hotel. We also went across to Malmo, which was really simple by train and took about half an hour. It cost us 288dkk which is about \u00a334 for a return for two",
          "Worth a trip over, especially for fans of Scandi crime fiction series :-) Nothing that special really, but an great feat of engineering nonetheless. It would probably be most impressive crossing at sunrise and sunset on a clear day (sadly we didn't hit those times). Don't take",

          "Going over the bridge is a real experience and well worth doing. The day trip from Copenhagen to Malmo is a good excuse to hop on the train and see the sea. We got the bus back from Malmo and that allowed us to see a lot more of the bridge itself as it sweeps around and under",
          "The combination bridge tunnel is great and the architecture is very nice. The views from the bridge are wonderful.",

          "Copenhagen to Malmo in about 25 minutes. Excellent feat of engineering. Practical and beautiful to look at.",
          "Okay, so it\u2019s just a bridge and it doesn\u2019t really have anything special apart from the fact that it allows you to go from Copenhagen to Malm\u00f6 in about 20 minutes, which is rather cool!",
          "It was amazing to see such a beautiful sea from Oresund Bridge. I am glad that we decided to visit Malmo!",
          "A Nice Beautiful Bridge between Sweden and Denmark quite long and it's a pay bridge so its quite expensive to just go a cross it to see it",
          "Being fans of Scandi noir, this Bridge had special significance. I hadn\u2019t realised that the 16km crossing is only partly by bridge, the rest is by tunnel. The manmade island of Peberholm connects the bridge to the tunnel. In one of those pleasing beneficial outcomes, apparently",

          "Its hard to review a bridge, but a bridge linking Sweden and Denmark is something special. I've gone over by car, but mostly by train and I just marvel at the view, the wind turbines, watching the sea traffic....I only wish I could cycle over!",
          "Amazing experience travelling under the bridge on the train and then over the bridge via taxi on the way back. Taxi quite expensive but worth it. The only thing, though, for fans of The Bridge, no Saga Noren in her green Porsche.....!",
          "Whether you're travelling by car, bus or train, the crossing of this bridge is always spectacular. For the non-commenters, it has great views across the Oresund and towards Malmo, so have your camera ready.",
          "A simple bit of organisation will enable a bus trip from Copenhagen to Malmo at a reasonable cost. The bridge itself is quite amazing, although the tunnel part is much like any road tunnel. Great views over the sound, and a easy way to get across to Malmo. Definitely worth it",
          "I have been across the bridge some years ago by car but this was my first time by train. The tracks are underneath the road in this impressive structure. The train travels fast but you do get quite a good view of the water and shipping. For a better view, go by car.",
          "The bridge connects Malm\u00f6 to Copenhagen. A trip worth taking! You can get a bus for as cheap as 5euros (one-way). While on the bridge, you can get a nice (far-off) view of both countries which is very cool. If the weather is nice (no fog) you can see a part of Denmark from",

          "One of the longest bridges we have been on and if you are traveling at night the lighting is awesome.",
          "Of course, if you watch Saga, you must cross the BRIDGE. A train ride will be easier and frequently available from Copenhagen, but will not give you an iconic view of the Bridge itself. I recommend taking a bus for at least one way. Get the Hollow Talk ready for you,",

          "I took a trip over the Oresund bridge to spend a few hours in Malmo. The train ride was fairly cheap and only took around 25mins! the bridge itself only takes around 5/10 mins to get over with lovely views of the sea.",
          "An amazing piece of engineering and a great driving experience especially if the weather is good. The crossing is made up of a 4km tunnel to an artificial island and then a 8km bridge over the sea. Do note, it's not cheap to cross (approximately 50 euros each way depending upon",

          "I crossed the bridge when I traveled to Malmo and I can say it's really amazing. I think one should definitely go to Malmo when staying in Copenhagen because it' is close and inexpensive.",

          "This Bridge takes you from Malm\u00f6 in The south of Sweden to Denmark (or the other way around \ud83d\ude0a)... Well at least a part of the way!... Couse in the middle of the sea it takes a dive under tha water and becomes a tunnel, how cool is that? One of the stops in Dennark is at Kastrup",

          "Crossed the bridge from Malm\u00f6 to Copenhagen (and back of course). The train was very very fast. We went from Hyllie to Copenhagen H, which is right in front of Tivoli gardens. Efficient but pricey. Get your ticket from a 7-eleven, rather than from a machine because sometimes",
          "Apparently a nice bridge, but the view from train was rather underwhelming. If you want to buy ticket to enjoy the feeling of crossing the sea by train, you might get disappointed.",
          "Traveled across this bridge several times. I don't know how I could rate it a five. But hey, at least it didn't fall down while we were crossing it. And as far as I know, there were no bodies found cut in half at the middle of it.",
          "We had a day spare and due to snow and wet weather forecast we decided to take a train from Copenhagen station to Malmo in Sweden. The train trip itself is under an hour and the journey across the bridge which links the two countries is impressive. You do not really appreciate",
          "An outstanding bridge. It amazed me how they built this on such a rough sea. As you cross it you can be enthralled by the large waves pounding on its columns and appreciate the beautiful views.",
          "We walked the seafront and saw the bridge from there. No need to go any closer. We are fans of the series so we had to take a look",
          "Being a massive fan of Nordic Noir Drama and having been gripped specifically by \"The Bridge\" I was keen to see this engineering marvel. So on a recent mini break to Copenhagen the opportunity presented itself and we took the train over to Malmo and across the bridge for lunch.",
          "What a wonderful piece of engineering. One of the most elegant bridges I have ever seen.It rises tall over the sea and than drops below the surface in a tunnel. I visited the location when it was being built back in 1999, now again, it just looks astonishing. Not much exploited",
          "Not really promoted as a 'must see' attraction. Had to seek help from DSB staff at Copenhagen Central regarding best tickets to purchase and they quickly got us sorted. Views were superb, including passing over large ships as we rose to the highest point. Suggest the tourist",
          "Passed this bridge by car nearly twice a day since 2001 (+ 3 half marathons). This bridge is really a huge lift the the region both countries however still far to expensive to really make the full integration between the cities. The bridge is really reliable, just been closed",

          "Took the train across from Copenhagen to Malmo for a day trip. Very efficient way to move between two countries and the view going to Malmo of the wind turbines (right side) was beautiful. We exited one stop before Malmo to view the grand entryway, but popped back on the train",

          "This is a very old and beautiful church which is well worth visiting when walking round Malmo. Comfortable shoes are a benefit when touring Malmo because there are lots of cobbles.",
          "A red brick church, with beautiful architecture. Very simple interior, without too many ornaments. The bell tower can\u2019t be visited, as in other churches in Europe. All in all, not one of the most beautiful churches I\u2019ve ever seen, you don\u2019t need more than 15 minutes to visit it.",
          "While staying in Copenhagen I had a free day and spent the afternoon in M\u00e4lmo. The city was quiet, it was a work day, and very clean. Transportation to and from by train was easy and walking or using a scooter while there made the trip easy. St. Petri is the oldest Church in the",
          "Recently restored and cleaned Beautiful church with a rich history! They have recently cleaned up the very old roof paintings in the oldest part of the church! Excellent acoustics! Go to a concert here! They're free!",
          "Impressive gilded altar and an even more impressive choir right next to the entrance with old, faded wall paintings.",
          "We saw the spire from the square and made our way to the church a couple of minutes walk. The church is beautiful inside and worth visiting if you are nearby.",
          "So many beautiful memories from this week. Performance by Kollektiv Knaster och Voices Of Scandinavia",

          "Happened by while wandering near our hotel in the old town, worth the visit. It is quite lovely and full of little architectural surprises.",
          "Might as well visit this church since it is just a short walk from Malmo Central Station or from Lilla Torg. It has interesting pieces to look at.",
          "St. Peter's Church is right off the main square, The Stortorget, almost behind City Hall. Unfortunately the inside was closed for renovations, but we did walk around the perimeter of the church and marveled at the beautiful architecture, simple, but elegant. It is a huge",
          "It really is a beautiful church, and one of the oldest buildings in the whole of Malm\u00f6. I\u2019ve walked past this church a number of times now, and everyone I can\u2019t help but admire its size and beauty.",
          "It is a historical church, but if you live life not having seen it, you have missed nothing. If in Malm\u00f6 anyway, might as well swing by to see the murals in the chapel.",
          "As you walk towards the church it gets more impressive and bigger. Almost Cathedral like and the main church of the city. The architecture and detail are great. Inside the white walls give it a real bright and welcoming feel",

          "Couldn't visit it as it was closed at 5pm. I just saw the architecture outside and enjoyed a drink at the park around it as it is closed to the biggest mall of malmo!",
          "This is a beautiful church and while we were there we had a concert. I think it is because it is their national day. The church itself has so much to see and enjoy and is well worth taking the time to go to. The wooden pulpit is amazing as is the new pipe organ- a real piece of",
          "I visited St, Petri because my Great Grandmother was baptised there and was pleasantly surprised. It's a beautiful church both inside and out. With one section inside that survived reformation so you can see how intimately the church was originally painted inside. Free, right",
          "I highly recommend visiting this church. I suggest you take a picture of the church from the back if you want to capture the whole structure...the buildings in the front are too close unless you have a wide angle lens. I thought the inside was absolutely stunning...not over",
          "Beautiful place right in the middle of the old town. Even if you are just wandering around the old city, you will run into this majestic church. It looks amazing from the outside. You can go inside, it is free, but after reformations, the classic medieval church was renovated",

          "The church looks both majestic and modest in the same time. It's spacious (tall), it has a huge altar, but the benches and the walls are simple / modest with some decorations. It's a welcoming calm place with nice architecture.",
          "Located behind the city hall, Saint Peter's Church is well worth popping into for a visit. The exterior is interesting, but rather dull in colour and the contrasting white interior hits you when you enter. The modern church organ is interesting. It also has an interesting",
          "Nice church to walk to. Lovely to look at from the outside. Recommend seeing but won't blow you away",
          "The church from the exterior to the interior is quite nice. Inside there\u2019s a big open, light space with not a whole lot else going on. There\u2019s a really interesting organ built into the wall. Quite peaceful inside if you fancy a break from the city.",

          "A very old church, beautiful and impressive. Located in the absolute city centre. Very often when I visit Malmoe I go in there and sit for a while, very peaceful. From the beginning it was a catholic church",
          "It is the oldest church in Malm\u00f6. Built in the 14th Century, the frescos and the altar are historical treasures. Well worth making the time to visit.",
          "Apparently the oldest building in this area, the church is lovely. Our tour guide told us that it was originally a Catholic Church, ornately decorated inside, but when it became a Protestant church, they painted over a lot of that. There\u2019s a small area they haven\u2019t painted over.",
          "Beautiful church in Malmo, well worth a visit and a walk around. Free entry and very quite, me and my wife enjoyed it",

          "We were lucky to visit when the organist was in full flow the sound filled every corner of the building, the acoustics are amazing. I believe that this is a Lutheran church so it is not as ornate as Catholic churches but still nice to visit.",
          "This chuch is amazing and a fantastic piece of Malm\u00f6s history, it is very close to the central station (walking distance).",
          "Not many cathedrals have had their tower falling down not once but twice. Fantastic acoustic and interesting artefacts.",
          "If you like old church architecture then you would get lost in this grand building. I only walked around on the outside as it was undergoing some renovations. However, it was fun just seeing the detailed architecture put into the old buildings of yesteryear.",
          "St. Peter\u2019s Church in Malmo is the oldest building in the city. This 14th century building is famous for its high wooden altar, one of the highest in Europe. The church also has a chapel attached to it. Worth a visit.",
          "Too bad you can\u2019t get in since the interior is undergoing renovations through December 2018. Much better churches to see across the bridge in Copenhagen. Better yet, go to the Roskilde Cathedral and couple it with a visit to the Viking museum nearby.",
          "had planned to see church, last stop on my day trip around Malmo before heading home. I was over from Copenhagen. nice looking church, great, tall spire, unfortunately at the moment it's closed for refurbishment. just my luck. a sign on the door apologised for it being",
          "The outside of the church was absolutely beautiful. We were a bit disappointed that we could not visit the inside as it is closed during renovations.",
          "So you can see the church, it's big enough, nothing special. However, it's closed (August 2018), so they have a temporary igloo church nearby which is a bit cool..",
          "The church was in front of us as we left the car park it is a churck with a spire so we could see were we had left the car. The church is large and built in red bricks. We were unable to enter the chuch so no comment on the contents.",
          "When I visited this church was shut. It was having some building works. There was still information on the door about the church and there was also a small tent nearby offering an alternative to the church.",
          "This is Saint Peter\u2019s Church of Malmo The Building is beautiful and pretty much big and high. A little bit difficult to take a picture of the church in a whole frame since a lot of buildings are surround the church in a narrow range.",
          "Closed for refurbishment - not sure when it reopens - check with tourist information before you go. There is a temporary church onsite ( in a tent ) but not quite the same",
          "Very nice church! Beautiful building in the center of the city. Highly recommended to visit while in Malm\u00f6!",
          "An historic place full of the histories of Malm\u00f6 If you want a quiet place to think is the right place to go You can visit the church by yourself not only when it\u2019s a whorship",
          "We could only look at this church from the outside but it is clear to see that the style of it is very nice and is worth a quick look while in Malmo.",
          "Currently under renovation We looked from the outside Magnificent church building They have an igloo type tent for worship in place of the church at present",
          "The church is currently closed and under going renovation in 2018 for its 700 year celebration in 2019.",
          "Nice looking, Northern European style brick church. Unfortunately closed for renovations but probably worth a minutes inside when it reopens.",
          "It's under renovation so you cannot go in. Limited to browsing around the outside for a few minutes.",
          "Coming from the small side streets this basilica is impressive. Very beautiful externally but unfortunately we could not visit it because work of renovation in progress.",
          "It is the oldest building in Malmo. Lots of locals come here to pray to reinforce their faith in God. As a human being, one must find a balance between living in the past and in the present. If you live only in what once was, you become a museum. If you live only in the feelings",
          "This church is absolutely beautiful...from the outside. They were doing serious renovations when we went by which didn\u2019t allow us to go inside but if it\u2019s as nice inside as it is outside it would definitely be a place to visit!",
          "This church is outstanding and the size is unbelievable. It is lovely to see and walk around and has amazing architecture and designs. A must see in Malmo",
          "peaceful space Not a typical churchits known as the round church The priest stands in the centre of the congragation All are equal very pretty church ............",

          "I visit malmo one day trip . The building was great near to main square and city hall.oldest building in malmo since 700 years.",
          "Located on the other side of central station across river, Peters chuch is largest church of Malmo. quite old church probably constructed in 13th century. From outside the huge building looked old and i was hoping that inside will not be diffetent either. I got there when chuch",
          "This is an okay church. I am not much of a church type but I do enjoy visiting churches for their architecture. St Petri is not bad at all and there is even a part of the church that is painted with very ancient patterns which is quite incredible to look at to be honest. The",
          "Love clean n minimalistic style of this church! If you are in Malmo you must visit this place! It\u2019s free and it takes only 15 mins!",
          "Small church interior, but with rather interesting decor. We visited when they were having an open house, there were activities for children as well as allowing people to try the Organ. They normally hold lunchtime concerts, so you could check in advance before heading down",
          "The Church looks very nice from the outside. Inside, it is quite plain, despite its 700 year history, although the side altar at the back has some faded murals, which are more often seen in Italian churches. The main altar is very dramatic and it is possible to walk all the way",
          "It\u2019s not the most impressive church that I\u2019ve seen. Nice architecture from outside but inside it\u2019s rather plain and quite small.",
          "If you\u2019re in Malmo this is worth a 30 minute stop inches heart of the town. Quite lovely, no charge.",
          "it is an impressive and rather austere building. it could be hlped by more descriptive materials. well worth going to",
          "This still operating 13th century church is rather plain outside (although definitely imposing) but step inside for a glorious space and a fascinating bit of western history. Originally a Catholic church, the Reformation resulted in painting the walls a stark white and the",
          "This church is stunning with its all white interior. The thing that caught my eye was the piano at the front. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been in a church with a piano as a centre piece. There was a colourful nativity scene and in the far back corner some very interesting old mosaic",
          "An amazing church built in the 1300s, but completley renovated in the late 1800s. It is a nice place to visit while you are aimlessly walking around in Malm\u00f6.",
          "Arriving in Malmo with no idea where to go or what to do we found this church first. We went in for a look and it is a lovely church. But, our experience was with the staff. We were searching for a tourist information centre and asked one of the ladies if she knew where it was.",
          "This church is tucked down a side street off the main square across from the station. Its well worth a visit . The alter is amazing but the highlight is the original frescoes and font .",
          "This is a very good example of Gothic architecture built of brick. I suppose it has been adorned with frescoes, but today\u2019s interior is serenely simple, allowing you to study the Gothic columns and vaults. Free admission and generous opening hours, and found in Malm\u00f6\u2019s historic",

          "Beautiful church building, so calm and peaceful to walk by. Lovely architectural details too. Lovely at night.",
          "Petri Kyrke, as the place is actually called, is a pleasant Scandinavian church in the centre of Malmo with a nice mixture of medieval and modern design. It houses concerts, and they leave the signage up for these during the daytime, so it was difficult to work out whether we",
          "A very nice church located in downtown Malmo. Free entry, it was nice to get in out of the cold for a look at the inside.",
          "Beautiful church or St. Peter's Cathedral. Many decorations and details are Christian but belong to the Lutheran beliefs. It is also the largest Lutheran Church in Scandinavia. Visit the choir of the city choir, we were on the test, they sound fantastic.",
          "The original date of this church goes back to the 1300\u00b4, when Sweden - or rather this part5 of Denmark, of course, was first Catholic. After the Reformation it was still Danish until the middle of the 1600\u00b4s when it first became Swedish. All the bishops of this church are listed",
          "Whilst not the most striking of churches from the outside, the inside is well worth a look. I spent a short time sat in the aisles taking it all in. Beautiful altar and gold display.",
          "Inside and out, this Church is worth seeing. I would recommend walking around the outside of the building first to see it. The go inside. Free to enter, there is a range of parts to see. Some parts are the typically up to date well kept areas but there are also parts that",
          "Worth a few minutes, but unfortunately a lot of it was painted over centuries ago. Still impressive and beautiful, that that survived",
          "This church has an interesting history ,which make you to visit it. Me I was unlucky because it was closed. May be next time",
          "The only reason I gave this a three is I didn't get a chance to see the inside sonce iy was closed under constriction. It was beautiful on the outside",
          "It's written to be one of the oldest preserved churches in Malmo. The alter is beautiful! We just happened to walk in while a choir was rehearsing. The sound was amazing. Although they were not playing the organ, there was a sign stating they are adding to an already huge organ!",
          "We walked in during a children's rehearsal it added to the ambiance. The church is very understated worth spending a few minutes sering",
          "Not particularly memorable, but it has a lovely spire. Also, the altar is worth a dekko. Good for about an hour.",
          "Interesting and informative. A church with real history and gravitas. Helpful staff who wanted to help and tell you all about the church and its history. It takes about an hour but well worth it.",
          "Beautiful church with an organ. One of the more iconic buildings in Malmo. Take 15 minutes to walk in and take some photos.",

          "The church, inside, is nothing special though in the usual beautiful scandinavian style, but outside is quite interesting. They are going to renew their organ and at that point this church will have the most big organ in south Sweden.",
          "Interesting church, quite spartan inside - but it wasn't always this way. Frescoes in the side knave quite amazing considering their age.",
          "The light is the first thing you see- the church interior is white which combined with the light streaming in on a sunny Scandinavian day overwhelms you completely. There are well preserved frescos and rich men graves beneath the floor",
          "While on an afternoon visit to Malmo we had the opportunity to stop in and visit the church. It really is beautiful and visitors are welcome to walk around and take pictures. I was especially impressed that the church had laid out a rainbow rug runner to support Pride Week.",
          "Came across St. Petri's while walking back to the train station and dicovered a truely stunning church,with an interior painted white it is a very beautiful building and will worth a visit",
          "We visited on a Sunday afternoon. We were greeted with beautiful organ music that played (remotely) during our entire visit. This is a beautiful church with a great history. Just before we exited we saw a room where they were restoring the original paintings on the walls.",
          "I thought this church was very pretty. Extremely easy to find and get to. The inside of the church was beautiful.",
          "Its very central location makes it easy to visit when in city. Often high class concert performances are given, so just check out the program.",
          "Beautiful church in Malmo , extremely romantic and beautiful . What is unusual - the clean white walls , columns and arches are in heart taking contrast with golden wooden altar.",
          "Just standing outside and looking at the spears of this structure is fantastic. Entering the big doors in front and making way into the main room makes you feel small and full of admiration. A church full of history and magnificant archhitevture. Worth a visit and maybe sit down",
          "We visited this church mainly because it is the church where all of my wife's ancestors were christened and married going back hundred's of years including her father. The staff was exceedingly friendly and knowledgeable which greatly enhanced our short time there. I was floored",
          "A pleasant old church near the center of Malmo. It is only a few minutes walk from the main center with the squares and is quite picturesque.",
          "Very poor church with a very simple decoration. The bulding wasn't also very architectural itself. So if you don't have time to visit it don't worry. At least it's free of charge.",
          "The alter and painted ceiling are really something. During our visit on a Monday, the priest held a service and it was interesting she was accompanied by a pianist who also sang solo. Only a handful in the church attended the service. Very enjoyable and well worth a visit.",
          "Just across the Town Hall of Malme, is located this oldest building in the capital of southernmost region of Sweden, that is, the Scania. This church dates back from the early 14th century. St. Petri or St.Peter's Church has got one very interesting architectural style, so",
          "As the oldest building in Malm\u00f6, this church definitely worth the visit because I think it has such particular Swedish style. Definitely worth to visit once in a while.",
          "Took a day trip to Malmo (from Copenhagen) and really enjoyed the city. This church is worth a stop. It's beautiful inside and outside with an amazing altar. When we were there, there was a service getting ready to start, but you're still able to stand in the back. There was no",
          "A well preserved gothic church with a high altar truly worth seeing. Note the list of parish preasts, an illustration of how Sk\u00e5ne represents a heritage of both Denmark and Sweden.",
          "I love the old churches of Europe and this one didn't disappoint. The alter is amazing. And the building itself has very cool features. On one side I think they are called flying buttresses. Very cool. It amazes me how they built these way back when and this one is nice.",
          "The church wasn't far from Malmo Central Station. It was only a few minutes walking away. If you arrive at Malmo Central Station, I'd highly recommend to check this church out.",
          "A huge church in the centre of old city that is very nice. Didn't get a chance to go inside but from the outside it's majestic really and you have to visit it",
          "This church dates back 700 years or more apparently and is worth a look. It has grave markers on the floor dating back to the 1600s and an old ante room that looks untouched for centuries.",
          "Like most churches in Sweden, everyone is welcome to join the services. The language spoken is off course Swedish but ask the person next to you and they will give you hints. Churches have long opening hours and you can pop in for a shorter or longer visit to admire the",
          "I liked the elegant simplicity ... and the way it is blended with the surrounding buildings ... it is just there ...",
          "This is a very nice church. It is pleasant to visit also the inside, which is for free and it is one of these churches that does not contain many gold decorations. It is rather in a modest style, which I prefer.",
          "Church in city centre, front of church was probably meeting of local city pickpockets group in morning, boss was give a day schcedule for his workers, looks very strange, police absents. Inside and outside was nice church, not lot of paints on walls inside, church is big, make",
          "A working attraction that contains a beautifully restored chapel with 500 year old murals above the christening basin. Rest of church not so charming.",
          "Really, living in Denmark this was nothing special. A very ordinary church with very ordinary old grave stones and a nice alter. I liked the boys' choir but did not have a chance to listen to them as we had to leave. Nice post cards to buy",
          "One of the oldest churches in the south of Sweden with burials of famous Knights inside the church.My daughter was baptisted in the church.Its in the central of Malm\u00f6 city.\"min walk from Stortorget where the statue of the Swedish warrior king Gustav the 12th are standing.So if",
          "Not as big as other main churches but its beautiful in its own way. I also enjoyed reading a bit of the history near the entrance.",
          "We saw it from outside, and yes, it is beautiful. It is especially interesting if you are used to a different style. However, if you've seen other churches like this, you won't get much from spending time here.",
          "It is supposed to be the oldest structure in Malmo but it is so well maintained and beautiful inside. One chapel still has the remains of paintings on the ceilings and walls. We did worry about stepping onto those marvelous stone carvings on the floor commemorating the dead.",
          "Beautiful place in the center of city. Nice restaurant near this church. Beautiful church and history of Malmo/Sweden.",
          "I stopped into this lovely little church and spent some time here. I got talking to a lovely little priest. I wouldn't factor long into my day for this but it is a beautiful stop off.",
          "Beautiful place in the center of the city, visible and accesible from all sides. I never hoped to see an Orthodox icon in a protestant church!!!",
          "I only had a short time here but it was very quiet and peaceful. It was also very easy to find this church",
          "The old town is not huge so it's not difficult to find this church. It's worth a quick look inside as well as a photo outside as you walk around Malmo.",
          "This church has lot of history. Very beautiful. I love churches and this in one of the best preserved.",
          "Not a very nice place to visit because of a lot of traffic and problem with parking spots. I would recommend another",
          "A recommendation from the desk at the Mayfair Hotel Tunneln, which is around the corner virtually. It was cold out and nice to duck into places as we walked around. Once in the church, one got a real sense of the history of this magnificent building and historic place. Having",
          "The architecture of this church is amazing, but once I came inside I was disappointed. it was poor and nothing special and it's a pity since it's one of the most popular attractions in Malm\u00f6.",
          "This is a wonderful, actively used building. The design is very interesting. The church sits right in the middle of a shopping district, and you can see it from all over the city. Construction on this building was started in 1319, and you can see how additions were made to it",
          "The church is open from 10 to 18, so it is quite easy to go inside and have a look. Very central, in the heart of the old town.",
          "We walked around the outside and it's beautiful. Went in and they were preparing some performance from school kids. So we didn't want to disturb them too much and just walk around a bit . It was very nicely renovated inside.",
          "Lovely church that is easy to find, open hours are sometimes difficult but it is worth it to take a little look inside. It may not be the most incredible but it is still lovely to see it when visiting Malmo.",
          "Well worth finding time to visit as the outside is not nealy as attractive. Opening hours can be limited as it is a working church.",
          "St Petri is the oldest church building in Malm\u00f6 and the oldest one built with brick. Dating from the 14th century the interior has been remodeled several times during the 700 years. Not in any way particular in appearance or architecture, St Petri should nevertheless be seen if",
          "In a town of so few items of true tourist worth its hard to get too excited about this church as it's not that amazing in any particular way. It was one of the top 10 things to see in Malmo",
          "One of the oldest building in Malmo this church is almost entirely built out of brick and has a spire spanning over 100 metres. (344 feet). Lots of great photos to ve taken here.",
          "We visited this church on a Monday within the publicised opening times and it was not open. This was disappointing. It is, however, worth a visit to look at the architecture from the outside.",
          "This church was very pretty , we didn't go inside it was Sunday when we saw it and service was going on . It's pretty on the outside .",
          "The church is well maintained, accessible and invites participation. Exceptional bapistry, organ and pulpit, all complimented by the petition area where you are invited to pray.",
          "Malmo itself is not a big city, though it's the third Swedish town. So, when you see such building like this, it's always catching your eye. Enormous one, it's even difficult to fill it in a standard photo snap. Must see.",
          "This is an old church with lot of architectural details. worth a visit while in Malmo. The place is not far off from the square.",
          "I wanted to see it as it was the oldest building in Malmo, so I went in a September afternoon. The construction is in well shape, nice architectural elements. Too bad it was crowded by other buildings. I couldn't enter as it was closed...strange for a church to be closed without",
          "Interesting example of a Swedish church. Very interesting mosaics on the wall in the forward part of the church.",
          "Lovely small chapel area to the left of the main door as you go in with amazing frescos over the walls and ceilings. Impressive font with large silver bowl.",
          "A beautiful piece of architecture and not one to be missed while in Malmo. Very easy to find from the square or the train station.",
          "We dropped in and managed to catch the last of Sunday services. It was wonderful. Oh sure, it's not Saint Peter's or Westminster but it's a great representation of some of the larger, more ornate churches in Sweden.",
          "What a splendid church! Walking in, I saw a little area for toddlers to play - how cute! In the back corner of the church I felt like I was going back in time. You can see the beautiful murals on the walls, knowing that you are viewing art from so long ago. Also, look down---",
          "Maybe it's just us, but walking into a church while a mini orchestra is practising and a small playground for toddlers is provided isn't something you come across everyday. Plus a list of all the known priests that served there since the 15th century really gives you a feeling",
          "Beautiful building. Impressive inside and outside. Very close to railway station and old town. Very original building material for someone more used to sandstone edifices.",
          "A restored 1950's organ is played for the public Wednesday's at 12:10. The hearing of such a fine instrument being played is inexpressible.",
          "It's was beautiful well worth a visit. Easy to find in the center of the city within walking distance to all other attractions.",
          "Visited this church in the weekend and I could even witness a christening of a child. This church is full of impressive architecture. In a free leaflet in the church (in a couple of languages) you can read about the history of the St. Petri church.",
          "Open to the public, located right in Malmo so easy to get to, Easy to find just follow the main spire.",
          "Walking distance from the Central Station. This church is 800 years old and looks majestic. Seeing the outside was enough but when you step inside, you will awe struck by the beautiful architecture, murals and decor. The interior decoration is stunning and priceless. Starting",
          "We nearly missed the original murals that are being revealed in one corner of the church. The puritans had white-washed the walls and the original murals had remained covered for many years. They have now been revealed in one section of the church and it was fascinating to see",
          "Free entry to this beautiful well maintained church. Great architecture so building is stunning before you even see inside!",
          "St Petri Church, is a special place. Stunning architecture and decor. Beautiful stained glass windows, and amazing ceilings.",
          "I love old churches, and this one was breathtakingly beautiful inside! I can only imagine getting married in one of these awesome churches. It was free admission, but we did make a small donation. The pictures here do not do it justice. Very peaceful and serene. A short walk",
          "It is a must visit if you like places full of history. It is an 800 years old beautiful church and the best of all the entrance is free. If you are in the area, don't forget to pass by.",
          "The church is close to Malmo's train station and easy to visit while walking towards (or returning from) the city center. It is not big enough for an extended visit, but there is enough to see to keep you busy for 15-30 minutes. There is a kids corner in the back of the church",
          "While I was there a man sat at one of the many pianos in the church and started playing very gently. It added to the respectful atmosphere in the church. It is a big church with a magnificent high altar of oak timber, but covered in gold leaf. There is a merchant's chapel with",
          "We live close buy, I often forget what an amazing place this is. Can hold its own among cathedrals all over Europe. Stop buy if you, entrance is free.",
          "If you are in Malmo, this church is well worth a visit. It is near the train station, close to the little squares in Malmo. The church is old and beautiful. You can buy a broshure for 5 korons (approx 0.50 euros). Have a pleasant stay in Malmo!",
          "This is the first church that greeted me as I left the train station. It stood majestically and really looked so beautiful. The interior was beautiful and impressive too. Pop in and have a look, it's worth the time.",
          "I have had the pleasure and benefit of having this church as my congregate church and both of my daughters are baptised there. It\u00b4s a really nice contrast to the city centre outside. Beautifully preserved and well worth a visit with it\u00b4s impressive history. Suitable for all",
          "It is Sweden's oldest church. It is beautiful and well kept, quite impressive. Worth checking it out if you're in town..",
          "Nice place. Visit it if you're in Malm\u00f6. It's located near the little square and was free of charge when we went there. Also, it is close to the metro.",
          "This is a very beautiful bulding from the outside and even nicer inside. It has some lovely carvings and is quite impressive. Well worth a visit.",
          "I was surprised by the church...it was very Catholic in feel...crucifix with Jesus's body, a Madonna statue, ornate altar...but I found out it was a Luther church...the structure survived the purge of the Reformation... A must see...",
          "For art history enthusiasts this is a must - a very stylish church built in the Gothic style and the entry is free of charge. I happened to be there at noon and there was even a concert going on which was enjoyed by tourists and locals alike.",
          "The church is very centrally located, not far from the centre and the main railway station. Nice inside, so calm and quiet. The interior is extremely light.",
          "I think this is the biggest church in town. Building started build in 1319. Inside are a lot of very interesting artefacts from 16-th and 17-th century.",
          "Beautiful Church but the desk attendant seemed to not want to be bothered with questions. Would have loved to learn more but the entrance had no English language pamphlets srocked.",
          "Looking for some peace and quiet away from the shopping streets of Malm\u00f6? This is the place to go and marvel at the sheer size and grandeur of the all-white interior of this magnificent church. Well worth a visit!",
          "Take the time to visit this church. Go inside. There is no cost to enter, but they are accepting donations to complete the largest organ in a church in Scandinavia. The main ceiling is not very ornate, but there are some lovely pieces of religious artwork to admire. This is",
          "Churches are not in much use these days in weathier parts of europe like sweden. But this old chruch, surprisingly, is very beautiful in its interior and definitely worth a visit.",
          "This is a beautiful interior and well worth looking inside. At the time we visited they were playing pipe organs which was interesting.",
          "Lovely alter. Very impressive. At the end of the school year teachers and students meet here for celebrations.",
          "We still find each new church a wonderful experience. St John's certainly did not disappoint us during our visit to Malmo. Certainly would recommend you discover its wonderful interior.",
          "Very impressive church. Was nice to sit and contemplate the architecture. Bit late to take advantage of the coffee that is available to visitors.",
          "An ice little medieval church in the corner, quiet and peaceful. The wallpaintings are amazing. But to see its famous organ, you have to go to the city museum.",
          "On a Saturday in May it wasn\u00b4t easy to find an occasion to visit the church, as it was very popular for weddings. Murals in side chapel worth the visit though.",
          "Unique design that varies alot from other cathedrals in Europe. I walked by it every day on my way to the convention center. It was locked, however, and I never got to take a peak inside.",
          "It was a good surprise visiting this attraction while I was on the way to the central station walking. Got inside easily and it was full of beautiful art works..! Man and Woman, the tower was soooo big at least 200 to 240 feet if I am not wrong..!",
          "This old (built in 1319) charming church is worth popping into. It is light and airy with little fuss, but attractive interior and exterior. Lovely calm welcoming atmosphere.",
          "We had an excellent tour guide who explained the history, design and uses of the church. The ornate inside is even better than the the outside with the beautiful paintings and old grave slabs with their inscriptions still visible. The massive chandeliers and the acoustics are",
          "If you need to find a quiet place then go inside. You can light a candle. Choose a peaceful corner and be still. There might be a little midday service. Or maybe you are lucky to see a baptism in the left corner at the church.",
          "This is the whitest church \u26ea I have ever seen and I have seen some white churches. There is a alcove with original murals on which is very good.",
          "Highly recommended for those who love seeing old churches - very beautiful! We walked by once before it opened (10am) but came back and were happy we did!",
          "We went to this church as it is only minutes away from the station. On the outside, the church is obviously not as large as most famous cathedrals but the architectural design is unique and very sophisticated. The tower up front looks taller than expected. The walls and pillars",
          "We checked the church and found that most of the interior had been in a process of whitening through great many resent years. Only a little part has been saved and this was interesting to experience. The atmosphere in the church is 'cold' and our first impression was that the",
          "It's quite a big, bright church on the inside. Don't let the outside full you with all the brown bricks. It's worth a visit but to me nothing special.",
          "This is a lovely church with a light bright interior- it felt fresh. The religious iconography was displayed to maximum advantage against the white paint. The arches are tall and graceful and the person on the desk is helpful and knowledgeable- well worth stopping by.",
          "Lovely church - light and bright inside with some interesting frescos. If you are lucky (as we were) you might arrive just at the right time to get a free cup of coffee!",
          "Visited this church today, it's 700 years old & worth the visit! Gorgeous interiors draped in history, unfortunately we visited the church as a funeral was being prepared so we cut our visit short as we felt a little uncomfortable being in there and taking photos with grieving",
          "I stumbled upon this when the bells were ringing. Beautiful church. You could hear the bells a mile away. A must see even if you aren't religious.",
          "This is the oldest church in Malm\u00f6. Of course it is beautiful, with soaring height, breathtaking architecture and carvings and a hushed atmosphere. But it's more than that. There is a small Chapel on the left side, Kr\u00e4markapellet, with a christening font, and walls covered in",
          "First time to visit this Old Church its so beautiful inside.my family enjoyed very much .the originality of the interior design inside the Church was excellent.",
          "This awesome church is a perfect example of how awesome brick gothic can be. This type of gothic style only occurs in Baltic state countries and Skandinavia so it's a great chance to visit it while spending time in Sweeden.",
          "This beautiful 700 year old church is definitely worth visiting. It's beautiful inside! They were testing the organ when we stopped in and it sounded gorgeous. Worth the stop!",
          "It's a church like many other. I found the altar strange: it's very baroque, very golden. it looks strange among the plain white walls. There's a play corner for kids, and free tea/coffee.",
          "Malm\u00f6 was cold and windy. I was on my way to the Moderna Museet, when I saw this church, so I went in to warm up a little. They serve free tea, which was very nice in this cold weather. St Petri is the oldest church in Malm\u00f6, built in the 14th-century. The Kr\u00e4markapellet has",
          "We stopped by the church while we were visiting Malmo for the day. It was open and we could look around, the inside is stunning.There is also free coffee available. In all we spent about 20 minutes walking around the inside and taking pictures.",
          "I promised myself to visit this church in Malmo and see the difference between the nordic churches and the ones in Italy or anywhere in the Med. Indeed, this church has all the lines you would expect in churches I saw in Sweden, UK, even Germany and Austria...... plus the",
          "When we stepped inside the church we were stunned by the interior of this church, didn't expect it to be so bright inside. There was also a free concert available for everyone to enjoy at 7pm, unfortunately we had a train to catch so weren't able to stay for that. We did see a",
          "I stopped in while walking by one evening as I heard music / singing from inside. Stepping in I was blown away by the acoustics and the fullness of the performer's voices. It was a free concert (held frequently) and was well worth the time. The church itself is a thing of beauty",
          "This is a really nice church, I visit churches not so much for the religious side of things that I enjoy taking photographs of the architecture. They are very friendly there unless there is a service on where they are further that you don't go walking around which I guess is",
          "I was on a hired bike so didn't want to leave the bike for very long, so I only peeped inside. I was amazed just how light it was, as normally churches are dim and cold. Certainly next time I will stay longer as it is a beautiful church.",
          "Very beautiful place with devine athmospere inside. Worth seeing for sure, because this is aming the few really interesting places in Malmo",
          "Ducked in here to escape a snowstorm. Really peaceful space, with information leaflets in English for those who are interested. The large wooden altar is apparently one of the largest in the country - and the smaller altars are lovely, too.",
          "A nice church with a beautiful interior. Worth to take a small stop and walk around. It was nice to sit down for about 20 mins. I spent the time gazing the interior and listen to the choir practicing. It was quite a good experience.",
          "The largest church in Malmo city centre, with interesting stained glass and decor. Free to visit and very close to the old quarter, it's a good rainy day option.",
          "This church have white clean lines, but with very special golden decoration. Some times there are concerts free for the public.",
          "Nothing special but i liked the inside. Overall average. If u don't go, you miss nothing. Nothing much to see in Malm\u00f6 anyway.",
          "not too overdone, spacious, nice artwork, impressive for a small town. if you're short on time and have seen nice churches before, feel free to pass on this one.",
          "We have visited at lunch time and there is a show, and free of charge. We have stayed for the show and was very nice.",
          "A tip: in the center of Malm\u00f6, behind the largh square Stortorget, there's a beautiful church : St. Petri!",
          "It's a small church but it's beautiful inside and out. Take a walk all the way around and see some of the remnants of the old church before they tore down the old Catholic art and whitewashed the walls. Free coffee and water is available for visitors, but don't carry it around",
          "This old church is lovely and absolutely worth a wander through. The buttress architecture reminded me of a cathedral in Palma Mallorca and the open door welcomed me in. Donate 2SEK and you can light a candle too.",
          "An active parish of the Swedish Church. We were there at their 1210 srrvice. If yiu enjoy architecture thus church has buttresses. The interior will take you back to the Renaissance.",
          "Wandering around Malmo I had little plans for my visit to the city, and stumbled across this church while taking a stroll around the city centre with this behind the City Hall. It's worth taking a look around the inside of the Church as it is a lovely quiet whitewashed interior.",
          "This church is located right behind the beautiful city hall. Some parts of the church look modern while others fairly old, including carvings on the floor and drawings on the ceiling of one side-room. It's free to enter, and worth a 5-10 minutes look if you're in the area.",
          "It's a nice change from the barrage of churches that you often get in Europe, with a white interior to contrast the more traditional brick exterior.",
          "I had my Sons Christening in this church, the facilities are wonderful with midaeval parts and lovely painted windows. Very specious and friendly staff.",
          "We had travelled from Copenhagen to Malmo, a 35 minute ride by train and were wandering with no where in particular in mind to visit. This is when we came upon a 700 year old kyrka or church, St Petri (Peters). It's different from other cathedrals because the interior is totally",
          "While visiting Copenhagen we made a trip to Malmo. While walking around Malmo, this church is worth a peak inside. It's free. Why not? There was one side room in particular I found the most interesting. The walls and floor made it seem much older than the rest. Check it out if",
          "The church was hosting a wedding, but they very kindly let us have a look around for 10 minutes before it was to start. The outside of the church is wonderful with a very high spire. The inside beautiful - open, spacious, airy, peaceful. Definitely worth a wander around in",
          "Here you can enjoy a before and after the renovation that makes thoughts how did they think? Music sat elected times and art exhibitions",
          "We visited the church on a one day trip to Malmo from Copenhagen. Walking around the inside of the church and learning the history was fascinating. The wonderful pictures painted on the walls and ceiling many centuries ago had all been paired over white on the advice of an",
          "Our hotel was very close to St. Petri's Church and we went there a number of times to enjoy the history and beauty. If your in Malmo it's a must see I would say!",
          "Well worth a visit, we popped in and they were rehersing some drama. Very atmospheric, lovely plain interior to one of Malmo's oldest churches, deceptively simple interior.",
          "A magnificent building, pristine white finish inside with colourful carving adorning the walls. Excellent seating and whilst we were there the pianist played for a service- an absolute bonus.",
          "St. Petri church in Malm\u00f6 has a really nice exterior and has simple interior. It's worth visiting if you are in Malm\u00f6 since it's in the center.",
          "Stumbled on this church just walking down the street! Would've been a shame if we missed it it's a Beautiful church inside and out! Worth a visit when in Malmo!",
          "This place is well worth a trip. The building has been well looked after and you are given free access to look around. The only restriction is flash photography. Photos come out really well as the walls are all painted bright white. There is a section of the walls were",
          "This church building is very tall and beautiful to look at. It is the first major attraction that I came across on my first visit to Malmo. Although it is the oldest building in Malmo, it has certainly stood the test of time and its beauty has been preserved. This building has",
          "Beautiful church in central Malm\u00f6, have a seat and feel the piece inside the church, only a few people here on a sunny day",
          "This church is really old, dating back to the 14th century. However as much as it is impressive from the outside it is a bit dull from the inside. Nothing much to be seen in it.",
          "Spending a rainy day in Malmo I decided to check out St. Petri. I really enjoyed this church. Only few people and I just sat a enjoyed the peacefulness and beauty of the church.",
          "It was built in 1312, and not too much chenged over the centuries just the tower. It is from 1891, 105 meter high and almost impossible to make a good photo. The altar, the baprtistery are renaissance gems. When they renovated in the middle of the 19. centruy, they cleaned",
          "Big church but somewhat boring. Hardly any people inthere, not that many decorations. Would visit other churches first and save this one for last",
          "This church is visible for a long distance. The outside of the church is as interesting as the interior, but it still is a functioning church and you can have a few moments of quiet meditation during brief morning services.",
          "Lots of stained glass windows in this beautiful church. The outside is just as impressive as the inside.",
          "Very clear architecture, nice church with btight large paces. The frescoes of the gothic chapel are of especially high value",
          "Large, stunning church with a wonderful interior. From the copper roof to the old wooden pews this church has a lot to offer.",
          "For those who appreciate centuries old buildings, this is a must-see in Malmo, full of history and opportunity for quiet reflection. The epitaphs of tombs in the floor are worth a look, even if your Swedish is nonexistent, and the altar of course is very impressive.",
          "After such a long walk around the city of Malm\u00f8 in Sweden- I always end-up my day for a short period of solitude.A moment to be alone in my own thoughts and to refresh myself.So I choosed a church.Its like going back to old ancient times.Its a travel way back hundreds of years",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral that is a short walk from anything in the city. It is well worth a stop and see--very beautiful. The structure is in good shape--well maintained. There is staff available for questions.",
          "If you have the slightest interest in historical monuments St. Petri is a must when you visit Malmoe. Just inside - and to the left you find \"The Merchant's Chapel\" with the original wallpaintings including the heraldry of \"Arma Christi\" dated to the last period - just before",
          "Our first visit in Scandinavian church. My knowledge about this culture and their religion was poor,pretty poor. I imagined to meet with Odin and Thor inside. Thanks for lighting me.",
          "If you are visiting the city, I suggest you to visit this church located in city center, not far away from main train station. Gothic style, this church is good example of medieval era.",
          "This is an interesting building, both outside and inside. Even if you are not religious, we would recommend a visit.",
          "The interior of the church is worth a visit. Very white interior with beautiful artifacts and decorations. One of the few churches where you don't see any stain glass yet still being a very beautiful church. It is a working church where there are recitals every Wednesday",
          "This was a beautiful church but not on the order of some off the more grand European churches. We were in and out in 15 minutes and it was very nice. Worth a visit if you are in town but I wouldn't travel long distances to get here.",
          "St Petri aka St Peters Church is on a quiet street in the middle of Malmo, and easily accessible by foot, bus or train. The outside of the church is pretty ordinary, but the size is nevertheless impressive. The real wonder of this place is only apparent when you walk through the",
          "Impressive church in the middle of Malmo that can quite clearly be seen from most places. Lovely design, the architecture is quite impressive.",
          "This church is amazing both inside and outside. Some of the alcove areas have amazing ceiling paintings. The sculptures in the middle are also inspiring.",
          "A nice white church - very clean - Great Organ - interesting paintings - lots of graves under the floor - nice benches for praying",
          "I passed this church while wandering around Malm\u00f6 and didn't go inside. The exterior is impressive, especially the tower.",
          "This church was easy to get to and you can take photos inside. I would recommend you to bring cash to buy a one of a kind candle.",
          "We really didn't expect to this church to open up and be the size it is as we walked through the doors from the street. St Petri has a beautiful altar. We lit candles in remembrance of some of our family and took time to wander around the church. I love churches and would",
          "While this church was not the prettiest (subjectively) among the many churches I saw in Copenhagen and Malmo, it may have been the oldest, which makes it worth a visit to me. The interior is so bright and crisp compared to the dark, gothic exterior. The interior is less",
          "Visited this attraction while roaming around Malmo without any real destination. The inside was worth the visit and worth spending a few moments in. However, there is nothing really impressive or striking about the exterior. Just off Stortorget makes the church easily accessible.",
          "This is a lovely church of contrasts. Stark white walls and gothic ceiling, with a baroque altar. The side chapels and memorial stones are also interesting.",
          "This historical building kind of sneak up on you in the middle of random streets. It's a very pretty Scandinavian church however!",
          "This church tells you a lot about the city's history, plenty of free concerts and it's one of the few churches that is actually open most of the day. Check out the lovely stone carvings around the church, if you pay attention you'll even find a symbol that you usually don't",
          "That is a huge church! i remember i really had difficulty when making the photo, in the matter of the fact I didn't succeed in capturing the entire view of it because the buildings around it are very close to the church. Anyway if you are in the gamla stan it's worth the visit.",
          "I ended up here due to a wrong turn but it was worth it. The church itself is nothing special (remodeled with white paint all over). However, there is a section with the old fracks that is quite beautiful. That alone makes it worth your time.",
          "I don't think I've ever been to a church this old. You cannot miss this piece of history if you come to Malmo. It's fairly small too, so you won't have to trek through a huge building. It was pretty much empty when I visited and it seems to be that way quite often. This is",
          "Visited in the middle of a workday, it was pretty much deserted. It gave off a very calming vibe; didnt impose itself, didnt overwhelm -- a serene little place of worship, a beautiful silent chapel. Not belonging to a faith, one sometimes feels out of place in a church. This",
          "It was a beautiful creation standing tall in the City of Malmo. It gives such a unique feeling of Europe. Personally I thought the outer is much impressive than the inside. I just stood near it and kept staring not being able to take my eyes away. There are benches close around",
          "This is a Church dating back to the 14th Century. If you are in Malmo, it is worth a visit. There are very ornate fixtures in the church from the pulpit to the altar to various other pictures/statues etc.",
          "Beautifully restored Lutheran church on the outside and inside. The white walls in the inside really brings out the altar in the center. It's not overly ornate. Beautiful in its simplicity. Don't worry about walking over the marble slabs; they've already moved the bodies to",
          "I was amazed how different the church looks in the inside. From the outside you see this impressive bulding full of detailes, in the inside however it is very simple, rather plain. We got free coffe/tea/buiscuits inside. The oldest building in the city was definitely worth",
          "Like others who may have mentioned this before me, the interiors are VERY different from the exteriors. It has a very bright interiors (during the day at least) and a very serene environment to pray or even just do some soul searching, It has a corner that has been preserved",
          "You must go inside the interior is very different than outside. \u0130nterior was very different than e i was expecting. All white inside. Less but impressive ornaments on white interior. And the altar is \"must see\"",
          "I don't visit many buildings but since Malmo doesn't much I decided to go in. Its free to enter. But I was amazed but the beautiful interior of the church. Huge very different Altar. And very artistic pictures with frames and a balcony/stage like beautiful structure half way in",
          "I had the pleasure the other day to be in the St Petrie church in Malm\u00f6 and enjoy a concert performed by the Orchestra of the Justus Liebig University Giessen Germany and the repertoire included Grieg Brahms and Schumann An outstanding performance The church itself is a Basilica",

          "We loved this quaint church built back in the 11th century. Fascinating detail in the architecture. We also found it very fascinating that they list every pastor ever in charge of the church from the day it opened in the foyer.",
          "After reading other reviews, we wanted to visit this church and we were not disappointed. We came on a Sunday, wanted to attend services, but could not find the times. Unfortunately, we arrived too late. However it should be noted that he church does hold services and they do",
          "We've seen many, many churches in Europe, and this was the first one with an all-white interior. It was beautiful, and definitely worth a stop. Be sure not to miss the corner area where they restored it to its original colors.",
          "Not the biggest church I have been in but it was still impressive. It looks gothic from the outside but much more modern inside. It's just a short walk from Malmo Central station so definitely worth a visit. Inside there is also free refreshments including tea which is always",
          "Definitely worth the stop to see the oldest building in Malmo. Get the tour guide pamphlet (10 Kronas) as you enter it is in 3 languages including English. It helped me to fully appreciate the history, beauty and significance of the artifacts inside.",
          "We were not planning on going to this church in our day excursion to Malmo from Copenhagen, but I am glad we did. On the outside the church is an impressive brick edifice, but once you enter you can feel the sanctity of the building. It is beautiful on the inside with",

          "We wandered into this beautiful church - the oldest building in Malmo just to have a look around. The Church is really lovely and we got an extra surprise as there were two musicians (a pianist and violinist) playing the most beautiful music - a real added bonus. This is",

        "wiki": "Malm\u00f6 (; Swedish: [\u02c8m\u00e2lm\u00f8\u02d0] (listen); Danish: Malm\u00f8 [\u02c8m\u00e6lm\u02cc\u00f8\u02c0]) is the largest city in the Swedish county (l\u00e4n) of Sk\u00e5ne (Scania). It is the third-largest city in Sweden, after Stockholm and Gothenburg, and the sixth-largest city in Scandinavia, with a population of 316,588 (municipal total 338,230 in 2018). The Malm\u00f6 Metropolitan Region is home to over 700,000 people, and the \u00d8resund Region, which includes Malm\u00f6, is home to 4 million people.Malm\u00f6 was one of the earliest and most industrialized towns in Scandinavia, but it struggled to adapt to post-industrialism. Since the construction of the \u00d6resund Bridge, Malm\u00f6 has undergone a major transformation, producing new architectural developments, supporting new biotech and IT companies, and attracting students through Malm\u00f6 University and other higher education facilities. The city contains many historic buildings and parks, and is also a commercial center for the western part of Scania.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest written mention of Malm\u00f6 as a city dates from 1275. It is thought to have been founded shortly before that date, as a fortified quay or ferry berth of the Archbishop of Lund, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) to the north-east. Malm\u00f6 was for centuries Denmark's second-biggest city. Its original name was Malmhaug (with alternate spellings), meaning \"Gravel pile\" or \"Ore Hill\".\nIn the 15th century, Malm\u00f6 became one of Denmark's largest and most visited cities, reaching a population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. It became the most important city around the \u00d8resund, with the German Hanseatic League frequenting it as a marketplace, and was notable for its flourishing herring fishery. In 1437, King Eric of Pomerania (King of Denmark from 1396 to 1439) granted the city's arms: argent with a griffin gules, based on Eric's arms from Pomerania. The griffin's head as a symbol of Malm\u00f6 extended to the entire province of Scania from 1660.\nIn 1434, a new citadel was constructed at the beach south of the town. This fortress, known today as Malm\u00f6hus, did not take its current form until the mid-16th century. Several other fortifications were constructed, making Malm\u00f6 Sweden's most fortified city, but only Malm\u00f6hus remains.\n\nLutheran teachings spread during the 16th century Protestant Reformation, and Malm\u00f6 became one of the first cities in Scandinavia to fully convert (1527\u20131529) to this Protestant denomination.\nIn the 17th century, Malm\u00f6 and the Scanian region (Sk\u00e5neland) came under control of Sweden following the Treaty of Roskilde with Denmark, signed in 1658. Fighting continued, however; in June 1677, 14,000 Danish troops laid siege to Malm\u00f6 for a month, but were unable to defeat the Swedish troops holding it.\nBy the dawn of the 18th century, Malm\u00f6 had about 2,300 inhabitants. However, owing to the wars of Charles XII of Sweden (reigned 1697\u20131718) and to bubonic plague epidemics, the population dropped to 1,500 by 1727. The population did not grow much until the modern harbor was constructed in 1775. The city started to expand and the population in 1800 was 4,000. 15 years later, it had increased to 6,000.\n\nIn 1840, Frans Henrik Kockum founded the workshop from which the Kockums shipyard eventually developed as one of the largest shipyards in the world. The Southern Main Line was built between 1856 and 1864; this enabled Malm\u00f6 to become a center of manufacture, with major textile and mechanical industries. In 1870, Malm\u00f6 overtook Norrk\u00f6ping to become Sweden's third-most populous city, and by 1900 Malm\u00f6 had strengthened this position with 60,000 inhabitants. Malm\u00f6 continued to grow through the first half of the 20th century. The population had swiftly increased to 100,000 by 1915 and to 200,000 by 1952.\n\n\n=== 1900\u20131969 ===\n\nIn 1914 (15 May to 4 October) Malm\u00f6 hosted the Baltic Exhibition. The large park Pildammsparken was arranged and planted for this large event. The Russian part of the exhibition was never taken down, owing to the outbreak of World War I.\nOn 18 and 19 December 1914, the Three Kings Meeting was held in Malm\u00f6. After a somewhat infected period (1905\u20131914), which included the dissolution of the Swedish-Norwegian Union, King Oscar II was replaced with King H\u00e5kon VII in Norway, who was the younger brother of the Danish King Christian X. As Oscar died in 1907, and his son Gustav V became the new King of Sweden, the tensions within Scandinavia were still unclear, but during this historical meeting, the Scandinavian Kings found internal understanding, as well as a common line about remaining neutral in the ongoing war.\nWithin sports, Malm\u00f6 has mostly been associated with football. IFK Malm\u00f6 participated in the first ever edition of Allsvenskan 1924/25, but from the mid-1940s Malm\u00f6 FF started to rise, and ever since it has been one of the most prominent clubs within Swedish football. They have won Allsvenskan 23 times in all (as of February 2018) between 1943/44 and 2017.\n\n\n=== 1970s and later ===\nBy 1971, Malm\u00f6 reached 265,000 inhabitants, but this was the peak which would stand for more than 30 years. (Svedala was, for a few years in the early 1970s, a part of Malm\u00f6 municipality.)\nBy the mid-1970s Sweden experienced a recession that hit the industrial sector especially hard; shipyards and manufacturing industries suffered, which led to high unemployment in many cities of Scania. Kockums shipyard had become a symbol of Malm\u00f6 as its largest employer and, when shipbuilding ceased in 1986, confidence in the future of Malm\u00f6 plummeted among politicians and the public. In addition, many middle-class families moved into one-family houses in surrounding municipalities such as Vellinge Municipality, Lomma Municipality and Staffanstorp Municipality, which profiled themselves as the suburbs of the upper-middle class. By 1985, Malm\u00f6 had lost 35,000 inhabitants and was down to 229,000.The Swedish financial crises of the early 1990s exacerbated Malm\u00f6's decline as an industrial city; between 1990 and 1995 Malm\u00f6 lost about 27,000 jobs and its economy was seriously strained. However, from 1994 under the leadership of the then mayor Ilmar Reepalu, the city of Malm\u00f6 started to create a new economy as a center of culture and knowledge. Malm\u00f6 reached bottom in 1995, but that same year marked the commencement of the massive \u00d6resund Bridge road, railway and tunnel project, connecting it to Copenhagen and to the rail lines of Europe. The new Malm\u00f6 University opened in 1998 on Kockums' former dockside. Further redevelopment of the now disused south-western harbor followed; a city architecture exposition (Bo01) was held in the area in 2001, and its buildings and villas form the core of a new city district. Designed with attractive waterfront vistas, it was intended to be and has been successful in attracting the urban middle-class.\nSince 1974, the Kockums Crane had been a landmark in Malm\u00f6 and a symbol of the city's manufacturing industry, but in 2002 it was disassembled and moved to South Korea. In 2005, Malm\u00f6 gained a new landmark with completion of Turning Torso, the tallest skyscraper in Scandinavia. Although the transformation from a city with its economic base in manufacturing has returned growth to Malm\u00f6, the new types of jobs have largely benefited the middle and upper classes.\nIn its 2015 and 2017 reports, Police in Sweden placed the Roseng\u00e5rd and the S\u00f6dra Sofielund/Seved district in the most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMalm\u00f6 is located at 13\u00b000' east and 55\u00b035' north, near the southwestern tip of Sweden, in the province of Scania.\nThe city is part of the transnational \u00d6resund Region and, since 2000, has been linked by the \u00d6resund Bridge across the \u00d6resund to Copenhagen, Denmark. The bridge opened on 1 July 2000, and measures 8 kilometres (5 miles) (the whole link totalling 16 km), with pylons reaching 204.5 metres (670.9 feet) vertically. Apart from the Helsingborg-Helsing\u00f8r ferry links further north, most ferry connections have been discontinued.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nMalm\u00f6, like the rest of southern Sweden, has an oceanic climate. Despite its northern location, the climate is mild compared to other locations at similar latitudes, mainly because of the influence of the Gulf Stream and also its westerly position on the Eurasian landmass. Owing to its northern latitude, daylight lasts 17 hours in midsummer, but only around seven hours in midwinter. According to data from 2002\u20132014 Falsterbo, to the south of the city, received an annual average of 1,895 hours of sunshine while Lund, to the north, received 1,803 hours. The sunshine data in the weather box is based on the data for Falsterbo.Summers are mild with average high temperatures of 20 to 23 \u00b0C (68 to 73 \u00b0F) and lows of around 11 to 13 \u00b0C (52 to 55 \u00b0F). Heat waves during the summer arise occasionally. Winters are fairly cold and windy, with temperatures steady between \u22123 to 4 \u00b0C (27 to 39 \u00b0F), but it rarely drops below \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F).\nRainfall is light to moderate throughout the year with 169 wet days. Snowfall occurs mainly in December through March, but snow covers do not remain for a long time, and some winters are virtually free of snow.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\u00d6resund Line trains cross the \u00d6resund Bridge every 20 minutes (hourly late night) connecting Malm\u00f6 to Copenhagen, and the Copenhagen Airport. The trip takes around 35\u201340 minutes. Additionally, some of the X 2000 and Intercity trains to Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Kalmar cross the bridge, stopping at Copenhagen Airport. In March 2005, excavation began on a new railway connection called the City Tunnel, which opened for traffic on 4 December 2010. The tunnel runs south from Malm\u00f6 Central Station through an underground station at the Triangeln railway station to Hylliev\u00e5ng (Hyllie Meadow). Then, the line comes to the surface to enter Hyllie Station, also created as part of the tunnel project. From Hyllie Station, the line connects to the existing \u00d6resund line in either direction, with the \u00d6resund Bridge lying due west.\nBesides the Copenhagen Airport, Malm\u00f6 has an airport of its own, Malm\u00f6 Airport, today chiefly used for domestic Swedish destinations, charter flights and low-cost carriers.\nThe motorway system has been incorporated with the \u00d6resund Bridge; the European route E20 goes over the bridge and then, together with the European route E6 follows the Swedish west coast from Malm\u00f6\u2013Helsingborg to Gothenburg. E6 goes further north along the west coast and through Norway to the Norwegian town Kirkenes at Barents Sea. The European route to J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping\u2013Stockholm (E4) starts at Helsingborg. Main roads in the directions of V\u00e4xj\u00f6\u2013Kalmar, Kristianstad\u2013Karlskrona, Ystad (E65), and Trelleborg start as freeways.\nMalm\u00f6 has 410 kilometres (250 mi) of bike paths; approximately 40% of all commuting is done by bicycle.\n\n\n=== Ports ===\nThe city has two industrial harbors; one is still in active use and is the largest Nordic port for car importation. It also has two marinas: the publicly owned Limhamn Marina (55\u00b035\u2032N 12\u00b055\u2032E) and the private Lagunen (55\u00b035\u2032N 12\u00b056\u2032E), both offering a limited number of guest docks.\nPublic transport consisted of a tram network from 1887 until 1973. Afterwards, it was replaced by a bus network.\n\n\n=== Malm\u00f6 S-Train ===\nA local train line with circular traffic at seven stations was opened in December 2018. The stations are Malm\u00f6 Central Station (underground platforms) \u2013 Triangeln station \u2013 Hyllie station \u2013 Malm\u00f6 South/Sv\u00e5gertorp \u2013 Persborg \u2013 Roseng\u00e5rd \u2013 \u00d6sterv\u00e4rn \u2013 Malm\u00f6 Central Station (main overground terminus). Some trains arrive from Kristianstad and finish with a lap around Malm\u00f6, whilst other trains at this circular line, never drive outside the city limits. There is at least a 30 minutes service between each departure, but far more between the Central Station and Hyllie. Extension plans of a minor network system exists.\n\n\n=== Proposed metro ===\nThe \u00d6resundsmetro is a proposed rapid transit network linking Malm\u00f6 with the existing Copenhagen Metro through a 22 km tunnel under the \u00d6resund.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nMalm\u00f6 Municipality is an administrative unit defined by geographical borders, consisting of the City of Malm\u00f6 and its immediate surroundings.\nMalm\u00f6 (Malm\u00f6 t\u00e4tort) consists of the urban part of the municipality together with the small town of Arl\u00f6v in the Burl\u00f6v Municipality. Both municipalities also include smaller urban areas and rural areas, such as the suburbs of Oxie and \u00c5karp. Malm\u00f6 t\u00e4tort is to be distinguished from Malm\u00f6 stad (the city of Malm\u00f6), which is a semi-official name of Malm\u00f6 Municipality.\nThe leaders in Malm\u00f6 created a commission for a socially sustainable Malm\u00f6 in November 2010. The commissions were tasked with providing evidence-based strategies for reducing health inequalities and improve living conditions for all citizens of Malm\u00f6, especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged and issued its final report in December 2013.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nMalm\u00f6 has a young population by Swedish standards, with almost half of the population under the age of 35 (48.2%).After 1971, Malm\u00f6 had 265,000 inhabitants, but the population then dropped to 229,000 by 1985. The total population of the urban area was 280,415 in December 2010. It then began to rise again, and had passed the previous record by the 1 January 2003 census, when it had 265,481 inhabitants. On 27 April 2011, the population of Malm\u00f6 reached the 300,000 mark. In 2017 the total population of the city was 316,588 inhabitants out of a municipal total of 338,230.In 2019, approximately 55.5% of the population of Malm\u00f6 municipality (190,849 residents) had at least one parent born abroad. The Middle East, Horn of Africa, former Yugoslavia and Denmark are the main sources of immigration. In addition, 14.8% (50 999 residents) of the population in 2019 were foreign nationals.Foreign-born population by country, 31 December 2018:\n\nGreater Malm\u00f6 is one of Sweden's three officially recognized metropolitan areas (storstadsomr\u00e5den) and since 2005 is defined as the municipality of Malm\u00f6 and 11 other municipalities in the southwestern corner of Scania. As of 2019, its population was recorded as 740,840. The region covers an area of 2,522 square kilometres (974 sq mi). The municipalities included, apart from Malm\u00f6, are Burl\u00f6v, Esl\u00f6v, H\u00f6\u00f6r, K\u00e4vlinge, Lomma, Lund, Skurup, Staffanstorp, Svedala, Trelleborg and Vellinge. Together with Lund, Malm\u00f6 is the region's economic and education hub.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Malm\u00f6 was traditionally based on shipbuilding (Kockums) and construction-related industries, such as concrete factories. The region's leading university, along with its associated hi-tech and pharmaceutical industries, is located in Lund about 16 kilometres (10 miles) to the north-east. As a result, Malm\u00f6 had a troubled economic situation following the mid-1970s. Between 1990\u20131995, 27,000 jobs were lost, and the budget deficit was more than one billion Swedish krona (SEK). In 1995, Malm\u00f6 had Sweden's highest unemployment rate.However, during the last two decades, there has been a revival. One contributing factor has been the economic integration with Denmark brought about by the \u00d6resund Bridge, which opened in July 2000. Also the university founded in 1998 and the effects of integration into the European Union have contributed. In 2017 the unemployment rate is still high but Malm\u00f6 has, in the last 20 years, had one of the strongest employment growth rates in Sweden. But a lot of those jobs are taken by workers outside the neighboring municipalities.As of 2016, the largest companies were:\nSkanska \u2013 heavy construction\nNobina \u2013 transport\nPostNord \u2013 postal services\nP\u00e5gen \u2013 bakery\nIKEA \u2013 furnitureAlmost 30 companies have moved their headquarters to Malm\u00f6 during the last seven years, generating around 2,300 jobs. Among them are IKEA who has most of its headquarter functions based in Malm\u00f6.The number of start-up companies is high in Malm\u00f6. Around 7 new companies are started every day in Malm\u00f6. In 2010, the renewal of the number of companies amounted to 13.9%, which exceeds both Stockholm and Gothenburg. Especially strong growth is in the gaming area with Massive entertainment and King being the flagship companies for the industry. Among the industries that continue to increase their share of companies in Malm\u00f6 are transport, financial and business services, entertainment, leisure and construction.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMalm\u00f6 has the country's ninth-largest school of higher education, Malm\u00f6 University, established in 1998. It has 1,600 employees and 24,000 students (2014).\nIn addition nearby Lund University (established in 1666) has some education located in Malm\u00f6:\n\nMalm\u00f6 Art Academy (Konsth\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nMalm\u00f6 Academy of Music (Musikh\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nMalm\u00f6 Theatre Academy (Teaterh\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nThe Faculty of Medicine, which is located in both Malm\u00f6 and Lund.The United Nations World Maritime University is also located in Malm\u00f6. The World Maritime University (WMU) operates under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized agency of the United Nations. WMU thus enjoys the status, privileges and immunities of a UN institution in Sweden.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Film and television ===\nA striking depiction of Malm\u00f6 (in the 1930s) was made by Bo Widerberg in his debut film Kvarteret Korpen (Raven's End) (1963), largely shot in the shabby Korpen working-class district in Malm\u00f6. With humour and tenderness, it depicts the tensions between classes and generations.  The movie was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1965. In 2017, the film Medan Vi Lever (While We Live) was awarded the prize for best film by an African living abroad at the Africa Movie Academy Awards. It was filmed in Malm\u00f6 and Gambia, and deals with identity, integration and everyday racism.The cities of Malm\u00f6 and Copenhagen are, with the \u00d6resund Bridge, the main locations in the television series The Bridge (Bron/Broen).\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\nIn 1944, Malm\u00f6 Stadsteater (Malm\u00f6 Municipal Theatre) was established with a repertoire comprising stage theatre, opera, musical, ballet, musical recitals and experimental theatre. In 1993 it was split into three units, Dramatiska Teater (Dramatical Theatre), Malm\u00f6 Musikteater (Music Theatre) and Sk\u00e5nes Dansteater (Scanian Dance Theatre) and the name was abandoned. The ownership of the last two were transferred to Region Sk\u00e5ne in 2006 Dramatiska Teatern regained its old name. In the 1950s Ingmar Bergman was the Director and Chief Stage Director of Malm\u00f6 Stadsteater and many of his actors, like Max von Sydow and Ingrid Thulin became known through his films. Later stage directors include Staffan Valdemar Holm and G\u00f6ran Stangertz. Malm\u00f6 Musikteater were renamed Malm\u00f6 Operan and plays operas and musicals, classics as newly composed, on one of Scandinavia's large opera scenes with 1,511 seats. Sk\u00e5nes dansteater is active and plays contemporary dance repertory and present works by Swedish and international choreographers in their house in Malm\u00f6 harbor.Since the 1970s the city has also been home to independent theatre groups and show/musical companies. It also hosts a rock/dance/dub culture; in the 1960s The Rolling Stones played the Klubb Bongo, and in recent years stars like Morrissey, Nick Cave, B.B. King and Pat Metheny have made repeated visits.\nThe Cardigans debuted in Malm\u00f6 and recorded their albums there. On 7 January 2009 CNN Travel broadcast a segment called \"MyCity_MyLife\" featuring Nina Persson taking the camera to some of the sites in Malm\u00f6 that she enjoys.\nThe Rooseum Center for Contemporary Art, founded in 1988 by the Swedish art collector and financier Fredrik Roos and housed in a former power station which had been built in 1900, was one of the foremost centers for contemporary art in Europe during the 1980s and 1990s. By 2006, most of the collection had been sold off and the museum was on a time-out; by 2010 Rooseum had been dismantled and a subsidiary of the National Museum of Modern Art inaugurated in its place.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nIn 1992 and in 2013 Malm\u00f6 was the host of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nModerna Museet Malm\u00f6 was opened in December 2009  in the old Rooseum building. It is a part of the Moderna Museet, with independent exhibitions of modern and contemporary art. The collection of Moderna Museet holds key pieces of, among others, Marcel Duchamp, Louise Bourgeois, Pablo Picasso, Niki de Saint Phalle, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Carolee Schneemann, Henri Matisse and Robert RauschenbergMalm\u00f6 Museum (Malm\u00f6 Museer) is a municipal and regional museum. The museum features exhibitions on technology, shipping, natural history and history. Malm\u00f6 Museum has an aquarium and an art museum. Malm\u00f6hus Castle is also operated as a part of the museum.\nExhibitions are primarily shown at Slottsholmen and at the Technology and Maritime Museum (Teknikens och sj\u00f6fartens hus).Malm\u00f6 Konsthall is one of the largest exhibition halls in Europe for contemporary art, opened in 1975.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMalm\u00f6's oldest building is St. Peter's Church (Swedish: Sankt Petri). It was built in the early 14th century in Baltic Brick Gothic probably after St Mary's Church in L\u00fcbeck. The church is built with a nave, two aisles, a transept and a tower. Its exterior is characterized above all by the flying buttresses spanning its airy arches over the aisles and ambulatory. The tower, which fell down twice during the 15th century, got its current look in 1890. Another major church of significance is the Church of Our Saviour, Malm\u00f6, which was founded in 1870.\nAnother old building is Tunneln, 300 metres (1,000 ft) to the west of Sankt Petri Church, which also dates back to around 1300.\nThe oldest parts of Malm\u00f6 were built between 1300\u20131600 during its first major period of expansion. The central city's layout, as well as some of its oldest buildings, are from this time. Many of the smaller buildings from this time are typical Scanian: two-story urban houses that show a strong Danish influence.Recession followed in the ensuing centuries. The next expansion period was in the mid 19th century and led to the modern stone and brick city. This expansion lasted into the 20th century and can be seen by a number of Art Nouveau buildings, among those in the Malm\u00f6 synagogue. Malm\u00f6 was relatively late to be influenced by modern ideas of functionalist tenement architecture in the 1930s.\nAround 1965, the government initiated the so-called Million Programme, intending to offer affordable apartments in the outskirts of major Swedish cities. But this period also saw the reconstruction (and razing) of much of the historical city center.Since the late 1990s, Malm\u00f6 has seen a more cosmopolitan architecture. V\u00e4stra Hamnen (The Western Harbor), like most of the harbor to the north of the city center, was industrial. In 2001 its reconstruction began as an urban residential neighbourhood, with 500 residential units, most were part of the exhibition Bo01. The exhibition had two main objectives: develop self-sufficient housing units in terms of energy and greatly diminish phosphorus emissions. Among the new building's towers were the Turning Torso, a skyscraper with a twisting design, 190 metres (620 ft) tall, the majority of which is residential. It became Malm\u00f6's new landmark. The most recent addition (2015) is the new development of Malm\u00f6 Live. This new building features a hotel, a concert hall, congress hall and a sky bar in the center of Malm\u00f6. Point Hyllie is a new 110 m commercial tower that is under construction as of 2018.\n\n\n=== Other sights ===\n\nThe beach Ribersborg, by locals usually called Ribban, south-west of the harbor area, is a man-made shallow beach, stretching along Malm\u00f6's coastline. Despite Malm\u00f6's chilly climate, it is sometimes referred to as the \"Copacabana of Malm\u00f6\". It is the site of Ribersborgs open-air bath, opened in the 1890s.\nThe long boardwalk at The Western Harbor, Scaniaparken and Daniaparken, has become a favorite summer hang-out for the people of Malm\u00f6 and is a popular place for bathing. The harbor is particularly popular with Malm\u00f6's vibrant student community and has been the scene of several impromptu outdoor parties and gatherings.\n\n\n=== Annual events ===\n\nIn the third week of August each year a festival, Malm\u00f6festivalen, fills the streets of Malm\u00f6 with different kinds of cuisines and events.\nBUFF International Film Festival, an international children and young people's film festival, is held in Malm\u00f6 every year in March.\nNordisk Panorama \u2013 Nordic Short & Doc Film Festival, a film festival for short and documentary films by filmmakers from the Nordic countries, is held every year in September.\nMalm\u00f6 Arab Film Festival (MAFF), the largest Arabic film festival in Europe, is held in Malm\u00f6.\nThe Nordic Game conference takes place in Malm\u00f6 every April/May. The event consists of conference itself, recruitment expo and game expo and attracts hundreds of gamedev professionals every year.\nMalm\u00f6 also hosts other 3rd party events that cater to all communities that reside in Malm\u00f6, including religious and political celebrations.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nSydsvenskan, founded in 1870, is Malm\u00f6's largest daily newspaper. It has an average circulation of 130,000. Its main competitor is the regional daily Sk\u00e5nska Dagbladet, which has a circulation of 34,000. The tabloid Kv\u00e4llsposten still has a minimal editorial staff but is today just a version of a Stockholm tabloid. The Social Democratic Arbetet was edited and printed at Malm\u00f6 between 1887 and 2000.In addition to these, a number of free-of-charge papers, generally dealing with entertainment, music and fashion have local editions (for instance City, Rodeo, Metro and N\u00f6jesguiden). Malm\u00f6 is also home to the Egmont Group's Swedish magazine operations. A number of local and regional radio and TV broadcasters are based in the Greater Malm\u00f6 area.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\n\n==== Football ====\n\nSports in southern Sweden are dominated by football. Over the years the city's best football teams have been Malm\u00f6 FF who play in the top-level Allsvenskan Malm\u00f6 FF had their most successful periods in the 1970s and 1980s when they won the league several times. In 1979, they advanced to the final of the European Cup defeating AS Monaco, Dynamo Kiew, Wisla Krakow and Austria Wien (Vienna) but lost in the final at the Munich Olympic Stadium against Nottingham Forest by a single goal just before half time scored by Trevor Francis. To date, they are the only Swedish football club to have reached the final of the competition. Malm\u00f6 FF is the club where for instance, Bosse Larsson and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 began their football careers.  A second football team, IFK Malm\u00f6 played in Sweden's top flight for about 20 years and the club's quarterfinal in the European Cup is the club's greatest achievement in its history. Today, the club resides in the sixth tier of the Swedish league system.\nFC Roseng\u00e5rd (former LdB Malm\u00f6) are playing in the top level in Damallsvenskan, women's football league. FC Roseng\u00e5rd girls have won the league 10 times and the national cup title 5 times. In 2014, they reached the semi-final in Champions League, which they ultimately went on to lose to the German side 1. FFC Frankfurt. Brazilian football player Marta, widely regarded the best female football player of all time, played in FC Roseng\u00e5rd between 2014 and 2017.\nAt the 1958 FIFA World Cup Malm\u00f6 Stadion was inaugurated in combination with the opening match of the cup, as World Champions West Germany defeated Argentina 3\u20131, in front of 31,156, a record attendance for Malm\u00f6 in general. Another two games were decided at the stadium.\n\n\n==== Other sports ====\nMalm\u00f6 has athletes competing in a variety of sport.\n\n\n===== Ice hockey =====\nThe most notable other sports team is the ice hockey team Malm\u00f6 Redhawks. They were the creation of millionaire Percy Nilsson and quickly rose to the highest rank in the early to mid-1990s and won two Swedish championships, but for a number of years have found themselves residing outside of the top flight. \n\n\n===== Handball =====\nA first division handball team, HK Malm\u00f6, attracts a fair amount of attendance. \n\n\n===== Rugby =====\nRugby union team, Malm\u00f6 RC, founded in 1954, have won 6 national championships. The club has teams for men, women and juniors.\n\n\n===== Gaelic football =====\nGaelic football has also been introduced to Malm\u00f6.

          "My partner and I went here just as two adults and really enjoyed the museum - there was a fantastic photo exhibition called 'Adropocen' while we were there which was extremely powerful, as well as the more fun and child friendly things like the submarine you can climb inside.",
          "We had such a great time in there, there's a part that's more of an exhibition but with plenty of interactive details and there's a experimental portion where you can try all sorts of physical experiments, it must be really educational and interesting for younger teens although",
          "I used to bring my kids here very often they loved it then and they still love it. Great for you kids and older ones. It\u2019s been newly renovated. Still think they could use a cafe and more welcoming entrance.",

          "This was a great museum with well put together and interesting displays of trains, cars and other technology. The best bit was being able to go into a real submarine. My 6ft 2in husband was definitely not built for submarines but we had a lot of fun! The ticket was only about",
          "We were looking forward to visiting this museum so were disappointed that it was closed for renovations until October 2019. However the surrounding area with the fishermen's houses were very nice.",
          "An old but interesting museum about the old days with cars, inventions, MC, aeroplanes and how people lived. There is an updated (newer) level where you can test more by yourself, with a blue screen, IR-camera, wind effects, strength and many more things. Family-friendly",
          "An interesting museum and with the ticket you can also visit Malmo castle. There is a real submarine with crew members possible to enter",
          "This is an awesome and must see museum in Malmo. There are several different exhibits to visit and lots of different things to see. There was a real submarine that you could go inside, and even some crew members that served were there talking to people. I've been to this place",
          "The museum is worth a visit even if you visit Malmo for one day. The ticket price is really low (40SEK= around 4 euro/$). By using this ticket you can also visit a small natural history museum and the Malmo castle. I reccomend it to people (younger and older) interested in",
          "It is quite attractive museum, not a big museum but enough to make visitors busy for 1-2 hours. Plenty of technology displays related to maritime stuffs, old tools and stuffs, air planes, motor cycles and bicycles, cars, horse drawn cart, old machines, old small locomotives, and",
          "I've been surprised by this museum. I wanted to visit it for the submarine (they have an entire submarine you can get into on Tuesdays and Sundays - if i'm not mistaken), but everything else was just as cool. Trains, automobiles and different machines. There's also a section",

          "Went two grown ups and three kids 9,10 and 12. The first two floors are filled with all kinds of machines and engines and also a few science bits. The submarine is really cool for all to go in to. All of us found the top floor the best though with all the experiments and things",
          "We spent this day in Malmo visiting the science and technology museum which is part of the castle...which contains MORE museum. The Tekniska museum though was so compelling we were there 4 hours...wandering through the submarine, looking at the development and future of cars,",

          "I'll preface this by saying I'm very biased in favor of technology and transportation type museums, but I enjoyed this museum a lot more than I thought I would. I came here mainly because it was free with the Malmohus admission, but it was nice. There were exhibits on many",

          "Don't miss the top floor, especially if acompanied by young persons. Stimulates interest in science. Exhibitions need time to take in and are for enthusiasts of 'planes and cars. Sub is unique in that you can go through it, with difficulty as doors are tight and space tighter.",
          "The exhibitions haven't really changed in three decades, and a lot of stuff is outdated. The 'ide planet' on the top floor doesn't look too inviting anymore -- some of the stuff was broken, and the camera/speed experiment wasn't properly explained. We had the place more or less",

          "A small, funky museum we liked far more than we expected. Only 40 krona admission. One half was about Malmo. Moderately interesting. Fun to see what a kitchen from the '50s looked like. We liked the Muscles to Machine Power better. The machines that shaped local history.",
          "Alright for spending an hour or two and if you have kids they will probably get something from it. about \u00a34 to get in so pretty cheap. Tells you about Swedish inventions and discoveries but not really very modern of exciting to look at.",
          "This place was like several museums in one - if you go right, it took you into an area of artifacts and items from 20th century Malmo. But the arrangement of items was very difficult to understand, since the organizing principles were unclear. It seemed very random, so it was",

          "The museum has some nice objects from the history of science and technology, most obbvious are objects from the history of transportation. More remarkable appear the objects related to Tycho Brahe on the first floor, they have a nice way of contextualising him and his work. The",
          "Lived in Malm\u00f6 for almost eight years now and visited the technical museum first now. The exhibition about the Tv-serie BROn(The Bridge) was in my focus. A bit tiny but well made. The submarine was another given attraction. Next time I will make sure I have more time because",

          "Well worth the visit. We paid to get in to Malmo Castle on the same street and had entry to this museum included. The Submarine was amazing. You can actually go inside. There was a man on board who told us lots of interesting facts and was really enthusiastic. The planes, bikes",
          "Very interesting museum with plenty of exhibits: old cars, airplanes, ships and a hit - submarine! We enjoyed also part of the museum with experiments. Buying a ticket to this museum in the price there is also admission to the museum in the castle (we had not enough time to see",

          "A must if in Malm\u00f8. Museum very close to Malm\u00f8hus, good parking close by. A museum for young and old, telling a lot about the swedish industri, cars-Volvo, airkraft-Saab, u-boat-Kochums and a lot more. Full scale U-boat were you can go in and realy file how narrow every thing",
          "I enjoyed this even more than the castle. It is a bit of a kiddie museum, but with some really cool stuff. I came for the submarine. I had been on a similar sized one in Pearl Harbor, but this was excellent. They have removed the periscope and you can look around the",
          "Very many and interesting things exposed in these museum. We were most impresed by the real planes, trains and even military submarine exposed, where you can touch and feel everything. Highly recommend especially for children!",
          "A good one day visit from Denmark. The museum is def better than the Malmo castle. I just loved the submarine. The car exhibits were good. A good way to spend a day in Malmo",
          "1) First of all, note: this museum, and the submarine U3, are NOT in the Museum Malmo / Malmohus Slott in the middle of the moat per the map. That's a different museum (and aquarium). Admission to one grants admission to the other, but this is a separate building across the road",
          "We went here to find out more about the submarine that is located here, and which you can enter and see from the inside. Very fun - but we also found the other parts of the museum very fun and intresting.",

          "We started our visit at the submarine.the kids loved it.later we went through the various parts of the museum and the kids were interested in everything. This was a great expreiuand we didn't even go through the entire place. A great way to spend half a day. The same ticket was",
          "A bit of everything ...engines, trolley car, submarine you can enter with sailors to explain life onboard.",
          "I went with my friends on our day trip to Malm\u00f6. It's definitely a great place for kids, but it was still fun for us as college students. The whole museum had cool things that were very interesting to read about. The top floor had interactive science games, which were so much",
          "I went there with my children and we liked it a lot. We went there for 2 days in a row. We really liked and the children were busy all the time. I will be back there. Across the street is another museum \"Stadsmuseum\" and that was also very good museum.",

          "Would you like to enter an U-boat or take a close look on a SAAB jetfigther or an old tram this is the place. You can easily use 2 or 3 hours in this part of the Malm\u00f6 Museums...",
          "So hands on that everyone I talk to about this place loves it!! My two year old loves to touch everything and have a run around the play area at the bottom and my dad loved walking round and seeing how things worked and reminding himself of his past as an engineer!",
          "It doesn't look much from the outside but there's much more that it seems. All sorts of science from Swedish invention to cars, aircraft and a submarine.",
          "Small interesting museum with displays about science and technology in Sweden. The high point of any visit is going inside a Swedish submarine with a guided tour by a former submariner, who was a member of the boat's crew.",
          "This is part of a package ticket when you go to the museum. It is well worth a stop. The models are well built--lots to see. The displays are well done and there is ample signage in English. The building is good looking and well maintained. There is a U boat that you can",
          "The museum is a perfect spot to bring Children between 5 and 15 with lots of technical activities. Among others a submarine you can walk inside in and get a feeling for how tough life underwater is. Also old trains and aircrafts.",
          "This museum at first glance looks to be a bit small and perhaps somewhere to entertain the kids for an hour or two. However, the more time you invest in the exhibits, the more you will gain in return. The highlight is the WW2 submarine. Impressively large from the outside but",
          "If you have young children to entertain then this is well worth a visit. It is located across the road from Malmo castle, and on the edge of Kungsparken (the King's Park). The museum contains several aircraft, a submarine that you can explore and various entertaining child",
          "This is a bit worn down, some exhibitions are really not so well composed but it is very accessable especially for small kids. They can get near a lot of stuff, it is not too big and there is a bit of a human touch to it, not so institutional",
          "It's a good place to go if you have time and don't really know what to do. There was a lot of kids when I went, so it was really lively.",
          "There's a lot to see in the museum and I think the going inside a submarine was the highlight. There were a lot of children there when I visited and parts of the museum dedicated to children's activities. I bought a combined ticket for this museum and the art gallery/castle down",

          "One of the best museum i have ever visited. You can see a lot of of cool and interesting things,touch them, see how they work, learn something new. Most of all i was impressed by science exibit, a must-visit place if you have kids! They will come out smarter then they were when",
          "We spent a great couple of hours around this museum, there is lots to see and do and we were surprised at how cheap it was! All of the exhibits were great and despite it being a busy Saturday we still felt like there was room to explore and read the English explanations.",

          "We were visiting Malmo and looking for places to go. This was high up on the list and it did not disappoint. Well to start with it did, purely because some of the write ups had no english. We kept going round and more and more started to appear. The power room was great,",
          "Very nice museum. Cheap enough to get in and a good range of things to see. The submarine is amazing and worth the entrance fee on its won",

          "It doesn't matter how old you are or if you aced or flunked science, this suits everyone! Visit an actual submarine, go experimenting, learn about air crafts, cars and boats. Perfect when tired of the beach in the summer or tired of the apartment a rainy winter day.",
          "Literally planes, trains and automobiles plus a lot of social history from Sweden. All exhibits in English and Swedish. There was a lot to see and it is worth half a day. Scrambling through the submarine is fun. Kids will love a special area in the basement for them to play in.",
          "Among the usual techical stuff there are some cars, aircraft and even a U-boat you can visit. The ticket also give you entrance to the bigger \"Malm\u00f6 Museum\" some houndred yards away.",
          "Very interesting place to see how technology has evolved in terms of maritime. One can go inside a decommissioned submarine.",
          "This museum contains some exhibits that might be of use or interest to children but falls far short of being spectacular. My husband and son enjoyed the U-boat - I found it claustrophobic bit that's my problem. The rest of the exhibits were mildly interesting. a shame really.",
          "It was a nice exhibit, I have to say that it was a bit short. I also saw the permanent exhibit. I would not have gone otherwise, but the entrance was cheap so I am happy I went. Love, love, love the submarine.",
          "GREAT museum for kids or adults who like interactive museums :) My toddler had a blast in every section of this museum, and so did I! It is interesting and fun, and should be top on anyone's list who is visiting the area (southern Sweden, Denmark, wherever!) It is worth a side",
          "I visited the castle which is surrounded by a moat. There is a picnic courtyard and fashion museum in the castle. There are two other museums nearby-the commandants house and technical museum. Of the three the technical museum is great. Amongst an eclectic mix are lots of",
          "Housed in the Malmoe castle, this museum is probably its best attraction. Vintage locomotives, tractors and motorcycles are on display, as well as very old fire truck, a submarine and a fighter jet.",
          "If you have the time, you should drop by this museum. It has the history of technology here, you will even find a submarine where you can go in and see the inside.",
          "Whilst the focus of the museum is sometimes a bit lost, yes it says maritime, but it doesn't stick to that, its all a bit jumbled, anyway, its also fun. Enjoyed the visit, especially the sub, U3. The best bit was that there was english words every where, worth taking the kids if",
          "As part of our trip to Copenhagen, we decided to travel across the \u00d8resund Bridge and spend the day in Malmo. After a breezy walk to look at the Turning Torso, we entered the museum which was very reasonable - 80 SEK (US$12.60) for two adults and two children (who were free!).",
          "For young children this is a great spot to visit. Plains, cars, trains and the submarine. All there to be seen and touched. Not expensive. Only thing that is missing a museum cafeteria, although they have a good inside picknick spot where you can eat your own sandwiches.",
          "Visited Sweden for the day from Copenhagen. Museum was great, easy to find with a quick map from the tourist info just outside the station. 10 minute walk to find it and 40 Sek each adult. Displays are good, with signs in English and Swedish. Not too much on display but loads",
          "I went to the museum as a part of my \"museum tour\" - 4 different museums in Malmo for one price - and I loved it. Although I am not a technical geek, I can imagine how enthusiastic could they be (children, daddies, grandfathers ;-))! I spent almost 2 hours there, the best part",
          "Highlight was the submarine which you could walk inside and see how cramped working conditions were. Rest of displays whilst interesting was nothing really extraordinary.",
          "Saw the review and went to this with a younger child (5-10 years). Great interactive museum - one of the most enjoyable we have found with lots of hands on activities. Really glad we found and others should look for this. We spent nearly 3 hours.",
          "Great for kids, not really big in size but very attractive museum, a submarine, a first dialysis machine that was introduced in Lund, several aircrafts, an old air traffic control. Tower, a very historical place to understand Sweden's origin and discoveries.",
          "People are normally turned off when it comes to Technology and Maritime, especially when you use them in the same sentence as Museum. Perhaps it's because we went along with such low expectations but we had such a good time here! The exhibits are, themselves, very interesting",
          "You're allowed to sit in/on some of the vehicles, which was fun. There's some good info about \"varied stuff\" (in English) and you can go in the submarine. I like places that let you touch and climb on and interact and this does it, has a bit of info about Malmo/Sweden but it's",
          "One of those rare finds, a museum with exhibits you can interact with. A fire engine, a motorbike and best of all the sub! Really wanted to see this just for the novelty value, it's a lot easier to imagine the 35 men in their cold, cramped claustrophobic conditions, working with",
          "What a fantastic place, staff so friendly and helpful.. And so many different wonderful things to see, my son of 8yrs and his uncle loved playing on the vehicles and the u3 submarine.. What a place and the castle the other side wow!",
          "Just along from the Malm\u00f6hus, with metered parking in front of the castle. It would be very easy to play the smug cosmopolitan card as soon as you walk through the doors of this museum, and if you have sullen teenagers in tow they may well hate you for bringing them in here.",
          "I only visited part of the museum, the part with the submarine and some jet engines and also the mezzanine with a natural history exhibition. It was beautiful, and I should know, I am a museum studies grad. The one thing I love about Scandinavian museums is that there are areas",
          "Very attractive price for a visit - SEK 40 (children under 19 - f.o.c.!), especially after Copenhagen. Interesting exibits of technology, impressive submarine with real ex-marines telling about it. The third store of the museum is extemelly interesting for both teens and adults.",
          "This was amazing value for money. It cost around \u00a38 for a family of four and we spent a good four hours in just the Technology and maritime museum - the ticket allows you to access the historical museum also. There are lots of hands on science exhibits, they were fascinating",
          "This is art of Malmo Musee so see that for more details. Lots to see and do here for everyone. There was an exhibition about astronomy and about discoveries made in Sweden. As someone on dialysis I was fascinated to discover that the first dialysis machine was developed in",
          "Great for adults too. This place kept our kids amused for a few hours while the rain fell outside. We were surprised to see a full submarine to walk/climb through, the third level is all hands on challenges and there's several aircraft inside. Overall great value and more",
          "Really good for children as there is an indoor play area. Lots to see. Inside a submarine, an old air traffic control tower, cars past and present to mention just a few. \u00a34 ish for a ticket that also covered the art/natural history/aquarium (aquarium was the best bit) museum.",
          "As the combined ticket price of 40SEK covers so much - don't miss this if you like the history of transport and travel in Sweden. It's got a lot for the kids with little interactive features and even for bigger kids with planes, boats and cars. The exhibition on life in Sweden",
          "My husband and I had visited the Malm\u00f6hus Castle and the visit to the Technology and Maritime Museum was included in our ticket. My husband being a great technology and maritime fan we knew we could not miss this museum. We decided to walk the short walk to the museum."

        "wiki": "Malm\u00f6 (; Swedish: [\u02c8m\u00e2lm\u00f8\u02d0] (listen); Danish: Malm\u00f8 [\u02c8m\u00e6lm\u02cc\u00f8\u02c0]) is the largest city in the Swedish county (l\u00e4n) of Sk\u00e5ne (Scania). It is the third-largest city in Sweden, after Stockholm and Gothenburg, and the sixth-largest city in Scandinavia, with a population of 316,588 (municipal total 338,230 in 2018). The Malm\u00f6 Metropolitan Region is home to over 700,000 people, and the \u00d8resund Region, which includes Malm\u00f6, is home to 4 million people.Malm\u00f6 was one of the earliest and most industrialized towns in Scandinavia, but it struggled to adapt to post-industrialism. Since the construction of the \u00d6resund Bridge, Malm\u00f6 has undergone a major transformation, producing new architectural developments, supporting new biotech and IT companies, and attracting students through Malm\u00f6 University and other higher education facilities. The city contains many historic buildings and parks, and is also a commercial center for the western part of Scania.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest written mention of Malm\u00f6 as a city dates from 1275. It is thought to have been founded shortly before that date, as a fortified quay or ferry berth of the Archbishop of Lund, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) to the north-east. Malm\u00f6 was for centuries Denmark's second-biggest city. Its original name was Malmhaug (with alternate spellings), meaning \"Gravel pile\" or \"Ore Hill\".\nIn the 15th century, Malm\u00f6 became one of Denmark's largest and most visited cities, reaching a population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. It became the most important city around the \u00d8resund, with the German Hanseatic League frequenting it as a marketplace, and was notable for its flourishing herring fishery. In 1437, King Eric of Pomerania (King of Denmark from 1396 to 1439) granted the city's arms: argent with a griffin gules, based on Eric's arms from Pomerania. The griffin's head as a symbol of Malm\u00f6 extended to the entire province of Scania from 1660.\nIn 1434, a new citadel was constructed at the beach south of the town. This fortress, known today as Malm\u00f6hus, did not take its current form until the mid-16th century. Several other fortifications were constructed, making Malm\u00f6 Sweden's most fortified city, but only Malm\u00f6hus remains.\n\nLutheran teachings spread during the 16th century Protestant Reformation, and Malm\u00f6 became one of the first cities in Scandinavia to fully convert (1527\u20131529) to this Protestant denomination.\nIn the 17th century, Malm\u00f6 and the Scanian region (Sk\u00e5neland) came under control of Sweden following the Treaty of Roskilde with Denmark, signed in 1658. Fighting continued, however; in June 1677, 14,000 Danish troops laid siege to Malm\u00f6 for a month, but were unable to defeat the Swedish troops holding it.\nBy the dawn of the 18th century, Malm\u00f6 had about 2,300 inhabitants. However, owing to the wars of Charles XII of Sweden (reigned 1697\u20131718) and to bubonic plague epidemics, the population dropped to 1,500 by 1727. The population did not grow much until the modern harbor was constructed in 1775. The city started to expand and the population in 1800 was 4,000. 15 years later, it had increased to 6,000.\n\nIn 1840, Frans Henrik Kockum founded the workshop from which the Kockums shipyard eventually developed as one of the largest shipyards in the world. The Southern Main Line was built between 1856 and 1864; this enabled Malm\u00f6 to become a center of manufacture, with major textile and mechanical industries. In 1870, Malm\u00f6 overtook Norrk\u00f6ping to become Sweden's third-most populous city, and by 1900 Malm\u00f6 had strengthened this position with 60,000 inhabitants. Malm\u00f6 continued to grow through the first half of the 20th century. The population had swiftly increased to 100,000 by 1915 and to 200,000 by 1952.\n\n\n=== 1900\u20131969 ===\n\nIn 1914 (15 May to 4 October) Malm\u00f6 hosted the Baltic Exhibition. The large park Pildammsparken was arranged and planted for this large event. The Russian part of the exhibition was never taken down, owing to the outbreak of World War I.\nOn 18 and 19 December 1914, the Three Kings Meeting was held in Malm\u00f6. After a somewhat infected period (1905\u20131914), which included the dissolution of the Swedish-Norwegian Union, King Oscar II was replaced with King H\u00e5kon VII in Norway, who was the younger brother of the Danish King Christian X. As Oscar died in 1907, and his son Gustav V became the new King of Sweden, the tensions within Scandinavia were still unclear, but during this historical meeting, the Scandinavian Kings found internal understanding, as well as a common line about remaining neutral in the ongoing war.\nWithin sports, Malm\u00f6 has mostly been associated with football. IFK Malm\u00f6 participated in the first ever edition of Allsvenskan 1924/25, but from the mid-1940s Malm\u00f6 FF started to rise, and ever since it has been one of the most prominent clubs within Swedish football. They have won Allsvenskan 23 times in all (as of February 2018) between 1943/44 and 2017.\n\n\n=== 1970s and later ===\nBy 1971, Malm\u00f6 reached 265,000 inhabitants, but this was the peak which would stand for more than 30 years. (Svedala was, for a few years in the early 1970s, a part of Malm\u00f6 municipality.)\nBy the mid-1970s Sweden experienced a recession that hit the industrial sector especially hard; shipyards and manufacturing industries suffered, which led to high unemployment in many cities of Scania. Kockums shipyard had become a symbol of Malm\u00f6 as its largest employer and, when shipbuilding ceased in 1986, confidence in the future of Malm\u00f6 plummeted among politicians and the public. In addition, many middle-class families moved into one-family houses in surrounding municipalities such as Vellinge Municipality, Lomma Municipality and Staffanstorp Municipality, which profiled themselves as the suburbs of the upper-middle class. By 1985, Malm\u00f6 had lost 35,000 inhabitants and was down to 229,000.The Swedish financial crises of the early 1990s exacerbated Malm\u00f6's decline as an industrial city; between 1990 and 1995 Malm\u00f6 lost about 27,000 jobs and its economy was seriously strained. However, from 1994 under the leadership of the then mayor Ilmar Reepalu, the city of Malm\u00f6 started to create a new economy as a center of culture and knowledge. Malm\u00f6 reached bottom in 1995, but that same year marked the commencement of the massive \u00d6resund Bridge road, railway and tunnel project, connecting it to Copenhagen and to the rail lines of Europe. The new Malm\u00f6 University opened in 1998 on Kockums' former dockside. Further redevelopment of the now disused south-western harbor followed; a city architecture exposition (Bo01) was held in the area in 2001, and its buildings and villas form the core of a new city district. Designed with attractive waterfront vistas, it was intended to be and has been successful in attracting the urban middle-class.\nSince 1974, the Kockums Crane had been a landmark in Malm\u00f6 and a symbol of the city's manufacturing industry, but in 2002 it was disassembled and moved to South Korea. In 2005, Malm\u00f6 gained a new landmark with completion of Turning Torso, the tallest skyscraper in Scandinavia. Although the transformation from a city with its economic base in manufacturing has returned growth to Malm\u00f6, the new types of jobs have largely benefited the middle and upper classes.\nIn its 2015 and 2017 reports, Police in Sweden placed the Roseng\u00e5rd and the S\u00f6dra Sofielund/Seved district in the most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMalm\u00f6 is located at 13\u00b000' east and 55\u00b035' north, near the southwestern tip of Sweden, in the province of Scania.\nThe city is part of the transnational \u00d6resund Region and, since 2000, has been linked by the \u00d6resund Bridge across the \u00d6resund to Copenhagen, Denmark. The bridge opened on 1 July 2000, and measures 8 kilometres (5 miles) (the whole link totalling 16 km), with pylons reaching 204.5 metres (670.9 feet) vertically. Apart from the Helsingborg-Helsing\u00f8r ferry links further north, most ferry connections have been discontinued.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nMalm\u00f6, like the rest of southern Sweden, has an oceanic climate. Despite its northern location, the climate is mild compared to other locations at similar latitudes, mainly because of the influence of the Gulf Stream and also its westerly position on the Eurasian landmass. Owing to its northern latitude, daylight lasts 17 hours in midsummer, but only around seven hours in midwinter. According to data from 2002\u20132014 Falsterbo, to the south of the city, received an annual average of 1,895 hours of sunshine while Lund, to the north, received 1,803 hours. The sunshine data in the weather box is based on the data for Falsterbo.Summers are mild with average high temperatures of 20 to 23 \u00b0C (68 to 73 \u00b0F) and lows of around 11 to 13 \u00b0C (52 to 55 \u00b0F). Heat waves during the summer arise occasionally. Winters are fairly cold and windy, with temperatures steady between \u22123 to 4 \u00b0C (27 to 39 \u00b0F), but it rarely drops below \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F).\nRainfall is light to moderate throughout the year with 169 wet days. Snowfall occurs mainly in December through March, but snow covers do not remain for a long time, and some winters are virtually free of snow.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\u00d6resund Line trains cross the \u00d6resund Bridge every 20 minutes (hourly late night) connecting Malm\u00f6 to Copenhagen, and the Copenhagen Airport. The trip takes around 35\u201340 minutes. Additionally, some of the X 2000 and Intercity trains to Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Kalmar cross the bridge, stopping at Copenhagen Airport. In March 2005, excavation began on a new railway connection called the City Tunnel, which opened for traffic on 4 December 2010. The tunnel runs south from Malm\u00f6 Central Station through an underground station at the Triangeln railway station to Hylliev\u00e5ng (Hyllie Meadow). Then, the line comes to the surface to enter Hyllie Station, also created as part of the tunnel project. From Hyllie Station, the line connects to the existing \u00d6resund line in either direction, with the \u00d6resund Bridge lying due west.\nBesides the Copenhagen Airport, Malm\u00f6 has an airport of its own, Malm\u00f6 Airport, today chiefly used for domestic Swedish destinations, charter flights and low-cost carriers.\nThe motorway system has been incorporated with the \u00d6resund Bridge; the European route E20 goes over the bridge and then, together with the European route E6 follows the Swedish west coast from Malm\u00f6\u2013Helsingborg to Gothenburg. E6 goes further north along the west coast and through Norway to the Norwegian town Kirkenes at Barents Sea. The European route to J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping\u2013Stockholm (E4) starts at Helsingborg. Main roads in the directions of V\u00e4xj\u00f6\u2013Kalmar, Kristianstad\u2013Karlskrona, Ystad (E65), and Trelleborg start as freeways.\nMalm\u00f6 has 410 kilometres (250 mi) of bike paths; approximately 40% of all commuting is done by bicycle.\n\n\n=== Ports ===\nThe city has two industrial harbors; one is still in active use and is the largest Nordic port for car importation. It also has two marinas: the publicly owned Limhamn Marina (55\u00b035\u2032N 12\u00b055\u2032E) and the private Lagunen (55\u00b035\u2032N 12\u00b056\u2032E), both offering a limited number of guest docks.\nPublic transport consisted of a tram network from 1887 until 1973. Afterwards, it was replaced by a bus network.\n\n\n=== Malm\u00f6 S-Train ===\nA local train line with circular traffic at seven stations was opened in December 2018. The stations are Malm\u00f6 Central Station (underground platforms) \u2013 Triangeln station \u2013 Hyllie station \u2013 Malm\u00f6 South/Sv\u00e5gertorp \u2013 Persborg \u2013 Roseng\u00e5rd \u2013 \u00d6sterv\u00e4rn \u2013 Malm\u00f6 Central Station (main overground terminus). Some trains arrive from Kristianstad and finish with a lap around Malm\u00f6, whilst other trains at this circular line, never drive outside the city limits. There is at least a 30 minutes service between each departure, but far more between the Central Station and Hyllie. Extension plans of a minor network system exists.\n\n\n=== Proposed metro ===\nThe \u00d6resundsmetro is a proposed rapid transit network linking Malm\u00f6 with the existing Copenhagen Metro through a 22 km tunnel under the \u00d6resund.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nMalm\u00f6 Municipality is an administrative unit defined by geographical borders, consisting of the City of Malm\u00f6 and its immediate surroundings.\nMalm\u00f6 (Malm\u00f6 t\u00e4tort) consists of the urban part of the municipality together with the small town of Arl\u00f6v in the Burl\u00f6v Municipality. Both municipalities also include smaller urban areas and rural areas, such as the suburbs of Oxie and \u00c5karp. Malm\u00f6 t\u00e4tort is to be distinguished from Malm\u00f6 stad (the city of Malm\u00f6), which is a semi-official name of Malm\u00f6 Municipality.\nThe leaders in Malm\u00f6 created a commission for a socially sustainable Malm\u00f6 in November 2010. The commissions were tasked with providing evidence-based strategies for reducing health inequalities and improve living conditions for all citizens of Malm\u00f6, especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged and issued its final report in December 2013.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nMalm\u00f6 has a young population by Swedish standards, with almost half of the population under the age of 35 (48.2%).After 1971, Malm\u00f6 had 265,000 inhabitants, but the population then dropped to 229,000 by 1985. The total population of the urban area was 280,415 in December 2010. It then began to rise again, and had passed the previous record by the 1 January 2003 census, when it had 265,481 inhabitants. On 27 April 2011, the population of Malm\u00f6 reached the 300,000 mark. In 2017 the total population of the city was 316,588 inhabitants out of a municipal total of 338,230.In 2019, approximately 55.5% of the population of Malm\u00f6 municipality (190,849 residents) had at least one parent born abroad. The Middle East, Horn of Africa, former Yugoslavia and Denmark are the main sources of immigration. In addition, 14.8% (50 999 residents) of the population in 2019 were foreign nationals.Foreign-born population by country, 31 December 2018:\n\nGreater Malm\u00f6 is one of Sweden's three officially recognized metropolitan areas (storstadsomr\u00e5den) and since 2005 is defined as the municipality of Malm\u00f6 and 11 other municipalities in the southwestern corner of Scania. As of 2019, its population was recorded as 740,840. The region covers an area of 2,522 square kilometres (974 sq mi). The municipalities included, apart from Malm\u00f6, are Burl\u00f6v, Esl\u00f6v, H\u00f6\u00f6r, K\u00e4vlinge, Lomma, Lund, Skurup, Staffanstorp, Svedala, Trelleborg and Vellinge. Together with Lund, Malm\u00f6 is the region's economic and education hub.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Malm\u00f6 was traditionally based on shipbuilding (Kockums) and construction-related industries, such as concrete factories. The region's leading university, along with its associated hi-tech and pharmaceutical industries, is located in Lund about 16 kilometres (10 miles) to the north-east. As a result, Malm\u00f6 had a troubled economic situation following the mid-1970s. Between 1990\u20131995, 27,000 jobs were lost, and the budget deficit was more than one billion Swedish krona (SEK). In 1995, Malm\u00f6 had Sweden's highest unemployment rate.However, during the last two decades, there has been a revival. One contributing factor has been the economic integration with Denmark brought about by the \u00d6resund Bridge, which opened in July 2000. Also the university founded in 1998 and the effects of integration into the European Union have contributed. In 2017 the unemployment rate is still high but Malm\u00f6 has, in the last 20 years, had one of the strongest employment growth rates in Sweden. But a lot of those jobs are taken by workers outside the neighboring municipalities.As of 2016, the largest companies were:\nSkanska \u2013 heavy construction\nNobina \u2013 transport\nPostNord \u2013 postal services\nP\u00e5gen \u2013 bakery\nIKEA \u2013 furnitureAlmost 30 companies have moved their headquarters to Malm\u00f6 during the last seven years, generating around 2,300 jobs. Among them are IKEA who has most of its headquarter functions based in Malm\u00f6.The number of start-up companies is high in Malm\u00f6. Around 7 new companies are started every day in Malm\u00f6. In 2010, the renewal of the number of companies amounted to 13.9%, which exceeds both Stockholm and Gothenburg. Especially strong growth is in the gaming area with Massive entertainment and King being the flagship companies for the industry. Among the industries that continue to increase their share of companies in Malm\u00f6 are transport, financial and business services, entertainment, leisure and construction.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMalm\u00f6 has the country's ninth-largest school of higher education, Malm\u00f6 University, established in 1998. It has 1,600 employees and 24,000 students (2014).\nIn addition nearby Lund University (established in 1666) has some education located in Malm\u00f6:\n\nMalm\u00f6 Art Academy (Konsth\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nMalm\u00f6 Academy of Music (Musikh\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nMalm\u00f6 Theatre Academy (Teaterh\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nThe Faculty of Medicine, which is located in both Malm\u00f6 and Lund.The United Nations World Maritime University is also located in Malm\u00f6. The World Maritime University (WMU) operates under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized agency of the United Nations. WMU thus enjoys the status, privileges and immunities of a UN institution in Sweden.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Film and television ===\nA striking depiction of Malm\u00f6 (in the 1930s) was made by Bo Widerberg in his debut film Kvarteret Korpen (Raven's End) (1963), largely shot in the shabby Korpen working-class district in Malm\u00f6. With humour and tenderness, it depicts the tensions between classes and generations.  The movie was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1965. In 2017, the film Medan Vi Lever (While We Live) was awarded the prize for best film by an African living abroad at the Africa Movie Academy Awards. It was filmed in Malm\u00f6 and Gambia, and deals with identity, integration and everyday racism.The cities of Malm\u00f6 and Copenhagen are, with the \u00d6resund Bridge, the main locations in the television series The Bridge (Bron/Broen).\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\nIn 1944, Malm\u00f6 Stadsteater (Malm\u00f6 Municipal Theatre) was established with a repertoire comprising stage theatre, opera, musical, ballet, musical recitals and experimental theatre. In 1993 it was split into three units, Dramatiska Teater (Dramatical Theatre), Malm\u00f6 Musikteater (Music Theatre) and Sk\u00e5nes Dansteater (Scanian Dance Theatre) and the name was abandoned. The ownership of the last two were transferred to Region Sk\u00e5ne in 2006 Dramatiska Teatern regained its old name. In the 1950s Ingmar Bergman was the Director and Chief Stage Director of Malm\u00f6 Stadsteater and many of his actors, like Max von Sydow and Ingrid Thulin became known through his films. Later stage directors include Staffan Valdemar Holm and G\u00f6ran Stangertz. Malm\u00f6 Musikteater were renamed Malm\u00f6 Operan and plays operas and musicals, classics as newly composed, on one of Scandinavia's large opera scenes with 1,511 seats. Sk\u00e5nes dansteater is active and plays contemporary dance repertory and present works by Swedish and international choreographers in their house in Malm\u00f6 harbor.Since the 1970s the city has also been home to independent theatre groups and show/musical companies. It also hosts a rock/dance/dub culture; in the 1960s The Rolling Stones played the Klubb Bongo, and in recent years stars like Morrissey, Nick Cave, B.B. King and Pat Metheny have made repeated visits.\nThe Cardigans debuted in Malm\u00f6 and recorded their albums there. On 7 January 2009 CNN Travel broadcast a segment called \"MyCity_MyLife\" featuring Nina Persson taking the camera to some of the sites in Malm\u00f6 that she enjoys.\nThe Rooseum Center for Contemporary Art, founded in 1988 by the Swedish art collector and financier Fredrik Roos and housed in a former power station which had been built in 1900, was one of the foremost centers for contemporary art in Europe during the 1980s and 1990s. By 2006, most of the collection had been sold off and the museum was on a time-out; by 2010 Rooseum had been dismantled and a subsidiary of the National Museum of Modern Art inaugurated in its place.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nIn 1992 and in 2013 Malm\u00f6 was the host of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nModerna Museet Malm\u00f6 was opened in December 2009  in the old Rooseum building. It is a part of the Moderna Museet, with independent exhibitions of modern and contemporary art. The collection of Moderna Museet holds key pieces of, among others, Marcel Duchamp, Louise Bourgeois, Pablo Picasso, Niki de Saint Phalle, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Carolee Schneemann, Henri Matisse and Robert RauschenbergMalm\u00f6 Museum (Malm\u00f6 Museer) is a municipal and regional museum. The museum features exhibitions on technology, shipping, natural history and history. Malm\u00f6 Museum has an aquarium and an art museum. Malm\u00f6hus Castle is also operated as a part of the museum.\nExhibitions are primarily shown at Slottsholmen and at the Technology and Maritime Museum (Teknikens och sj\u00f6fartens hus).Malm\u00f6 Konsthall is one of the largest exhibition halls in Europe for contemporary art, opened in 1975.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMalm\u00f6's oldest building is St. Peter's Church (Swedish: Sankt Petri). It was built in the early 14th century in Baltic Brick Gothic probably after St Mary's Church in L\u00fcbeck. The church is built with a nave, two aisles, a transept and a tower. Its exterior is characterized above all by the flying buttresses spanning its airy arches over the aisles and ambulatory. The tower, which fell down twice during the 15th century, got its current look in 1890. Another major church of significance is the Church of Our Saviour, Malm\u00f6, which was founded in 1870.\nAnother old building is Tunneln, 300 metres (1,000 ft) to the west of Sankt Petri Church, which also dates back to around 1300.\nThe oldest parts of Malm\u00f6 were built between 1300\u20131600 during its first major period of expansion. The central city's layout, as well as some of its oldest buildings, are from this time. Many of the smaller buildings from this time are typical Scanian: two-story urban houses that show a strong Danish influence.Recession followed in the ensuing centuries. The next expansion period was in the mid 19th century and led to the modern stone and brick city. This expansion lasted into the 20th century and can be seen by a number of Art Nouveau buildings, among those in the Malm\u00f6 synagogue. Malm\u00f6 was relatively late to be influenced by modern ideas of functionalist tenement architecture in the 1930s.\nAround 1965, the government initiated the so-called Million Programme, intending to offer affordable apartments in the outskirts of major Swedish cities. But this period also saw the reconstruction (and razing) of much of the historical city center.Since the late 1990s, Malm\u00f6 has seen a more cosmopolitan architecture. V\u00e4stra Hamnen (The Western Harbor), like most of the harbor to the north of the city center, was industrial. In 2001 its reconstruction began as an urban residential neighbourhood, with 500 residential units, most were part of the exhibition Bo01. The exhibition had two main objectives: develop self-sufficient housing units in terms of energy and greatly diminish phosphorus emissions. Among the new building's towers were the Turning Torso, a skyscraper with a twisting design, 190 metres (620 ft) tall, the majority of which is residential. It became Malm\u00f6's new landmark. The most recent addition (2015) is the new development of Malm\u00f6 Live. This new building features a hotel, a concert hall, congress hall and a sky bar in the center of Malm\u00f6. Point Hyllie is a new 110 m commercial tower that is under construction as of 2018.\n\n\n=== Other sights ===\n\nThe beach Ribersborg, by locals usually called Ribban, south-west of the harbor area, is a man-made shallow beach, stretching along Malm\u00f6's coastline. Despite Malm\u00f6's chilly climate, it is sometimes referred to as the \"Copacabana of Malm\u00f6\". It is the site of Ribersborgs open-air bath, opened in the 1890s.\nThe long boardwalk at The Western Harbor, Scaniaparken and Daniaparken, has become a favorite summer hang-out for the people of Malm\u00f6 and is a popular place for bathing. The harbor is particularly popular with Malm\u00f6's vibrant student community and has been the scene of several impromptu outdoor parties and gatherings.\n\n\n=== Annual events ===\n\nIn the third week of August each year a festival, Malm\u00f6festivalen, fills the streets of Malm\u00f6 with different kinds of cuisines and events.\nBUFF International Film Festival, an international children and young people's film festival, is held in Malm\u00f6 every year in March.\nNordisk Panorama \u2013 Nordic Short & Doc Film Festival, a film festival for short and documentary films by filmmakers from the Nordic countries, is held every year in September.\nMalm\u00f6 Arab Film Festival (MAFF), the largest Arabic film festival in Europe, is held in Malm\u00f6.\nThe Nordic Game conference takes place in Malm\u00f6 every April/May. The event consists of conference itself, recruitment expo and game expo and attracts hundreds of gamedev professionals every year.\nMalm\u00f6 also hosts other 3rd party events that cater to all communities that reside in Malm\u00f6, including religious and political celebrations.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nSydsvenskan, founded in 1870, is Malm\u00f6's largest daily newspaper. It has an average circulation of 130,000. Its main competitor is the regional daily Sk\u00e5nska Dagbladet, which has a circulation of 34,000. The tabloid Kv\u00e4llsposten still has a minimal editorial staff but is today just a version of a Stockholm tabloid. The Social Democratic Arbetet was edited and printed at Malm\u00f6 between 1887 and 2000.In addition to these, a number of free-of-charge papers, generally dealing with entertainment, music and fashion have local editions (for instance City, Rodeo, Metro and N\u00f6jesguiden). Malm\u00f6 is also home to the Egmont Group's Swedish magazine operations. A number of local and regional radio and TV broadcasters are based in the Greater Malm\u00f6 area.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\n\n==== Football ====\n\nSports in southern Sweden are dominated by football. Over the years the city's best football teams have been Malm\u00f6 FF who play in the top-level Allsvenskan Malm\u00f6 FF had their most successful periods in the 1970s and 1980s when they won the league several times. In 1979, they advanced to the final of the European Cup defeating AS Monaco, Dynamo Kiew, Wisla Krakow and Austria Wien (Vienna) but lost in the final at the Munich Olympic Stadium against Nottingham Forest by a single goal just before half time scored by Trevor Francis. To date, they are the only Swedish football club to have reached the final of the competition. Malm\u00f6 FF is the club where for instance, Bosse Larsson and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 began their football careers.  A second football team, IFK Malm\u00f6 played in Sweden's top flight for about 20 years and the club's quarterfinal in the European Cup is the club's greatest achievement in its history. Today, the club resides in the sixth tier of the Swedish league system.\nFC Roseng\u00e5rd (former LdB Malm\u00f6) are playing in the top level in Damallsvenskan, women's football league. FC Roseng\u00e5rd girls have won the league 10 times and the national cup title 5 times. In 2014, they reached the semi-final in Champions League, which they ultimately went on to lose to the German side 1. FFC Frankfurt. Brazilian football player Marta, widely regarded the best female football player of all time, played in FC Roseng\u00e5rd between 2014 and 2017.\nAt the 1958 FIFA World Cup Malm\u00f6 Stadion was inaugurated in combination with the opening match of the cup, as World Champions West Germany defeated Argentina 3\u20131, in front of 31,156, a record attendance for Malm\u00f6 in general. Another two games were decided at the stadium.\n\n\n==== Other sports ====\nMalm\u00f6 has athletes competing in a variety of sport.\n\n\n===== Ice hockey =====\nThe most notable other sports team is the ice hockey team Malm\u00f6 Redhawks. They were the creation of millionaire Percy Nilsson and quickly rose to the highest rank in the early to mid-1990s and won two Swedish championships, but for a number of years have found themselves residing outside of the top flight. \n\n\n===== Handball =====\nA first division handball team, HK Malm\u00f6, attracts a fair amount of attendance. \n\n\n===== Rugby =====\nRugby union team, Malm\u00f6 RC, founded in 1954, have won 6 national championships. The club has teams for men, women and juniors.\n\n\n===== Gaelic football =====\nGaelic football has also been introduced to Malm\u00f6. The men of Malm\u00f6 G.A.A. have won the Scandinavian Championships twice and the women once.\n\n\n===== Additional Team and Individual Sport =====\nOther notable team a sports are baseball, American football and Australian football.\nAmong non-team sports, badminton and athletics are the most popular, together with east Asian martial arts and boxing. Basketball is also fairly a big sport in the city, including the clubs Malbas and SF Srbija among others.\nWomen are permitted by the city council to swim topless in public swimming pools. Everyone must wear bathing attire, but covering of the breasts is not mandatory.\n\n\n== Notable events ==\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nScania\nMalm\u00f6 Bulltofta Airport\nChapter 4 Concerning the Friary in Malm\u00f8 in Chronicle of the Expulsion of the Greyfriars\nList of governors of Malm\u00f6hus County\nPorts of the Baltic Sea\n\n\n== References ==\nFacts & Figures about Malm\u00f6, 2005 at the Wayback Machine (archived 7 October 2006) \u2013 in English.

          "Set on 3 floors, with a coffee shop, exhibition centre and shop the modern designs are certainly interesting and worth a look. What spoilt it for me was that on leaving I noticed the vicious looking spikes placed on the yellow wall in the courtyard to prevent birds from sitting.",
          "I unfortunately visited there fifteen to five when the center would be closed so not ver much time to get better acquainted to art pieces. A museum shop and wooden items ware was to be seen. Neither the cafe was open",

        "wiki": "Dania Park, also known as Daniaparken, is located on the Bo01 district in Malm\u00f6, Sweden and was designed by architects Thorbj\u00f6rn Andersson and PeGe Hillinge of SWECO FFS Architects in 1999. Aside from being the first park in over 50 years to be built in the city, it is also a former Saab factory, because of which the site's contamination made it unsuitable for large plant planting, thus the area is mostly grass covered, but is mostly characterized by terraces, platforms and balconies which overlook the \u00d6resund Sound.\n\n\n== Features ==\nThis park features a number of facilities and elements which makes the site unique. To counter the flatness of the site due to the lack of vertical elements such as trees, a number of terraces, balconies and platforms are located throughout the area. A grassy area facilitates \"al-fresco\" seating and allows for relaxation, reading, sunbathing, and other leisure activities. Stairs are also located throughout the coastline which allows visitors to access the water level. This makes the site intimately connected to the waterfront and is why most of the activities are oriented towards the sound. This same element is the parks downfall during the winter cold. The openness and lack of cover, except for a granite wall which provides some areas of shelter and seating, makes the site usable for only the warmer part of the year. On the other hand, features like the 25' wooden wall that lies waterside, although unintended, gives bathers a wall to climb and an adventurous element to the site.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Malm\u00f6 (; Swedish: [\u02c8m\u00e2lm\u00f8\u02d0] (listen); Danish: Malm\u00f8 [\u02c8m\u00e6lm\u02cc\u00f8\u02c0]) is the largest city in the Swedish county (l\u00e4n) of Sk\u00e5ne (Scania). It is the third-largest city in Sweden, after Stockholm and Gothenburg, and the sixth-largest city in Scandinavia, with a population of 316,588 (municipal total 338,230 in 2018). The Malm\u00f6 Metropolitan Region is home to over 700,000 people, and the \u00d8resund Region, which includes Malm\u00f6, is home to 4 million people.Malm\u00f6 was one of the earliest and most industrialized towns in Scandinavia, but it struggled to adapt to post-industrialism. Since the construction of the \u00d6resund Bridge, Malm\u00f6 has undergone a major transformation, producing new architectural developments, supporting new biotech and IT companies, and attracting students through Malm\u00f6 University and other higher education facilities. The city contains many historic buildings and parks, and is also a commercial center for the western part of Scania.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest written mention of Malm\u00f6 as a city dates from 1275. It is thought to have been founded shortly before that date, as a fortified quay or ferry berth of the Archbishop of Lund, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) to the north-east. Malm\u00f6 was for centuries Denmark's second-biggest city. Its original name was Malmhaug (with alternate spellings), meaning \"Gravel pile\" or \"Ore Hill\".\nIn the 15th century, Malm\u00f6 became one of Denmark's largest and most visited cities, reaching a population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. It became the most important city around the \u00d8resund, with the German Hanseatic League frequenting it as a marketplace, and was notable for its flourishing herring fishery. In 1437, King Eric of Pomerania (King of Denmark from 1396 to 1439) granted the city's arms: argent with a griffin gules, based on Eric's arms from Pomerania. The griffin's head as a symbol of Malm\u00f6 extended to the entire province of Scania from 1660.\nIn 1434, a new citadel was constructed at the beach south of the town. This fortress, known today as Malm\u00f6hus, did not take its current form until the mid-16th century. Several other fortifications were constructed, making Malm\u00f6 Sweden's most fortified city, but only Malm\u00f6hus remains.\n\nLutheran teachings spread during the 16th century Protestant Reformation, and Malm\u00f6 became one of the first cities in Scandinavia to fully convert (1527\u20131529) to this Protestant denomination.\nIn the 17th century, Malm\u00f6 and the Scanian region (Sk\u00e5neland) came under control of Sweden following the Treaty of Roskilde with Denmark, signed in 1658. Fighting continued, however; in June 1677, 14,000 Danish troops laid siege to Malm\u00f6 for a month, but were unable to defeat the Swedish troops holding it.\nBy the dawn of the 18th century, Malm\u00f6 had about 2,300 inhabitants. However, owing to the wars of Charles XII of Sweden (reigned 1697\u20131718) and to bubonic plague epidemics, the population dropped to 1,500 by 1727. The population did not grow much until the modern harbor was constructed in 1775. The city started to expand and the population in 1800 was 4,000. 15 years later, it had increased to 6,000.\n\nIn 1840, Frans Henrik Kockum founded the workshop from which the Kockums shipyard eventually developed as one of the largest shipyards in the world. The Southern Main Line was built between 1856 and 1864; this enabled Malm\u00f6 to become a center of manufacture, with major textile and mechanical industries. In 1870, Malm\u00f6 overtook Norrk\u00f6ping to become Sweden's third-most populous city, and by 1900 Malm\u00f6 had strengthened this position with 60,000 inhabitants. Malm\u00f6 continued to grow through the first half of the 20th century. The population had swiftly increased to 100,000 by 1915 and to 200,000 by 1952.\n\n\n=== 1900\u20131969 ===\n\nIn 1914 (15 May to 4 October) Malm\u00f6 hosted the Baltic Exhibition. The large park Pildammsparken was arranged and planted for this large event. The Russian part of the exhibition was never taken down, owing to the outbreak of World War I.\nOn 18 and 19 December 1914, the Three Kings Meeting was held in Malm\u00f6. After a somewhat infected period (1905\u20131914), which included the dissolution of the Swedish-Norwegian Union, King Oscar II was replaced with King H\u00e5kon VII in Norway, who was the younger brother of the Danish King Christian X. As Oscar died in 1907, and his son Gustav V became the new King of Sweden, the tensions within Scandinavia were still unclear, but during this historical meeting, the Scandinavian Kings found internal understanding, as well as a common line about remaining neutral in the ongoing war.\nWithin sports, Malm\u00f6 has mostly been associated with football. IFK Malm\u00f6 participated in the first ever edition of Allsvenskan 1924/25, but from the mid-1940s Malm\u00f6 FF started to rise, and ever since it has been one of the most prominent clubs within Swedish football. They have won Allsvenskan 23 times in all (as of February 2018) between 1943/44 and 2017.\n\n\n=== 1970s and later ===\nBy 1971, Malm\u00f6 reached 265,000 inhabitants, but this was the peak which would stand for more than 30 years. (Svedala was, for a few years in the early 1970s, a part of Malm\u00f6 municipality.)\nBy the mid-1970s Sweden experienced a recession that hit the industrial sector especially hard; shipyards and manufacturing industries suffered, which led to high unemployment in many cities of Scania. Kockums shipyard had become a symbol of Malm\u00f6 as its largest employer and, when shipbuilding ceased in 1986, confidence in the future of Malm\u00f6 plummeted among politicians and the public. In addition, many middle-class families moved into one-family houses in surrounding municipalities such as Vellinge Municipality, Lomma Municipality and Staffanstorp Municipality, which profiled themselves as the suburbs of the upper-middle class. By 1985, Malm\u00f6 had lost 35,000 inhabitants and was down to 229,000.The Swedish financial crises of the early 1990s exacerbated Malm\u00f6's decline as an industrial city; between 1990 and 1995 Malm\u00f6 lost about 27,000 jobs and its economy was seriously strained. However, from 1994 under the leadership of the then mayor Ilmar Reepalu, the city of Malm\u00f6 started to create a new economy as a center of culture and knowledge. Malm\u00f6 reached bottom in 1995, but that same year marked the commencement of the massive \u00d6resund Bridge road, railway and tunnel project, connecting it to Copenhagen and to the rail lines of Europe. The new Malm\u00f6 University opened in 1998 on Kockums' former dockside. Further redevelopment of the now disused south-western harbor followed; a city architecture exposition (Bo01) was held in the area in 2001, and its buildings and villas form the core of a new city district. Designed with attractive waterfront vistas, it was intended to be and has been successful in attracting the urban middle-class.\nSince 1974, the Kockums Crane had been a landmark in Malm\u00f6 and a symbol of the city's manufacturing industry, but in 2002 it was disassembled and moved to South Korea. In 2005, Malm\u00f6 gained a new landmark with completion of Turning Torso, the tallest skyscraper in Scandinavia. Although the transformation from a city with its economic base in manufacturing has returned growth to Malm\u00f6, the new types of jobs have largely benefited the middle and upper classes.\nIn its 2015 and 2017 reports, Police in Sweden placed the Roseng\u00e5rd and the S\u00f6dra Sofielund/Seved district in the most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMalm\u00f6 is located at 13\u00b000' east and 55\u00b035' north, near the southwestern tip of Sweden, in the province of Scania.\nThe city is part of the transnational \u00d6resund Region and, since 2000, has been linked by the \u00d6resund Bridge across the \u00d6resund to Copenhagen, Denmark. The bridge opened on 1 July 2000, and measures 8 kilometres (5 miles) (the whole link totalling 16 km), with pylons reaching 204.5 metres (670.9 feet) vertically. Apart from the Helsingborg-Helsing\u00f8r ferry links further north, most ferry connections have been discontinued.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nMalm\u00f6, like the rest of southern Sweden, has an oceanic climate. Despite its northern location, the climate is mild compared to other locations at similar latitudes, mainly because of the influence of the Gulf Stream and also its westerly position on the Eurasian landmass. Owing to its northern latitude, daylight lasts 17 hours in midsummer, but only around seven hours in midwinter. According to data from 2002\u20132014 Falsterbo, to the south of the city, received an annual average of 1,895 hours of sunshine while Lund, to the north, received 1,803 hours. The sunshine data in the weather box is based on the data for Falsterbo.Summers are mild with average high temperatures of 20 to 23 \u00b0C (68 to 73 \u00b0F) and lows of around 11 to 13 \u00b0C (52 to 55 \u00b0F). Heat waves during the summer arise occasionally. Winters are fairly cold and windy, with temperatures steady between \u22123 to 4 \u00b0C (27 to 39 \u00b0F), but it rarely drops below \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F).\nRainfall is light to moderate throughout the year with 169 wet days. Snowfall occurs mainly in December through March, but snow covers do not remain for a long time, and some winters are virtually free of snow.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\u00d6resund Line trains cross the \u00d6resund Bridge every 20 minutes (hourly late night) connecting Malm\u00f6 to Copenhagen, and the Copenhagen Airport. The trip takes around 35\u201340 minutes. Additionally, some of the X 2000 and Intercity trains to Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Kalmar cross the bridge, stopping at Copenhagen Airport. In March 2005, excavation began on a new railway connection called the City Tunnel, which opened for traffic on 4 December 2010. The tunnel runs south from Malm\u00f6 Central Station through an underground station at the Triangeln railway station to Hylliev\u00e5ng (Hyllie Meadow). Then, the line comes to the surface to enter Hyllie Station, also created as part of the tunnel project. From Hyllie Station, the line connects to the existing \u00d6resund line in either direction, with the \u00d6resund Bridge lying due west.\nBesides the Copenhagen Airport, Malm\u00f6 has an airport of its own, Malm\u00f6 Airport, today chiefly used for domestic Swedish destinations, charter flights and low-cost carriers.\nThe motorway system has been incorporated with the \u00d6resund Bridge; the European route E20 goes over the bridge and then, together with the European route E6 follows the Swedish west coast from Malm\u00f6\u2013Helsingborg to Gothenburg. E6 goes further north along the west coast and through Norway to the Norwegian town Kirkenes at Barents Sea. The European route to J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping\u2013Stockholm (E4) starts at Helsingborg. Main roads in the directions of V\u00e4xj\u00f6\u2013Kalmar, Kristianstad\u2013Karlskrona, Ystad (E65), and Trelleborg start as freeways.\nMalm\u00f6 has 410 kilometres (250 mi) of bike paths; approximately 40% of all commuting is done by bicycle.\n\n\n=== Ports ===\nThe city has two industrial harbors; one is still in active use and is the largest Nordic port for car importation. It also has two marinas: the publicly owned Limhamn Marina (55\u00b035\u2032N 12\u00b055\u2032E) and the private Lagunen (55\u00b035\u2032N 12\u00b056\u2032E), both offering a limited number of guest docks.\nPublic transport consisted of a tram network from 1887 until 1973. Afterwards, it was replaced by a bus network.\n\n\n=== Malm\u00f6 S-Train ===\nA local train line with circular traffic at seven stations was opened in December 2018. The stations are Malm\u00f6 Central Station (underground platforms) \u2013 Triangeln station \u2013 Hyllie station \u2013 Malm\u00f6 South/Sv\u00e5gertorp \u2013 Persborg \u2013 Roseng\u00e5rd \u2013 \u00d6sterv\u00e4rn \u2013 Malm\u00f6 Central Station (main overground terminus). Some trains arrive from Kristianstad and finish with a lap around Malm\u00f6, whilst other trains at this circular line, never drive outside the city limits. There is at least a 30 minutes service between each departure, but far more between the Central Station and Hyllie. Extension plans of a minor network system exists.\n\n\n=== Proposed metro ===\nThe \u00d6resundsmetro is a proposed rapid transit network linking Malm\u00f6 with the existing Copenhagen Metro through a 22 km tunnel under the \u00d6resund.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nMalm\u00f6 Municipality is an administrative unit defined by geographical borders, consisting of the City of Malm\u00f6 and its immediate surroundings.\nMalm\u00f6 (Malm\u00f6 t\u00e4tort) consists of the urban part of the municipality together with the small town of Arl\u00f6v in the Burl\u00f6v Municipality. Both municipalities also include smaller urban areas and rural areas, such as the suburbs of Oxie and \u00c5karp. Malm\u00f6 t\u00e4tort is to be distinguished from Malm\u00f6 stad (the city of Malm\u00f6), which is a semi-official name of Malm\u00f6 Municipality.\nThe leaders in Malm\u00f6 created a commission for a socially sustainable Malm\u00f6 in November 2010. The commissions were tasked with providing evidence-based strategies for reducing health inequalities and improve living conditions for all citizens of Malm\u00f6, especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged and issued its final report in December 2013.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nMalm\u00f6 has a young population by Swedish standards, with almost half of the population under the age of 35 (48.2%).After 1971, Malm\u00f6 had 265,000 inhabitants, but the population then dropped to 229,000 by 1985. The total population of the urban area was 280,415 in December 2010. It then began to rise again, and had passed the previous record by the 1 January 2003 census, when it had 265,481 inhabitants. On 27 April 2011, the population of Malm\u00f6 reached the 300,000 mark. In 2017 the total population of the city was 316,588 inhabitants out of a municipal total of 338,230.In 2019, approximately 55.5% of the population of Malm\u00f6 municipality (190,849 residents) had at least one parent born abroad. The Middle East, Horn of Africa, former Yugoslavia and Denmark are the main sources of immigration. In addition, 14.8% (50 999 residents) of the population in 2019 were foreign nationals.Foreign-born population by country, 31 December 2018:\n\nGreater Malm\u00f6 is one of Sweden's three officially recognized metropolitan areas (storstadsomr\u00e5den) and since 2005 is defined as the municipality of Malm\u00f6 and 11 other municipalities in the southwestern corner of Scania. As of 2019, its population was recorded as 740,840. The region covers an area of 2,522 square kilometres (974 sq mi). The municipalities included, apart from Malm\u00f6, are Burl\u00f6v, Esl\u00f6v, H\u00f6\u00f6r, K\u00e4vlinge, Lomma, Lund, Skurup, Staffanstorp, Svedala, Trelleborg and Vellinge. Together with Lund, Malm\u00f6 is the region's economic and education hub.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Malm\u00f6 was traditionally based on shipbuilding (Kockums) and construction-related industries, such as concrete factories. The region's leading university, along with its associated hi-tech and pharmaceutical industries, is located in Lund about 16 kilometres (10 miles) to the north-east. As a result, Malm\u00f6 had a troubled economic situation following the mid-1970s. Between 1990\u20131995, 27,000 jobs were lost, and the budget deficit was more than one billion Swedish krona (SEK). In 1995, Malm\u00f6 had Sweden's highest unemployment rate.However, during the last two decades, there has been a revival. One contributing factor has been the economic integration with Denmark brought about by the \u00d6resund Bridge, which opened in July 2000. Also the university founded in 1998 and the effects of integration into the European Union have contributed. In 2017 the unemployment rate is still high but Malm\u00f6 has, in the last 20 years, had one of the strongest employment growth rates in Sweden. But a lot of those jobs are taken by workers outside the neighboring municipalities.As of 2016, the largest companies were:\nSkanska \u2013 heavy construction\nNobina \u2013 transport\nPostNord \u2013 postal services\nP\u00e5gen \u2013 bakery\nIKEA \u2013 furnitureAlmost 30 companies have moved their headquarters to Malm\u00f6 during the last seven years, generating around 2,300 jobs. Among them are IKEA who has most of its headquarter functions based in Malm\u00f6.The number of start-up companies is high in Malm\u00f6. Around 7 new companies are started every day in Malm\u00f6. In 2010, the renewal of the number of companies amounted to 13.9%, which exceeds both Stockholm and Gothenburg. Especially strong growth is in the gaming area with Massive entertainment and King being the flagship companies for the industry. Among the industries that continue to increase their share of companies in Malm\u00f6 are transport, financial and business services, entertainment, leisure and construction.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMalm\u00f6 has the country's ninth-largest school of higher education, Malm\u00f6 University, established in 1998. It has 1,600 employees and 24,000 students (2014).\nIn addition nearby Lund University (established in 1666) has some education located in Malm\u00f6:\n\nMalm\u00f6 Art Academy (Konsth\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nMalm\u00f6 Academy of Music (Musikh\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nMalm\u00f6 Theatre Academy (Teaterh\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nThe Faculty of Medicine, which is located in both Malm\u00f6 and Lund.The United Nations World Maritime University is also located in Malm\u00f6. The World Maritime University (WMU) operates under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized agency of the United Nations. WMU thus enjoys the status, privileges and immunities of a UN institution in Sweden.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Film and television ===\nA striking depiction of Malm\u00f6 (in the 1930s) was made by Bo Widerberg in his debut film Kvarteret Korpen (Raven's End) (1963), largely shot in the shabby Korpen working-class district in Malm\u00f6. With humour and tenderness, it depicts the tensions between classes and generations.  The movie was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1965. In 2017, the film Medan Vi Lever (While We Live) was awarded the prize for best film by an African living abroad at the Africa Movie Academy Awards. It was filmed in Malm\u00f6 and Gambia, and deals with identity, integration and everyday racism.The cities of Malm\u00f6 and Copenhagen are, with the \u00d6resund Bridge, the main locations in the television series The Bridge (Bron/Broen).\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\nIn 1944, Malm\u00f6 Stadsteater (Malm\u00f6 Municipal Theatre) was established with a repertoire comprising stage theatre, opera, musical, ballet, musical recitals and experimental theatre. In 1993 it was split into three units, Dramatiska Teater (Dramatical Theatre), Malm\u00f6 Musikteater (Music Theatre) and Sk\u00e5nes Dansteater (Scanian Dance Theatre) and the name was abandoned. The ownership of the last two were transferred to Region Sk\u00e5ne in 2006 Dramatiska Teatern regained its old name. In the 1950s Ingmar Bergman was the Director and Chief Stage Director of Malm\u00f6 Stadsteater and many of his actors, like Max von Sydow and Ingrid Thulin became known through his films. Later stage directors include Staffan Valdemar Holm and G\u00f6ran Stangertz. Malm\u00f6 Musikteater were renamed Malm\u00f6 Operan and plays operas and musicals, classics as newly composed, on one of Scandinavia's large opera scenes with 1,511 seats. Sk\u00e5nes dansteater is active and plays contemporary dance repertory and present works by Swedish and international choreographers in their house in Malm\u00f6 harbor.Since the 1970s the city has also been home to independent theatre groups and show/musical companies. It also hosts a rock/dance/dub culture; in the 1960s The Rolling Stones played the Klubb Bongo, and in recent years stars like Morrissey, Nick Cave, B.B. King and Pat Metheny have made repeated visits.\nThe Cardigans debuted in Malm\u00f6 and recorded their albums there. On 7 January 2009 CNN Travel broadcast a segment called \"MyCity_MyLife\" featuring Nina Persson taking the camera to some of the sites in Malm\u00f6 that she enjoys.\nThe Rooseum Center for Contemporary Art, founded in 1988 by the Swedish art collector and financier Fredrik Roos and housed in a former power station which had been built in 1900, was one of the foremost centers for contemporary art in Europe during the 1980s and 1990s. By 2006, most of the collection had been sold off and the museum was on a time-out; by 2010 Rooseum had been dismantled and a subsidiary of the National Museum of Modern Art inaugurated in its place.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nIn 1992 and in 2013 Malm\u00f6 was the host of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nModerna Museet Malm\u00f6 was opened in December 2009  in the old Rooseum building. It is a part of the Moderna Museet, with independent exhibitions of modern and contemporary art. The collection of Moderna Museet holds key pieces of, among others, Marcel Duchamp, Louise Bourgeois, Pablo Picasso, Niki de Saint Phalle, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Carolee Schneemann, Henri Matisse and Robert RauschenbergMalm\u00f6 Museum (Malm\u00f6 Museer) is a municipal and regional museum. The museum features exhibitions on technology, shipping, natural history and history. Malm\u00f6 Museum has an aquarium and an art museum. Malm\u00f6hus Castle is also operated as a part of the museum.\nExhibitions are primarily shown at Slottsholmen and at the Technology and Maritime Museum (Teknikens och sj\u00f6fartens hus).Malm\u00f6 Konsthall is one of the largest exhibition halls in Europe for contemporary art, opened in 1975.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMalm\u00f6's oldest building is St. Peter's Church (Swedish: Sankt Petri). It was built in the early 14th century in Baltic Brick Gothic probably after St Mary's Church in L\u00fcbeck. The church is built with a nave, two aisles, a transept and a tower. Its exterior is characterized above all by the flying buttresses spanning its airy arches over the aisles and ambulatory. The tower, which fell down twice during the 15th century, got its current look in 1890. Another major church of significance is the Church of Our Saviour, Malm\u00f6, which was founded in 1870.\nAnother old building is Tunneln, 300 metres (1,000 ft) to the west of Sankt Petri Church, which also dates back to around 1300.\nThe oldest parts of Malm\u00f6 were built between 1300\u20131600 during its first major period of expansion. The central city's layout, as well as some of its oldest buildings, are from this time. Many of the smaller buildings from this time are typical Scanian: two-story urban houses that show a strong Danish influence.Recession followed in the ensuing centuries. The next expansion period was in the mid 19th century and led to the modern stone and brick city. This expansion lasted into the 20th century and can be seen by a number of Art Nouveau buildings, among those in the Malm\u00f6 synagogue. Malm\u00f6 was relatively late to be influenced by modern ideas of functionalist tenement architecture in the 1930s.\nAround 1965, the government initiated the so-called Million Programme, intending to offer affordable apartments in the outskirts of major Swedish cities. But this period also saw the reconstruction (and razing) of much of the historical city center.Since the late 1990s, Malm\u00f6 has seen a more cosmopolitan architecture. V\u00e4stra Hamnen (The Western Harbor), like most of the harbor to the north of the city center, was industrial. In 2001 its reconstruction began as an urban residential neighbourhood, with 500 residential units, most were part of the exhibition Bo01. The exhibition had two main objectives: develop self-sufficient housing units in terms of energy and greatly diminish phosphorus emissions. Among the new building's towers were the Turning Torso, a skyscraper with a twisting design, 190 metres (620 ft) tall, the majority of which is residential. It became Malm\u00f6's new landmark. The most recent addition (2015) is the new development of Malm\u00f6 Live. This new building features a hotel, a concert hall, congress hall and a sky bar in the center of Malm\u00f6. Point Hyllie is a new 110 m commercial tower that is under construction as of 2018.\n\n\n=== Other sights ===\n\nThe beach Ribersborg, by locals usually called Ribban, south-west of the harbor area, is a man-made shallow beach, stretching along Malm\u00f6's coastline. Despite Malm\u00f6's chilly climate, it is sometimes referred to as the \"Copacabana of Malm\u00f6\". It is the site of Ribersborgs open-air bath, opened in the 1890s.\nThe long boardwalk at The Western Harbor, Scaniaparken and Daniaparken, has become a favorite summer hang-out for the people of Malm\u00f6 and is a popular place for bathing. The harbor is particularly popular with Malm\u00f6's vibrant student community and has been the scene of several impromptu outdoor parties and gatherings.\n\n\n=== Annual events ===\n\nIn the third week of August each year a festival, Malm\u00f6festivalen, fills the streets of Malm\u00f6 with different kinds of cuisines and events.\nBUFF International Film Festival, an international children and young people's film festival, is held in Malm\u00f6 every year in March.\nNordisk Panorama \u2013 Nordic Short & Doc Film Festival, a film festival for short and documentary films by filmmakers from the Nordic countries, is held every year in September.\nMalm\u00f6 Arab Film Festival (MAFF), the largest Arabic film festival in Europe, is held in Malm\u00f6.\nThe Nordic Game conference takes place in Malm\u00f6 every April/May. The event consists of conference itself, recruitment expo and game expo and attracts hundreds of gamedev professionals every year.\nMalm\u00f6 also hosts other 3rd party events that cater to all communities that reside in Malm\u00f6, including religious and political celebrations.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nSydsvenskan, founded in 1870, is Malm\u00f6's largest daily newspaper. It has an average circulation of 130,000. Its main competitor is the regional daily Sk\u00e5nska Dagbladet, which has a circulation of 34,000. The tabloid Kv\u00e4llsposten still has a minimal editorial staff but is today just a version of a Stockholm tabloid. The Social Democratic Arbetet was edited and printed at Malm\u00f6 between 1887 and 2000.In addition to these, a number of free-of-charge papers, generally dealing with entertainment, music and fashion have local editions (for instance City, Rodeo, Metro and N\u00f6jesguiden). Malm\u00f6 is also home to the Egmont Group's Swedish magazine operations. A number of local and regional radio and TV broadcasters are based in the Greater Malm\u00f6 area.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\n\n==== Football ====\n\nSports in southern Sweden are dominated by football. Over the years the city's best football teams have been Malm\u00f6 FF who play in the top-level Allsvenskan Malm\u00f6 FF had their most successful periods in the 1970s and 1980s when they won the league several times. In 1979, they advanced to the final of the European Cup defeating AS Monaco, Dynamo Kiew, Wisla Krakow and Austria Wien (Vienna) but lost in the final at the Munich Olympic Stadium against Nottingham Forest by a single goal just before half time scored by Trevor Francis. To date, they are the only Swedish football club to have reached the final of the competition. Malm\u00f6 FF is the club where for instance, Bosse Larsson and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 began their football careers.  A second football team, IFK Malm\u00f6 played in Sweden's top flight for about 20 years and the club's quarterfinal in the European Cup is the club's greatest achievement in its history. Today, the club resides in the sixth tier of the Swedish league system.\nFC Roseng\u00e5rd (former LdB Malm\u00f6) are playing in the top level in Damallsvenskan, women's football league. FC Roseng\u00e5rd girls have won the league 10 times and the national cup title 5 times. In 2014, they reached the semi-final in Champions League, which they ultimately went on to lose to the German side 1. FFC Frankfurt. Brazilian football player Marta, widely regarded the best female football player of all time, played in FC Roseng\u00e5rd between 2014 and 2017.\nAt the 1958 FIFA World Cup Malm\u00f6 Stadion was inaugurated in combination with the opening match of the cup, as World Champions West Germany defeated Argentina 3\u20131, in front of 31,156, a record attendance for Malm\u00f6 in general. Another two games were decided at the stadium.\n\n\n==== Other sports ====\nMalm\u00f6 has athletes competing in a variety of sport.\n\n\n===== Ice hockey =====\nThe most notable other sports team is the ice hockey team Malm\u00f6 Redhawks. They were the creation of millionaire Percy Nilsson and quickly rose to the highest rank in the early to mid-1990s and won two Swedish championships, but for a number of years have found themselves residing outside of the top flight. \n\n\n===== Handball =====\nA first division handball team, HK Malm\u00f6, attracts a fair amount of attendance. \n\n\n===== Rugby =====\nRugby union team, Malm\u00f6 RC, founded in 1954, have won 6 national championships. The club has teams for men, women and juniors.\n\n\n===== Gaelic football =====\nGaelic football has also been introduced to Malm\u00f6. The men of Malm\u00f6 G.A.A. have won the Scandinavian Championships twice and the women once.\n\n\n===== Additional Team and Individual Sport =====\nOther notable team a sports are baseball, American football and Australian football.\nAmong non-team sports, badminton and athletics are the most popular, together with east Asian martial arts and boxing. Basketball is also fairly a big sport in the city, including the clubs Malbas and SF Srbija among others.\nWomen are permitted by the city council to swim topless in public swimming pools. Everyone must wear bathing attire, but covering of the breasts is not mandatory.\n\n\n== Notable events ==\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nScania\nMalm\u00f6 Bulltofta Airport\nChapter 4 Concerning the Friary in Malm\u00f8 in Chronicle of the Expulsion of the Greyfriars\nList of governors of Malm\u00f6hus County\nPorts of the Baltic Sea\n\n\n== References ==\nFacts & Figures about Malm\u00f6, 2005 at the Wayback Machine (archived 7 October 2006) \u2013 in English.

        "wiki": "Malm\u00f6 Airport, until 2007 known as Sturup Airport (Swedish: Sturups flygplats) (IATA: MMX, ICAO: ESMS) is Sweden's fourth busiest airport, handling 1,975,479 passengers in 2019. The airport is located in Svedala Municipality, approximately 28 kilometres (17 mi) east of Malm\u00f6 and 26 kilometres (16 mi) south-east of Lund.\nVia the \u00d6resund Bridge the airport is located about 55 kilometres (34 mi) from central Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, and 47 kilometres (29 mi) from Copenhagen Airport. The city of Malm\u00f6 has roughly the same distance by road to Copenhagen Airport as to Malm\u00f6 Airport. Residents of the Malm\u00f6 region use Copenhagen Airport more than Malm\u00f6 Airport for scheduled international air travel.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nCompleted in 1972, then at a cost of around SEK130 million, almost twice as much as initially forecast, Sturup Airport replaced the aging Bulltofta Airport, which had served the region since 1923. Plans to build a new airport were drafted in the early 1960s. Expansion was impossible, due to Bulltofta's close proximity to the now booming city and nearby communities complained about noise pollution from the newly introduced jet aircraft.Construction began in 1970, and the airport was inaugurated two years later on 3 December 1972. At the same time Bulltofta Airport closed. However, Malm\u00f6 ATC (Air Traffic Control) remained at the old Bulltofta site until 1983 when it also moved to Malm\u00f6 Airport.According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), three airlines were serving the airport in the fall of 1996 including KLM Cityhopper with nonstop Fokker F50 turboprop flights to Amsterdam (AMS), Malmo Aviation with nonstop British Aerospace BAe 146 jet flights to London City Airport (LCY) as well as Stockholm Bromma Airport (BMA), and Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) with nonstop McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and MD-87 jet flights to Stockholm Arlanda Airport (ARN).\n\n\n=== Development since the 2000s ===\nAround 2005\u20132008 several low-cost airlines hoped to attract both Danish and Swedish passengers to Sturup Airport in competition with Copenhagen Airport. Malm\u00f6 airport, due to its lower landing fees, is seen by some low-cost airlines as a less expensive way of accessing the Copenhagen area. The airport caters to low-cost carriers such as Wizz Air.During 2008 Danish Sterling Airlines was operating service from Malm\u00f6 Airport to London Gatwick Airport (LGW), Alicante, Barcelona, Nice and Florence. However, other low-cost carriers such as easyJet use Copenhagen Airport. Norwegian Air Shuttle uses Malm\u00f6 Airport for a few flights a day to and from Stockholm Arlanda Airport while the majority of flights to the region go to Copenhagen Airport. In 2014, Ryanair moved their operations to Copenhagen Airport as well. Malm\u00f6 Airport has not been attractive for travellers to/from Denmark.\nThe Malm\u00f6 Airport Master Plan from 2018 describes how the airport will develop in the years to come, e.g. by extending the hall for arriving luggage and with new traffic flows to and from the airport. The works are projected in order to allow for a future second passenger terminal, as well as a second, parallel, runway northwest of the present one.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nMalm\u00f6 Airport features one passenger and two cargo terminals as well as 20 aircraft stands.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n=== Passenger ===\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Malm\u00f6:\n\n\n=== Cargo ===\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n== Ground transportation ==\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nFlygbussarna Airport coaches depart from the airport to downtown Malm\u00f6 and Lund. The journey to Malm\u00f6 or Lund takes about 40 minutes. From there, there are train connections to destinations including Copenhagen.\nGr\u00e5hundbus coaches departs to Copenhagen 30 minutes after every Ryanair arrival.\nThere is also Wizzair's bus to Copenhagen\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of the largest airports in the Nordic countries\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Malm\u00f6-Sturup Airport at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website\nAirport information for ESMS at World Aero Data.

          "In a small town, you sort of hope that the much lauded modern art museum would be full of art. Unfortunately my timing wasn't so. There was only one exhibition while I was in Malmo but it was pretty interesting - a mix of media and a good way to spend 1/2 hour. Definitely worth",

          "Have been there twice. Interesting to see what sort of new modern art people are making nowadays. The museum is in 2 floors. It is not a big place. There is a fee. There are free boxes for bags. They have a little cafe, vegetarian foods too. It is just for a shorter visit. Not",

          "Quiet neighboorhood, some 10 minutes walk from the city centre. Amazing industrial building, more should have been kept from the original structure though. Free entrance. Museum is quiet inside, too. More vividness would be expected from a place for modern arts in my opinion.",
          "We liked the shop and bought some very cool pencils with witty mottos. The exhibitions were very left field which is what you would expect in a modern art gallery. We thought the curation could have been better- a little more context and a few pointers would have helped us",
          "The Moderna Museet in Malm\u00f6 is a part of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm from 2009. They had many interesting exhibitions, but I liked best the Hannah Ryggen exhibition. Hannah Ryggen (21 March 1894, Malm\u00f6 \u2013 2 February 1970) was a Swedish-born Norwegian textile artist.",
          "Contemporary art combined with a good restaurant (search for the restaurant \"njutbar\"). Much smaller than the museum of modern art in Stockholm but then again Malm\u00f6 is a smaller town... Accessible for wheelchairs and strollers. The shop is very tiny so don't come here just for",
          "Exciting and inspiring visit of many good exhibitions. It was very calm here at our visit - in the Saturday morning - which we found very relaxing when strolling around, exploring the exhibitions. The atmosphere here is great!",
          "It's a great little museum with lots to see, was very impressed with their shows and exhibitions and it's not too big so you can take time in watching everything rather than feel you had to rush to see it all and it have a sweet cafe there too",
          "not for the ones that want something to see. This is no ordinary museum. It's for the more......ellegant people or sophisticated maybe, but it wasn't for me. Just 2-3 rooms, very expensive entrance fee, and almost nothing to see inside",
          "As always, at the art museum all depends on what is exhibited, this exhibition by Nils Dardel was definitely worth visiting. Some video installations also caught my interest. Finish off with something good to eat and t drink at the small cafe",
          "I was very pleased with the originality of the paintings, mostly by the Swedish artist Dardel. It's not a very big museum but worth a look and the price is fair for what they offer. I'd suggest it to every modern art lover",
          "One of the better museums in Malm\u00f6. They deliver to your expectations. They often have small \"assignments\" for the kids.",
          "Expected the place to be much bigger. When i went there were a lot of video/multi media installations in the upstairs galleries and a large exhibition downstairs, so check if things are likely to interest you before you go. Friendly enthusiastic staff and a small friendly cafe .",
          "I am actually totally disappointed. All of the tourist guides say that they have a great collection of paitings would wide famous and know painters but I haven't seen none of them. It is small and actually nothing inw there. I always try to be loyal and understandable but in",
          "There were several rooms with different artists - all marked by strong colours like orange, yellow and green - nice room for a stipendiat",
          "As with all art galleries and museums the quality of the experience very much depends on the exhibits hanging on the walls. I had not heard of Nils Dardel before but after viewing his work I think it is a name I will remember. The second exhibition on the top floor didn't",
          "I went with relatives and their kid to attend a splash painting session, as mentioned on the museum's website. The person at the desk saw us arrive with a bag of clothes (to change after ours would be soaked with paint), we asked if the splash painting was still on the schedule",
          "What a lovely museum. The space itself is beautiful and fascinating while the art was thought provoking and funny - Just what good modern art should be. The cafe is also wonderful with tasty food all day. The staff are super friendly - discount most negative reviews and please",
          "The Museum is located at the northeast corner of the inner city island, and has exhibitions that change frequently.. we paid a hefty $7 as pensioners and were pretty disappointed with what we saw...in any case there are lockers restrooms a small cafe and shop and there are two",

          "It was a big surprise! this museum is really interesting , there was a soviet exhibition with some hippie exhibition too , the building it is very nice as it has a modern part added to it s facade , everything inside has a different colour , orange reception yellow lockers ect a",
          "This is a very interesting small museum with reasonable space for temporary exhibitions. When we visited there was a very interesting piece on surrealism, which ended with a section on the roots of surrealism - including interestingly the gothic and such artists as Piranesi.",
          "We went here on our mast day as we had 'time to kill' before our flight. The exhibitions were a bit strange although one, Scandinavian Pain we found interesting. However there is not a lot to see and it seemed difficult to spend more than an hour here. One tip though seniors",
          "Its not a bad museum, its just not that big and you feel as if you dont get value for your money. We went to see the latest exibition with Edward Munch. Its was ok. Nothing speciel, but yet interresting, as its was displayed in a barn. But all in all an average museum.",
          "I paid 70 SEK to come see this, spent more time walking to the museum than I did inside it. Here are a few installations and exhibitions but nothing to write home about. Spend your 70 elsewhere or come on a Friday when it's free.",
          "Appearances can be deceiving. Externally looks a vibrant mix of old and new, while internally is a bit of a yawn. Hs a clever idea of free cards to hear audio descriptions at each display in your own language. However many of the exhibits early on the card did not translate to",
          "We found this museum to be rather underwhelming with very few works on display. Two smallish rooms had a meagre quantity of quite interesting works, and a video room was a non starter. I'm not sure what would normally be in the main exhibition room, but things picked up a little",

        "wiki": "Malm\u00f6 Airport, until 2007 known as Sturup Airport (Swedish: Sturups flygplats) (IATA: MMX, ICAO: ESMS) is Sweden's fourth busiest airport, handling 1,975,479 passengers in 2019. The airport is located in Svedala Municipality, approximately 28 kilometres (17 mi) east of Malm\u00f6 and 26 kilometres (16 mi) south-east of Lund.\nVia the \u00d6resund Bridge the airport is located about 55 kilometres (34 mi) from central Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, and 47 kilometres (29 mi) from Copenhagen Airport. The city of Malm\u00f6 has roughly the same distance by road to Copenhagen Airport as to Malm\u00f6 Airport. Residents of the Malm\u00f6 region use Copenhagen Airport more than Malm\u00f6 Airport for scheduled international air travel.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nCompleted in 1972, then at a cost of around SEK130 million, almost twice as much as initially forecast, Sturup Airport replaced the aging Bulltofta Airport, which had served the region since 1923. Plans to build a new airport were drafted in the early 1960s. Expansion was impossible, due to Bulltofta's close proximity to the now booming city and nearby communities complained about noise pollution from the newly introduced jet aircraft.Construction began in 1970, and the airport was inaugurated two years later on 3 December 1972. At the same time Bulltofta Airport closed. However, Malm\u00f6 ATC (Air Traffic Control) remained at the old Bulltofta site until 1983 when it also moved to Malm\u00f6 Airport.According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), three airlines were serving the airport in the fall of 1996 including KLM Cityhopper with nonstop Fokker F50 turboprop flights to Amsterdam (AMS), Malmo Aviation with nonstop British Aerospace BAe 146 jet flights to London City Airport (LCY) as well as Stockholm Bromma Airport (BMA), and Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) with nonstop McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and MD-87 jet flights to Stockholm Arlanda Airport (ARN).\n\n\n=== Development since the 2000s ===\nAround 2005\u20132008 several low-cost airlines hoped to attract both Danish and Swedish passengers to Sturup Airport in competition with Copenhagen Airport. Malm\u00f6 airport, due to its lower landing fees, is seen by some low-cost airlines as a less expensive way of accessing the Copenhagen area. The airport caters to low-cost carriers such as Wizz Air.During 2008 Danish Sterling Airlines was operating service from Malm\u00f6 Airport to London Gatwick Airport (LGW), Alicante, Barcelona, Nice and Florence. However, other low-cost carriers such as easyJet use Copenhagen Airport. Norwegian Air Shuttle uses Malm\u00f6 Airport for a few flights a day to and from Stockholm Arlanda Airport while the majority of flights to the region go to Copenhagen Airport. In 2014, Ryanair moved their operations to Copenhagen Airport as well. Malm\u00f6 Airport has not been attractive for travellers to/from Denmark.\nThe Malm\u00f6 Airport Master Plan from 2018 describes how the airport will develop in the years to come, e.g. by extending the hall for arriving luggage and with new traffic flows to and from the airport. The works are projected in order to allow for a future second passenger terminal, as well as a second, parallel, runway northwest of the present one.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nMalm\u00f6 Airport features one passenger and two cargo terminals as well as 20 aircraft stands.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n=== Passenger ===\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Malm\u00f6:\n\n\n=== Cargo ===\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n== Ground transportation ==\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nFlygbussarna Airport coaches depart from the airport to downtown Malm\u00f6 and Lund. The journey to Malm\u00f6 or Lund takes about 40 minutes. From there, there are train connections to destinations including Copenhagen.\nGr\u00e5hundbus coaches departs to Copenhagen 30 minutes after every Ryanair arrival.\nThere is also Wizzair's bus to Copenhagen\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of the largest airports in the Nordic countries\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Malm\u00f6-Sturup Airport at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website\nAirport information for ESMS at World Aero Data.

It is the third-largest city in Sweden, after Stockholm and Gothenburg, and the sixth-largest city in Scandinavia, with a population of 316,588 (municipal total 338,230 in 2018). The Malm\u00f6 Metropolitan Region is home to over 700,000 people, and the \u00d8resund Region, which includes Malm\u00f6, is home to 4 million people.Malm\u00f6 was one of the earliest and most industrialized towns in Scandinavia, but it struggled to adapt to post-industrialism. Since the construction of the \u00d6resund Bridge, Malm\u00f6 has undergone a major transformation, producing new architectural developments, supporting new biotech and IT companies, and attracting students through Malm\u00f6 University and other higher education facilities. The city contains many historic buildings and parks, and is also a commercial center for the western part of Scania.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest written mention of Malm\u00f6 as a city dates from 1275. It is thought to have been founded shortly before that date, as a fortified quay or ferry berth of the Archbishop of Lund, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) to the north-east. Malm\u00f6 was for centuries Denmark's second-biggest city. Its original name was Malmhaug (with alternate spellings), meaning \"Gravel pile\" or \"Ore Hill\".\nIn the 15th century, Malm\u00f6 became one of Denmark's largest and most visited cities, reaching a population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. It became the most important city around the \u00d8resund, with the German Hanseatic League frequenting it as a marketplace, and was notable for its flourishing herring fishery. In 1437, King Eric of Pomerania (King of Denmark from 1396 to 1439) granted the city's arms: argent with a griffin gules, based on Eric's arms from Pomerania. The griffin's head as a symbol of Malm\u00f6 extended to the entire province of Scania from 1660.\nIn 1434, a new citadel was constructed at the beach south of the town. This fortress, known today as Malm\u00f6hus, did not take its current form until the mid-16th century. Several other fortifications were constructed, making Malm\u00f6 Sweden's most fortified city, but only Malm\u00f6hus remains.\n\nLutheran teachings spread during the 16th century Protestant Reformation, and Malm\u00f6 became one of the first cities in Scandinavia to fully convert (1527\u20131529) to this Protestant denomination.\nIn the 17th century, Malm\u00f6 and the Scanian region (Sk\u00e5neland) came under control of Sweden following the Treaty of Roskilde with Denmark, signed in 1658. Fighting continued, however; in June 1677, 14,000 Danish troops laid siege to Malm\u00f6 for a month, but were unable to defeat the Swedish troops holding it.\nBy the dawn of the 18th century, Malm\u00f6 had about 2,300 inhabitants. However, owing to the wars of Charles XII of Sweden (reigned 1697\u20131718) and to bubonic plague epidemics, the population dropped to 1,500 by 1727. The population did not grow much until the modern harbor was constructed in 1775. The city started to expand and the population in 1800 was 4,000. 15 years later, it had increased to 6,000.\n\nIn 1840, Frans Henrik Kockum founded the workshop from which the Kockums shipyard eventually developed as one of the largest shipyards in the world. The Southern Main Line was built between 1856 and 1864; this enabled Malm\u00f6 to become a center of manufacture, with major textile and mechanical industries. In 1870, Malm\u00f6 overtook Norrk\u00f6ping to become Sweden's third-most populous city, and by 1900 Malm\u00f6 had strengthened this position with 60,000 inhabitants. Malm\u00f6 continued to grow through the first half of the 20th century. The population had swiftly increased to 100,000 by 1915 and to 200,000 by 1952.\n\n\n=== 1900\u20131969 ===\n\nIn 1914 (15 May to 4 October) Malm\u00f6 hosted the Baltic Exhibition. The large park Pildammsparken was arranged and planted for this large event. The Russian part of the exhibition was never taken down, owing to the outbreak of World War I.\nOn 18 and 19 December 1914, the Three Kings Meeting was held in Malm\u00f6. After a somewhat infected period (1905\u20131914), which included the dissolution of the Swedish-Norwegian Union, King Oscar II was replaced with King H\u00e5kon VII in Norway, who was the younger brother of the Danish King Christian X. As Oscar died in 1907, and his son Gustav V became the new King of Sweden, the tensions within Scandinavia were still unclear, but during this historical meeting, the Scandinavian Kings found internal understanding, as well as a common line about remaining neutral in the ongoing war.\nWithin sports, Malm\u00f6 has mostly been associated with football. IFK Malm\u00f6 participated in the first ever edition of Allsvenskan 1924/25, but from the mid-1940s Malm\u00f6 FF started to rise, and ever since it has been one of the most prominent clubs within Swedish football. They have won Allsvenskan 23 times in all (as of February 2018) between 1943/44 and 2017.\n\n\n=== 1970s and later ===\nBy 1971, Malm\u00f6 reached 265,000 inhabitants, but this was the peak which would stand for more than 30 years. (Svedala was, for a few years in the early 1970s, a part of Malm\u00f6 municipality.)\nBy the mid-1970s Sweden experienced a recession that hit the industrial sector especially hard; shipyards and manufacturing industries suffered, which led to high unemployment in many cities of Scania. Kockums shipyard had become a symbol of Malm\u00f6 as its largest employer and, when shipbuilding ceased in 1986, confidence in the future of Malm\u00f6 plummeted among politicians and the public. In addition, many middle-class families moved into one-family houses in surrounding municipalities such as Vellinge Municipality, Lomma Municipality and Staffanstorp Municipality, which profiled themselves as the suburbs of the upper-middle class. By 1985, Malm\u00f6 had lost 35,000 inhabitants and was down to 229,000.The Swedish financial crises of the early 1990s exacerbated Malm\u00f6's decline as an industrial city; between 1990 and 1995 Malm\u00f6 lost about 27,000 jobs and its economy was seriously strained. However, from 1994 under the leadership of the then mayor Ilmar Reepalu, the city of Malm\u00f6 started to create a new economy as a center of culture and knowledge. Malm\u00f6 reached bottom in 1995, but that same year marked the commencement of the massive \u00d6resund Bridge road, railway and tunnel project, connecting it to Copenhagen and to the rail lines of Europe. The new Malm\u00f6 University opened in 1998 on Kockums' former dockside. Further redevelopment of the now disused south-western harbor followed; a city architecture exposition (Bo01) was held in the area in 2001, and its buildings and villas form the core of a new city district. Designed with attractive waterfront vistas, it was intended to be and has been successful in attracting the urban middle-class.\nSince 1974, the Kockums Crane had been a landmark in Malm\u00f6 and a symbol of the city's manufacturing industry, but in 2002 it was disassembled and moved to South Korea. In 2005, Malm\u00f6 gained a new landmark with completion of Turning Torso, the tallest skyscraper in Scandinavia. Although the transformation from a city with its economic base in manufacturing has returned growth to Malm\u00f6, the new types of jobs have largely benefited the middle and upper classes.\nIn its 2015 and 2017 reports, Police in Sweden placed the Roseng\u00e5rd and the S\u00f6dra Sofielund/Seved district in the most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMalm\u00f6 is located at 13\u00b000' east and 55\u00b035' north, near the southwestern tip of Sweden, in the province of Scania.\nThe city is part of the transnational \u00d6resund Region and, since 2000, has been linked by the \u00d6resund Bridge across the \u00d6resund to Copenhagen, Denmark. The bridge opened on 1 July 2000, and measures 8 kilometres (5 miles) (the whole link totalling 16 km), with pylons reaching 204.5 metres (670.9 feet) vertically. Apart from the Helsingborg-Helsing\u00f8r ferry links further north, most ferry connections have been discontinued.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nMalm\u00f6, like the rest of southern Sweden, has an oceanic climate. Despite its northern location, the climate is mild compared to other locations at similar latitudes, mainly because of the influence of the Gulf Stream and also its westerly position on the Eurasian landmass. Owing to its northern latitude, daylight lasts 17 hours in midsummer, but only around seven hours in midwinter. According to data from 2002\u20132014 Falsterbo, to the south of the city, received an annual average of 1,895 hours of sunshine while Lund, to the north, received 1,803 hours. The sunshine data in the weather box is based on the data for Falsterbo.Summers are mild with average high temperatures of 20 to 23 \u00b0C (68 to 73 \u00b0F) and lows of around 11 to 13 \u00b0C (52 to 55 \u00b0F). Heat waves during the summer arise occasionally. Winters are fairly cold and windy, with temperatures steady between \u22123 to 4 \u00b0C (27 to 39 \u00b0F), but it rarely drops below \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F).\nRainfall is light to moderate throughout the year with 169 wet days. Snowfall occurs mainly in December through March, but snow covers do not remain for a long time, and some winters are virtually free of snow.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\u00d6resund Line trains cross the \u00d6resund Bridge every 20 minutes (hourly late night) connecting Malm\u00f6 to Copenhagen, and the Copenhagen Airport. The trip takes around 35\u201340 minutes. Additionally, some of the X 2000 and Intercity trains to Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Kalmar cross the bridge, stopping at Copenhagen Airport. In March 2005, excavation began on a new railway connection called the City Tunnel, which opened for traffic on 4 December 2010. The tunnel runs south from Malm\u00f6 Central Station through an underground station at the Triangeln railway station to Hylliev\u00e5ng (Hyllie Meadow). Then, the line comes to the surface to enter Hyllie Station, also created as part of the tunnel project. From Hyllie Station, the line connects to the existing \u00d6resund line in either direction, with the \u00d6resund Bridge lying due west.\nBesides the Copenhagen Airport, Malm\u00f6 has an airport of its own, Malm\u00f6 Airport, today chiefly used for domestic Swedish destinations, charter flights and low-cost carriers.\nThe motorway system has been incorporated with the \u00d6resund Bridge; the European route E20 goes over the bridge and then, together with the European route E6 follows the Swedish west coast from Malm\u00f6\u2013Helsingborg to Gothenburg. E6 goes further north along the west coast and through Norway to the Norwegian town Kirkenes at Barents Sea. The European route to J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping\u2013Stockholm (E4) starts at Helsingborg. Main roads in the directions of V\u00e4xj\u00f6\u2013Kalmar, Kristianstad\u2013Karlskrona, Ystad (E65), and Trelleborg start as freeways.\nMalm\u00f6 has 410 kilometres (250 mi) of bike paths; approximately 40% of all commuting is done by bicycle.\n\n\n=== Ports ===\nThe city has two industrial harbors; one is still in active use and is the largest Nordic port for car importation. It also has two marinas: the publicly owned Limhamn Marina (55\u00b035\u2032N 12\u00b055\u2032E) and the private Lagunen (55\u00b035\u2032N 12\u00b056\u2032E), both offering a limited number of guest docks.\nPublic transport consisted of a tram network from 1887 until 1973. Afterwards, it was replaced by a bus network.\n\n\n=== Malm\u00f6 S-Train ===\nA local train line with circular traffic at seven stations was opened in December 2018. The stations are Malm\u00f6 Central Station (underground platforms) \u2013 Triangeln station \u2013 Hyllie station \u2013 Malm\u00f6 South/Sv\u00e5gertorp \u2013 Persborg \u2013 Roseng\u00e5rd \u2013 \u00d6sterv\u00e4rn \u2013 Malm\u00f6 Central Station (main overground terminus). Some trains arrive from Kristianstad and finish with a lap around Malm\u00f6, whilst other trains at this circular line, never drive outside the city limits. There is at least a 30 minutes service between each departure, but far more between the Central Station and Hyllie. Extension plans of a minor network system exists.\n\n\n=== Proposed metro ===\nThe \u00d6resundsmetro is a proposed rapid transit network linking Malm\u00f6 with the existing Copenhagen Metro through a 22 km tunnel under the \u00d6resund.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nMalm\u00f6 Municipality is an administrative unit defined by geographical borders, consisting of the City of Malm\u00f6 and its immediate surroundings.\nMalm\u00f6 (Malm\u00f6 t\u00e4tort) consists of the urban part of the municipality together with the small town of Arl\u00f6v in the Burl\u00f6v Municipality. Both municipalities also include smaller urban areas and rural areas, such as the suburbs of Oxie and \u00c5karp. Malm\u00f6 t\u00e4tort is to be distinguished from Malm\u00f6 stad (the city of Malm\u00f6), which is a semi-official name of Malm\u00f6 Municipality.\nThe leaders in Malm\u00f6 created a commission for a socially sustainable Malm\u00f6 in November 2010. The commissions were tasked with providing evidence-based strategies for reducing health inequalities and improve living conditions for all citizens of Malm\u00f6, especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged and issued its final report in December 2013.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nMalm\u00f6 has a young population by Swedish standards, with almost half of the population under the age of 35 (48.2%).After 1971, Malm\u00f6 had 265,000 inhabitants, but the population then dropped to 229,000 by 1985. The total population of the urban area was 280,415 in December 2010. It then began to rise again, and had passed the previous record by the 1 January 2003 census, when it had 265,481 inhabitants. On 27 April 2011, the population of Malm\u00f6 reached the 300,000 mark. In 2017 the total population of the city was 316,588 inhabitants out of a municipal total of 338,230.In 2019, approximately 55.5% of the population of Malm\u00f6 municipality (190,849 residents) had at least one parent born abroad. The Middle East, Horn of Africa, former Yugoslavia and Denmark are the main sources of immigration. In addition, 14.8% (50 999 residents) of the population in 2019 were foreign nationals.Foreign-born population by country, 31 December 2018:\n\nGreater Malm\u00f6 is one of Sweden's three officially recognized metropolitan areas (storstadsomr\u00e5den) and since 2005 is defined as the municipality of Malm\u00f6 and 11 other municipalities in the southwestern corner of Scania. As of 2019, its population was recorded as 740,840. The region covers an area of 2,522 square kilometres (974 sq mi). The municipalities included, apart from Malm\u00f6, are Burl\u00f6v, Esl\u00f6v, H\u00f6\u00f6r, K\u00e4vlinge, Lomma, Lund, Skurup, Staffanstorp, Svedala, Trelleborg and Vellinge. Together with Lund, Malm\u00f6 is the region's economic and education hub.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Malm\u00f6 was traditionally based on shipbuilding (Kockums) and construction-related industries, such as concrete factories. The region's leading university, along with its associated hi-tech and pharmaceutical industries, is located in Lund about 16 kilometres (10 miles) to the north-east. As a result, Malm\u00f6 had a troubled economic situation following the mid-1970s. Between 1990\u20131995, 27,000 jobs were lost, and the budget deficit was more than one billion Swedish krona (SEK). In 1995, Malm\u00f6 had Sweden's highest unemployment rate.However, during the last two decades, there has been a revival. One contributing factor has been the economic integration with Denmark brought about by the \u00d6resund Bridge, which opened in July 2000. Also the university founded in 1998 and the effects of integration into the European Union have contributed. In 2017 the unemployment rate is still high but Malm\u00f6 has, in the last 20 years, had one of the strongest employment growth rates in Sweden. But a lot of those jobs are taken by workers outside the neighboring municipalities.As of 2016, the largest companies were:\nSkanska \u2013 heavy construction\nNobina \u2013 transport\nPostNord \u2013 postal services\nP\u00e5gen \u2013 bakery\nIKEA \u2013 furnitureAlmost 30 companies have moved their headquarters to Malm\u00f6 during the last seven years, generating around 2,300 jobs. Among them are IKEA who has most of its headquarter functions based in Malm\u00f6.The number of start-up companies is high in Malm\u00f6. Around 7 new companies are started every day in Malm\u00f6. In 2010, the renewal of the number of companies amounted to 13.9%, which exceeds both Stockholm and Gothenburg. Especially strong growth is in the gaming area with Massive entertainment and King being the flagship companies for the industry. Among the industries that continue to increase their share of companies in Malm\u00f6 are transport, financial and business services, entertainment, leisure and construction.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMalm\u00f6 has the country's ninth-largest school of higher education, Malm\u00f6 University, established in 1998. It has 1,600 employees and 24,000 students (2014).\nIn addition nearby Lund University (established in 1666) has some education located in Malm\u00f6:\n\nMalm\u00f6 Art Academy (Konsth\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nMalm\u00f6 Academy of Music (Musikh\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nMalm\u00f6 Theatre Academy (Teaterh\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nThe Faculty of Medicine, which is located in both Malm\u00f6 and Lund.The United Nations World Maritime University is also located in Malm\u00f6. The World Maritime University (WMU) operates under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized agency of the United Nations. WMU thus enjoys the status, privileges and immunities of a UN institution in Sweden.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Film and television ===\nA striking depiction of Malm\u00f6 (in the 1930s) was made by Bo Widerberg in his debut film Kvarteret Korpen (Raven's End) (1963), largely shot in the shabby Korpen working-class district in Malm\u00f6. With humour and tenderness, it depicts the tensions between classes and generations.  The movie was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1965. In 2017, the film Medan Vi Lever (While We Live) was awarded the prize for best film by an African living abroad at the Africa Movie Academy Awards. It was filmed in Malm\u00f6 and Gambia, and deals with identity, integration and everyday racism.The cities of Malm\u00f6 and Copenhagen are, with the \u00d6resund Bridge, the main locations in the television series The Bridge (Bron/Broen).\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\nIn 1944, Malm\u00f6 Stadsteater (Malm\u00f6 Municipal Theatre) was established with a repertoire comprising stage theatre, opera, musical, ballet, musical recitals and experimental theatre. In 1993 it was split into three units, Dramatiska Teater (Dramatical Theatre), Malm\u00f6 Musikteater (Music Theatre) and Sk\u00e5nes Dansteater (Scanian Dance Theatre) and the name was abandoned. The ownership of the last two were transferred to Region Sk\u00e5ne in 2006 Dramatiska Teatern regained its old name. In the 1950s Ingmar Bergman was the Director and Chief Stage Director of Malm\u00f6 Stadsteater and many of his actors, like Max von Sydow and Ingrid Thulin became known through his films. Later stage directors include Staffan Valdemar Holm and G\u00f6ran Stangertz. Malm\u00f6 Musikteater were renamed Malm\u00f6 Operan and plays operas and musicals, classics as newly composed, on one of Scandinavia's large opera scenes with 1,511 seats. Sk\u00e5nes dansteater is active and plays contemporary dance repertory and present works by Swedish and international choreographers in their house in Malm\u00f6 harbor.Since the 1970s the city has also been home to independent theatre groups and show/musical companies. It also hosts a rock/dance/dub culture; in the 1960s The Rolling Stones played the Klubb Bongo, and in recent years stars like Morrissey, Nick Cave, B.B. King and Pat Metheny have made repeated visits.\nThe Cardigans debuted in Malm\u00f6 and recorded their albums there. On 7 January 2009 CNN Travel broadcast a segment called \"MyCity_MyLife\" featuring Nina Persson taking the camera to some of the sites in Malm\u00f6 that she enjoys.\nThe Rooseum Center for Contemporary Art, founded in 1988 by the Swedish art collector and financier Fredrik Roos and housed in a former power station which had been built in 1900, was one of the foremost centers for contemporary art in Europe during the 1980s and 1990s. By 2006, most of the collection had been sold off and the museum was on a time-out; by 2010 Rooseum had been dismantled and a subsidiary of the National Museum of Modern Art inaugurated in its place.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nIn 1992 and in 2013 Malm\u00f6 was the host of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nModerna Museet Malm\u00f6 was opened in December 2009  in the old Rooseum building. It is a part of the Moderna Museet, with independent exhibitions of modern and contemporary art. The collection of Moderna Museet holds key pieces of, among others, Marcel Duchamp, Louise Bourgeois, Pablo Picasso, Niki de Saint Phalle, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Carolee Schneemann, Henri Matisse and Robert RauschenbergMalm\u00f6 Museum (Malm\u00f6 Museer) is a municipal and regional museum. The museum features exhibitions on technology, shipping, natural history and history. Malm\u00f6 Museum has an aquarium and an art museum. Malm\u00f6hus Castle is also operated as a part of the museum.\nExhibitions are primarily shown at Slottsholmen and at the Technology and Maritime Museum (Teknikens och sj\u00f6fartens hus).Malm\u00f6 Konsthall is one of the largest exhibition halls in Europe for contemporary art, opened in 1975.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMalm\u00f6's oldest building is St. Peter's Church (Swedish: Sankt Petri). It was built in the early 14th century in Baltic Brick Gothic probably after St Mary's Church in L\u00fcbeck. The church is built with a nave, two aisles, a transept and a tower. Its exterior is characterized above all by the flying buttresses spanning its airy arches over the aisles and ambulatory. The tower, which fell down twice during the 15th century, got its current look in 1890. Another major church of significance is the Church of Our Saviour, Malm\u00f6, which was founded in 1870.\nAnother old building is Tunneln, 300 metres (1,000 ft) to the west of Sankt Petri Church, which also dates back to around 1300.\nThe oldest parts of Malm\u00f6 were built between 1300\u20131600 during its first major period of expansion. The central city's layout, as well as some of its oldest buildings, are from this time. Many of the smaller buildings from this time are typical Scanian: two-story urban houses that show a strong Danish influence.Recession followed in the ensuing centuries. The next expansion period was in the mid 19th century and led to the modern stone and brick city. This expansion lasted into the 20th century and can be seen by a number of Art Nouveau buildings, among those in the Malm\u00f6 synagogue. Malm\u00f6 was relatively late to be influenced by modern ideas of functionalist tenement architecture in the 1930s.\nAround 1965, the government initiated the so-called Million Programme, intending to offer affordable apartments in the outskirts of major Swedish cities. But this period also saw the reconstruction (and razing) of much of the historical city center.Since the late 1990s, Malm\u00f6 has seen a more cosmopolitan architecture. V\u00e4stra Hamnen (The Western Harbor), like most of the harbor to the north of the city center, was industrial. In 2001 its reconstruction began as an urban residential neighbourhood, with 500 residential units, most were part of the exhibition Bo01. The exhibition had two main objectives: develop self-sufficient housing units in terms of energy and greatly diminish phosphorus emissions. Among the new building's towers were the Turning Torso, a skyscraper with a twisting design, 190 metres (620 ft) tall, the majority of which is residential. It became Malm\u00f6's new landmark. The most recent addition (2015) is the new development of Malm\u00f6 Live. This new building features a hotel, a concert hall, congress hall and a sky bar in the center of Malm\u00f6. Point Hyllie is a new 110 m commercial tower that is under construction as of 2018.\n\n\n=== Other sights ===\n\nThe beach Ribersborg, by locals usually called Ribban, south-west of the harbor area, is a man-made shallow beach, stretching along Malm\u00f6's coastline. Despite Malm\u00f6's chilly climate, it is sometimes referred to as the \"Copacabana of Malm\u00f6\". It is the site of Ribersborgs open-air bath, opened in the 1890s.\nThe long boardwalk at The Western Harbor, Scaniaparken and Daniaparken, has become a favorite summer hang-out for the people of Malm\u00f6 and is a popular place for bathing. The harbor is particularly popular with Malm\u00f6's vibrant student community and has been the scene of several impromptu outdoor parties and gatherings.\n\n\n=== Annual events ===\n\nIn the third week of August each year a festival, Malm\u00f6festivalen, fills the streets of Malm\u00f6 with different kinds of cuisines and events.\nBUFF International Film Festival, an international children and young people's film festival, is held in Malm\u00f6 every year in March.\nNordisk Panorama \u2013 Nordic Short & Doc Film Festival, a film festival for short and documentary films by filmmakers from the Nordic countries, is held every year in September.\nMalm\u00f6 Arab Film Festival (MAFF), the largest Arabic film festival in Europe, is held in Malm\u00f6.\nThe Nordic Game conference takes place in Malm\u00f6 every April/May. The event consists of conference itself, recruitment expo and game expo and attracts hundreds of gamedev professionals every year.\nMalm\u00f6 also hosts other 3rd party events that cater to all communities that reside in Malm\u00f6, including religious and political celebrations.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nSydsvenskan, founded in 1870, is Malm\u00f6's largest daily newspaper. It has an average circulation of 130,000. Its main competitor is the regional daily Sk\u00e5nska Dagbladet, which has a circulation of 34,000. The tabloid Kv\u00e4llsposten still has a minimal editorial staff but is today just a version of a Stockholm tabloid. The Social Democratic Arbetet was edited and printed at Malm\u00f6 between 1887 and 2000.In addition to these, a number of free-of-charge papers, generally dealing with entertainment, music and fashion have local editions (for instance City, Rodeo, Metro and N\u00f6jesguiden). Malm\u00f6 is also home to the Egmont Group's Swedish magazine operations. A number of local and regional radio and TV broadcasters are based in the Greater Malm\u00f6 area.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\n\n==== Football ====\n\nSports in southern Sweden are dominated by football. Over the years the city's best football teams have been Malm\u00f6 FF who play in the top-level Allsvenskan Malm\u00f6 FF had their most successful periods in the 1970s and 1980s when they won the league several times. In 1979, they advanced to the final of the European Cup defeating AS Monaco, Dynamo Kiew, Wisla Krakow and Austria Wien (Vienna) but lost in the final at the Munich Olympic Stadium against Nottingham Forest by a single goal just before half time scored by Trevor Francis. To date, they are the only Swedish football club to have reached the final of the competition. Malm\u00f6 FF is the club where for instance, Bosse Larsson and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 began their football careers.

It was designed by Sigurd Lewerentz.\n\n\n== Quote ==\nThe following quote was machine translated from text taken from the Swedish language Wikipedia site.\nEast cemetery in Malm\u00f6 is Malm\u00f6's largest cemetery.\nIn 1917 settled an architectural competition for a new cemetery in Malm\u00f6. The winning competition entry called \"ridge\" and was submitted by architect Sigurd Lewerentz. He came in the period 1917-1969 to respond to all major new construction and changes in the cemetery. He is also buried in the cemetery. There are also Gustaf Freij, Carl Herslow, Emil Mazetti-Nissen.\nThere are four chapels, St. Bridget of 1918, which is built in a classical style (now serves as the Orthodox Church) and the more modern twin chapels St. Gertrude and St. Knut from 1943. Even the small Chapel of Hope from the same year are in this building. Lewerentz last building on the eastern cemetery (and last in general) became the widely acclaimed flower shop from 1969. It was built in raw concrete and has a single radical form of an oversimplification of nybrutalismens spirit, but with a sophisticated design details. Flower Kiosk and Eastern Cemetery architecture attracts interested visitors from all over the world.\nIn 1937 extended Malm\u00f6's Sp\u00e5rv\u00e4gars line 6 up to the East entrance of the cemetery. Tram traffic nedlades However, in 1949 and replaced by buses.\n\nEast of the cemetery now has designated areas for Catholics, Orthodox, Jews and Muslims.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\u00d6stra kyrkog\u00e5rden (likely an old, broken link)\nhttp://malmo-kyrkogardsforvaltning.smrt.se/kyrkogardar_och_kapell/ostra_kyrkogarden\nIDstory om \u00d6stra kyrkog\u00e5rden\nSvenskagravar.se (S\u00f6k gravsatta)",

It has 550,000 different media, about 10,000 DVDs and 33,500 music CDs. In 2006, it became the first library in Sweden to lend video games.\n\n\n== History ==\nMalm\u00f6 City Library first opened on 12 December 1905, then in Hotel Tunneln. At that time they had 3,096 volumes \u2013 books and periodicals. In 1946, it moved to \"The Castle\" at Regementsgatan. The Castle, as it had come to be known as, was originally built for Malm\u00f6 Museum, and was designed by the architects John Smedberg and Fredrik Sundb\u00e4rg who had been inspired by Danish and Southern Swedish renaissance castles.\nMalm\u00f6 City Library, as it is today, consists of three buildings. \"The Calendar of light\" was designed by the Danish architect Henning Larsen and was inaugurated 31 May 1997. The Castle was restored and re-inaugurated 24 September 1999. These two main buildings are linked by a building called \"The Cylinder\", where the entrance, an information desk, a return desk and a cafe are located.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== External links ==\nMalm\u00f6 City Library \u2013 Official Site",

        "wiki": "Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 (Swedish pronunciation: [\u02c8sl\u01ce\u02d0tan \u026abra\u02c8h\u01d0\u02d0m\u028av\u026at\u0255]; Bosnian pronunciation: [zl\u01cetan ibrax\u01d0\u02d0mo\u028bit\u0255]; born 3 October 1981) is a Swedish professional footballer who plays as a striker for Serie A club Milan. Ibrahimovi\u0107 is widely regarded as one of the best strikers of his generation. He is one of the most decorated active footballers in the world, having won 31 trophies in his career. He has scored over 540 career goals, and has scored in each of the last four decades.Ibrahimovi\u0107 began his career at Malm\u00f6 FF in 1999, and signed for Ajax two years later. At Ajax, Ibrahimovi\u0107 gained a reputation as one of the most promising forwards in Europe, and departed two years later to sign for Juventus. He excelled in Serie A in a strike partnership with David Trezeguet, before joining domestic rivals Internazionale in 2006, where he won the Capocannoniere (Serie A top scorer) in 2008\u201309 and won three consecutive Serie A titles. In the summer of 2009, he moved to Barcelona in one of the world's most expensive transfers, before returning to Italy the following season, joining Milan. With them, he won another Serie A title in the 2010\u201311 season, before joining Paris Saint-Germain in July 2012. During his four-season stay in with them, Ibrahimovi\u0107 won a number of trophies including four consecutive Ligue 1 titles, and was the top scorer in Ligue 1 for three seasons. In October 2015, he became PSG's all time leading goalscorer at the time. In 2016, he joined Manchester United on a free transfer and won the FA Community Shield, Football League Cup and UEFA Europa League in his first season. Ibrahimovi\u0107 joined American club LA Galaxy in 2018. Two years later, he rejoined Milan.\nIbrahimovi\u0107 is one of ten players to have made 100 or more appearances for the Swedish national team, over a 15-year international career. He is the country's all-time leading goalscorer with 62 goals. He represented Sweden at the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups, as well as the 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 UEFA European Championships. He has been awarded Guldbollen (the Golden Ball), given to the Swedish player of the year, a record 11 times, including 10 consecutive times from 2007 to 2016. Ibrahimovi\u0107's bicycle kick goal for Sweden against England won the 2013 FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award.Ibrahimovi\u0107 was named in the FIFA FIFPro World XI in 2013 and the UEFA Team of the Year in 2007, 2009, 2013 and 2014. He finished at a peak of fourth for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2013. In 2019, FourFourTwo magazine named him the third-greatest player never to win the UEFA Champions League. In December 2014, Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter ranked him the second-greatest Swedish sportsperson ever, after tennis player Bj\u00f6rn Borg. Off the field, Ibrahimovi\u0107 is known for his brash persona and outspoken comments, in addition to referring to himself in the third person.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 was born in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, on 3 October 1981. He was born to a Muslim Bosniak father, \u0160efik Ibrahimovi\u0107, who emigrated to Sweden in 1977, and a Catholic Croat mother, Jurka Gravi\u0107, who also emigrated to Sweden where the couple first met. His father was born in Bijeljina (in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina), and his mother in the village of Prkos in \u0160kabrnja, in the SFR Yugoslavia (modern-day Croatia). He had a Catholic Christian upbringing.Ibrahimovi\u0107 began playing football at the age of six, after receiving a pair of football boots. He alternated between FBK Balkan, a Malm\u00f6 club founded by Yugoslav immigrants, Malm\u00f6 BI and briefly BK Flagg football clubs. While in his early teens, he was a regular for his hometown club Malm\u00f6 FF. At the age of 15, Ibrahimovi\u0107 was close to quitting his football career, in favour of working at the docks in Malm\u00f6, but his manager convinced him to continue playing. As a kid growing up, his hero was Brazilian forward Ronaldo. An avid viewer of Italian football, prolific striker Gabriel Batistuta \u2013 a player with similar characteristics to himself \u2013 was another player he admired.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Malm\u00f6 FF ===\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 signed his first contract with Malm\u00f6 in 1996, and moved up to the senior side for the 1999 season of Allsvenskan, Sweden's top-flight league. That season, Malm\u00f6 finished 13th in the league and were relegated to the second division, but returned to the top flight the next season. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger unsuccessfully tried to persuade Ibrahimovi\u0107 to join Arsenal, while Leo Beenhakker (the technical director of Ajax) also expressed interest in the player after watching him in a friendly against Norwegian side Moss FK. On 22 March 2001, a deal between Ajax and Malm\u00f6 regarding Ibrahimovi\u0107's transfer to Amsterdam was announced, and in July, Ibrahimovi\u0107 officially joined Ajax for 80 million Swedish kronor (\u20ac8.7 million).\n\n\n=== Ajax ===\nIbrahimovi\u0107 received little playing time under manager Co Adriaanse, but when Adriaanse was sacked on 29 November 2001, new coach Ronald Koeman inserted Ibrahimovi\u0107 into the starting lineup as Ajax won the 2001\u201302 Eredivisie title. The next season, Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored twice in a 2\u20131 victory over French champions Lyon in his Champions League debut on 17 September 2002. He scored five Champions League goals overall as Ajax fell to Milan in the quarter-finals.Ibrahimovi\u0107's profile rose when he scored an individual goal against NAC Breda on 22 August 2004 \u2013 a slaloming run past five opposition players which the commentator compared with Diego Maradona and Zinedine Zidane \u2013 that was eventually voted the Goal of the Year by Eurosport viewers. On 18 August 2004, during an international match against the Netherlands, Ibrahimovi\u0107 injured Ajax teammate Rafael van der Vaart, who later accused Ibrahimovi\u0107 of hurting him intentionally.\n\n\n=== Juventus ===\nIbrahimovi\u0107 moved from Ajax to Juventus for \u20ac16 million. He was promptly inserted into the starting eleven due in part to top scorer David Trezeguet's injury problems, and scored 16 goals. The club finished top of Serie A, and in the Champions League they reached the quarter-finals before being knocked out by eventual champions Liverpool. Near the end of the season, Juventus reportedly rejected a \u20ac70 million bid for him from Real Madrid, which was later revealed to be a publicity stunt initiated by Ibrahimovi\u0107's agent, Mino Raiola, in order to increase his market value. At the end of his first season in Italy Ibrahimovi\u0107 was named Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year, and in November 2005, he was awarded the Guldbollen, a prize awarded to the best Swedish footballer of the year.The following season was poor compared to his first season; his role in Juventus' attack changed, as he became less of a goalscorer and moved more to the sidelines, taking much part in the build-up play, especially as a target player, and his assist numbers increased. In the 2005\u201306 season, Juventus fans often got frustrated with him due to his anonymous presence in certain important games such as the Champions League defeat to Arsenal. Juventus were stripped of their last two Scudetti as part of the verdict from the Calciopoli scandal, and were relegated to Serie B. The new staff tried to persuade Ibrahimovi\u0107 and other top players to stay with Juventus, but the player and his agent were adamant to move on, with Raiola threatening legal action in order to extricate Ibrahimovi\u0107 from his contract.\n\n\n=== Inter Milan ===\n\nOn 10 August 2006, Ibrahimovi\u0107 completed a \u20ac24.8 million move to Inter Milan, signing a four-year-deal. Ibrahimovi\u0107 said that he had supported Inter when he was young.Ibrahimovi\u0107 made his debut for Inter on 26 August 2006 against Roma in the 2006 Supercoppa Italiana, playing the full 90 minutes as Inter won after extra time. He scored in his Serie A debut against Fiorentina on 9 September as Inter commenced the league with a 3\u20132 win at Stadio Artemio Franchi. Three days later, in his first Champions League appearance for Inter, Ibrahimovi\u0107 was not able to avoid the 1\u20130 away defeat to Sporting CP as Inter began their European campaign in the wrong way. Later, on 28 October, in his first \"Derby della Madonnina\" match against cross-town rivals Milan, Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored the third Inter goal of the match and also his third league goal of the season in a 4\u20133 thriller win. In his first season at the club, Ibrahimovi\u0107 top scored for Inter in Serie A with 15 goals, as the team won the Scudetto with a record 97 points.Ibrahimovi\u0107 played his 100th Serie A match on 16 September 2007 at the San Siro against Catania, where he appeared as a second-half substitute for Hern\u00e1n Crespo in an eventual 2\u20130 win. In 2007, he signed a new contract until June 2013; it was reported that this contract had made him the world's highest paid footballer. On 18 May 2008, Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored both goals in a 2\u20130 defeat of Parma on the final day of the 2007\u201308 Serie A season to give Inter a second consecutive Scudetto. Overall, he scored 17 goals in 26 league matches, and was named both Serie A Footballer of the Year and Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year.\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 started his third Inter season by winning the Supercoppa Italiana against Roma. After the regular and extra time had finished in a draw, the match went to a penalty shootout where he successfully converted his penalty attempt. He scored his team's only goal in the 2008\u201309 Serie A opening match against Sampdoria, which finished in a 1\u20131 draw. On 4 October, during the match against Bologna at home which Inter won 2\u20131, Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored a sensational goal, stunning Francesco Antonioli with an irresistible backheeled shot from Adriano's left-wing cross. The goal was later voted Goal of the Year in Serie A. On 19 October 2008, Ibrahimovi\u0107 continued with his solid performances by scoring twice in an impressive 4\u20130 win at Roma, taking his tally up to five league goals. He then scored another double in the Matchday 12 win against Palermo to help Inter take the lead in the Serie A table by one point. In the next fixture, Ibrahimovi\u0107 provided the assist on the only goal in the Derby d'Italia match against Juventus at home, helping Inter to extend their league lead.Ibrahimovi\u0107 ended the 2008\u201309 Serie A season as the league's top goalscorer with 25 goals, helping Inter to another league title. He was also named both Footballer of the Year and Foreign Footballer of the Year for the second consecutive season.\n\n\n=== Barcelona ===\n\n\n==== 2009\u201310 season ====\n\nAfter Inter teammate Maxwell completed his transfer to Barcelona, Bar\u00e7a president Joan Laporta confirmed that there was an agreement in principle between Barcelona and Inter for Ibrahimovi\u0107 to join the club in exchange for striker Samuel Eto'o, plus a reported fee of \u00a359 million. Ibrahimovi\u0107 left Inter during their United States summer tour in the World Football Challenge on 23 July 2009 for negotiations with Barcelona, with his last match for Inter being against Chelsea. After Inter agreed terms with Eto'o and Barcelona with Ibrahimovi\u0107, Barcelona announced Ibrahimovi\u0107 would arrive on 26 July 2009 and undergo a medical test on 27 July 2009.\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 passed his medical and was presented to a crowd of over 60,000 at Camp Nou. He signed a five-year contract, for \u20ac46 million and the exchange of Eto'o (valued at \u20ac20 million) and loan of Alexander Hleb (with an option to purchase for a \u20ac10 million fee), with a \u20ac250 million release clause, making Ibrahimovi\u0107 worth \u20ac66 million. The Hleb deal, however, collapsed. Eventually, Ibrahimovi\u0107 cost Barcelona \u20ac69.884 million, which included other fees. As per the Inter book, the fee was \u20ac69.5 million, but part of the Inter fee (max 5% according to FIFA regulation) were deducted and distributed by Barcelona to youth and young professional clubs of Ibrahimovi\u0107: Malm\u00f6 FF and AFC Ajax as solidarity contribution.\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 started the 2009\u201310 season with his competitive debut for Barcelona on 23 August 2009 by assisting a Lionel Messi goal, leading them to the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, beating Athletic Bilbao 5\u20131 on aggregate. In his next competitive match, Barcelona won the 2009 UEFA Super Cup with a 1\u20130 win over Shakhtar Donetsk. In his third appearance, he scored his first goal in Barcelona's La Liga season opener against Sporting Gij\u00f3n in a 3\u20130 win. Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored in his next four games, thus setting a team record as the only player ever to score in his first five league matches.On 20 October, he scored his first Champions League goal for Barcelona in a group stage match against Rubin Kazan. Five days later, he scored twice in a 6\u20131 thrashing of Real Zaragoza, giving him a league-leading seven goals in seven league matches while sending Barcelona to the top of the table. On 7 November, however, he suffered a thigh injury that kept him out for three weeks. He returned to action in week 12 of the season against Real Madrid as a second-half substitute for Thierry Henry, and scored his eighth goal of the campaign. He finished with 11 goals and 4 assists in Barcelona's first 15 league matches. Barcelona capped off 2009 by winning the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup against Estudiantes on 19 December 2009.\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 scored Barcelona's only goal in the 2009\u201310 Copa del Rey first leg match of the round of 16 in a 2\u20131 loss to Sevilla on 5 January 2010. On 20 January, he was selected in the 2009 UEFA Team of the Year. His first goal of 2010 came on 14 February against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. In his next appearance, Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored against Stuttgart in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League knockout stage fixture. He was sent off on 6 March in a league match against Almer\u00eda, which Barcelona appealed to no avail, and he was suspended for one game. A calf strain during warmups before the next La Liga match following his return from suspension against Athletic Bilbao ruled Ibrahimovi\u0107 out of the second leg 4\u20131 victory over Arsenal, in which he scored two goals away from home, the return leg of El Cl\u00e1sico against Madrid (which Barcelona won 2\u20130), and the next league match against Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a. He made his return as a substitute in the 82nd minute in a 0\u20130 away draw against Espanyol on 17 April.\n\nFollowing Barcelona's semi-final defeat to Inter Milan in the Champions League, Ibrahimovi\u0107 spoke of how he confronted his coach Pep Guardiola in the changing room. \"I yelled: 'You haven't got any balls!' and worse than that I added: 'You can go to hell!' I completely lost it, and you might have expected Guardiola to say a few words in response, but he's a spineless coward. He just [...] left, never to mention it again, not a word.\" He scored his final goal for Barcelona in the 2010 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a on 14 August in a 3\u20131 defeat against Sevilla, and on 25 August, he played his last match for the club against Milan for the Joan Gamper Trophy, after which he claimed to the media that his relationship with Guardiola had started deteriorating and that Guardiola had not spoken to him since February. In his autobiography I Am Zlatan, he states, \"'It started well but then Messi started to talk. He wanted to play in the middle, not on the wing, so the system changed from 4\u20133\u20133 to 4\u20135\u20131. I was sacrificed and no longer had the freedom on the pitch I need to succeed.\"\n\n\n==== 2010\u201311 season: Loan to Milan ====\nOn 28 August 2010, A.C. Milan announced via their official website that they had signed Ibrahimovi\u0107 for the 2010\u201311 season. He was loaned out to Milan for the season, with the club having the option to purchase him outright for \u20ac24 million at the end of the season. He signed a four-year deal immediately after successfully passing the medical examinations. Upon signing, Ibrahimovi\u0107 said, \"This move gives me more adrenaline. I have moved here to win the Champions League with Milan. I want to win the double.\"\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 made his Milan debut in a 2\u20130 loss to Cesena on 11 September, in which he missed a penalty late in the match, and scored his first goals for the club when Milan defeated Auxerre in their first Champions League match of the season on 15 September. On 14 November, Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored in a 1\u20130 victory against his former club Inter in the Derby della Madonnina. On 20 November, he scored his seventh goal against Fiorentina in the 45th minute with an over-the-head bicycle kick, passing Alexandre Pato as the team's top goalscorer for the season. On 4 December 2010, in a game against Brescia, he assisted Kevin-Prince Boateng to give Milan an early lead and then scored the third goal by a powerful shot near the edge of the penalty box to give Milan a 3\u20130 win. On 12 December 2010, history repeated itself in the game against Bologna after he assisted Boateng to give Milan an early lead once again and scoring later that match to make it 3\u20130, leading him to 13 goals with 8 assists in 21 matches in all competitions. Within days of the match, he was compared to Milan legend Marco van Basten by both the media and Van Basten himself.Ibrahimovi\u0107 received a three-match ban after being shown a red card in a 1\u20131 home draw against Bari in March 2011 for punching Bari defender Marco Rossi in the stomach. An additional three-match ban was given to Ibrahimovi\u0107 in February 2012 in a 2\u20131 home defeat against Fiorentina for swearing at an assistant referee. Ibrahimovi\u0107 stated in his defence that he was talking to himself in frustration. He won his first Scudetto with Milan after a draw against Roma. All agreements between Milan and Barcelona were confirmed on 18 June 2011.\n\n\n=== Milan ===\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 started the new season on 6 August in the 2011 Supercoppa Italiana against city rivals Inter, where he scored the first goal of a 2\u20131 comeback victory to clinch the first trophy of the season. In the opening league match of the 2011\u201312 season, Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored Milan's first goal of a 2\u20132 home draw against Lazio. He scored his first Champions League goal of the season on 28 September in a 2\u20130 home win against Viktoria Plze\u0148, which was followed by another one on 19 October against BATE Borisov in another 2\u20130 home win. He continued with his solid performances as he scored in a 4\u20131 home win against Parma and a brace in the team's 3\u20132 away victory over Roma, ending a successful month of October.November saw him score in consecutive games against BATE, in the Champions League, and Catania, in the league. Later in the month against Barcelona in another Champions League tie, Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored against his old club to equalise the game at 1\u20131. Bar\u00e7a eventually pulled away however with Xavi scoring the winning goal for the Catalan giants to make it 3\u20132 at the San Siro. He ended November with a brace against Chievo, the first of those tallies brought his Serie A career total to 100 goals. In December, Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored a goal in each of five Serie A games.

Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored 11 goals during the qualifying phase, making him its second-top goalscorer after Poland's Robert Lewandowski.\nOn 11 May 2016, Ibrahimovi\u0107 made the final 23-man squad for Sweden at Euro 2016. As captain, he played every minute of Sweden's three group matches, but did not score any goals. He managed only one shot on target during the tournament. Sweden finished in last place in their group and as a result were eliminated along with seven other teams in the group stage. On 21 June 2016, Ibrahimovi\u0107 announced that he would retire from international football immediately after Sweden's last match at Euro 2016.In November 2017, after Sweden clinched qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia by defeating Italy in the second qualifying round, there was speculation about a possible return of Ibrahimovi\u0107 to the national team. Ibrahimovi\u0107 himself expressed his wish to represent Sweden in the World Cup. However, in April 2018, Sweden manager Janne Andersson stated that Ibrahimovi\u0107 will not be called-up for the World Cup, thus ending any possibility of a return. Later in June, Ibrahimovi\u0107 blamed the Swedish media for his World Cup absence.\n\n\n== Style of play ==\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 has been described by ESPN as being \"good in the air, quick, tall, strong and agile, he plays well with his back to goal and boasts some of the best finishing, vision, passing and ball control around.\" A versatile and well-rounded footballer, from a tactical standpoint, Ibrahimovi\u0107 is capable of playing anywhere along the front line, due to his ability to both create and score goals for his team, although he is most often deployed as a striker, due to his composure and eye for goal. He has also functioned in a more creative playmaking role at times, as a supporting forward or even as a number 10, in particular in his later career, after losing some of his pace and stamina with age; this deeper position allows him to drop into midfield to pick up the ball, where he can utilise his technical ability, vision, passing, and movement to create space and provide assists for teammates.\n\nWhile naturally right-footed, Ibrahimovi\u0107 is a powerful and accurate striker of the ball from both inside or outside the penalty area with either foot, and is also known for his accuracy from penalties and dead ball situations. An accurate finisher with his head as well as with his feet, his height, elevation, and strength often give him an advantage at winning aerial challenges, and also allow him to function as a \"target man\"; despite his large stature, Ibrahimovi\u0107 is uncommonly agile for a player of his size, and his athleticism and ability in the air have seen him score several goals from acrobatic strikes and volleys throughout his career, which earned him the monicker Ibracadabra in the Italian media. In spite of his size and physique, Ibrahimovi\u0107 possesses excellent technique and ball control, which, coupled with his balance, power, and physicality, enables him to hold up the ball well with his back to goal, retain possession, and link up with other players; he has also been praised by pundits for his creativity and dribbling skills.\n\nConsidered to be a highly talented player in his youth, due to his prolific goalscoring, consistency, and spectacular strikes, Ibrahimovi\u0107 came to be regarded by many in the sport to be one of the best players in the world during his prime, and as one of the greatest and most complete strikers of his generation; he has also drawn praise from managers and teammates for his leadership and longevity, as well as his fitness, professionalism, and dedication in training. Regarding his work-ethic, his former Juventus, Fabio Capello commented in 2016: \"At the beginning of his first spell at Juventus [...] I noticed that he was weaker than I thought when he had to kick the ball and was not very strong in the air. Ibrahimovic [sic] loved making assists more than scoring goals. I wanted him to become more ruthless in front of goal and improve his finishing. He had the same technical skills as Van Basten and I made him watch some videos of him to improve his finishing. I told him to watch Van Basten's movements inside the area and the way he used to score goals. Ibra got it straight away; I think results are out there to prove it. He is a very humble guy and he worked every day to improve. He\u2019s proud of himself too, he loves being the best.\"Although Ibrahimovi\u0107 has been criticised at times in the media for being inconsistent in high pressure situations, and for his limited work-rate and poor performances in big matches, in particular in his youth, throughout his career he has scored in some of the biggest matches in football; these include the Derby della Madonnina and the Derby d'Italia in Italy, El Cl\u00e1sico, El Otro Cl\u00e1sico, and the Catalan Derbi barcelon\u00ed in Spain, Le Classique in France, De Klassieker and De Topper in the Netherlands, and the Manchester Derby and North-West Derby in England, as well as UEFA Champions League and UEFA European Championship games against some of the strongest opponents in European football. He has also scored in the Helsingborgs IF\u2013Malm\u00f6 FF \"Sk\u00e5nederby\" in Sweden, and in El Tr\u00e1fico and the California Cl\u00e1sico in the United States. Moreover, in addition to being a prolific striker, he has also been highly successful throughout his career, winning numerous titles in several countries; additionally, he is the only player to have scored for six different clubs in the Champions League. Known for his strong mentality, as well as his extroverted and highly competitive personality, despite his success, he has been criticised in the media for his arrogance, aggression and rebellious character, as well as his lack of discipline on the pitch, in particular in his early career, which has led him to involved in confrontations with other players, some of his managers and even reporters. Ibrahimovi\u0107 has frequently been compared to Dutchman Marco van Basten, due to their similar playing styles, physiques, and proclivity for scoring from powerful shots and volleys; despite this comparison, Ibrahimovi\u0107 has stated that his main influence was his idol, former Brazilian forward Ronaldo, whom he regards as the greatest player of all time. He has also been likened to French former footballer Eric Cantona, who also played for Manchester United.\n\n\n== Football-related business activities ==\n\n\n=== Hammarby IF ===\nOn 27 November 2019, it was announced that Ibrahimovi\u0107 had bought 23.5 percent of the shares in Hammarby IF, a Swedish top flight club from Stockholm. The seller was Anschutz Entertainment Group, also the owner of his former club LA Galaxy, who reduced their stake in Hammarby by half. In Sweden, all sport teams in the league systems are regulated to be nonprofit organizations, which means that a majority of the voting rights, or 51 percent, is still controlled by the members of the club. Fans of Malm\u00f6 FF, who were unhappy with Ibrahimovi\u0107's investment into their rival club, have vandalised his statue in Malm\u00f6 on numerous occasions.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 has been involved in several violent incidents with teammates. After a 2004 international friendly against the Netherlands, Ajax teammate Rafael van der Vaart publicly accused Ibrahimovi\u0107 of deliberately injuring him during the game. Ibrahimovi\u0107 responded by threatening to break both of van der Vaart's legs. Ibrahimovi\u0107 also punched Ajax teammate Mido in the dressing room after the latter had thrown a pair of scissors at him.During his spell at Barcelona, Ibrahimovi\u0107 had a falling-out with coach Pep Guardiola, culminating in a dressing room incident in which Ibrahimovi\u0107 threw a training-kit box across the room and screamed insults at Guardiola. Guardiola eventually refused to speak to Ibrahimovi\u0107 and loaned him out to Milan. Barcelona vice president Carles Vilarrubi further revealed that Ibrahimovi\u0107 had threatened to publicly beat up Guardiola if he was not released to Milan.\n\nIn 2010, Ibrahimovi\u0107 was involved in a training-ground fist-fight with Milan teammate Oguchi Onyewu, after Ibrahimovi\u0107 made a two-footed tackle on him, followed by a headbutt. They were separated and the session prematurely abandoned, with Ibrahimovi\u0107 having suffered a broken rib in the fracas. Both players had accused one of insulting the other. In March 2011, Ibrahimovi\u0107 was given a three-match ban for punching Bari defender Marco Rossi in the stomach during a game. He received another three-match ban in February 2012 for slapping Napoli player Salvatore Aronica. In 2011, Ibrahimovi\u0107 kicked teammate Antonio Cassano in the head while Cassano was speaking to reporters, and kicked Milan teammate Rodney Strasser during a training session.In November 2012 with PSG, he received a two-match ban for kicking Saint-\u00c9tienne goalkeeper St\u00e9phane Ruffier in the chest. In December 2012, Ibrahimovi\u0107 was accused by Lyon defender Dejan Lovren and president Jean-Michel Aulas of deliberately stamping on Lovren's head. Lovren suggested the reason Zlatan escaped punishment was due to his \u201csuperstar status\u201d. In February 2013, UEFA handed Ibrahimovi\u0107 a two-match ban for stamping on Valencia winger Andr\u00e9s Guardado. In March 2013, PSG winger Lucas claimed that Ibrahimovi\u0107 regularly insulted teammates, stating, \"He always asks for the ball and insults a lot. He is sometimes a bit arrogant and complains.\" Lucas later claimed, however, that the interview was twisted and badly translated. In May 2013, Ibrahimovi\u0107 was filmed screaming at PSG sporting director Leonardo after the club's title victory.Lyon coach Hubert Fournier accused Ibrahimovi\u0107 of abusing officials, stating in January 2015 that \"all the referees in this league get insulted by this person\". Two months later, after a loss by PSG in a Ligue 1 match, Ibrahimovi\u0107 ranted, \"In 15 years I've never seen a [good] referee in this shit country ... [they] don't even deserve PSG.\" He later apologised, but was criticised by French politicians, and Ligue 1 imposed a four-match ban.\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 has additionally engaged in multiple incidents while with the national team. After Sweden's 1\u20130 victory over the Faroe Islands in October 2012, Faroes captain Fr\u00f3\u00f0i Benjaminsen accused Ibrahimovi\u0107 of foul play and insults, describing him as \"arrogant\", \"childish\", \"ignorant\", and a \"dirty player\". In December 2015, French sports daily L'\u00c9quipe branded Ibrahimovi\u0107 and Cristiano Ronaldo the \"most arrogant\" footballers in the world. Ibrahimovi\u0107 was additionally caught on camera kicking teammate Christian Wilhelmsson during training.In 2013, he came under fire from the Sweden women's national team for an interview published on Christmas Day by tabloid Expressen, in which he had commented about the disparity of achievements by, and the treatment of, male and female footballers. His former teammate Anders Svensson had been rewarded with a car for becoming Sweden's most-capped player that year, but Therese Sj\u00f6gran had received no such reward for doing likewise for the women's team, despite owning 41 more caps (187 to 146) than Svensson at the time. Ibrahimovi\u0107's response to the issue was that Sweden would be \"devaluing\" Svensson \"by comparing him with the ladies' individual achievements. They can get a bike with my autograph on it and then we're good.\" Coach Pia Sundhage replied that his comments were \"sad and unfortunate\" and epitomised \"failings in the basic values of male football\", while Sj\u00f6gran said, \"I understand him when he says that the men's national team brings in more money and exposure. That's true. But this is about respect.\"In April 2016, Mino Raiola announced that Ibrahimovi\u0107 would be suing Swedish trainer Ulf Karlsson over doping claims. According to Expressen, Karlsson cited Ibrahimovi\u0107's \"unnatural\" and \"rapid weight gain\" during his stint with Juventus. Raiola said about the allegations, \"The claims are just crazy \u2013 the facts are not there. All the clubs Zlatan has been at know he doesn't even take aspirin.\"In April 2019, Real Salt Lake defender Nedum Onuoha accused Ibrahimovic of foul play and threats to injure him during a game, calling him \"arrogant\", \"disrespectful\", and \"a complete thug\". In May 2019, Ibrahimovi\u0107 received a two-match ban for violent conduct, after choking NYCFC goalkeeper Sean Johnson. In July 2019, Ibrahimovi\u0107 made controversial remarks about the level of play in the MLS, describing himself as \"a Ferrari among Fiats\" and \"by far the best player\" in the league. More controversy followed suit when\u2014after the Galaxy's loss to crosstown rivals Los Angeles FC during playoffs\u2014Ibrahimovic was seen making obscene gestures towards heckling fans as he left the pitch.In November 2019, Ibrahimovi\u0107 bought a 23.5% stake in Stockholm-based club Hammarby, which is the rival to the striker's boyhood club, Malm\u00f6. In his statement, the player said that he intends on making it the best club. However, his decision to invest in the club infuriated the fans of Malm\u00f6 who vandalized his bronze statue and set it ablaze. The striker responded to the incident and marked that the decision had nothing to with where he began his career.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 has one sibling (Sanela) and four half-siblings. His longtime partner is Helena Seger, with whom he has two sons: Maximilian (born 22 September 2006) and Vincent (born 6 March 2008). He currently resides outside Los Angeles, although he still has a home in Malm\u00f6, where he spends his summers. Ibrahimovi\u0107 received an honorary black belt in taekwondo; he attended classes at the Malm\u00f6 Taekwondo club Enighet (\"Unity\") as a child. Ibrahimovi\u0107 is fluent in five languages: Swedish, Bosnian, English, Spanish and Italian. He has stated that he was raised as a Catholic. Ibrahimovi\u0107 often refers to himself in the third person.The name \"Zlatan\" was trademarked in May 2003 at the Swedish Patent and Registration Office for \"most likely being perceived as Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107\", which meant that he received exclusive rights to the name for certain products, including sporting goods, clothing, and shoes. Ibrahimovi\u0107 is under contract with Nike and features in their television advertising where he has appeared alongside other players in the Nike stable including Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and Wayne Rooney. He wears the Nike Mercurial boot line and has the names and dates of birth of his sons embedded onto the external sides of his boots. In late 2007, Ibrahimovi\u0107, with the help of Nike, self-funded Zlatan Court in the streets of the city district Roseng\u00e5rd in his hometown Malm\u00f6: he provided a playing mat, goalposts, lighting and a modern fence. In 2008, he donated new Nike kits to his youth club, FBK Balkan.\n\nIn a February 2011 interview, Ibrahimovi\u0107 stated that the boxer Muhammad Ali is one of his role models, going on to say: \"One of my idols in sport and outside the sport also [sic]...he believed in his [principles] and he never gave [them] up.\" While in Malm\u00f6 with the national team in September 2012, Ibrahimovi\u0107 was honoured with the inscription of his name on the city's \"Walk of Fame of Sports\". The Swedish Post Office issued a set of five postage stamps featuring Ibrahimovi\u0107 in March 2014. Ibrahimovi\u0107 features in EA Sports' FIFA video game series, and was the fourth highest rated player in FIFA 15.On 11 August 2014, Ibrahimovi\u0107 paid US$51,000 to send the Swedish national football team for the intellectually disabled to the INAS World Football Championships in Brazil. After teammates Johan Elmander, Kim K\u00e4llstr\u00f6m, Andreas Isaksson and Per Nilsson donated autographed jerseys to be auctioned off for the cause, Ibrahimovi\u0107 responded, \"What the hell are you going to do with a shirt? How much is it to go?\". In a league match against Caen on 14 February 2015, Ibrahimovi\u0107 took off his shirt after scoring a goal to unveil the removable tattooed names of 50 people suffering from hunger around the world, in a gesture to raise awareness for famine in accordance with the United Nations World Food Programme.Active on social media, Zlatan has over 40 million Instagram followers, the most for a person from Sweden. Independent Swedish film production company Auto Images released the sports documentary Becoming Zlatan in February 2016 which follows Ibrahimovi\u0107 through his formative years with Malm\u00f6 FF and Ajax all the way to his breakthrough with Juventus in 2005. The film has been featured at several film festivals including the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam, Helsinki Documentary Film Festival and the Rouen Nordic Film Festival amongst others. He does not drink alcohol.On 8 October 2019, a statue of Ibrahimovi\u0107 was unveiled in his hometown, outside Malm\u00f6's Stadion. The statue, created by Peter Linde, is 8 feet 9 inches (2.67 m) tall and weighs almost 500 kilograms (1,100 lb).\n\n\n=== Religious and social background ===\nIbrahimovi\u0107 was born to a Bosniak Muslim father, \u0160efik Ibrahimovi\u0107, and a Croat Catholic mother, Jurka Gravi\u0107; his parents were immigrants to Sweden from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, \u0160efik from SR Bosnia and Herzegovina and Jurka from SR Croatia, and met for the first time in Sweden. Ibrahimovi\u0107's parents divorced when he was a child, and although his upbringing was divided between them, he spent more time with his father: \"I had time with my mother but I really lived with my father.\" He has said in a 2012 interview with PSG that: \"My father is Muslim, my mother is Catholic, but none of that has anything to do with football. I received a special education. I'm me and football is a religion in its own right, and everyone is welcome...\" In an interview with CNN on 24 November 2015, he stressed that his Muslim background was \"not a factor\" in fans' perception of him: \"For me, it didn't change (anything) because my father is Muslim and my mother is Catholic... For me it is all about respect. That's how I grew up and the way I learned to be. This is what I am.\" Nevertheless he later described himself as a \"deeply faithful Catholic\".The Malm\u00f6-based television presenter Teddy Land\u00e9n, who was interviewed for the same documentary, noted Ibrahimovi\u0107's choice of shirt name following his 2001 transfer to Ajax: \"You can see that just the fact that when he [emerged] in the professional [football] world [at Ajax], from Sweden, where he was only known [by the name] Zlatan \u2013 his first name \u2013 he changed so he would have Ibrahimovi\u0107 on his shirt, on his jersey, because he wanted to honour his background. Being from a Muslim background, being from a very very low key, very low status background, he really [wanted] to show all the kids from Roseng\u00e5rd [and] from Malm\u00f6 in general: 'If I can do it, you can do it.'\"\n\n\n=== Body art ===\nHis surname is tattooed in Arabic on the back of his right arm, the names of his sons Vincent and Maximilian on his right arm. He has the common Buddhist \"Five Deva Faces Yantra\" representing wind, water, fire, creative perception and space, arranged in a way believed to ward off illness and injury, on his lower back.

          "WE`ve had a great day out at Malmo and esp in Folkets Park - entry free and most activities for the kids are free too. Spent over 4 hrs in there and absolutly loved it. Climbing, Cocart, Skateboards ect, great for young and older kids too.",

          "During the summer months, the park has many food trucks during the weekends. You can also borrow skateboards and other games to play. There are always a few restaurants and cafes open even during winter as well as a skating rink. There is also a nightclub in the centre of the",
          "This was a wonderful bustling place and would be an ideal place to take kids as there are so many playparks and children's activities available. However, even if you do not have kids there are some wonderful fountains and nice open areas and the park is a great place to have a",

          "Especially great for families and kids. Always fun things happening in Folkets Park, for all ages and interests.",
          "Folkets Park is one of the coolest parks in Malmo. It offers pretty much everything you'd want from a park: grass, mini-lake, Sunday market, mini-golf and at night, you can even come and dance your heart away at a popular nightclub that's right inside the park.",
          "This park has some different equipment. I loved the graffiti outside on the hoarding at the end of the park.",
          "We were forced to go there by our daughter who found the place by the Internet. But in November it looks abandoned. Absolutely nothing to do. No attractions, no food. And even walking there was not a big pleasure. Everything looks very shabby and unmaintained. Don't waste your",
          "Everything shut or broken. Please avoid. Dirty and full of litter. All the attractions have gone and lots of the area are closed off. I cant say anything that can redeem this place.",

          "It's a good place if you have kids. Otherwise, nothing really to do. However, when there's any specific events (such as: Midsummer, etc.), it's definitely worth to visit!",
          "If you have kids under ten and you are visiting Malmo in summer you will earn many brownie points with the kids if you take them to play in this park! We have seen free playgrounds in many countries but have never seen so many kids having so much fun! Of course if you don't",
          "Not sure if this is because it is winter, but this park has very little green space, an area for skateboarders and a scary ice rink which is nothing more than a frozen pond. Ice skates for hire along with crash helmet- very sensible. I wouldn't recommend at this time of year,",
          "Much used local park. Skateboarding area. Interesting reptile and monkey zoo, up close and personal. Worth a visit.",
          "Walking by sometimes you wonder what the Moorish Pavilion is all about in the middle of the park but there are events and the park offers skateboard thrills ice rink restaurant and much more",
          "We actually just visited the rock bar Folkets Bar for a concert but the surrounding park looked really nice too. Folkets Bar has a spacey terrace area with views to a fountain and the park.",

          "14 holes of well crafted contoured holes with features taken from the city e.g. Turning torso building. Interesting and challenging holes without ever being unfairly hard. We take our mini golf seriously and this is a contender for best ever!",
          "A popular place for the locals in the hipster/immigrant neighborhood of Malm\u00f6. The park offers both a large scene and small ones too, different events, places for food and coffee, traditional park stuff like ice cream, play grounds and benched. Come here with your kids, friends",
          "On arrival, a mosque greeted me and I thought I was at a wrong place. But upon exploring further, there were so many children running around, playing with the rose shaped fountain, sunbathing or hiding under the shade. The atmosphere was of a park than a mosque. A really nice",
          "Folkets Park is a great visit when in Malm\u00f6. If you have children they will love the playgrounds, the mini golf, ice cream and cotton candy, terrarium and so on. The caf\u00e9 Far i Hatten is also well worth a visit and will be enjoyed by both adults and children.",
          "Not a big park, but due to it's localization and offering quite crowded on weekends and/or sunny days. Enough grassy places to picknic in, plenty of playgrounds for children (including an open air bouncy thingy) and with food. This is what makes the park so popular amongst the",
          "very nice for wandering around close to other attractions good if weather is nice. Lots of little hide aways for a break too.",
          "A True dissapointment. It's suppose to be a central park in Malm\u00f6 but, is nothing like it used to be are what it ought to be. The one and only thing that is worth a visit is the terrarium which was very interesting. Go directly there and skip the so called park.",
          "This park in city's heart has few restaurants, a bunch of animals and a big playground. It is free for entry and undoubtedly most popular picnic spot for locals. It has few beautiful sculpture including a huge Lotus with fountain.",

          "After getting my bikes form the hotel we went for a bike*ride. In the Folkets park you're not supposed to bike, but as it was a pretty slow afternoon we did it anyway. The park's a great place to be. The entire area's just breathing relaxation. There are many parks in Malm\u00f6,",
          "If you are in holiday with your chidren is very nice to have a picknic and feed the ducks. But is not so special",
          "I expected more since it is one of the top ten of Malmo. But i was disappointed. The flea market was poor. the park was kind of neglected. the rose fountain is creepy :) It is being under construction (oct. 2015). but on the other hand, your kids can have fun there.",
          "I can see from the different reviews, that people's expectations of what a \"People's park\" should contain, vary a lot. Haven't been here since they took away the pony riding and rides, so expectations were low, but we were pleasantly surprised. Came here with some friends and",
          "There are some swings and specially designed areas where kids can play around but other than that there's nothing interesting to do here",
          "I was told by a local to come here, it's definitely not worth it, it shouldn't be an attraction to visit the place is bare and dirty with nothing of interest.",

          "We stumbled on this park and it was a huge hit with your kids, it is free to go in and even the rides on the little cars are free, there are loads of climbing frames and a pond the kids can splash in, there was a flea market and live music when we went. Lots of little stalls to",
          "For some reason I thought I would be more impressed by this park, however, I was not. It resembled any public park you can get in most North America cities and there was nothing particular about it to have on the map as an attraction.",
          "I am not impressed by this park. It's not nice maintained, there is too much vegetation and no running water on tap so that children wash their hands. Not very clean park.",
          "We love this park. Nice playgrounds, pool for toddlers and older children, cafes, and resting areas with shade. My son loves the playground and the pool.",
          "A lovely little park to sit and pass some time, if you have children there's a lot for them to do and play on including a crazy trampoline type thing.",
          "A lovely park, great for kids! Also for adults, with cool bars and restaurants. Fantastic in the summer.",
          "There is a lot of strange people around the Volkspark - Almost the most attractions were closed - a big mosque was the center of the Park",
          "This is an amazing place, where we can just sit in the nice square inside and have fun, conversation looking a lovely garden.",
          "They are under repairs but, just fine to have something around to do, besides only shopping, nightlife or eating on restaurants...",
          "We passed by this park at night, and it was absolutely breathtaking. Everything is nicely lit, I can't imagine how beautiful this place must be during the day! We had a blast just by walking around this amuzement park. It gets scary at night, but totally worth seeing!",
          "This is a great open air space in the centre off he city with a range of attractions for all ages. There are play areas for toddlers and older children and rides in the summer. There is also a reptile house, however we did not attend this as it was very expensive to go in. There",
          "Folketspark is a small park and it is not so green, it has some playgrounds, but mainly i go there for the cultural events. In the summer there are festivals and music and films shown in open air. There are some night clubs and many locals hang got in the park drinking beer in",
          "We visited the park when there was a Turkish festival. The park was filled with music and food and dancing on a beautiful spring day. All ages were present, and clearly enjoyed getting outdoors. Some of the buildings are dated, but the location is still functional and fun.",
          "Great in the warm April sun, but not much happening, not a very pretty park, small and untidy, unless you have a reason to go, suggest don't bother.",
          "Folkets Park! The park for Everybody! Nice Paris wheel with great view over the city of Malmo! Nice park to walk thru!",
          "This park is literally in the center of town. Great place to go during the summer with a blanket and just lay down. Many people gather there during the summer months to enjoy the sun and there is also a little tivoli for kids to enjoy, rides, ice cream etc.",
          "I won't go on as the other reviews on here tell you but there's everything for everyone of all ages.. The fair was fantastic, the water pool, the chill out areas, the cafes, we got there today at 10am and didn't leave till 7pm, what an asset to Malmo, see you next summer!!",
          "This is where Malmo's hipster/hippie communities hang out, and I don't blame them. It's a big free \"people's park\", with rides (not free), recreational areas, a big rose water fountain (which you can go in.. but mostly kids!), mini-zoo, etc, etc. There are also a few cafes and"

          "A true piece of living history, a pearl in the heart of Malm\u00f6. The guide inside the museum, was the most amazing sweet woman, i learned so much from her, and she actually knew the answer to every question I had! She's as amazing as this house...! It was so good i felt a bit",
          "I had the pleasure to visit Ebbas Hus and I was so impressed with this piece of jewelry. The history of how the city received the house, but also the cultural history attached to the house are just incredible. The museum is advertised as the smallest in Malm\u00f6, but really, it",

          "Based on previous review we wnt along, it is a small museum, worth noting that it is only open Wednesday and Saturday 12:00 till 16:00. It doesn't take lo g to go round, the house guide will tell you about Ebba and her family, then you are left to wander, stepping back in time",

        "wiki": "Malm\u00f6 (; Swedish: [\u02c8m\u00e2lm\u00f8\u02d0] (listen); Danish: Malm\u00f8 [\u02c8m\u00e6lm\u02cc\u00f8\u02c0]) is the largest city in the Swedish county (l\u00e4n) of Sk\u00e5ne (Scania). It is the third-largest city in Sweden, after Stockholm and Gothenburg, and the sixth-largest city in Scandinavia, with a population of 316,588 (municipal total 338,230 in 2018). The Malm\u00f6 Metropolitan Region is home to over 700,000 people, and the \u00d8resund Region, which includes Malm\u00f6, is home to 4 million people.Malm\u00f6 was one of the earliest and most industrialized towns in Scandinavia, but it struggled to adapt to post-industrialism. Since the construction of the \u00d6resund Bridge, Malm\u00f6 has undergone a major transformation, producing new architectural developments, supporting new biotech and IT companies, and attracting students through Malm\u00f6 University and other higher education facilities. The city contains many historic buildings and parks, and is also a commercial center for the western part of Scania.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest written mention of Malm\u00f6 as a city dates from 1275. It is thought to have been founded shortly before that date, as a fortified quay or ferry berth of the Archbishop of Lund, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) to the north-east. Malm\u00f6 was for centuries Denmark's second-biggest city. Its original name was Malmhaug (with alternate spellings), meaning \"Gravel pile\" or \"Ore Hill\".\nIn the 15th century, Malm\u00f6 became one of Denmark's largest and most visited cities, reaching a population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. It became the most important city around the \u00d8resund, with the German Hanseatic League frequenting it as a marketplace, and was notable for its flourishing herring fishery. In 1437, King Eric of Pomerania (King of Denmark from 1396 to 1439) granted the city's arms: argent with a griffin gules, based on Eric's arms from Pomerania. The griffin's head as a symbol of Malm\u00f6 extended to the entire province of Scania from 1660.\nIn 1434, a new citadel was constructed at the beach south of the town. This fortress, known today as Malm\u00f6hus, did not take its current form until the mid-16th century. Several other fortifications were constructed, making Malm\u00f6 Sweden's most fortified city, but only Malm\u00f6hus remains.\n\nLutheran teachings spread during the 16th century Protestant Reformation, and Malm\u00f6 became one of the first cities in Scandinavia to fully convert (1527\u20131529) to this Protestant denomination.\nIn the 17th century, Malm\u00f6 and the Scanian region (Sk\u00e5neland) came under control of Sweden following the Treaty of Roskilde with Denmark, signed in 1658. Fighting continued, however; in June 1677, 14,000 Danish troops laid siege to Malm\u00f6 for a month, but were unable to defeat the Swedish troops holding it.\nBy the dawn of the 18th century, Malm\u00f6 had about 2,300 inhabitants. However, owing to the wars of Charles XII of Sweden (reigned 1697\u20131718) and to bubonic plague epidemics, the population dropped to 1,500 by 1727. The population did not grow much until the modern harbor was constructed in 1775. The city started to expand and the population in 1800 was 4,000. 15 years later, it had increased to 6,000.\n\nIn 1840, Frans Henrik Kockum founded the workshop from which the Kockums shipyard eventually developed as one of the largest shipyards in the world. The Southern Main Line was built between 1856 and 1864; this enabled Malm\u00f6 to become a center of manufacture, with major textile and mechanical industries. In 1870, Malm\u00f6 overtook Norrk\u00f6ping to become Sweden's third-most populous city, and by 1900 Malm\u00f6 had strengthened this position with 60,000 inhabitants. Malm\u00f6 continued to grow through the first half of the 20th century. The population had swiftly increased to 100,000 by 1915 and to 200,000 by 1952.\n\n\n=== 1900\u20131969 ===\n\nIn 1914 (15 May to 4 October) Malm\u00f6 hosted the Baltic Exhibition. The large park Pildammsparken was arranged and planted for this large event. The Russian part of the exhibition was never taken down, owing to the outbreak of World War I.\nOn 18 and 19 December 1914, the Three Kings Meeting was held in Malm\u00f6. After a somewhat infected period (1905\u20131914), which included the dissolution of the Swedish-Norwegian Union, King Oscar II was replaced with King H\u00e5kon VII in Norway, who was the younger brother of the Danish King Christian X. As Oscar died in 1907, and his son Gustav V became the new King of Sweden, the tensions within Scandinavia were still unclear, but during this historical meeting, the Scandinavian Kings found internal understanding, as well as a common line about remaining neutral in the ongoing war.\nWithin sports, Malm\u00f6 has mostly been associated with football. IFK Malm\u00f6 participated in the first ever edition of Allsvenskan 1924/25, but from the mid-1940s Malm\u00f6 FF started to rise, and ever since it has been one of the most prominent clubs within Swedish football. They have won Allsvenskan 23 times in all (as of February 2018) between 1943/44 and 2017.\n\n\n=== 1970s and later ===\nBy 1971, Malm\u00f6 reached 265,000 inhabitants, but this was the peak which would stand for more than 30 years. (Svedala was, for a few years in the early 1970s, a part of Malm\u00f6 municipality.)\nBy the mid-1970s Sweden experienced a recession that hit the industrial sector especially hard; shipyards and manufacturing industries suffered, which led to high unemployment in many cities of Scania. Kockums shipyard had become a symbol of Malm\u00f6 as its largest employer and, when shipbuilding ceased in 1986, confidence in the future of Malm\u00f6 plummeted among politicians and the public. In addition, many middle-class families moved into one-family houses in surrounding municipalities such as Vellinge Municipality, Lomma Municipality and Staffanstorp Municipality, which profiled themselves as the suburbs of the upper-middle class. By 1985, Malm\u00f6 had lost 35,000 inhabitants and was down to 229,000.The Swedish financial crises of the early 1990s exacerbated Malm\u00f6's decline as an industrial city; between 1990 and 1995 Malm\u00f6 lost about 27,000 jobs and its economy was seriously strained. However, from 1994 under the leadership of the then mayor Ilmar Reepalu, the city of Malm\u00f6 started to create a new economy as a center of culture and knowledge. Malm\u00f6 reached bottom in 1995, but that same year marked the commencement of the massive \u00d6resund Bridge road, railway and tunnel project, connecting it to Copenhagen and to the rail lines of Europe. The new Malm\u00f6 University opened in 1998 on Kockums' former dockside. Further redevelopment of the now disused south-western harbor followed; a city architecture exposition (Bo01) was held in the area in 2001, and its buildings and villas form the core of a new city district. Designed with attractive waterfront vistas, it was intended to be and has been successful in attracting the urban middle-class.\nSince 1974, the Kockums Crane had been a landmark in Malm\u00f6 and a symbol of the city's manufacturing industry, but in 2002 it was disassembled and moved to South Korea. In 2005, Malm\u00f6 gained a new landmark with completion of Turning Torso, the tallest skyscraper in Scandinavia. Although the transformation from a city with its economic base in manufacturing has returned growth to Malm\u00f6, the new types of jobs have largely benefited the middle and upper classes.\nIn its 2015 and 2017 reports, Police in Sweden placed the Roseng\u00e5rd and the S\u00f6dra Sofielund/Seved district in the most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMalm\u00f6 is located at 13\u00b000' east and 55\u00b035' north, near the southwestern tip of Sweden, in the province of Scania.\nThe city is part of the transnational \u00d6resund Region and, since 2000, has been linked by the \u00d6resund Bridge across the \u00d6resund to Copenhagen, Denmark. The bridge opened on 1 July 2000, and measures 8 kilometres (5 miles) (the whole link totalling 16 km), with pylons reaching 204.5 metres (670.9 feet) vertically. Apart from the Helsingborg-Helsing\u00f8r ferry links further north, most ferry connections have been discontinued.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nMalm\u00f6, like the rest of southern Sweden, has an oceanic climate. Despite its northern location, the climate is mild compared to other locations at similar latitudes, mainly because of the influence of the Gulf Stream and also its westerly position on the Eurasian landmass. Owing to its northern latitude, daylight lasts 17 hours in midsummer, but only around seven hours in midwinter. According to data from 2002\u20132014 Falsterbo, to the south of the city, received an annual average of 1,895 hours of sunshine while Lund, to the north, received 1,803 hours. The sunshine data in the weather box is based on the data for Falsterbo.Summers are mild with average high temperatures of 20 to 23 \u00b0C (68 to 73 \u00b0F) and lows of around 11 to 13 \u00b0C (52 to 55 \u00b0F). Heat waves during the summer arise occasionally. Winters are fairly cold and windy, with temperatures steady between \u22123 to 4 \u00b0C (27 to 39 \u00b0F), but it rarely drops below \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F).\nRainfall is light to moderate throughout the year with 169 wet days. Snowfall occurs mainly in December through March, but snow covers do not remain for a long time, and some winters are virtually free of snow.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\u00d6resund Line trains cross the \u00d6resund Bridge every 20 minutes (hourly late night) connecting Malm\u00f6 to Copenhagen, and the Copenhagen Airport. The trip takes around 35\u201340 minutes. Additionally, some of the X 2000 and Intercity trains to Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Kalmar cross the bridge, stopping at Copenhagen Airport. In March 2005, excavation began on a new railway connection called the City Tunnel, which opened for traffic on 4 December 2010. The tunnel runs south from Malm\u00f6 Central Station through an underground station at the Triangeln railway station to Hylliev\u00e5ng (Hyllie Meadow). Then, the line comes to the surface to enter Hyllie Station, also created as part of the tunnel project. From Hyllie Station, the line connects to the existing \u00d6resund line in either direction, with the \u00d6resund Bridge lying due west.\nBesides the Copenhagen Airport, Malm\u00f6 has an airport of its own, Malm\u00f6 Airport, today chiefly used for domestic Swedish destinations, charter flights and low-cost carriers.\nThe motorway system has been incorporated with the \u00d6resund Bridge; the European route E20 goes over the bridge and then, together with the European route E6 follows the Swedish west coast from Malm\u00f6\u2013Helsingborg to Gothenburg. E6 goes further north along the west coast and through Norway to the Norwegian town Kirkenes at Barents Sea. The European route to J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping\u2013Stockholm (E4) starts at Helsingborg. Main roads in the directions of V\u00e4xj\u00f6\u2013Kalmar, Kristianstad\u2013Karlskrona, Ystad (E65), and Trelleborg start as freeways.\nMalm\u00f6 has 410 kilometres (250 mi) of bike paths; approximately 40% of all commuting is done by bicycle.\n\n\n=== Ports ===\nThe city has two industrial harbors; one is still in active use and is the largest Nordic port for car importation. It also has two marinas: the publicly owned Limhamn Marina (55\u00b035\u2032N 12\u00b055\u2032E) and the private Lagunen (55\u00b035\u2032N 12\u00b056\u2032E), both offering a limited number of guest docks.\nPublic transport consisted of a tram network from 1887 until 1973. Afterwards, it was replaced by a bus network.\n\n\n=== Malm\u00f6 S-Train ===\nA local train line with circular traffic at seven stations was opened in December 2018. The stations are Malm\u00f6 Central Station (underground platforms) \u2013 Triangeln station \u2013 Hyllie station \u2013 Malm\u00f6 South/Sv\u00e5gertorp \u2013 Persborg \u2013 Roseng\u00e5rd \u2013 \u00d6sterv\u00e4rn \u2013 Malm\u00f6 Central Station (main overground terminus). Some trains arrive from Kristianstad and finish with a lap around Malm\u00f6, whilst other trains at this circular line, never drive outside the city limits. There is at least a 30 minutes service between each departure, but far more between the Central Station and Hyllie. Extension plans of a minor network system exists.\n\n\n=== Proposed metro ===\nThe \u00d6resundsmetro is a proposed rapid transit network linking Malm\u00f6 with the existing Copenhagen Metro through a 22 km tunnel under the \u00d6resund.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nMalm\u00f6 Municipality is an administrative unit defined by geographical borders, consisting of the City of Malm\u00f6 and its immediate surroundings.\nMalm\u00f6 (Malm\u00f6 t\u00e4tort) consists of the urban part of the municipality together with the small town of Arl\u00f6v in the Burl\u00f6v Municipality. Both municipalities also include smaller urban areas and rural areas, such as the suburbs of Oxie and \u00c5karp. Malm\u00f6 t\u00e4tort is to be distinguished from Malm\u00f6 stad (the city of Malm\u00f6), which is a semi-official name of Malm\u00f6 Municipality.\nThe leaders in Malm\u00f6 created a commission for a socially sustainable Malm\u00f6 in November 2010. The commissions were tasked with providing evidence-based strategies for reducing health inequalities and improve living conditions for all citizens of Malm\u00f6, especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged and issued its final report in December 2013.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nMalm\u00f6 has a young population by Swedish standards, with almost half of the population under the age of 35 (48.2%).After 1971, Malm\u00f6 had 265,000 inhabitants, but the population then dropped to 229,000 by 1985. The total population of the urban area was 280,415 in December 2010. It then began to rise again, and had passed the previous record by the 1 January 2003 census, when it had 265,481 inhabitants. On 27 April 2011, the population of Malm\u00f6 reached the 300,000 mark. In 2017 the total population of the city was 316,588 inhabitants out of a municipal total of 338,230.In 2019, approximately 55.5% of the population of Malm\u00f6 municipality (190,849 residents) had at least one parent born abroad. The Middle East, Horn of Africa, former Yugoslavia and Denmark are the main sources of immigration. In addition, 14.8% (50 999 residents) of the population in 2019 were foreign nationals.Foreign-born population by country, 31 December 2018:\n\nGreater Malm\u00f6 is one of Sweden's three officially recognized metropolitan areas (storstadsomr\u00e5den) and since 2005 is defined as the municipality of Malm\u00f6 and 11 other municipalities in the southwestern corner of Scania. As of 2019, its population was recorded as 740,840. The region covers an area of 2,522 square kilometres (974 sq mi). The municipalities included, apart from Malm\u00f6, are Burl\u00f6v, Esl\u00f6v, H\u00f6\u00f6r, K\u00e4vlinge, Lomma, Lund, Skurup, Staffanstorp, Svedala, Trelleborg and Vellinge. Together with Lund, Malm\u00f6 is the region's economic and education hub.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Malm\u00f6 was traditionally based on shipbuilding (Kockums) and construction-related industries, such as concrete factories. The region's leading university, along with its associated hi-tech and pharmaceutical industries, is located in Lund about 16 kilometres (10 miles) to the north-east. As a result, Malm\u00f6 had a troubled economic situation following the mid-1970s. Between 1990\u20131995, 27,000 jobs were lost, and the budget deficit was more than one billion Swedish krona (SEK). In 1995, Malm\u00f6 had Sweden's highest unemployment rate.However, during the last two decades, there has been a revival. One contributing factor has been the economic integration with Denmark brought about by the \u00d6resund Bridge, which opened in July 2000. Also the university founded in 1998 and the effects of integration into the European Union have contributed. In 2017 the unemployment rate is still high but Malm\u00f6 has, in the last 20 years, had one of the strongest employment growth rates in Sweden. But a lot of those jobs are taken by workers outside the neighboring municipalities.As of 2016, the largest companies were:\nSkanska \u2013 heavy construction\nNobina \u2013 transport\nPostNord \u2013 postal services\nP\u00e5gen \u2013 bakery\nIKEA \u2013 furnitureAlmost 30 companies have moved their headquarters to Malm\u00f6 during the last seven years, generating around 2,300 jobs. Among them are IKEA who has most of its headquarter functions based in Malm\u00f6.The number of start-up companies is high in Malm\u00f6. Around 7 new companies are started every day in Malm\u00f6. In 2010, the renewal of the number of companies amounted to 13.9%, which exceeds both Stockholm and Gothenburg. Especially strong growth is in the gaming area with Massive entertainment and King being the flagship companies for the industry. Among the industries that continue to increase their share of companies in Malm\u00f6 are transport, financial and business services, entertainment, leisure and construction.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMalm\u00f6 has the country's ninth-largest school of higher education, Malm\u00f6 University, established in 1998. It has 1,600 employees and 24,000 students (2014).\nIn addition nearby Lund University (established in 1666) has some education located in Malm\u00f6:\n\nMalm\u00f6 Art Academy (Konsth\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nMalm\u00f6 Academy of Music (Musikh\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nMalm\u00f6 Theatre Academy (Teaterh\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nThe Faculty of Medicine, which is located in both Malm\u00f6 and Lund.The United Nations World Maritime University is also located in Malm\u00f6. The World Maritime University (WMU) operates under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized agency of the United Nations. WMU thus enjoys the status, privileges and immunities of a UN institution in Sweden.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Film and television ===\nA striking depiction of Malm\u00f6 (in the 1930s) was made by Bo Widerberg in his debut film Kvarteret Korpen (Raven's End) (1963), largely shot in the shabby Korpen working-class district in Malm\u00f6. With humour and tenderness, it depicts the tensions between classes and generations.  The movie was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1965. In 2017, the film Medan Vi Lever (While We Live) was awarded the prize for best film by an African living abroad at the Africa Movie Academy Awards. It was filmed in Malm\u00f6 and Gambia, and deals with identity, integration and everyday racism.The cities of Malm\u00f6 and Copenhagen are, with the \u00d6resund Bridge, the main locations in the television series The Bridge (Bron/Broen).\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\nIn 1944, Malm\u00f6 Stadsteater (Malm\u00f6 Municipal Theatre) was established with a repertoire comprising stage theatre, opera, musical, ballet, musical recitals and experimental theatre. In 1993 it was split into three units, Dramatiska Teater (Dramatical Theatre), Malm\u00f6 Musikteater (Music Theatre) and Sk\u00e5nes Dansteater (Scanian Dance Theatre) and the name was abandoned. The ownership of the last two were transferred to Region Sk\u00e5ne in 2006 Dramatiska Teatern regained its old name. In the 1950s Ingmar Bergman was the Director and Chief Stage Director of Malm\u00f6 Stadsteater and many of his actors, like Max von Sydow and Ingrid Thulin became known through his films. Later stage directors include Staffan Valdemar Holm and G\u00f6ran Stangertz. Malm\u00f6 Musikteater were renamed Malm\u00f6 Operan and plays operas and musicals, classics as newly composed, on one of Scandinavia's large opera scenes with 1,511 seats. Sk\u00e5nes dansteater is active and plays contemporary dance repertory and present works by Swedish and international choreographers in their house in Malm\u00f6 harbor.Since the 1970s the city has also been home to independent theatre groups and show/musical companies. It also hosts a rock/dance/dub culture; in the 1960s The Rolling Stones played the Klubb Bongo, and in recent years stars like Morrissey, Nick Cave, B.B. King and Pat Metheny have made repeated visits.\nThe Cardigans debuted in Malm\u00f6 and recorded their albums there. On 7 January 2009 CNN Travel broadcast a segment called \"MyCity_MyLife\" featuring Nina Persson taking the camera to some of the sites in Malm\u00f6 that she enjoys.\nThe Rooseum Center for Contemporary Art, founded in 1988 by the Swedish art collector and financier Fredrik Roos and housed in a former power station which had been built in 1900, was one of the foremost centers for contemporary art in Europe during the 1980s and 1990s. By 2006, most of the collection had been sold off and the museum was on a time-out; by 2010 Rooseum had been dismantled and a subsidiary of the National Museum of Modern Art inaugurated in its place.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nIn 1992 and in 2013 Malm\u00f6 was the host of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nModerna Museet Malm\u00f6 was opened in December 2009  in the old Rooseum building. It is a part of the Moderna Museet, with independent exhibitions of modern and contemporary art. The collection of Moderna Museet holds key pieces of, among others, Marcel Duchamp, Louise Bourgeois, Pablo Picasso, Niki de Saint Phalle, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Carolee Schneemann, Henri Matisse and Robert RauschenbergMalm\u00f6 Museum (Malm\u00f6 Museer) is a municipal and regional museum. The museum features exhibitions on technology, shipping, natural history and history. Malm\u00f6 Museum has an aquarium and an art museum. Malm\u00f6hus Castle is also operated as a part of the museum.\nExhibitions are primarily shown at Slottsholmen and at the Technology and Maritime Museum (Teknikens och sj\u00f6fartens hus).Malm\u00f6 Konsthall is one of the largest exhibition halls in Europe for contemporary art, opened in 1975.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMalm\u00f6's oldest building is St. Peter's Church (Swedish: Sankt Petri). It was built in the early 14th century in Baltic Brick Gothic probably after St Mary's Church in L\u00fcbeck. The church is built with a nave, two aisles, a transept and a tower. Its exterior is characterized above all by the flying buttresses spanning its airy arches over the aisles and ambulatory. The tower, which fell down twice during the 15th century, got its current look in 1890. Another major church of significance is the Church of Our Saviour, Malm\u00f6, which was founded in 1870.\nAnother old building is Tunneln, 300 metres (1,000 ft) to the west of Sankt Petri Church, which also dates back to around 1300.\nThe oldest parts of Malm\u00f6 were built between 1300\u20131600 during its first major period of expansion. The central city's layout, as well as some of its oldest buildings, are from this time. Many of the smaller buildings from this time are typical Scanian: two-story urban houses that show a strong Danish influence.Recession followed in the ensuing centuries. The next expansion period was in the mid 19th century and led to the modern stone and brick city. This expansion lasted into the 20th century and can be seen by a number of Art Nouveau buildings, among those in the Malm\u00f6 synagogue. Malm\u00f6 was relatively late to be influenced by modern ideas of functionalist tenement architecture in the 1930s.\nAround 1965, the government initiated the so-called Million Programme, intending to offer affordable apartments in the outskirts of major Swedish cities. But this period also saw the reconstruction (and razing) of much of the historical city center.Since the late 1990s, Malm\u00f6 has seen a more cosmopolitan architecture. V\u00e4stra Hamnen (The Western Harbor), like most of the harbor to the north of the city center, was industrial. In 2001 its reconstruction began as an urban residential neighbourhood, with 500 residential units, most were part of the exhibition Bo01. The exhibition had two main objectives: develop self-sufficient housing units in terms of energy and greatly diminish phosphorus emissions. Among the new building's towers were the Turning Torso, a skyscraper with a twisting design, 190 metres (620 ft) tall, the majority of which is residential. It became Malm\u00f6's new landmark. The most recent addition (2015) is the new development of Malm\u00f6 Live. This new building features a hotel, a concert hall, congress hall and a sky bar in the center of Malm\u00f6. Point Hyllie is a new 110 m commercial tower that is under construction as of 2018.\n\n\n=== Other sights ===\n\nThe beach Ribersborg, by locals usually called Ribban, south-west of the harbor area, is a man-made shallow beach, stretching along Malm\u00f6's coastline. Despite Malm\u00f6's chilly climate, it is sometimes referred to as the \"Copacabana of Malm\u00f6\". It is the site of Ribersborgs open-air bath, opened in the 1890s.\nThe long boardwalk at The Western Harbor, Scaniaparken and Daniaparken, has become a favorite summer hang-out for the people of Malm\u00f6 and is a popular place for bathing. The harbor is particularly popular with Malm\u00f6's vibrant student community and has been the scene of several impromptu outdoor parties and gatherings.\n\n\n=== Annual events ===\n\nIn the third week of August each year a festival, Malm\u00f6festivalen, fills the streets of Malm\u00f6 with different kinds of cuisines and events.\nBUFF International Film Festival, an international children and young people's film festival, is held in Malm\u00f6 every year in March.\nNordisk Panorama \u2013 Nordic Short & Doc Film Festival, a film festival for short and documentary films by filmmakers from the Nordic countries, is held every year in September.\nMalm\u00f6 Arab Film Festival (MAFF), the largest Arabic film festival in Europe, is held in Malm\u00f6.\nThe Nordic Game conference takes place in Malm\u00f6 every April/May. The event consists of conference itself, recruitment expo and game expo and attracts hundreds of gamedev professionals every year.\nMalm\u00f6 also hosts other 3rd party events that cater to all communities that reside in Malm\u00f6, including religious and political celebrations.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nSydsvenskan, founded in 1870, is Malm\u00f6's largest daily newspaper. It has an average circulation of 130,000. Its main competitor is the regional daily Sk\u00e5nska Dagbladet, which has a circulation of 34,000. The tabloid Kv\u00e4llsposten still has a minimal editorial staff but is today just a version of a Stockholm tabloid. The Social Democratic Arbetet was edited and printed at Malm\u00f6 between 1887 and 2000.In addition to these, a number of free-of-charge papers, generally dealing with entertainment, music and fashion have local editions (for instance City, Rodeo, Metro and N\u00f6jesguiden). Malm\u00f6 is also home to the Egmont Group's Swedish magazine operations. A number of local and regional radio and TV broadcasters are based in the Greater Malm\u00f6 area.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\n\n==== Football ====\n\nSports in southern Sweden are dominated by football. Over the years the city's best football teams have been Malm\u00f6 FF who play in the top-level Allsvenskan Malm\u00f6 FF had their most successful periods in the 1970s and 1980s when they won the league several times. In 1979, they advanced to the final of the European Cup defeating AS Monaco, Dynamo Kiew, Wisla Krakow and Austria Wien (Vienna) but lost in the final at the Munich Olympic Stadium against Nottingham Forest by a single goal just before half time scored by Trevor Francis. To date, they are the only Swedish football club to have reached the final of the competition. Malm\u00f6 FF is the club where for instance, Bosse Larsson and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 began their football careers.  A second football team, IFK Malm\u00f6 played in Sweden's top flight for about 20 years and the club's quarterfinal in the European Cup is the club's greatest achievement in its history. Today, the club resides in the sixth tier of the Swedish league system.\nFC Roseng\u00e5rd (former LdB Malm\u00f6) are playing in the top level in Damallsvenskan, women's football league. FC Roseng\u00e5rd girls have won the league 10 times and the national cup title 5 times. In 2014, they reached the semi-final in Champions League, which they ultimately went on to lose to the German side 1. FFC Frankfurt. Brazilian football player Marta, widely regarded the best female football player of all time, played in FC Roseng\u00e5rd between 2014 and 2017.\nAt the 1958 FIFA World Cup Malm\u00f6 Stadion was inaugurated in combination with the opening match of the cup, as World Champions West Germany defeated Argentina 3\u20131, in front of 31,156, a record attendance for Malm\u00f6 in general. Another two games were decided at the stadium.\n\n\n==== Other sports ====\nMalm\u00f6 has athletes competing in a variety of sport.\n\n\n===== Ice hockey =====\nThe most notable other sports team is the ice hockey team Malm\u00f6 Redhawks. They were the creation of millionaire Percy Nilsson and quickly rose to the highest rank in the early to mid-1990s and won two Swedish championships, but for a number of years have found themselves residing outside of the top flight. \n\n\n===== Handball =====\nA first division handball team, HK Malm\u00f6, attracts a fair amount of attendance. \n\n\n===== Rugby =====\nRugby union team, Malm\u00f6 RC, founded in 1954, have won 6 national championships. The club has teams for men, women and juniors.\n\n\n===== Gaelic football =====\nGaelic football has also been introduced to Malm\u00f6. The men of Malm\u00f6 G.A.A. have won the Scandinavian Championships twice and the women once.\n\n\n===== Additional Team and Individual Sport =====\nOther notable team a sports are baseball, American football and Australian football.\nAmong non-team sports, badminton and athletics are the most popular, together with east Asian martial arts and boxing. Basketball is also fairly a big sport in the city, including the clubs Malbas and SF Srbija among others.\nWomen are permitted by the city council to swim topless in public swimming pools. Everyone must wear bathing attire, but covering of the breasts is not mandatory.\n\n\n== Notable events ==\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nScania\nMalm\u00f6 Bulltofta Airport\nChapter 4 Concerning the Friary in Malm\u00f8 in Chronicle of the Expulsion of the Greyfriars\nList of governors of Malm\u00f6hus County\nPorts of the Baltic Sea\n\n\n== References ==\nFacts & Figures about Malm\u00f6, 2005 at the Wayback Machine (archived 7 October 2006) \u2013 in English.

          "My first impression of Malmo was made up of its warm, beautiful coffee shops that were straight out of a designer decor magazine. On a cold, windy day in November, you can imagine how lovely it is to see the bright halogen lighting exuding out of coffee shops where people are",
          "The west side of the square is arguably the most picturesque and gives a good idea of what the square looked like during the heyday of imperial Sweden in the seventeenth century! Some lovely architecure involved! '10",
          "I find it a bit odd writing a review of a town square, but I have done because of the architecture. I like the architecture in old Malmo and there are quite a few nice interesting buildings here. Don't expect anything too exciting though. It is worth mentioning Spegeln though,",
          "Its big and that's about it. There's a big carpark in the middle and the square is surrounded mostly by hotels and a cinema. Its nothing special although it did look pretty with all the Christmas lights on the trees. Lillatorg, a small cobbled square nearby, is much prettier and",
          "Just lovely and staff the best, really is located on a 1o. World country as Sweden. Just lovely. New, toilet new, confortable beds, just need to change the bateries of the remote controls.",
          "Already Xmas for them and the square has it's Xmas tree right in the middle, near the statue of King Gustav, facing the Town hall. On the left, looking at the City hall, you can walk to St Peter's church and on the right you will walk towards the shopping street and the Little",
          "Few minuts walk away from the Centralstation you will find the Stora Torget. Many large old buildings, among them the old Townhall and rigth in the midle a large statue of the swedish king Carl Gustav riding on a horse . Arround the square you find some good hotels as well as",
          "Being about two minutes walk from the train station it is usual with people arrived by train will go through Stortorget as it is connecting the walking Street through Malm\u00f6",
          "I cycled around this square. Next to Lilla Torg. In this large square you will see the Malmo City Hall, a statue of King Karl Gustav, the Kebab stall..! and many other beautiful buildings. Malmo is very clean but what shocks you is the amount of cigarette butts in the cobbled",
          "No destination in itself but if you are in town you will naturally pass across the square.Certainly one could think a little more seating, farmers' markets and some cafes to get a little more alive",
          "In the summer there were lot of flowers! Looked great! The weather was beautiful. Very stylish square.",
          "Here you will find beautiful old buildings. This is also a shopping district. Try the shawarma roll at Shawarma King (located in the middle of the square). Delicious beef strips and fresh vegetables served with garlic and spicy sauce, wrapped in a thin flat bread.",
          "There are some good restaurants located here and beautiful buildings as well, but it's a shame to have the parking place on the square.",
          "Stortorget is an old and elegant square in Malmo, harboring the city hall and the statue of Karl X Gustav. Like any old European square it is loaded with old artistic buildings.",
          "Lovely Scandinavian Square which contains the City Hall, Fountain and the statue of Karl X Gustav. It's very scenic, great photo opportunities for tourists and didn't appear overly busy.",
          "Except to view the huge statue of King Karl X Gustav who liberated Malmo from Denmark, or to take a photo of the Dutch Renaissance-style city hall, there is not much to do here during the summer. It's also undergoing reconstruction so areas are fenced off. The little Shawarma",
          "It was a lovely day, sun shining. Walked around the square. Unfortunately there seems to be a lot of litter, especially cigarette butts jammed in cobbled areas. Disgusting!!",
          "This place seemed pretty dull compared to the Little square nearby. There wasn't a whole lot going on in the square itself, but some of the more populated shopping streets projected from this point.",
          "The Town Hall building is beautiful and the square it sits in is nice to walk around. We came to Malmo for the day and came by here. There are fountains and statues and it's very pleasant.",
          "This is not the most attractive square in Malmo.However, it is worth passing through to visit the well-known old pharmacy, which is still in use. Also, nearby is the more atmospheric \"Little Square\"",
          "This is the main square of Malm\u00f6. City hall, fountains and statues around, and of course caf\u00e9s as well. Apoteket Lejonet - Lion Pharmacy is one of the attraction, beeing the oldest in the town.",

          "We visited Malmo on a very cold and windy day; if it were nicer, we might have spent more time exploring the square. Surrounded by large old-looking buildings, you could almost imagine how it might have looked hundreds of years ago. This would be a great place to visit (and",
          "I was very impressed with the main square. Spend some time sitting under the statue of Karl X Gustav and make sure you take a picture and enjoy the architecture of city hall. There are restaurants in the area as well, we enjoyed Mello Yello which is more on Lila Torg but also",
          "Some squares offers exciting environments, beautiful sceneries or interesting build commitment - some squares you pass just on the way to some place else. This square is definitely a square, you do not stay on for very long, but seasonally so created quite a lot of events here",
          "Great for seeing the Town Hall and for the cafes and shops and with the shopping streets right off the square",
          "My favorite coffee shop in Malmo. Cheese cake is delicious. I have visited this shop with different people and everyone has liked it. It is full of people always.",
          "Malmo's most popular attraction they say. We came here on Wednesday's afternoon, expecting it to be crowded, but it was absolutely empty. Better for us, because this way we could enjoy looking at the buildings surrounding the square! Couple of shops and restaurants are located",
          "If you're going through the square, don't miss the magnificent, gigantic, be-hatted bronze statue of Karl X Gustav sitting on a horse.",
          "Here you have all kinds of shops. What do you need? You are in the middle of town and you can buy anything you need. The distance you have to big shopping center or to small shops are near you. The possibility for food or coffee is also available in one of the many corners",
          "Walked around there and had dinner 2 nights in the area. Really busy place and lots of tourists and locals. Our hotel was a bit away, so we were not worried about the noise, but woudld not want to be staying on that square, I think..",
          "..and every square meter full of history - take a look also at the restored 400-year-old fountain. It's just a place you've must been when you're in Malm\u00f6 learning a bit more of the spirit of this town.",
          "Stortorget Square is the largest square on Old Town and is very historic. A public fountain dating back over 400 years has been restored. Colorfully painted storefronts are the signature of this part of Stockholm. A 'must see' part of your walking tour of Old Town.",
          "This is old town square with lots of old heritage buildling arround it. Worth a walk through this area which you are bound to pass while visiting other places of interest in town.",
          "Starting point to explore Malmo. Big square. Old building arround, shops, and street attraction. Easily reached from the station. Walking distance to the museum and Malmo park.",
          "Huge square that's great to sit and take in the architecture of the old buildings surrounding it. City Hall is pretty spectacular but not much more than a square you pass through to get to Lilla Torg or Central Station.",
          "Nothing exciting about this square. Big open space and the city hall is there. Just proceed to little plaza 5m further down with cafes and restaurants",
          "I really liked it. I liked the feel of it, the low-key historic style combined with competing Kings (Burger and Shawarma), delicious fast-food (Max's), convenient pharmacy (apototek) and tourist shop. The marching band installation was a huge hit with my toddler. He wanted to",
          "Nothing much to comment on. A large open square. We expected some sort of street market like the easter market in Prague but it was just given over to car parking. Some nice architecture around the square and a few restaurants.",
          "This is the first place you'll reach when heading into town from the station and it makes for a nice arrival. There are some very interesting buildings including the lovely city hall.",
          "If in Malm\u00f6 this is a great place to start your visit. Stroll around the square and when you are done take a walk to Lilla Torg (the small square) just next to it. Here you will find plenty of restaurants, bars and cafees. A variety of food to choose from. When done here keep",
          "Its a large square dominated by City Hall a large and imposing building. The large chemist is worth a look as it retains the old dispensing bottles and although modern and fully functioning they have retained the history of the place and don't mind you coming in to have a look",
          "When visiting Malm\u00f6 centre many miss a quick visit to the Farmacy - Apoteket Lejonet - if you don't have a headache, that is! The entire 100 year old interior is still in place - carved wood all over...",
          "The square is very big and have some nice old buildings. If you want to try the north swedish mcdonald they have a max burger resturant there. Picolo mondo the italian restaurant serves very nice italian food in an old restaurant. It is very close to the trainstation.",

          "This is where you find some great restaurants, nightclub Etage, Burger King and a few shops, as well as city hall, which has an excellent restaurant in the basement (Radhuskallaren)",
          "The Stortorget resembles many other squares in other Swedish cities and has not that special atmosphere as the near-by little square.",
          "Large market place in malm\u00f6, Beutifuly laid out space occupied by cheap retail marketers and shops as well. Extremely beautiful place for shopping and leisure as well.",
          "Nice surroundings but not much to do other than shopping - feels a bit quiet and desolate, particularly when the wind is blowing outside of summer months",
          "I live in malmo and this is a must see for all visitors. The cityhall is one of Malmos most beautiful buildings. The biograf spegeln is a good place to see independent movies.",
          "Nice large square surrounded with some wonderful buildings. It is really enjoyable on a summer day. There is also and nice fountain. There is not much activity going on but that you will find on the neighboring Lilla Torget",
          "Right next to Llilla Torg, this big square has a small car park where we parked easily on a Sunday morning in April. The City hall dominates the square and also of interest are Kockska house , Hotel Kramer and Pharmacy Leo. Apparently the square is used for big events"

          "This was a great way to see a lot in a short time - 50 minutes because unlike bus tour you don't get caught in traffic! Easy to find, just across from the Central Station.",
          "The tour was good. You saw most of Malmo on the tour, which was nice for a first-time visitor. There's a lot of history to see, but I felt our tour guide did not go into detail like other boat tours I have been on. She wasn't the friendliest, and rushed through her descriptions.",
          "Had 2 extra days in Copenhagen due to a pilots strike and decided to take the train over to Malmo, Sweden. The canal tour takes you on a 50 minute tour around the city. It gives you an opportunity to see lots of the city sights without having to walk it. My friend and I",
          "The boat tour lasts 50 minutes or so, the start\\end point is right next to the central station, which is very convenient. The guide was fine, she explained everything in both Swedish and English. However, the scenery was underwhelming. Most of the tour is in industrial areas,",
          "The boats are not huge and the trip feels personal. The route gives you a good grasp of the city and helps you understand the history and defences a little more. Duck low for the bridges! A boat trip is a bit if a busman's holiday for me, I'm a boat skipper back home, but I",

          "I had just come to Malmo for the day from Copenhagen (mainly to cross over the Oresund Bridge) and knew nothing about Malmo. I didn't want to stray far from the train station, so was delighted to see these boat tours leaving from the canal directly opposite the station. There",
          "A very pleasant hour spent on the canals of central Malmo. Good and entertaining commentary from our friendly guide. Plenty of photo opportunities along the route. You can even take a picnic basket from the cafe with you. One word of warning..... you pass under 22 bridges, and",
          "I have been living in Malm\u00f6 for over four years now, and have seen the Rundan boat go past my apartment countless times, and have always been meaning to give it a try. This weekend I had a friend visiting so finally got round to doing it .. I wasn't expecting much, but was",
          "My husband and I are staying in Copenhagen but we caught the train to Malmo, Sweden, for the day. The boat tour is conveniently located opposite the train station. As cities go, there isn't a massive amount to see in Malmo but I thought the boat tour was a great way to find out",
          "We went to Malmo for a day from Copenhagen and chose to see Malmo by doing a bike tour as well as a canal tour. The tour was excellent and captain and the tour guide Maya were excellent indeed. Highly recommended way to take in the beauty of the city.",
          "Would recommend this boat ride around the city of Malmo. Commentary was very good and very way to see the sights.",

          "I was actually on my way to Copenhagen when I got a cheap flight ticket to Malmo. Since I had 3 hours to kill I decided to try out the Boat tour at Malmo. I wasnt left disappointed. The Boat Tour was awesome. It took us under various bridges, the scenery was awesome. The only",
          "Despite a cold, wet and windy afternoon in Malm\u00f6, this was an enjoyable and informative way to see Sweden's third-largest city. The tour guide catered to his audience in both Swedish and English, even though he had only three passengers due to the inclement weather. Undoubtedly",
          "Apart from walking, it might even be the only way, since there are no open-top buses in Malm\u00f6. I had a good time on the boat, thanks to the girl who told great stories about all the sights, and some funny jokes as well.",
          "We came across this quite by accident on an impromptu trip from Copenhagen to Malm\u00f6, an easy drive over the Bridge. The Tourist Centre recommended a Canal Tour by boat. They leave opposite the main Central Railway Station. It was a Public Holiday but the boats seemed to be",
          "Not the best thing to do in early May... Too cold ...walking along canal could be better to see the interesting architecture and the beautiful buildings.",
          "Hello all, if you ever get the chance to take one of the Friday evening cruises with bringing your own food and drinks DO IT. We arived around 7 pm and took of little later when all had arrived. Everybody were bringing food drinks and great spririts and the tour guide was",
          "Decided to take a trip to Malmo during a stay in Copenhagen. The station is faced by a canal and over the other side was the mooring point for the boat trip. The tour costs 130 Swedish Kronor with coffee and cake for an extra 40. The guide brought on picnic baskets with Coffee",
          "Even though I live near Malm\u00f6, it is always fun to play tourist in your own backyard. My husband and I took advantage of a sunny, late summer day and too the canal trip on Rundan. We bought ice cream at the little snack bar before we boarded the boat. The snacks are well",
          "For under US$20 we had an excellent open-air boat ride around Malmo. Our time was short in this incredible city so we thought this might be the best way to see and learn about the place. We were right. Our tour guide and driver were both friendly, helpful and full of",
          "We very much enjoyed our 50 minute cruise through Malm\u00f6's canals. The open-top boat experiences the full effect of the sun, so be prepared. Our very lovely guide delivered her commentary in Swedish and perfect English, with much humour and all the while, with a small dog on her",
          "We recently spent a long weekend in the lovely city of Malmo, Sweden. Given the mix of both modern and centuries old architecture and the location of Malmo on the water, my 5 year old son and I decided to take a boat tour with Rundan Sightseeing. The trip lasts approximately 50",
          "Malmo does not have a HOHO bus but they have a very nice sightseeing boat tour of the city through the canals and up through part of the docks. A very nice way to get the flavor of Malmo. The boat excursion takes place on a low slung riverboat that is barely short enough to",
          "This boat trip gives you the overall view of Malmo, runs every hour from 11:30 to 15:30 at this time of year, more often in summer. The cost is 130SEK each, enjoyed the commentary which was in English and Swedish. This trip lasts 50 minutes and takes you round the canel under",
          "I had a very short stay in Malmo on my way from Halmstad to Copenhagen, however this tour was great & I enjoyed it, it gave me an overall view of the city, and also its very close to the central station to get the train to other cities.",
          "To begin with the price is a bit steep, at least compared to the similar tours in Copenhagen. If you visit both Copenhagen and Malm\u00f6, save this experience for Copenhagen. It\u2019s cheaper and Copenhagen has more to offer for an experience of this type. Even if there is only so much",
          "I would definitely recommend doing this as soon as you get to Malmo. It gives you an idea of where everything is and you get pictures and views of things you couldnt get from anywhere else without walking for hours, Probably the best thing to do in Malmo.",
          "I went to Malm\u00f6 for a cuple of hours when being on a weekend trip in Copenhagen. The canal tour in Malm\u00f6 was funny, mainly because of the Eurovision music they played in anticipation of the upcoming music event. Malm\u00f6 itself is a pretty nice town, which you see best from the",
          "We did this boat tour because we needed to wait to check into our hotel. We were so pleased with this tour because it gave us the highlights of Malm\u00f6 from the water and helped us decide what we were going to do the rest of our visit. It covers all of the highlights and really",
          "This circular tour of Malm\u00f6 takes about 50 minutes and explores the canals and gives you a view of Malm\u00f6 you don't get from the streets. Our tour was in English, but I think German tours were also available. The commentary was good and explained both the historic and more modern"

        "wiki": "Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 (Swedish pronunciation: [\u02c8sl\u01ce\u02d0tan \u026abra\u02c8h\u01d0\u02d0m\u028av\u026at\u0255]; Bosnian pronunciation: [zl\u01cetan ibrax\u01d0\u02d0mo\u028bit\u0255]; born 3 October 1981) is a Swedish professional footballer who plays as a striker for Serie A club Milan. Ibrahimovi\u0107 is widely regarded as one of the best strikers of his generation. He is one of the most decorated active footballers in the world, having won 31 trophies in his career. He has scored over 540 career goals, and has scored in each of the last four decades.Ibrahimovi\u0107 began his career at Malm\u00f6 FF in 1999, and signed for Ajax two years later. At Ajax, Ibrahimovi\u0107 gained a reputation as one of the most promising forwards in Europe, and departed two years later to sign for Juventus. He excelled in Serie A in a strike partnership with David Trezeguet, before joining domestic rivals Internazionale in 2006, where he won the Capocannoniere (Serie A top scorer) in 2008\u201309 and won three consecutive Serie A titles. In the summer of 2009, he moved to Barcelona in one of the world's most expensive transfers, before returning to Italy the following season, joining Milan. With them, he won another Serie A title in the 2010\u201311 season, before joining Paris Saint-Germain in July 2012. During his four-season stay in with them, Ibrahimovi\u0107 won a number of trophies including four consecutive Ligue 1 titles, and was the top scorer in Ligue 1 for three seasons. In October 2015, he became PSG's all time leading goalscorer at the time. In 2016, he joined Manchester United on a free transfer and won the FA Community Shield, Football League Cup and UEFA Europa League in his first season. Ibrahimovi\u0107 joined American club LA Galaxy in 2018. Two years later, he rejoined Milan.\nIbrahimovi\u0107 is one of ten players to have made 100 or more appearances for the Swedish national team, over a 15-year international career. He is the country's all-time leading goalscorer with 62 goals. He represented Sweden at the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups, as well as the 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 UEFA European Championships. He has been awarded Guldbollen (the Golden Ball), given to the Swedish player of the year, a record 11 times, including 10 consecutive times from 2007 to 2016. Ibrahimovi\u0107's bicycle kick goal for Sweden against England won the 2013 FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award.Ibrahimovi\u0107 was named in the FIFA FIFPro World XI in 2013 and the UEFA Team of the Year in 2007, 2009, 2013 and 2014. He finished at a peak of fourth for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2013. In 2019, FourFourTwo magazine named him the third-greatest player never to win the UEFA Champions League. In December 2014, Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter ranked him the second-greatest Swedish sportsperson ever, after tennis player Bj\u00f6rn Borg. Off the field, Ibrahimovi\u0107 is known for his brash persona and outspoken comments, in addition to referring to himself in the third person.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 was born in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, on 3 October 1981. He was born to a Muslim Bosniak father, \u0160efik Ibrahimovi\u0107, who emigrated to Sweden in 1977, and a Catholic Croat mother, Jurka Gravi\u0107, who also emigrated to Sweden where the couple first met. His father was born in Bijeljina (in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina), and his mother in the village of Prkos in \u0160kabrnja, in the SFR Yugoslavia (modern-day Croatia). He had a Catholic Christian upbringing.Ibrahimovi\u0107 began playing football at the age of six, after receiving a pair of football boots. He alternated between FBK Balkan, a Malm\u00f6 club founded by Yugoslav immigrants, Malm\u00f6 BI and briefly BK Flagg football clubs. While in his early teens, he was a regular for his hometown club Malm\u00f6 FF. At the age of 15, Ibrahimovi\u0107 was close to quitting his football career, in favour of working at the docks in Malm\u00f6, but his manager convinced him to continue playing. As a kid growing up, his hero was Brazilian forward Ronaldo. An avid viewer of Italian football, prolific striker Gabriel Batistuta \u2013 a player with similar characteristics to himself \u2013 was another player he admired.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Malm\u00f6 FF ===\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 signed his first contract with Malm\u00f6 in 1996, and moved up to the senior side for the 1999 season of Allsvenskan, Sweden's top-flight league. That season, Malm\u00f6 finished 13th in the league and were relegated to the second division, but returned to the top flight the next season. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger unsuccessfully tried to persuade Ibrahimovi\u0107 to join Arsenal, while Leo Beenhakker (the technical director of Ajax) also expressed interest in the player after watching him in a friendly against Norwegian side Moss FK. On 22 March 2001, a deal between Ajax and Malm\u00f6 regarding Ibrahimovi\u0107's transfer to Amsterdam was announced, and in July, Ibrahimovi\u0107 officially joined Ajax for 80 million Swedish kronor (\u20ac8.7 million).\n\n\n=== Ajax ===\nIbrahimovi\u0107 received little playing time under manager Co Adriaanse, but when Adriaanse was sacked on 29 November 2001, new coach Ronald Koeman inserted Ibrahimovi\u0107 into the starting lineup as Ajax won the 2001\u201302 Eredivisie title. The next season, Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored twice in a 2\u20131 victory over French champions Lyon in his Champions League debut on 17 September 2002. He scored five Champions League goals overall as Ajax fell to Milan in the quarter-finals.Ibrahimovi\u0107's profile rose when he scored an individual goal against NAC Breda on 22 August 2004 \u2013 a slaloming run past five opposition players which the commentator compared with Diego Maradona and Zinedine Zidane \u2013 that was eventually voted the Goal of the Year by Eurosport viewers. On 18 August 2004, during an international match against the Netherlands, Ibrahimovi\u0107 injured Ajax teammate Rafael van der Vaart, who later accused Ibrahimovi\u0107 of hurting him intentionally.\n\n\n=== Juventus ===\nIbrahimovi\u0107 moved from Ajax to Juventus for \u20ac16 million. He was promptly inserted into the starting eleven due in part to top scorer David Trezeguet's injury problems, and scored 16 goals. The club finished top of Serie A, and in the Champions League they reached the quarter-finals before being knocked out by eventual champions Liverpool. Near the end of the season, Juventus reportedly rejected a \u20ac70 million bid for him from Real Madrid, which was later revealed to be a publicity stunt initiated by Ibrahimovi\u0107's agent, Mino Raiola, in order to increase his market value. At the end of his first season in Italy Ibrahimovi\u0107 was named Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year, and in November 2005, he was awarded the Guldbollen, a prize awarded to the best Swedish footballer of the year.The following season was poor compared to his first season; his role in Juventus' attack changed, as he became less of a goalscorer and moved more to the sidelines, taking much part in the build-up play, especially as a target player, and his assist numbers increased. In the 2005\u201306 season, Juventus fans often got frustrated with him due to his anonymous presence in certain important games such as the Champions League defeat to Arsenal. Juventus were stripped of their last two Scudetti as part of the verdict from the Calciopoli scandal, and were relegated to Serie B. The new staff tried to persuade Ibrahimovi\u0107 and other top players to stay with Juventus, but the player and his agent were adamant to move on, with Raiola threatening legal action in order to extricate Ibrahimovi\u0107 from his contract.\n\n\n=== Inter Milan ===\n\nOn 10 August 2006, Ibrahimovi\u0107 completed a \u20ac24.8 million move to Inter Milan, signing a four-year-deal. Ibrahimovi\u0107 said that he had supported Inter when he was young.Ibrahimovi\u0107 made his debut for Inter on 26 August 2006 against Roma in the 2006 Supercoppa Italiana, playing the full 90 minutes as Inter won after extra time. He scored in his Serie A debut against Fiorentina on 9 September as Inter commenced the league with a 3\u20132 win at Stadio Artemio Franchi. Three days later, in his first Champions League appearance for Inter, Ibrahimovi\u0107 was not able to avoid the 1\u20130 away defeat to Sporting CP as Inter began their European campaign in the wrong way. Later, on 28 October, in his first \"Derby della Madonnina\" match against cross-town rivals Milan, Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored the third Inter goal of the match and also his third league goal of the season in a 4\u20133 thriller win. In his first season at the club, Ibrahimovi\u0107 top scored for Inter in Serie A with 15 goals, as the team won the Scudetto with a record 97 points.Ibrahimovi\u0107 played his 100th Serie A match on 16 September 2007 at the San Siro against Catania, where he appeared as a second-half substitute for Hern\u00e1n Crespo in an eventual 2\u20130 win. In 2007, he signed a new contract until June 2013; it was reported that this contract had made him the world's highest paid footballer. On 18 May 2008, Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored both goals in a 2\u20130 defeat of Parma on the final day of the 2007\u201308 Serie A season to give Inter a second consecutive Scudetto. Overall, he scored 17 goals in 26 league matches, and was named both Serie A Footballer of the Year and Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year.\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 started his third Inter season by winning the Supercoppa Italiana against Roma. After the regular and extra time had finished in a draw, the match went to a penalty shootout where he successfully converted his penalty attempt. He scored his team's only goal in the 2008\u201309 Serie A opening match against Sampdoria, which finished in a 1\u20131 draw. On 4 October, during the match against Bologna at home which Inter won 2\u20131, Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored a sensational goal, stunning Francesco Antonioli with an irresistible backheeled shot from Adriano's left-wing cross. The goal was later voted Goal of the Year in Serie A. On 19 October 2008, Ibrahimovi\u0107 continued with his solid performances by scoring twice in an impressive 4\u20130 win at Roma, taking his tally up to five league goals. He then scored another double in the Matchday 12 win against Palermo to help Inter take the lead in the Serie A table by one point. In the next fixture, Ibrahimovi\u0107 provided the assist on the only goal in the Derby d'Italia match against Juventus at home, helping Inter to extend their league lead.Ibrahimovi\u0107 ended the 2008\u201309 Serie A season as the league's top goalscorer with 25 goals, helping Inter to another league title. He was also named both Footballer of the Year and Foreign Footballer of the Year for the second consecutive season.\n\n\n=== Barcelona ===\n\n\n==== 2009\u201310 season ====\n\nAfter Inter teammate Maxwell completed his transfer to Barcelona, Bar\u00e7a president Joan Laporta confirmed that there was an agreement in principle between Barcelona and Inter for Ibrahimovi\u0107 to join the club in exchange for striker Samuel Eto'o, plus a reported fee of \u00a359 million. Ibrahimovi\u0107 left Inter during their United States summer tour in the World Football Challenge on 23 July 2009 for negotiations with Barcelona, with his last match for Inter being against Chelsea. After Inter agreed terms with Eto'o and Barcelona with Ibrahimovi\u0107, Barcelona announced Ibrahimovi\u0107 would arrive on 26 July 2009 and undergo a medical test on 27 July 2009.\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 passed his medical and was presented to a crowd of over 60,000 at Camp Nou. He signed a five-year contract, for \u20ac46 million and the exchange of Eto'o (valued at \u20ac20 million) and loan of Alexander Hleb (with an option to purchase for a \u20ac10 million fee), with a \u20ac250 million release clause, making Ibrahimovi\u0107 worth \u20ac66 million. The Hleb deal, however, collapsed. Eventually, Ibrahimovi\u0107 cost Barcelona \u20ac69.884 million, which included other fees. As per the Inter book, the fee was \u20ac69.5 million, but part of the Inter fee (max 5% according to FIFA regulation) were deducted and distributed by Barcelona to youth and young professional clubs of Ibrahimovi\u0107: Malm\u00f6 FF and AFC Ajax as solidarity contribution.\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 started the 2009\u201310 season with his competitive debut for Barcelona on 23 August 2009 by assisting a Lionel Messi goal, leading them to the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, beating Athletic Bilbao 5\u20131 on aggregate. In his next competitive match, Barcelona won the 2009 UEFA Super Cup with a 1\u20130 win over Shakhtar Donetsk. In his third appearance, he scored his first goal in Barcelona's La Liga season opener against Sporting Gij\u00f3n in a 3\u20130 win. Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored in his next four games, thus setting a team record as the only player ever to score in his first five league matches.On 20 October, he scored his first Champions League goal for Barcelona in a group stage match against Rubin Kazan. Five days later, he scored twice in a 6\u20131 thrashing of Real Zaragoza, giving him a league-leading seven goals in seven league matches while sending Barcelona to the top of the table. On 7 November, however, he suffered a thigh injury that kept him out for three weeks. He returned to action in week 12 of the season against Real Madrid as a second-half substitute for Thierry Henry, and scored his eighth goal of the campaign. He finished with 11 goals and 4 assists in Barcelona's first 15 league matches. Barcelona capped off 2009 by winning the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup against Estudiantes on 19 December 2009.\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 scored Barcelona's only goal in the 2009\u201310 Copa del Rey first leg match of the round of 16 in a 2\u20131 loss to Sevilla on 5 January 2010. On 20 January, he was selected in the 2009 UEFA Team of the Year. His first goal of 2010 came on 14 February against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. In his next appearance, Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored against Stuttgart in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League knockout stage fixture. He was sent off on 6 March in a league match against Almer\u00eda, which Barcelona appealed to no avail, and he was suspended for one game.

I completely lost it, and you might have expected Guardiola to say a few words in response, but he's a spineless coward. He just [...] left, never to mention it again, not a word.\" He scored his final goal for Barcelona in the 2010 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a on 14 August in a 3\u20131 defeat against Sevilla, and on 25 August, he played his last match for the club against Milan for the Joan Gamper Trophy, after which he claimed to the media that his relationship with Guardiola had started deteriorating and that Guardiola had not spoken to him since February. In his autobiography I Am Zlatan, he states, \"'It started well but then Messi started to talk. He wanted to play in the middle, not on the wing, so the system changed from 4\u20133\u20133 to 4\u20135\u20131. I was sacrificed and no longer had the freedom on the pitch I need to succeed.\"\n\n\n==== 2010\u201311 season: Loan to Milan ====\nOn 28 August 2010, A.C. Milan announced via their official website that they had signed Ibrahimovi\u0107 for the 2010\u201311 season.

Though none of the players consumed any alcohol, they were nonetheless all sent home by manager Lars Lagerb\u00e4ck as punishment and did not take part in the match. Mellberg and Wilhelmsson did not appeal the coach's decision, but Ibrahimovi\u0107 felt that it was unjust and therefore refused to take part in Sweden's next qualifiers against Iceland and Spain. He also refused to partake in a friendly against Egypt on 7 February 2007, but ended his self-imposed boycott a month later, and returned for Sweden's loss to Northern Ireland on 28 March.

Ibrahimovi\u0107 summarised the defeat by saying: \"One thing is for sure, a World Cup without me is nothing to watch.\"\n\n\n=== Sweden's top scorer, Euro 2016 and retirement ===\n\nOn 4 September 2014, Ibrahimovi\u0107 scored his 50th international goal in a 2\u20130 friendly match victory over Estonia, making him the Swedish national team's all-time leading goalscorer. Earlier in the same match, he equaled Sven Rydell's record of 49 by scoring the opening goal.

On 21 June 2016, Ibrahimovi\u0107 announced that he would retire from international football immediately after Sweden's last match at Euro 2016.In November 2017, after Sweden clinched qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia by defeating Italy in the second qualifying round, there was speculation about a possible return of Ibrahimovi\u0107 to the national team. Ibrahimovi\u0107 himself expressed his wish to represent Sweden in the World Cup. However, in April 2018, Sweden manager Janne Andersson stated that Ibrahimovi\u0107 will not be called-up for the World Cup, thus ending any possibility of a return. Later in June, Ibrahimovi\u0107 blamed the Swedish media for his World Cup absence.\n\n\n== Style of play ==\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 has been described by ESPN as being \"good in the air, quick, tall, strong and agile, he plays well with his back to goal and boasts some of the best finishing, vision, passing and ball control around.\" A versatile and well-rounded footballer, from a tactical standpoint, Ibrahimovi\u0107 is capable of playing anywhere along the front line, due to his ability to both create and score goals for his team, although he is most often deployed as a striker, due to his composure and eye for goal. He has also functioned in a more creative playmaking role at times, as a supporting forward or even as a number 10, in particular in his later career, after losing some of his pace and stamina with age; this deeper position allows him to drop into midfield to pick up the ball, where he can utilise his technical ability, vision, passing, and movement to create space and provide assists for teammates.\n\nWhile naturally right-footed, Ibrahimovi\u0107 is a powerful and accurate striker of the ball from both inside or outside the penalty area with either foot, and is also known for his accuracy from penalties and dead ball situations. An accurate finisher with his head as well as with his feet, his height, elevation, and strength often give him an advantage at winning aerial challenges, and also allow him to function as a \"target man\"; despite his large stature, Ibrahimovi\u0107 is uncommonly agile for a player of his size, and his athleticism and ability in the air have seen him score several goals from acrobatic strikes and volleys throughout his career, which earned him the monicker Ibracadabra in the Italian media. In spite of his size and physique, Ibrahimovi\u0107 possesses excellent technique and ball control, which, coupled with his balance, power, and physicality, enables him to hold up the ball well with his back to goal, retain possession, and link up with other players; he has also been praised by pundits for his creativity and dribbling skills.\n\nConsidered to be a highly talented player in his youth, due to his prolific goalscoring, consistency, and spectacular strikes, Ibrahimovi\u0107 came to be regarded by many in the sport to be one of the best players in the world during his prime, and as one of the greatest and most complete strikers of his generation; he has also drawn praise from managers and teammates for his leadership and longevity, as well as his fitness, professionalism, and dedication in training. Regarding his work-ethic, his former Juventus, Fabio Capello commented in 2016: \"At the beginning of his first spell at Juventus [...] I noticed that he was weaker than I thought when he had to kick the ball and was not very strong in the air. Ibrahimovic [sic] loved making assists more than scoring goals. I wanted him to become more ruthless in front of goal and improve his finishing. He had the same technical skills as Van Basten and I made him watch some videos of him to improve his finishing. I told him to watch Van Basten's movements inside the area and the way he used to score goals. Ibra got it straight away; I think results are out there to prove it. He is a very humble guy and he worked every day to improve. He\u2019s proud of himself too, he loves being the best.\"Although Ibrahimovi\u0107 has been criticised at times in the media for being inconsistent in high pressure situations, and for his limited work-rate and poor performances in big matches, in particular in his youth, throughout his career he has scored in some of the biggest matches in football; these include the Derby della Madonnina and the Derby d'Italia in Italy, El Cl\u00e1sico, El Otro Cl\u00e1sico, and the Catalan Derbi barcelon\u00ed in Spain, Le Classique in France, De Klassieker and De Topper in the Netherlands, and the Manchester Derby and North-West Derby in England, as well as UEFA Champions League and UEFA European Championship games against some of the strongest opponents in European football. He has also scored in the Helsingborgs IF\u2013Malm\u00f6 FF \"Sk\u00e5nederby\" in Sweden, and in El Tr\u00e1fico and the California Cl\u00e1sico in the United States. Moreover, in addition to being a prolific striker, he has also been highly successful throughout his career, winning numerous titles in several countries; additionally, he is the only player to have scored for six different clubs in the Champions League. Known for his strong mentality, as well as his extroverted and highly competitive personality, despite his success, he has been criticised in the media for his arrogance, aggression and rebellious character, as well as his lack of discipline on the pitch, in particular in his early career, which has led him to involved in confrontations with other players, some of his managers and even reporters. Ibrahimovi\u0107 has frequently been compared to Dutchman Marco van Basten, due to their similar playing styles, physiques, and proclivity for scoring from powerful shots and volleys; despite this comparison, Ibrahimovi\u0107 has stated that his main influence was his idol, former Brazilian forward Ronaldo, whom he regards as the greatest player of all time. He has also been likened to French former footballer Eric Cantona, who also played for Manchester United.\n\n\n== Football-related business activities ==\n\n\n=== Hammarby IF ===\nOn 27 November 2019, it was announced that Ibrahimovi\u0107 had bought 23.5 percent of the shares in Hammarby IF, a Swedish top flight club from Stockholm. The seller was Anschutz Entertainment Group, also the owner of his former club LA Galaxy, who reduced their stake in Hammarby by half. In Sweden, all sport teams in the league systems are regulated to be nonprofit organizations, which means that a majority of the voting rights, or 51 percent, is still controlled by the members of the club. Fans of Malm\u00f6 FF, who were unhappy with Ibrahimovi\u0107's investment into their rival club, have vandalised his statue in Malm\u00f6 on numerous occasions.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 has been involved in several violent incidents with teammates. After a 2004 international friendly against the Netherlands, Ajax teammate Rafael van der Vaart publicly accused Ibrahimovi\u0107 of deliberately injuring him during the game.

Ibrahimovi\u0107 also punched Ajax teammate Mido in the dressing room after the latter had thrown a pair of scissors at him.During his spell at Barcelona, Ibrahimovi\u0107 had a falling-out with coach Pep Guardiola, culminating in a dressing room incident in which Ibrahimovi\u0107 threw a training-kit box across the room and screamed insults at Guardiola. Guardiola eventually refused to speak to Ibrahimovi\u0107 and loaned him out to Milan. Barcelona vice president Carles Vilarrubi further revealed that Ibrahimovi\u0107 had threatened to publicly beat up Guardiola if he was not released to Milan.\n\nIn 2010, Ibrahimovi\u0107 was involved in a training-ground fist-fight with Milan teammate Oguchi Onyewu, after Ibrahimovi\u0107 made a two-footed tackle on him, followed by a headbutt. They were separated and the session prematurely abandoned, with Ibrahimovi\u0107 having suffered a broken rib in the fracas. Both players had accused one of insulting the other. In March 2011, Ibrahimovi\u0107 was given a three-match ban for punching Bari defender Marco Rossi in the stomach during a game. He received another three-match ban in February 2012 for slapping Napoli player Salvatore Aronica.

In December 2012, Ibrahimovi\u0107 was accused by Lyon defender Dejan Lovren and president Jean-Michel Aulas of deliberately stamping on Lovren's head. Lovren suggested the reason Zlatan escaped punishment was due to his \u201csuperstar status\u201d. In February 2013, UEFA handed Ibrahimovi\u0107 a two-match ban for stamping on Valencia winger Andr\u00e9s Guardado. In March 2013, PSG winger Lucas claimed that Ibrahimovi\u0107 regularly insulted teammates, stating, \"He always asks for the ball and insults a lot. He is sometimes a bit arrogant and complains.\" Lucas later claimed, however, that the interview was twisted and badly translated. In May 2013, Ibrahimovi\u0107 was filmed screaming at PSG sporting director Leonardo after the club's title victory.Lyon coach Hubert Fournier accused Ibrahimovi\u0107 of abusing officials, stating in January 2015 that \"all the referees in this league get insulted by this person\". Two months later, after a loss by PSG in a Ligue 1 match, Ibrahimovi\u0107 ranted, \"In 15 years I've never seen a [good] referee in this shit country ... [they] don't even deserve PSG.\" He later apologised, but was criticised by French politicians, and Ligue 1 imposed a four-match ban.\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 has additionally engaged in multiple incidents while with the national team. After Sweden's 1\u20130 victory over the Faroe Islands in October 2012, Faroes captain Fr\u00f3\u00f0i Benjaminsen accused Ibrahimovi\u0107 of foul play and insults, describing him as \"arrogant\", \"childish\", \"ignorant\", and a \"dirty player\".

Ibrahimovi\u0107 was additionally caught on camera kicking teammate Christian Wilhelmsson during training.In 2013, he came under fire from the Sweden women's national team for an interview published on Christmas Day by tabloid Expressen, in which he had commented about the disparity of achievements by, and the treatment of, male and female footballers. His former teammate Anders Svensson had been rewarded with a car for becoming Sweden's most-capped player that year, but Therese Sj\u00f6gran had received no such reward for doing likewise for the women's team, despite owning 41 more caps (187 to 146) than Svensson at the time. Ibrahimovi\u0107's response to the issue was that Sweden would be \"devaluing\" Svensson \"by comparing him with the ladies' individual achievements. They can get a bike with my autograph on it and then we're good.\" Coach Pia Sundhage replied that his comments were \"sad and unfortunate\" and epitomised \"failings in the basic values of male football\", while Sj\u00f6gran said, \"I understand him when he says that the men's national team brings in more money and exposure. That's true. But this is about respect.\"In April 2016, Mino Raiola announced that Ibrahimovi\u0107 would be suing Swedish trainer Ulf Karlsson over doping claims. According to Expressen, Karlsson cited Ibrahimovi\u0107's \"unnatural\" and \"rapid weight gain\" during his stint with Juventus. Raiola said about the allegations, \"The claims are just crazy \u2013 the facts are not there. All the clubs Zlatan has been at know he doesn't even take aspirin.\"In April 2019, Real Salt Lake defender Nedum Onuoha accused Ibrahimovic of foul play and threats to injure him during a game, calling him \"arrogant\", \"disrespectful\", and \"a complete thug\".

In his statement, the player said that he intends on making it the best club. However, his decision to invest in the club infuriated the fans of Malm\u00f6 who vandalized his bronze statue and set it ablaze. The striker responded to the incident and marked that the decision had nothing to with where he began his career.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nIbrahimovi\u0107 has one sibling (Sanela) and four half-siblings.

I received a special education. I'm me and football is a religion in its own right, and everyone is welcome...\" In an interview with CNN on 24 November 2015, he stressed that his Muslim background was \"not a factor\" in fans' perception of him: \"For me, it didn't change (anything) because my father is Muslim and my mother is Catholic... For me it is all about respect. That's how I grew up and the way I learned to be. This is what I am.\" Nevertheless he later described himself as a \"deeply faithful Catholic\".The Malm\u00f6-based television presenter Teddy Land\u00e9n, who was interviewed for the same documentary, noted Ibrahimovi\u0107's choice of shirt name following his 2001 transfer to Ajax: \"You can see that just the fact that when he [emerged] in the professional [football] world [at Ajax], from Sweden, where he was only known [by the name] Zlatan \u2013 his first name \u2013 he changed so he would have Ibrahimovi\u0107 on his shirt, on his jersey, because he wanted to honour his background. Being from a Muslim background, being from a very very low key, very low status background, he really [wanted] to show all the kids from Roseng\u00e5rd [and] from Malm\u00f6 in general: 'If I can do it, you can do it.'\"\n\n\n=== Body art ===\nHis surname is tattooed in Arabic on the back of his right arm, the names of his sons Vincent and Maximilian on his right arm.

It is not one corpse but two halves of two separate women: the upper-half being that of a female Swedish politician, the lower-half being that of a Danish prostitute. Saga Nor\u00e9n from Sweden and Martin Rohde from Denmark lead the murder investigations.\nMartin has had a vasectomy. August, the eighteen-year-old son from his first marriage is now living with Martin and Mette, his current wife, with whom Martin has three children. Mette discovers that she is expecting another set of twins.\nSaga lives alone and rather than have serious relationships, she prefers to pick up men in bars for casual sex. Her poor social skills, her difficulty in empathising and her inability to channel her emotions make her appear cold, insensitive and blunt but she is completely honest and forthright in all aspects. In the course of the investigation, Martin and Saga develop a close working relationship.\nThe investigation quickly escalates as a journalist, Daniel Ferb\u00e9, whose car was used in the crime, begins receiving phone calls. The caller, who becomes known as the \"Truth Terrorist\", claims to be committing crimes in order to draw attention to various social problems. A social worker, Stefan Lindberg is an early suspect; his estranged sister Sonja is a victim. Working together, the Danish and Swedish police conclude that the killer must have a connection with them. After the killer has murdered several people, his true motivation begins to seem personal. They discover that he has been planning his campaign over a period of several years.\n\n\n=== Series 2 ===\n\nSeries two starts 13 months later.\nA coaster veers off course and rams into the \u00d8resund Bridge. When Saga arrives, there is no crew just three Swedes and two Danes below deck,  chained and in poor condition. Although Martin has gone through a nervous breakdown following his son's death, she arranges for him to be assigned to the case. After the victims on the coaster die from pneumonic plague, a viral video appears in which four disguised eco-terrorists claim responsibility for the incident. They embark on further attacks, including blowing up a petrol tanker and distributing poisoned food. As the police close in on the group, they are all found dead in a shipping container, thus raising the question of whether there are other terrorist cells or a larger group.\nThe keynote speaker of an upcoming EU climate conference in Copenhagen is one of those killed by poisoning. Caroline Brandstrup-Julin, the head of the conference, appoints Viktoria Nordgren, head of the Medisonus pharmaceutical company, as his replacement. While arranging the congress, Caroline's sister Bodil is asked by Oliver Nordgren, Viktoria's brother and a shareholder of Medisonus, whether she would be willing to write Viktoria's biography; Viktoria has been diagnosed with cancer and has about six months to live.\nDuring the retrieval of a sunken boat, seven corpses are found inside. The owner of the boat is Marcus Stenberg. The investigation discovers the identities of the dead and finds that some of them had previously been volunteers in medical studies undertaken by Medisonus, but who had gone missing. The company's security chief tells them that a possible industrial spy gained access to their headquarters.\nBodil and Viktoria meet to discuss the content of the biography. Oliver, who lives in the house opposite to his sister's and has secretly installed cameras in her house, watches them make love. When Viktoria asks Oliver to keep out of her life, he confesses that he is responsible for the eco-terrorist acts. When he tries to kill her, Oliver's wife Gertrud arrives to save Viktoria and kills Oliver. The police assume that Oliver acted alone as the ringleader of the plot, but Saga then turns up further evidence that there must be at least one more accomplice.\nThe police pathologist shows that two of the dead bodies found earlier contain a deadly virus, which causes internal bleeding and becomes airborne once the victim's blood escapes the body; Saga and Martin guess that Gertrud has developed the virus and infected Viktoria with the intent of spreading it at the EU conference. They manage to alert Caroline, and command her to evacuate the building and turn off the ventilation. Eventually, the police arrive at the conference and begin searching for the dying Viktoria. She is eventually discovered in a bathroom by Pernille, who handcuffs her to a pipe to help contain her. Before she can leave, however, Viktoria starts coughing blood, infecting Pernille with the virus. As the area is contained, Martin and Saga communicate with Pernille over the radio, and as Viktoria dies painfully, Pernille decides not to go the same way, and commits suicide with her gun. Meanwhile, Gertrud drives to a secluded warehouse where she shoots a video and is executed by a man who arrives and castigates her for the failure of her plot.\nMartin, in an attempt to get over the death of August, begins visiting Jens in prison, to try to get through to him. He is satisfied when he sees that his visits have made an impression, and Jens begins to feel remorse for his crime. When Martin moves back in with his estranged wife Mette, ready to start again, she admits that she no longer loves him. A distraught Martin blames Jens, and begins to suffer renewed symptoms of paranoia. Saga hears that Jens has died in prison, apparently a suicide, and suspects Martin of having poisoned him. The series ends as Martin is arrested, apparently as a result of her intervention.\n\n\n=== Series 3 ===\nSeries three starts 13 months later.\nWhen a female body is found on a construction site in Malm\u00f6, Sweden \u2013 posed in a tableau representing a traditional family \u2013 Saga is assigned to the case together with a Copenhagen police officer Hanne Thomsen, who is hostile towards Saga due to her role in the incarceration of Martin Rohde. The victim is identified as Helle Anker, a resident of Copenhagen. Anker, a lesbian married to a Swedish woman, was the pioneer of Denmark's first gender-neutral preschool. Her work had been the target of numerous threats, including vlog posts by right-wing lawyer Lise Frise Andersen, whose husband owns the facility where Anker's body was discovered. While attempting to question Anker's son Morten, a mentally unstable veteran of the war in Afghanistan, Thomsen is wounded by a booby trap. Saga is then assigned a new Danish partner, Henrik Sabroe.\nAnother murder is linked to Andersen's blog. Hans Petterson is abducted and Linn Bj\u00f6rkman takes over as his replacement. The murders are described on the television news, leading Emil Larsson, an art gallery employee, to come forward and show that they may have been staged to look like artworks from a collection owned by multi-millionaire Freddie Holst. The police suspect Holst's former business partner, Claes Sandberg. Holst had legally gained control of his company and art collection.\nSaga's mother Marie-Louise challenges the assumption that Jennifer was the victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, suggesting that it was Saga's inability to connect with her sister emotionally that drove her to suicide. Marie-Louise claims that Saga has been to her home and threatened her. At first when Marie-Louise is found dead, the assumption is suicide but later it is considered it could be murder. Saga is interviewed by Internal Affairs. The pressure of her mother's investigation and her grief when Hans dies causes Saga to make a serious error. Linn, who has replaced the abducted Hans, temporarily suspends Saga and replaces her with Rasmus. A woman named Jeanette carrying Freddie's baby is kidnapped and a woman named Annika is discovered. Freddie outfoxes his security detail, goes to the secluded location that the killer has instructed and finds himself with Emil Larsson who explains that he has been enacting justice on those who wronged him during his childhood. Freddie was the sperm donor used to conceive him. He takes Freddie and the baby to Saltholm where he has prepared the final artwork. Saga and Henrik are following up on a lead and arrive in time to save the lives of all three.\nSix years after she disappeared, the body of Henrik's wife is discovered, but no trace of their two daughters; causing him to spiral into depression and to overdose on drugs. Saga goes to his house in time to rescue him. Shortly after, Saga is informed that a preliminary hearing is being scheduled on her case and, despite Linn's belief that it will not proceed further than this, she worries that she will lose everything as a result. Henrik, wanting to find his two missing daughters himself, resigns his job and goes to find Saga, intending to ask her to join him. He eventually finds her at the train tracks where her sister killed herself, looking visibly distressed. Realising she is considering taking her own life on the tracks as the lights of an approaching train appear, Henrik desperately tries to talk her out of it, insisting he needs her expertise to help find his girls. When he attempts to cross the track to her, Saga draws a gun on him and orders him to stay back, before seemingly stepping into the path of an oncoming train. When it passes, however, Henrik sees that she has not gone through with it but has fallen to her knees a short distance away, and goes to comfort her as she begins sobbing. The series ends with Henrik and Saga studying the case information about the disappearance of Henrik's daughters.\n\n\n=== Series 4 ===\nTwo years later, having spent more than a year in prison, Saga Nor\u00e9n is released following a retrial which found that there was reasonable doubt about her murdering her mother. Henrik Sabroe investigates the murder of the director general of the Immigration Service, Margarethe Thormond, who has been stoned to death. After her release and assignment to help Henrik solve the murder case, Saga moves in with him. She starts therapy after having a panic attack while driving across the bridge and Henrik attends meetings for addicts. There, he is befriended by a man in a wheelchair named Kevin. Two more victims are discovered and Saga realizes that each victim is killed using one method of executing prisoners sentenced to death - suggesting a total of seven victims, leaving four to come. She also notes that the victims are selected not because of their actions but because of something their loved ones have done.\nAs more people are murdered, Henrik realizes that the common link between the victims is people associated with Tommy - a gangster and a police informer that Henrik used to know. Tommy had told Henrik when and where his gang would be raiding another gang but the prosecutor refused to follow up on the tip. The raid led to bloodshed and a number of deaths, resulting in the execution of Tommy as a police informer, a fact inadvertently revealed by a journalist whose brother was one of the victims. Henrik and Lilian's involvement in that case makes their loved ones potential victims of future murders because they are considered to have betrayed Tommy. Kevin is revealed as Tommy's son, whose real name is Brian.\nMeanwhile, Saga has become pregnant and she decides to have an abortion, which upsets Henrik. She agrees to proceed with the pregnancy provided he keeps the baby and raises it on his own. Later, Saga realizes that she is in love with Henrik, so she aborts her pregnancy to remove a possible obstacle to her relationship with him. When she tells Henrik, he is furious and throws her out of the house. Acting on discussions with her therapist, Saga decides to make amends and redoubles her efforts to find Henrik's daughters. A chance encounter with Christoffer, whose father was a minor figure in the investigation, enables her to track down one of Henrik's daughters, Astrid, who is living as another man's daughter in a closed community. Reunited with Henrik, Astrid tells him his other daughter, Anna, died of untreated appendicitis.\nSaga discovers that the murderer is Tommy's former lover, Susanne Winter, personal assistant to the Thormonds. Winter is arrested and provides details about the murders. With the help of her therapist, Saga lets go of her guilt for her sister's suicide. Her therapist suggests that Saga is a police officer to make amends for her sister's suicide. The pathologist, who admires Saga, helps confirm that her mother suffered from a psychological problem and probably caused her sister's death. With her guilt resolved, Saga discovers she can explore life outside of police.\nHowever, when summoned to talk to a former fellow prisoner, Saga learns that Susanne Winter was not acting alone. In the meantime, Henrik is trying to rebuild his relationship with Astrid. Brian unexpectedly comes to visit them one evening to celebrate. When Henrik turns around, Brian stands up from his wheelchair and attacks him. He ties up Henrik and Astrid, and asks Henrik to watch as he shoots Astrid. Henrik refuses, so Brian shoots her in the leg and says he will continue to maim her until Henrik opens his eyes. A gunshot is heard and Henrik sees that Brian has been shot dead by Saga.\nSaga visits Henrik and tells him she is leaving to explore doing the things she wants to do but promises to stay in touch. Returning to Malm\u00f6, she stops at the halfway point to throw her police badge into the sea.  Her phone rings, and she answers just with her name, omitting her former job title.\n\n\n== Production ==\nSeries two started shooting in October 2012, and began to air in Denmark and Sweden on Sunday 22 September 2013 (20.00 in Denmark and 21.00 in Sweden).In January 2014, Hans Rosenfeldt was writing the third series and retaining most of the main characters. In June 2014 it was announced that Kim Bodnia, who plays Martin Rohde, would not appear in the third series. Helin and Bodnia suggested that series three would include Saga coping without her only friend, and suggested that Bodnia's character might return sometime in the future. Hans Rosenfeldt confirmed that Bodnia had left the show because Bodnia was not happy about the way that his on-screen character was evolving. He also voiced concerns in an interview about working in Malm\u00f6, due to the city's problems with antisemitism, which had made his decision to leave the series easier. Filming started during September 2014.The Scandinavian launch of the third series was on 27 September 2015. Sofia Helin is credited alone in the first episode's opening titles, with Thure Lindhardt listed alongside her thereafter. The names, along with the Swedish and Danish titles, were separated by three lines, indicating the third series; they had been separated by one line in the first, and two in the second series.\nWhen the fourth series started broadcasting on 1 January 2018 in the Nordic countries, Rosenfeld confirmed that this is the final series; it was written so as to bring the previous story-lines to satisfactory conclusion.\n\n\n== Music ==\nThe opening and closing theme is a cut of the song \"Hollow Talk\" by Copenhagen-based Danish chamber pop band Choir of Young Believers.\n\n\n== Broadcast ==\n\n\n=== Series 1 ===\nSeries one consists of 10 episodes. Each episode is 60 minutes in length. They were first broadcast on Wednesday nights at 8pm in Denmark and 9pm in Sweden.\n\nThe first airing of the series was screened on Sweden's SVT1 weekly from Wednesday 21 September 2011 at 21.00. Denmark's DR1 followed a week later in their 20.00 slot every Wednesday. By screening the final episode immediately after episode 9, DR1 managed to screen episode 10 simultaneously with SVT1.\nOn several occasions, The Bridge failed to have sufficient viewers to be placed in SVT1's weekly Top 10 programmes.

          "Very well-built newcomer in the Malm\u00f6 Escape room scene. Clever and quite elaborate puzzles made for a surprisingly good time. Their focus on story driven scenarios made them stand out from their competitors, and the owner/guide/expert was such a nice guy!",

          "Great place and story.",

          "Really good Escape Room with varied puzzles, cool solutions and nice staff. Anyone who hasn't tested does it!\n\n",

          "The lost hand. Interesting but the feeling does not come true. Supernova staff who engage.\n\n",
          "Really nice decor in the room and interesting puzzles! The room The Last Hand that we played focuses more on the story than in most Esacpe rooms on the story - it is not just an excuse for doing lots of puzzles in the \u2026",

        "wiki": "Non-Violence, also known as The Knotted Gun, is a bronze sculpture by Swedish artist Carl Fredrik Reutersw\u00e4rd of an oversized Colt Python .357 Magnum revolver with its muzzle tied in a knot.\n\n\n== History ==\nCarl Fredrik Reutersw\u00e4rd made this sculpture after the murder of John Lennon. One copy was originally located at the Strawberry Fields memorial in Central Park. In 1988, Luxembourg donated it to the United Nations, and the sculpture was moved right outside of the headquarters of the UN.Since 1993, the sculpture has been the symbol of The Non-Violence Project (NVPF), a nonprofit organization that promotes social change through violence-prevention education programs.\nIn 2011, Ringo Starr unveiled his own brightly colored version of The Knotted Gun that he created.For the 30th anniversary of the sculpture, the NVPF and the art dealer Hansen Fine Art launched a foot-long version of the sculpture sold online. The United Nations Postal Administration issued three stamps depicting the sculpture. In 2019, the NVPF worked with the Dalai Lama to make 150 small-scale Non-Violence sculptures from melted confiscated guns (Humanium Metal), including one copy signed by the Dalai Lama and auctioned at Sotheby's.\n\n\n== Description ==\nNon-Violence, or The Knotted Gun, is a bronze sculpture by Swedish artist Carl Fredrik Reutersw\u00e4rd of an oversized Colt Python .357 Magnum revolver  with its muzzle tied in a knot. According to Kofi Annan, \"it has enriched the consciousness of humanity with a powerful symbol that encapsulates, in a few simple curves, the greatest prayer of man; that which asks not for victory, but for peace.\"\u00bb\nThe Museum of Sketches for Public Art in Lund (Sweden) holds a sketch of the firearm on which Reutersw\u00e4rd noted that his grief at the murders of Lennon and Bob Crane inspired him to design this artwork.\n\n\n== Locations ==\nThere are currently 31 copies of the sculpture around the world. They are located in strategic places such as :\n\n\n== See also ==\nInternational Day of Non-Violence\nNonviolence\n\n\n== References ==",

          "A really impressive piece of art, which represents pacifism very strongly. As far as I\u2018ve read, there are several copies spread all over the world, but this one in Malm\u00f6 is one of 3 originals. Absolutely worth a visit.",
          "It is a piece of public art, quite close to the Malm\u00f6 Central Station, you need about 5 minute to see it.",
          "Its just a nice structure to look it. Quite close to the malmo station and its not as big as pictures make it seem",
          "What an amazing piece of work! Well worth coming to see if you're in Malmo! They also have some other very interesting pieces of street art in the vicinity.",
          "A monument, not very big, representing a pistol with a knotted barrel. Placed very close to the central railway station. You do not need more than 5-10 minutes to see it.",
          "Visit if you\u2019re in malmo but I wouldn\u2019t go out of your way for it, small street statue with a large meaning",
          "Although near the Central Station we almost missed this sculpture as it is a lot smaller than I expected. Titled \"Non Violence\" by Carl Fredrick Reuters Ward 1985.",
          "This is a piece of public art, like many others. If you happen to be close by, you'd might as well take a look, but I wouldn't recommend anyone go out of their way to see it. You will do just as well googling the image and taking a look online.",
          "I guess it is one of those things you have to see when in Malmo. It is within an easy walk from the train station",
          "It is not a big sculpture and you do not miss anything, if you cannot visit this place. It is not far away from central station.",
          "Very short walk from central Malmo train Station and such a striking image. Worth a visit- takes a great photo and poignant",
          "We stopped by the sculpture on the way back to the Central Train Station. Almost everyone walks past it because they assumed the sculpture would be much larger.",
          "While I thought it would be bigger, it is an impressive monument with an even more important message.",
          "The message of this sculpture is loud and clear. It is an intricate piece of art. Definitely worth your visit.",
          "Central area and a different type of sculpture. I think the meaning is clear and it is quite impressive if smaller than I expected",
          "How significant is this statue in this day and age. So appropriate and full of meaning. I really thought this was clever and the artist did an amazing job.",
          "Located near main station near other attractions. Its an interesting statue in an nice surroundings.",
          "This is really easy to find just across the road from the station, so if like us you come to Malmo on the train it's a good first stop before looking round the town. The sculpture is smaller than you would think from photos, so is easy to miss. The statue is very detailed",
          "Great symbolism for the lack of crime in Sweden. We need this in the USA for sure. I showed a picture with me sitting on it because without defense it looks really big, but it\u2019s not.",
          "The sculpture is called 'Non-Violence' and is by Carl -Friedrick Reutersward. It's not a large piece of artwork, but it's very symbolic and worth a visit. It's a 5 to 10 minute activity.",
          "I heard about this and wanted to visit it, however, I was slightly disappointed by the size of this sculpture (which is my fault as I had higher expectations). Nevertheless, this is a nice sculpture with a strong message.",
          "The original first knotted gun. Over 36 around the world. Not as large as in front of the UN. Interesting to now about it.",
          "I\u2019d only briefly seen pictures of the knotted gun so both myself and my wife has for some reason thought it was a huge sculpture. Imagine my surprise when I saw it in the distance as I was approaching. I actually asked my wife if it was a tiny model of the real one. Anyway,",
          "Worthwhile visiting it, just behind the train station, a powerful message. We enjoyed the walk in the nearby area as well.",
          "This is a great statue. Bronze statue by a Swedish artist. It a a lot fun that has the nozzle in a knot to represent that we should stop gun violence/ war etc.",
          "This non violent bronze sculpture is made by Carl Fredrik Reutersw\u00e4rd. It s an overzised magnum revolver",
          "Not sure this was worth a separate walk but it was cool once we got there. It\u2019s next to the colorful sculptures too.",
          "I am giving \"The Knotted Gun\" a full five stars because you think you will see this HUGE sculpture.... and then you see it and become mesmerized by its size. Like everyone else, I thought it was huge.... but it is small. I have attached a picture of it here. Regardless, if",
          "The Knotted Gun is a small sculpture on a marble plinth with nothing else around it (e.g. story board or museum etc.) A few good photos and a provocative one of piece of art but you only need 10 minutes here. Very close to central train station.",
          "The Knotted Gun in Malmo is another \"one of a kind\" thing! Not sure what it is supposed to mean!!!!!",
          "I am a gun enthusiast so while I don't believe the underlying message from the artist is relevant I did find the art itself fun to look at. Hate does not live in inanimate objects, only in people!",
          "The Knotted Gun is a small sculpture near the university and train station in Malmo. The knotted gun is in memory of John Lennon and was created in 1985 to represent non violence.",
          "At the west river edge, Suelishamnen, at the west end of Malmo Central Station, this sculpture has deep meaning and reminder for all how human has misused the gun for the evil purposes and kill others. This \u201cNon-Violence\u201d sculpture created by Swedish Artist Carl Fredrik",
          "Worth a visit if in Malmo close to Central Station but not really visible from a distance. Excellent message and imaginative way of delivering it.",
          "Great sculpture with a strong message. Funny comment: after seeing pictures online before you expect this huge sculpture/gun - in reality it's the size of a dog :D still worth it and just 1 minute walk from central station.",
          "Not sure why but I expected more to be around this. When you\u2019re trying to find it you may miss it because it\u2019s hidden behind central station and a small shop. However once you arrive there it does have a very powerful message! Worth a visit and a few pictures!",
          "It's opposite the Central Station - leave the station through the coffee shop called Espresso House and cross the little bridge over the canal in front of you. Not as small as expected after the reviews I had read here!!",
          "It is first thing to see when you get out of Malmo train station.100 meters from station. The statue is small may be miss it.good art but smaller than iI expect but must to see it &take photo",
          "Getting off the train in Malmo, this was the first thing I looked for. Took me a while via google maps going around in circles but got there in the end. Actually just a stones throw from station but I was expecting it to be so much bigger so I complexity missed it at first",
          "You can say that's interesting but i thought it's much bigger. We were not impressed to see it, but if you are in Malm\u00f6 then it's required.",
          "Very nice, but we've passed by this statue 3 times (!!) without noticing it's there. Disappointed by the size, but nice design.",
          "I come from one of the very few countries in the world without an army, so seeing this magnificent artwork that undoubtedly conveys a peace and disarmament message, was very inspiring and satisfying. It also exemplifies how Sweden has chosen to live for the past decades and",
          "Arrived from Scotland having seen many photographs of this sculpture. Rather disappointed to find it was considerably smaller in scale than any of us thought it would be. Very impressive in terms of the creative process behind it but visually it's as though this is just a",
          "Very Interesting sculpture. Strong message being shown. Signifies the Swedish personality - peaceful / non violent and chilled.",
          "This is an excellent sculpture. Coming from Canada (and being so close to the USA and their gun culture), I appreciate the message this conveys.",
          "An interesting monument, maybe a message for many. Sweden has not been in the war for more than 200 years",
          "What you see is what you get. Passed by every day to catch a train. The Swedes got the message. Maybe some other countries should stop and think.",
          "If you are coming from Copenhagen and visiting Malmo, or just visiting at all, then it is worth passing as it is not far from the station. There are quite a few statues like this around the world and they are good to see.",
          "What you see in the picture is what you see there, If you happen to pass by, you see It, you imagine Buggs Bunny doing it to the hunters gun, and thats all folks.",
          "I really liked seeing this, great, simple attraction that isn't crowded by other tourists. very unique and Swedish.",
          "Worth a quick visit if you are near Malmo Central station. The meaning behind the knotted gun is very fascinating but I had to look it up online after i saw the knotted gun. Other than that, it is smaller than what i was imagining. This was just as equal as seeing all the other",
          "What a great, but small (4 foot long) sculpture, but the meaning had all of my social media friends raving!",
          "Was expecting a big gun statue but was suprise that it was a small knotted gun. The surroundings has a view of the river.",
          "we found this one and a other in gothenborg as well. we liked it and the idea is great behind this statue.",
          "It would be a sin to visit Malmo and not to see \"The Knotted Gun\". One of the famous monument in Malmo with very strong message. Btw it is not that big as it looks in the photos :) but it doesn\u00b4t matter.",
          "I happened to stumble onto this piece of art when I got off of a random train to Malmo. It had a good message and is a nice piece of art by the harbor/train station.",
          "I don't normally \"get\" a lot of more of the modern art but I liked this one and the message that I believe that it is trying to give.",
          "Definetly worth the visit. 30 minutes stroll from Lilla Torg. Just by the harbour. It is not huge. Does it need to be?",
          "still amazingly powerful message ... stays there as a reminder of the human stupidity ... hence not all of us!",
          "Im not sure what all the hoppla is. It is an interesting sculpture but nothing amazing. If you have time, than see it.",
          "Not literally, the knot prevented the firearm from discharging. I'd long heard of the big gun prior to my trip to Malmo last year, but nothing prepared me for the awe that I felt when in it's presence. I felt a calm pass through me, my shoulders dropped and my skin cleared to",
          "A very interesting statue/sculpture well placed on the waterside near to The Central Railway Station .",
          "Its near the train station and any local can point you to it. Its really small but I think it can be compared to the Little Mermaid on Copenhagen side in term of size and hype.",
          "We would not have been able to find it if I hadn't followed the directions given from other Tripadvisor users. It is very small and there are no lights on it or around it, so at night, it just kinda dissappears in the darkness.",
          "Very near the main Malmo station, it's worth a little detour to look at. Much smaller than I expected and awkward to photograph in it's entirety getting a blue sky background. Wortha detour though.",
          "This is an interesting piece of art which caught my attention, but I did not see any information detailing its history and philsophy, which would have been good to read.",
          "One could think it is bigger but don't be surprized dear traveler or Malmo walker, it is smaller than you would expect. But why should one such monument be any bigger?",
          "This statue isn't exactly huge and its surrounded by parked bicycles. It's a good stopping off point on a walk from the station to the castle. There is another statue across the road from it.",
          "This is a very interesting piece of public art. You will pass by it as you leave the train station and walk towards Malmo Castle. It is one of the important landmarks to get a second with. Especially if you have seen the others in other cities.",
          "As the title says, this st\u00e1tue IS Message to the world. Was dissapointed by the size of statue, expected something bigger, but still interesting.",
          "Original and interesting statue. The message of the knotted gun is clear. A must see if you are sight seeing in Malm\u00f6 .Very close to Malm\u00f6 central station.",
          "Although I admire its originality, this sight might not worth a detour. If you still insist on seeing it, try to go during the day. It's difficult to spot at night since it isn't well lit.",
          "What else can be said? The larger versions stands in front of the UN building. Its place across from the central station in Malm\u00f6.",
          "I have to agree with the reviews. The sculpture is a lot smaller than it seems, and that is why it is not so easy to find! It is a replica, but the important thing is the message it carries, specially on such an intercultural city like Malmo.",
          "Don't be fooled by images you see... this sculpture is much smaller than it appears online, but it carries a large message. If you arrive in Malmo via the train, you might as well stop and see this as its a short walk away from the station. Oddly difficult to find if you have",
          "Not a big as you think - but does make you think. A must see if you are sight seening in Malmo - lovely place",
          "We happened upon this sculpture by chance. We had seen it outside the UN in NYC as well. Nice to see this in Sweden, as it is sculpted by a Swede.",
          "The message of the knotted gun is clear. Relatively easy to find. 5-10 minate from the central train station. Only take a couple of minutes to have a look or take picture. Not very special. Nice surroundings though.",
          "What an absolute mission to find something that, in the end, was not all that difficult to find! The gun is quite a bit smaller than we thought it would be - hence us walking in circles looking for it on a hot June afternoon (aka Roxette) in Malmo. Its situated near the Maritime",
          "Took a bit of searching. Like the message. Worth seeing. The whole area is really nice to walk around. Really enjoyed it.",
          "The size of the artwork is quite small than i thought about. You can find it easily as it just located nearby the river. 5 mins walk to there from central station. Not very special at all.",
          "The knotted gun is a somewhat small sculpture located by a canal, close to Malm\u00f6's central station. The absurdity of the piece is clearly a shot at the absurdity of violence, and I guess gun violence in particular. This message is all the more poignant in these days of",
          "Couldn't afford a visit to the big apple? At least you can get a glimpse of the same Non-Violence statue in Malm\u00f6. Pass it by when going to or from the central station, it's an iconic statue but do not expect sometime big. Sometimes local artists knits a dress for it.",
          "+ Original statue + Deep meaning/good story of the statue + Easy to find + Near the central station - Size: Smaller than expected",
          "This is a really interesting sculpture that is worth the walk. It is about a block from Central Station and a block from the canal. Go straight out the front door of central station where the city buses are located. Turn right, cross the street, walk over the curved white",
          "Stumbled across the statue whilst walking from the station towards the port. It was good to see as it is a big attraction of the city. Well worth having a few photos as the meaning behind the statue is significant. Was quite surprised that it was a small statue, however still",
          "Despite all the instructions, guidances, photos and the address we nearly missed it and passed it without noticing it! The statue looks great, its message is worth to be considered by everyone but the position of the statue could be better. I read the reviews before my trip so I",
          "Quiet underwhelming, worthwhile seeing when strolling through Malm\u00f6, nice to take a few pics, not many tourists as its quiet hard to find given the size of the monument/statue itself.",
          "It is nice to take a picture there as it is one of the attractions of the city, however, we were expecting it to be bigger!",
          "This small statue sends a strong message and is worth a visit. Some say it's hard to find, but just head out of Central station towards the Turning Turso in the distance, and cross a canal, it will be on your left.",
          "As you get out from the train station you can spot the Knotted Gun straight away near the canal before walking towards the City Hall square and all the gorgeous attractions of Malmo city centre. Lots of people taking pictures so might be a bit annoying, take a deep breath and",
          "I read a few reviews of how hard this place is to find so suggest you bin any map and just walk straight out of the central station and instead of turning left onto the main drag, continue straight on towards the bike racks. In fact, if you squint, you can actually see it from",
          "It's not going to take you long to visit, but if you're walking through the city centre, this is a good place to stop and see this interesting statue.",
          "It's a nice sculpture but very difficult to find the place. We have walked a lot untill we found it.",

        "wiki": "Ribersborg open-air bath (Ribersborgs kallbadhus in Swedish, also known as Ribban by the older and Kallis by the younger generation) is an open-air public bath on the Ribersborg beach in Malm\u00f6, Sweden approximately one kilometre southwest of Turning Torso. The bathhouse is open for a skinny dip year round and has separate areas for men and women. Each area is equipped with two saunas and a warm water tub. There is also one mixed sauna (fkk-sauna) between the ladies and gentlemen's area. As well as a cafe and a restaurant.\nThe bath was inaugurated in June 1898 with initiative by C.A. Richter, who bought the old bathhouse at Nyhamn port, which was being sold because of the port's expansion. Four years later a storm damaged the new bath during Christmas and it was rebuilt. During the refurbishment a diving tower was added to the men's department, with a view of the strait and the women's department. During the 1930s it was modernised with nude bathing and confidentiality was added between the departments. In 1966, the City of Malm\u00f6 purchased the baths. It was again damaged by a storm in 1988 and in 1995 it was declared a historic building.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

          "It\u2019s a very beautiful location in Malm\u00f6 so if you don\u2019t want to go to the sauna, just go for the view. We had some really good food with some coworkers at our last stay. The bath are split in half where woman and men are at different sides of the buildings. This is because it\u2019s",
          "I was a little unsure about this one but I read all the reviews so I knew just what to expect. No swimming suit needed or even allowed! I felt like a true Swede as I experienced the saunas on the girls side and took several dips in the Baltic sea The sea was rough so the area",
          "Upon entering the building we were greeted and after getting a run down of the baths, we were told \u201cit\u2019s a very Swedish thing to do\u201d so we went in.

          "Not for the shy! The sauna is nude only with no bathing suits allowed (although you can bring or hire a large towel if modesty is an issue). The sauna is mostly split into male and female areas, with a central unisex sauna in between. I left my drivers license behind and the",

          "Some hundred meters out from the long beach, with many kilometers of sand, a century old sea bath from 1898 is well worth a visit - at all times of the year. In the summers the tree deck often is crowded with sunbathers. From the saunas, some with wood stoves, the view over the",

        "wiki": "Copenhagen (Danish: K\u00f8benhavn [k\u02b0\u00f8pm\u0329\u02c8h\u0251w\u02c0n] (listen)) is the capital and most populous city of Denmark. As of 1 January 2020, the city had a population of 794,128 with 632,340 in Copenhagen Municipality, 104,305 in Frederiksberg Municipality, 42,989 in T\u00e5rnby Municipality, and 14,494 in Drag\u00f8r Municipality. It forms the core of the wider urban area of Copenhagen (population 1,330,993) and the Copenhagen metropolitan area (population 2,057,142). Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of Zealand; another small portion of the city is located on Amager, and it is separated from Malm\u00f6, Sweden, by the strait of \u00d8resund. The \u00d8resund Bridge connects the two cities by rail and road.\nOriginally a Viking fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now Gammel Strand, Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. Beginning in the 17th century, it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions, defences and armed forces. During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the Kalmar Union, governing the entire present day Nordic region in a personal union with Sweden and Norway ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state. The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of Scandinavia under the union for well over 120 years, starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion. After a plague outbreak and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. After further disasters in the early 19th century when Horatio Nelson attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the Second World War, the Finger Plan fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.\nSince the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the cultural, economic and governmental centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the service sector, especially through initiatives in information technology, pharmaceuticals and clean technology. Since the completion of the \u00d8resund Bridge, Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of Scania and its largest city, Malm\u00f6, forming the \u00d8resund Region. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens, The Little Mermaid statue, the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces, Rosenborg Castle Gardens, Frederik's Church, and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions. The largest lake of Denmark, Arres\u00f8, lies around 27 miles (43 kilometers) northwest of the City Hall Square.\nCopenhagen is home to the University of Copenhagen, the Technical University of Denmark, Copenhagen Business School and the IT University of Copenhagen. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the FC K\u00f8benhavn and Br\u00f8ndby football clubs. The annual Copenhagen Marathon was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world.\nThe Copenhagen Metro, launched in 2002, serves central Copenhagen. Additionally the Copenhagen S-train, the Lokaltog (private railway) and the Coast Line network serve and connect central Copenhagen to outlying boroughs. Serving roughly two million passengers a month, Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup, is the busiest airport in the Nordic countries.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nCopenhagen's name reflects its origin as a harbour and a place of commerce. The original designation in Old Norse, from which Danish descends, was Kaupmannah\u01ebfn [\u02e1kaupman\u02d0ah\u0252vn] (cf. modern Icelandic: Kaupmannah\u00f6fn [\u02e1k\u02b0\u00f8yhpman\u02d0ah\u0153pn], Faroese Keypmannahavn), meaning \"merchants' harbour\". By the time Old Danish was spoken, the capital was called K\u00f8pmann\u00e6hafn, with the current name deriving from centuries of subsequent regular sound change. An exact English equivalent would be \"chapman's haven\". However, the English term for the city was adapted from its Low German name, Kopenhagen.\n(English chapman, German Kaufmann, Dutch koopman, Swedish k\u00f6pman, Danish k\u00f8bmand, Icelandic kaupma\u00f0ur: in all these words, the first syllable comes ultimately from Latin caupo, \"tradesman\".) Copenhagen's Swedish name is K\u00f6penhamn, a direct translation of the mutually intelligible Danish name.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nAlthough the earliest historical records of Copenhagen are from the end of the 12th century, recent archaeological finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's Kongens Nytorv from c. 1020. Excavations in Pilestr\u00e6de have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the 11th century, have been unearthed near where Str\u00f8get meets R\u00e5dhuspladsen.\nThese finds indicate that Copenhagen's origins as a city go back at least to the 11th century. Substantial discoveries of flint tools in the area provide evidence of human settlements dating to the Stone Age. Many historians believe the town dates to the late Viking Age, and was possibly founded by Sweyn I Forkbeard. \nThe natural harbour and good herring stocks seem to have attracted fishermen and merchants to the area on a seasonal basis from the 11th century and more permanently in the 13th century. The first habitations were probably centred on Gammel Strand (literally \"old shore\") in the 11th century or even earlier.The earliest written mention of the town was in the 12th century when Saxo Grammaticus in Gesta Danorum referred to it as Portus Mercatorum, meaning Merchants' Harbour or, in the Danish of the time, K\u00f8bmannahavn. Traditionally, Copenhagen's founding has been dated to Bishop Absalon's construction of a modest fortress on the little island of Slotsholmen in 1167 where Christiansborg Palace stands today. The construction of the fortress was in response to attacks by Wendish pirates who plagued the coastline during the 12th century. Defensive ramparts and moats were completed and by 1177 St. Clemens Church had been built. Attacks by the Germans continued, and after the original fortress was eventually destroyed by the marauders, islanders replaced it with Copenhagen Castle.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nIn 1186, a letter from Pope Urban III states that the castle of Hafn (Copenhagen) and its surrounding lands, including the town of Hafn, were given to Absalon, Bishop of Roskilde 1158\u20131191 and Archbishop of Lund 1177\u20131201, by King Valdemar I. On Absalon's death, the property was to come into the ownership of the Bishopric of Roskilde. Around 1200, the Church of Our Lady was constructed on higher ground to the northeast of the town, which began to develop around it.As the town became more prominent, it was repeatedly attacked by the Hanseatic League, and in 1368 successfully invaded during the Second Danish-Hanseatic War. As the fishing industry thrived in Copenhagen, particularly in the trade of herring, the city began expanding to the north of Slotsholmen. In 1254, it received a charter as a city under Bishop Jakob Erlandsen who garnered support from the local fishing merchants against the king by granting them special privileges. In the mid 1330s, the first land assessment of the city was published.With the establishment of the Kalmar Union (1397\u20131523) between Denmark, Norway and Sweden, by about 1416 Copenhagen had emerged as the capital of Denmark when Eric of Pomerania moved his seat to Copenhagen Castle. The University of Copenhagen was inaugurated on 1 June 1479 by King Christian I, following approval from Pope Sixtus IV. This makes it the oldest university in Denmark and one of the oldest in Europe. Originally controlled by the Catholic Church, the university's role in society was forced to change during the Reformation in Denmark in the late 1530s.\n\n\n=== 16th and 17th centuries ===\n\nIn disputes prior to the Reformation of 1536, the city which had been faithful to Christian II, who was Catholic, was successfully besieged in 1523 by the forces of Frederik I, who supported Lutheranism. Copenhagen's defences were reinforced with a series of towers along the city wall. After an extended siege from July 1535 to July 1536, during which the city supported Christian II's alliance with Malm\u00f6 and L\u00fcbeck, it was finally forced to capitulate to Christian III. During the second half of the century, the city prospered from increased trade across the Baltic supported by Dutch shipping. Christoffer Valkendorff, a high-ranking statesman, defended the city's interests and contributed to its development. The Netherlands had also become primarily Protestant, as were northern German states.\nDuring the reign of Christian IV between 1588 and 1648, Copenhagen had dramatic growth as a city. On his initiative at the beginning of the 17th century, two important buildings were completed on Slotsholmen: the T\u00f8jhus Arsenal and B\u00f8rsen, the stock exchange. To foster international trade, the East India Company was founded in 1616. To the east of the city, inspired by Dutch planning, the king developed the district of Christianshavn with canals and ramparts. It was initially intended to be a fortified trading centre but ultimately became part of Copenhagen. Christian IV also sponsored an array of ambitious building projects including Rosenborg Slot and the Rundet\u00e5rn. In 1658\u201359, the city withstood a siege by the Swedes under Charles X and successfully repelled a major assault.By 1661, Copenhagen had asserted its position as capital of Denmark and Norway. All the major institutions were located there, as was the fleet and most of the army. The defences were further enhanced with the completion of the Citadel in 1664 and the extension of Christianshavns Vold with its bastions in 1692, leading to the creation of a new base for the fleet at Nyholm.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\n\nCopenhagen lost around 22,000 of its population of 65,000 to the plague in 1711. The city was also struck by two major fires which destroyed much of its infrastructure. The Copenhagen Fire of 1728 was the largest in the history of Copenhagen. It began on the evening of 20 October, and continued to burn until the morning of 23 October, destroying approximately 28% of the city, leaving some 20% of the population homeless. No less than 47% of the medieval section of the city was completely lost. Along with the 1795 fire, it is the main reason that few traces of the old town can be found in the modern city.A substantial amount of rebuilding followed. In 1733, work began on the royal residence of Christiansborg Palace which was completed in 1745. In 1749, development of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden was initiated. Designed by Nicolai Eigtved in the Rococo style, its centre contained the mansions which now form Amalienborg Palace. Major extensions to the naval base of Holmen were undertaken while the city's cultural importance was enhanced with the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts.In the second half of the 18th century, Copenhagen benefited from Denmark's neutrality during the wars between Europe's main powers, allowing it to play an important role in trade between the states around the Baltic Sea. After Christiansborg was destroyed by fire in 1794 and another fire caused serious damage to the city in 1795, work began on the classical Copenhagen landmark of H\u00f8jbro Plads while Nytorv and Gammel Torv were converged.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nOn 2 April 1801, a British fleet under the command of Admiral Sir Hyde Parker attacked and defeated the neutral Danish-Norwegian fleet anchored near Copenhagen. Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson led the main attack. He famously disobeyed Parker's order to withdraw, destroying many of the Dano-Norwegian ships before a truce was agreed. Copenhagen is often considered to be Nelson's hardest-fought battle, surpassing even the heavy fighting at Trafalgar. It was during this battle that Lord Nelson was said to have \"put the telescope to the blind eye\" in order not to see Admiral Parker's signal to cease fire.\n\nThe Second Battle of Copenhagen (or the Bombardment of Copenhagen) (16 August \u2013 5 September 1807) was from a British point of view a preemptive attack on Copenhagen, targeting the civilian population to yet again seize the Dano-Norwegian fleet. But from a Danish point of view the battle was a terror bombardment on their capital. Particularly notable was the use of incendiary Congreve rockets (containing phosphorus, which cannot be extinguished with water) that randomly hit the city. Few houses with straw roofs remained after the bombardment. The largest church, Vor frue kirke, was destroyed by the sea artillery. Several historians consider this battle the first terror attack against a major European city in modern times.\n\nThe British landed 30,000 men, they surrounded Copenhagen and the attack continued for the next three days, killing some 2,000 civilians and destroying most of the city. The devastation was so great because Copenhagen relied on an old defence-line whose limited range could not reach the British ships and their longer-range artillery.Despite the disasters of the early 19th century, Copenhagen experienced a period of intense cultural creativity known as the Danish Golden Age. Painting prospered under C.W. Eckersberg and his students while C.F. Hansen and Gottlieb Bindesb\u00f8ll brought a Neoclassical look to the city's architecture. In the early 1850s, the ramparts of the city were opened to allow new housing to be built around The Lakes (Danish: S\u00f8erne) that bordered the old defences to the west. By the 1880s, the districts of N\u00f8rrebro and Vesterbro developed to accommodate those who came from the provinces to participate in the city's industrialization. This dramatic increase of space was long overdue, as not only were the old ramparts out of date as a defence system but bad sanitation in the old city had to be overcome. From 1886, the west rampart (Vestvolden) was flattened, allowing major extensions to the harbour leading to the establishment of the Freeport of Copenhagen 1892\u201394. Electricity came in 1892 with electric trams in 1897. The spread of housing to areas outside the old ramparts brought about a huge increase in the population. In 1840, Copenhagen was inhabited by approximately 120,000 people. By 1901, it had some 400,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, Copenhagen had become a thriving industrial and administrative city. With its new city hall and railway station, its centre was drawn towards the west. New housing developments grew up in Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j and Valby while Frederiksberg became an enclave within the city of Copenhagen. The northern part of Amager and Valby were also incorporated into the City of Copenhagen in 1901\u201302.As a result of Denmark's neutrality in the First World War, Copenhagen prospered from trade with both Britain and Germany while the city's defences were kept fully manned by some 40,000 soldiers for the duration of the war.In the 1920s there were serious shortages of goods and housing. Plans were drawn up to demolish the old part of Christianshavn and to get rid of the worst of the city's slum areas. However, it was not until the 1930s that substantial housing developments ensued, with the demolition of one side of Christianhavn's Torvegade to build five large blocks of flats.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\n\nIn Denmark during World War II, Copenhagen was occupied by German troops along with the rest of the country from 9 April 1940 until 4 May 1945. German leader Adolf Hitler hoped that Denmark would be \"a model protectorate\" and initially the Nazi authorities sought to arrive at an understanding with the Danish government. The 1943 Danish parliamentary election was also allowed to take place, with only the Communist Party excluded. But in August 1943, after the government's collaboration with the occupation forces collapsed, several ships were sunk in Copenhagen Harbor by the Royal Danish Navy to prevent their use by the Germans. Around that time the Nazis started to arrest Jews, although most managed to escape to Sweden.In 1945 Ole Lippman, leader of the Danish section of the Special Operations Executive, invited the British Royal Air Force to assist their operations by attacking Nazi headquarters in Copenhagen. Accordingly, air vice-marshal Sir Basil Embry drew up plans for a spectacular precision attack on the Sicherheitsdienst and Gestapo building, the former offices of the Shell Oil Company. Political prisoners were kept in the attic to prevent an air raid, so the RAF had to bomb the lower levels of the building.The attack, known as \"Operation Carthage\", came on 22 March 1945, in three small waves. In the first wave, all six planes (carrying one bomb each) hit their target, but one of the aircraft crashed near Frederiksberg Girls School. Because of this crash, four of the planes in the two following waves assumed the school was the military target and aimed their bombs at the school, leading to the death of 123 civilians (of which 87 were schoolchildren). However, 18 of the 26 political prisoners in the Shell Building managed to escape while the Gestapo archives were completely destroyed.On 8 May 1945 Copenhagen was officially liberated by British troops commanded by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery who supervised the surrender of 30,000 Germans situated around the capital.\n\n\n==== Post-war decades ====\nShortly after the end of the war, an innovative urban development project known as the Finger Plan was introduced in 1947, encouraging the creation of new housing and businesses interspersed with large green areas along five \"fingers\" stretching out from the city centre along the S-train routes. With the expansion of the welfare state and women entering the work force, schools, nurseries, sports facilities and hospitals were established across the city. As a result of student unrest in the late 1960s, the former B\u00e5dsmandsstr\u00e6de Barracks in Christianshavn was occupied, leading to the establishment of Freetown Christiania in September 1971.Motor traffic in the city grew significantly and in 1972 the trams were replaced by buses. From the 1960s, on the initiative of the young architect Jan Gehl, pedestrian streets and cycle tracks were created in the city centre. Activity in the port of Copenhagen declined with the closure of the Holmen Naval Base. Copenhagen Airport underwent considerable expansion, becoming a hub for the Nordic countries. In the 1990s, large-scale housing developments were realized in the harbour area and in the west of Amager. The national library's Black Diamond building on the waterfront was completed in 1999.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nSince the summer of 2000, Copenhagen and the Swedish city of Malm\u00f6 have been connected by the \u00d8resund Bridge, which carries rail and road traffic. As a result, Copenhagen has become the centre of a larger metropolitan area spanning both nations. The bridge has brought about considerable changes in the public transport system and has led to the extensive redevelopment of Amager. The city's service and trade sectors have developed while a number of banking and financial institutions have been established. Educational institutions have also gained importance, especially the University of Copenhagen with its 35,000 students. Another important development for the city has been the Copenhagen Metro, the railway system which opened in 2002 with additions until 2007, transporting some 54 million passengers by 2011.On the cultural front, the Copenhagen Opera House, a gift to the city from the shipping magnate M\u00e6rsk Mc-Kinney M\u00f8ller on behalf of the A.P. M\u00f8ller foundation, was completed in 2004. In December 2009 Copenhagen gained international prominence when it hosted the worldwide climate meeting COP15.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCopenhagen is part of the \u00d8resund Region, which consists of Zealand, Lolland-Falster and Bornholm in Denmark and Scania in Sweden. It is located on the eastern shore of the island of Zealand, partly on the island of Amager and on a number of natural and artificial islets between the two. Copenhagen faces the \u00d8resund to the east, the strait of water that separates Denmark from Sweden, and which connects the North Sea with the Baltic Sea. The Swedish towns of Malm\u00f6 and Landskrona lie on the Swedish side of the sound directly across from Copenhagen. By road, Copenhagen is 42 kilometres (26 mi) northwest of Malm\u00f6, Sweden, 85 kilometres (53 mi) northeast of N\u00e6stved, 164 kilometres (102 mi) northeast of Odense, 295 kilometres (183 mi) east of Esbjerg and 188 kilometres (117 mi) southeast of Aarhus by sea and road via Sj\u00e6llands Odde.The city centre lies in the area originally defined by the old ramparts, which are still referred to as the Fortification Ring (F\u00e6stningsringen) and kept as a partial green band around it. Then come the late-19th- and early-20th-century residential neighbourhoods of \u00d8sterbro, N\u00f8rrebro, Vesterbro and Amagerbro. The outlying areas of Kongens Enghave, Valby, Vigerslev, Vanl\u00f8se, Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j, Utterslev and Sundby followed from 1920 to 1960. They consist mainly of residential housing and apartments often enhanced with parks and greenery.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nThe central area of the city consists of relatively low-lying flat ground formed by moraines from the last ice age while the hilly areas to the north and west frequently rise to 50 m (160 ft) above sea level. The slopes of Valby and Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j reach heights of over 30 m (98 ft), divided by valleys running from the northeast to the southwest. Close to the centre are the Copenhagen lakes of Sortedams S\u00f8, Peblinge S\u00f8 and Sankt J\u00f8rgens S\u00f8.Copenhagen rests on a subsoil of flint-layered limestone deposited in the Danian period some 60 to 66 million years ago. Some greensand from the Selandian is also present. There are a few faults in the area, the most important of which is the Carlsberg fault which runs northwest to southeast through the centre of the city. During the last ice age, glaciers eroded the surface leaving a layer of moraines up to 15 m (49 ft) thick.Geologically, Copenhagen lies in the northern part of Denmark where the land is rising because of post-glacial rebound.\n\n\n=== Beaches ===\n\nAmager Strandpark, which opened in 2005, is a 2 km (1 mi) long artificial island, with a total of 4.6 km (2.9 mi) of beaches. It is located just 15 minutes by bicycle or a few minutes by metro from the city centre. In Klampenborg, about 10 kilometers from downtown Copenhagen, is Bellevue Beach. It is 700 metres (2,300 ft) long and has both lifeguards and freshwater showers on the beach.The beaches are supplemented by a system of Harbour Baths along the Copenhagen waterfront. The first and most popular of these is located at Islands Brygge and has won international acclaim for its design.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nCopenhagen is in the oceanic climate zone (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb\u202f). Its weather is subject to low-pressure systems from the Atlantic which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Apart from slightly higher rainfall from July to September, precipitation is moderate. While snowfall occurs mainly from late December to early March, there can also be rain, with average temperatures around the freezing point.June is the sunniest month of the year with an average of about eight hours of sunshine a day. July is the warmest month with an average daytime high of 21 \u00b0C. By contrast, the average hours of sunshine are less than two per day in November and only one and a half per day from December to February. In the spring, it gets warmer again with four to six hours of sunshine per day from March to May. February is the driest month of the year. Exceptional weather conditions can bring as much as 50 cm of snow to Copenhagen in a 24-hour period during the winter months while summer temperatures have been known to rise to heights of 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F).Because of Copenhagen's northern latitude, the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight. There is therefore a difference of 10 hours and 31 minutes in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nAccording to Statistics Denmark, the urban area of Copenhagen (Hovedstadsomr\u00e5det) consists of the municipalities of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Albertslund, Br\u00f8ndby, Gentofte, Gladsaxe, Glostrup, Herlev, Hvidovre, Lyngby-Taarb\u00e6k, R\u00f8dovre, T\u00e5rnby and Vallensb\u00e6k as well as parts of Ballerup, Rudersdal and Fures\u00f8 municipalities, along with the cities of Ish\u00f8j and Greve Strand. They are located in the Capital Region (Region Hovedstaden). Municipalities are responsible for a wide variety of public services, which include land-use planning, environmental planning, public housing, management and maintenance of local roads, and social security. Municipal administration is also conducted by a mayor, a council, and an executive.Copenhagen Municipality is by far the largest municipality, with the historic city at its core. The seat of Copenhagen's municipal council is the Copenhagen City Hall (R\u00e5dhus), which is situated on City Hall Square. The second largest municipality is Frederiksberg, an enclave within Copenhagen Municipality.\nCopenhagen Municipality is divided into ten districts (bydele): Indre By, \u00d8sterbro, N\u00f8rrebro, Vesterbro/Kongens Enghave, Valby, Vanl\u00f8se, Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j-Husum, Bispebjerg, Amager \u00d8st, and Amager Vest. Neighbourhoods of Copenhagen include Slotsholmen, Frederiksstaden, Islands Brygge, Holmen, Christiania, Carlsberg, Sluseholmen, Sydhavn, Amagerbro, \u00d8restad, Nordhavnen, Bellah\u00f8j, Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j, Ryparken, and Vigerslev.\n\n\n=== Law and order ===\nMost of Denmark's top legal courts and institutions are based in Copenhagen. A modern style court of justice, Hof- og Stadsretten, was introduced in Denmark, specifically for Copenhagen, by Johann Friedrich Struensee in 1771. Now known as the City Court of Copenhagen (K\u00f8benhavns Byret), it is the largest of the 24 city courts in Denmark with jurisdiction over the municipalities of Copenhagen, Drag\u00f8r and T\u00e5rnby. With its 42 judges, it has a Probate Division, an Enforcement Division and a Registration and Notorial Acts Division while bankruptcy is handled by the Maritime and Commercial Court of Copenhagen. Established in 1862, the Maritime and Commercial Court (S\u00f8- og Handelsretten) also hears commercial cases including those relating to trade marks, marketing practices and competition for the whole of Denmark. Denmark's Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret), located in Christiansborg Palace on Prins J\u00f8rgens G\u00e5rd in the centre of Copenhagen, is the country's final court of appeal. Handling civil and criminal cases from the subordinate courts, it has two chambers which each hear all types of cases.The Danish National Police and Copenhagen Police headquarters is situated in the Neoclassical-inspired Politig\u00e5rden building built in 1918\u201324 under architects Hack Kampmann and Holger Alfred Jacobsen. The building also contains administration, management, emergency department and radio service offices. In their efforts to deal with drugs, the police have noted considerable success in the two special drug consumption rooms opened by the city where addicts can use sterile needles and receive help from nurses if necessary. Use of these rooms does not lead to prosecution; the city treats drug use as a public health issue, not a criminal one.The Copenhagen Fire Department forms the largest municipal fire brigade in Denmark with some 500 fire and ambulance personnel, 150 administration and service workers, and 35 workers in prevention. The brigade began as the Copenhagen Royal Fire Brigade on 9 July 1687 under King Christian V. After the passing of the Copenhagen Fire Act on 18 May 1868, on 1 August 1870 the Copenhagen Fire Brigade became a municipal institution in its own right. The fire department has its headquarters in the Copenhagen Central Fire Station which was designed by Ludvig Fenger in the Historicist style and inaugurated in 1892.\n\n\n=== Environmental planning ===\n\nCopenhagen is recognized as one of the most environmentally friendly cities in the world. As a result of its commitment to high environmental standards, Copenhagen has been praised for its green economy, ranked as the top green city for the second time in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index (GGEI). In 2001 a large offshore wind farm was built just off the coast of Copenhagen at Middelgrunden. It produces about 4% of the city's energy. Years of substantial investment in sewage treatment have improved water quality in the harbour to an extent that the inner harbour can be used for swimming with facilities at a number of locations.\n\nCopenhagen aims to be carbon-neutral by 2025. Commercial and residential buildings are to reduce electricity consumption by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively, and total heat consumption is to fall by 20 percent by 2025. Renewable energy features such as solar panels are becoming increasingly common in the newest buildings in Copenhagen. District heating will be carbon-neutral by 2025, by waste incineration and biomass. New buildings must now be constructed according to Low Energy Class ratings and in 2020 near net-zero energy buildings. By 2025, 75% of trips should be made on foot, by bike, or by using public transit. The city plans that 20\u201330% of cars will run on electricity or biofuel by 2025. The investment is estimated at $472 million public funds and $4.78 billion private funds.The city's urban planning authorities continue to take full account of these priorities. Special attention is given both to climate issues and efforts to ensure maximum application of low-energy standards. Priorities include sustainable drainage systems, recycling rainwater, green roofs and efficient waste management solutions. In city planning, streets and squares are to be designed to encourage cycling and walking rather than driving. Further, the city administration is working with smart city initiatives to improve how data and technology can be used to implement new solutions that support the transition toward a carbon-neutral economy. These solutions support operations covered by the city administration to improve e.g. public health, district heating, urban mobility and waste management systems. Smart city operations in Copenhagen are maintained by Copenhagen Solutions Lab, the city's official smart-city development unit under the Technical and Environmental Administration.\n\n\n== Demographics and society ==\n\nCopenhagen is the most populous city in Denmark and one of the most populous in the Nordic countries. For statistical purposes, Statistics Denmark considers the City of Copenhagen (Byen K\u00f8benhavn) to consist of the Municipality of Copenhagen plus three adjacent municipalities: Drag\u00f8r, Frederiksberg, and T\u00e5rnby. Their combined population stands at 763,908 (as of December 2016).The Municipality of Copenhagen is by far the most populous in the country and one of the most populous Nordic municipalities with 601,448 inhabitants (as of December 2016). There was a demographic boom in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, largely due to immigration to Denmark. According to figures from the first quarter of 2016, approximately 76% of the municipality's population was of Danish descent, defined as having at least one parent who was born in Denmark and has Danish citizenship. Much of the remaining 24% were of a foreign background, defined as immigrants (18%) or descendants of recent immigrants (6%). There are no official statistics on ethnic groups. The adjacent table shows the most common countries of birth of Copenhagen residents.\nAccording to Statistics Denmark, Copenhagen's urban area has a larger population of 1,280,371 (as of 1 January 2016). The urban area consists of the municipalities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg plus 16 of the 20 municipalities of the former counties Copenhagen and Roskilde, though five of them only partially. Metropolitan Copenhagen has a total of 2,016,285 inhabitants (as of 2016). The area of Metropolitan Copenhagen is defined by the Finger Plan. Since the opening of the \u00d8resund Bridge in 2000, commuting between Zealand and Scania in Sweden has increased rapidly, leading to a wider, integrated area. Known as the \u00d8resund Region, it has 3.8 million inhabitants (of whom 2.5 million live in the Danish part of the region).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nA majority (56.9%) of those living in Copenhagen are members of the Lutheran Church of Denmark which is 0.6% lower than one year earlier according to 2019 figures. The National Cathedral, the Church of Our Lady, is one of the dozens of churches in Copenhagen. There are also several other Christian communities in the city, of which the largest is Roman Catholic.Foreign migration to Copenhagen, rising over the last three decades, has contributed to increasing religious diversity; the Grand Mosque of Copenhagen, the first in Denmark, opened in 2014. Islam is the second largest religion in Copenhagen, accounting for approximately 10% of the population. While there are no official statistics, a significant portion of the estimated 175,000\u2013200,000 Muslims in the country live in the Copenhagen urban area, with the highest concentration in N\u00f8rrebro and the Vestegnen. There are also some 7,000 Jews in Denmark, most of them in the Copenhagen area where there are several synagogues. There is a long history of Jews in the city, and the first synagogue in Copenhagen was built in 1684. Today, the history of the Jews of Denmark can be explored at the Danish Jewish Museum in Copenhagen.\n\n\n=== Quality of living ===\nFor a number of years, Copenhagen has ranked high in international surveys for its quality of life. Its stable economy together with its education services and level of social safety make it attractive for locals and visitors alike. Although it is one of the world's most expensive cities, it is also one of the most liveable with its public transport, facilities for cyclists and its environmental policies. In elevating Copenhagen to \"most liveable city\" in 2013, Monocle pointed to its open spaces, increasing activity on the streets, city planning in favour of cyclists and pedestrians, and features to encourage inhabitants to enjoy city life with an emphasis on community, culture and cuisine. Other sources have ranked Copenhagen high for its business environment, accessibility, restaurants and environmental planning. However, Copenhagen ranks only 39th for student friendliness in 2012. Despite a top score for quality of living, its scores were low for employer activity and affordability.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nCopenhagen is the major economic and financial centre of Denmark. The city's economy is based largely on services and commerce. Statistics for 2010 show that the vast majority of the 350,000 workers in Copenhagen are employed in the service sector, especially transport and communications, trade, and finance, while less than 10,000 work in the manufacturing industries. The public sector workforce is around 110,000, including education and healthcare. From 2006 to 2011, the economy grew by 2.5% in Copenhagen, while it fell by some 4% in the rest of Denmark. In 2017, the wider Capital Region of Denmark had a gross domestic product (GDP) of \u20ac120 billion, and the 15th largest GDP per capita of regions in the European Union.\n\nSeveral financial institutions and banks have headquarters in Copenhagen, including Alm. Brand, Danske Bank, Nykredit and Nordea Bank Danmark. The Copenhagen Stock Exchange (CSE) was founded in 1620 and is now owned by Nasdaq, Inc.. Copenhagen is also home to a number of international companies including A.P. M\u00f8ller-M\u00e6rsk, Novo Nordisk, Carlsberg and Novozymes. City authorities have encouraged the development of business clusters in several innovative sectors, which include information technology, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, clean technology and smart city solutions.\n\nLife science is a key sector with extensive research and development activities. Medicon Valley is a leading bi-national life sciences cluster in Europe, spanning the \u00d8resund Region. Copenhagen is rich in companies and institutions with a focus on research and development within the field of biotechnology, and the Medicon Valley initiative aims to strengthen this position and to promote cooperation between companies and academia. Many major Danish companies like Novo Nordisk and Lundbeck, both of which are among the 50 largest pharmaceutical and biotech companies in the world, are located in this business cluster.Shipping is another import sector with Maersk, the world's largest shipping company, having their world headquarters in Copenhagen. The city has an industrial harbour, Copenhagen Port. Following decades of stagnation, it has experienced a resurgence since 1990 following a merger with Malm\u00f6 harbour. Both ports are operated by Copenhagen Malm\u00f6 Port (CMP). The central location in the \u00d8resund Region allows the ports to act as a hub for freight that is transported onward to the Baltic countries. CMP annually receives about 8,000 ships and handled some 148,000 TEU in 2012.Copenhagen has some of the highest gross wages in the world. High taxes mean that wages are reduced after mandatory deduction. A beneficial researcher scheme with low taxation of foreign specialists has made Denmark an attractive location for foreign labour. It is however also among the most expensive cities in Europe.Denmark's Flexicurity model features some of the most flexible hiring and firing legislation in Europe, providing attractive conditions for foreign investment and international companies looking to locate in Copenhagen. In Dansk Industri's 2013 survey of employment factors in the ninety-six municipalities of Denmark, Copenhagen came in first place for educational qualifications and for the development of private companies in recent years, but fell to 86th place in local companies' assessment of the employment climate. The survey revealed considerable dissatisfaction in the level of dialogue companies enjoyed with the municipal authorities.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism is a major contributor to Copenhagen's economy, attracting visitors due to the city's harbour, cultural attractions and award-winning restaurants. Since 2009, Copenhagen has been one of the fastest growing metropolitan destinations in Europe. Hotel capacity in the city is growing significantly. From 2009 to 2013, it experienced a 42% growth in international bed nights (total number of nights spent by tourists), tallying a rise of nearly 70% for Chinese visitors. The total number of bed nights in the Capital Region surpassed 9 million in 2013, while international bed nights reached 5 million.In 2010, it is estimated that city break tourism contributed to DKK 2 billion in turnover. However, 2010 was an exceptional year for city break tourism and turnover increased with 29% in that one year. 680,000 cruise passengers visited the port in 2015. In 2019 Copenhagen was ranked first among Lonely Planet's top ten cities to visit.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe city's appearance today is shaped by the key role it has played as a regional centre for centuries. Copenhagen has a multitude of districts, each with its distinctive character and representing its own period. Other distinctive features of Copenhagen include the abundance of water, its many parks, and the bicycle paths that line most streets.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe oldest section of Copenhagen's inner city is often referred to as Middelalderbyen (the medieval city). However, the city's most distinctive district is Frederiksstaden, developed during the reign of Frederick V. It has the Amalienborg Palace at its centre and is dominated by the dome of Frederik's Church (or the Marble Church) and several elegant 18th-century Rococo mansions. The inner city includes Slotsholmen, a little island on which Christiansborg Palace stands and Christianshavn with its canals. B\u00f8rsen on Slotsholmen and Frederiksborg Palace in Hiller\u00f8d are prominent examples of the Dutch Renaissance style in Copenhagen. Around the historical city centre lies a band of congenial residential boroughs (Vesterbro, Inner N\u00f8rrebro, Inner \u00d8sterbro) dating mainly from late 19th century. They were built outside the old ramparts when the city was finally allowed to expand beyond its fortifications.Sometimes referred to as \"the City of Spires\", Copenhagen is known for its horizontal skyline, broken only by the spires and towers of its churches and castles. Most characteristic of all is the Baroque spire of the Church of Our Saviour with its narrowing external spiral stairway that visitors can climb to the top. Other important spires are those of Christiansborg Palace, the City Hall and the former Church of St. Nikolaj that now houses a modern art venue. Not quite so high are the Renaissance spires of Rosenborg Castle and the \"dragon spire\" of Christian IV's former stock exchange, so named because it resembles the intertwined tails of four dragons.Copenhagen is recognised globally as an exemplar of best practice urban planning. Its thriving mixed use city centre is defined by striking contemporary architecture, engaging public spaces and an abundance of human activity. These design outcomes have been deliberately achieved through careful replanning in the second half of the 20th century.\nRecent years have seen a boom in modern architecture in Copenhagen both for Danish architecture and for works by international architects. For a few hundred years, virtually no foreign architects had worked in Copenhagen, but since the turn of the millennium the city and its immediate surroundings have seen buildings and projects designed by top international architects. British design magazine Monocle named Copenhagen the World's best design city 2008.Copenhagen's urban development in the first half of the 20th century was heavily influenced by industrialisation. After World War II, Copenhagen Municipality adopted Fordism and repurposed its medieval centre to facilitate private automobile infrastructure in response to innovations in transport, trade and communication. Copenhagen's spatial planning in this time frame was characterised by the separation of land uses: an approach which requires residents to travel by car to access facilities of different uses.The boom in urban development and modern architecture has brought some changes to the city's skyline. A political majority has decided to keep the historical centre free of high-rise buildings, but several areas will see or have already seen massive urban development. \u00d8restad now has seen most of the recent development. Located near Copenhagen Airport, it currently boasts one of the largest malls in Scandinavia and a variety of office and residential buildings as well as the IT University and a high school.\n\n\n=== Parks, gardens and zoo ===\n\nCopenhagen is a green city with many parks, both large and small. King's Garden (Kongens Have), the garden of Rosenborg Castle, is the oldest and most frequented of them all. It was Christian IV who first developed its landscaping in 1606. Every year it sees more than 2.5 million visitors and in the summer months it is packed with sunbathers, picnickers and ballplayers. It serves as a sculpture garden with both a permanent display and temporary exhibits during the summer months. Also located in the city centre are the Botanical Gardens noted for their large complex of 19th-century greenhouses donated by Carlsberg founder J. C. Jacobsen. F\u00e6lledparken at 58 ha (140 acres) is the largest park in Copenhagen.It is popular for sports fixtures and hosts several annual events including a free opera concert at the opening of the opera season, other open-air concerts, carnival and Labour Day celebrations, and the Copenhagen Historic Grand Prix, a race for antique cars. A historical green space in the northeastern part of the city is Kastellet, a well-preserved Renaissance citadel that now serves mainly as a park. Another popular park is the Frederiksberg Gardens, a 32-hectare romantic landscape park. It houses a colony of tame grey herons and other waterfowl. The park offers views of the elephants and the elephant house designed by world-famous British architect Norman Foster of the adjacent Copenhagen Zoo. Langelinie, a park and promenade along the inner \u00d8resund coast, is home to one of Copenhagen's most-visited tourist attractions, the Little Mermaid statue.In Copenhagen, many cemeteries double as parks, though only for the more quiet activities such as sunbathing, reading and meditation. Assistens Cemetery, the burial place of Hans Christian Andersen, is an important green space for the district of Inner N\u00f8rrebro and a Copenhagen institution. The lesser known Vestre Kirkegaard is the largest cemetery in Denmark (54 ha (130 acres)) and offers a maze of dense groves, open lawns, winding paths, hedges, overgrown tombs, monuments, tree-lined avenues, lakes and other garden features.It is official municipal policy in Copenhagen that by 2015 all citizens must be able to reach a park or beach on foot in less than 15 minutes. In line with this policy, several new parks, including the innovative Superkilen in the N\u00f8rrebro district, have been completed or are under development in areas lacking green spaces.\n\n\n=== Landmarks by district ===\n\n\n==== Indre By ====\nThe historic centre of the city, Indre By or the Inner City, features many of Copenhagen's most popular monuments and attractions. The area known as Frederiksstaden, developed by Frederik V in the second half of the 18th century in the Rococo style, has the four mansions of Amalienborg, the royal residence, and the wide-domed Marble Church at its centre. Directly across the water from Amalienborg, the recently completed Copenhagen Opera stands on the island of Holmen. To the south of Frederiksstaden, the Nyhavn canal is lined with colourful houses from the 17th and 18th centuries, many now with lively restaurants and bars. The canal runs from the harbour front to the spacious square of Kongens Nytorv which was laid out by Christian V in 1670. Important buildings include Charlottenborg Palace, famous for its art exhibitions, the Thott Palace (now the French embassy), the Royal Danish Theatre and the Hotel D'Angleterre, dated to 1755. Other landmarks in Indre By include the parliament building of Christiansborg, the City Hall and Rundet\u00e5rn, originally an observatory. There are also several museums in the area including Thorvaldsen Museum dedicated to the 18th-century sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. Closed to traffic since 1964, Str\u00f8get, the world's oldest and longest pedestrian street, runs the 3.2 km (2.0 mi) from R\u00e5dhuspladsen to Kongens Nytorv. With its speciality shops, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, and buskers, it is always full of life and includes the old squares of Gammel Torv and Amagertorv, each with a fountain. Rosenborg Castle on \u00d8ster Voldgade was built by Christian IV in 1606 as a summer residence in the Renaissance style. It houses the Danish crown jewels and crown regalia, the coronation throne and tapestries illustrating Christian V's victories in the Scanian War.\n\n\n==== Christianshavn ====\n\nChristianshavn lies to the southeast of Indre By on the other side of the harbour. The area was developed by Christian IV in the early 17th century. Impressed by the city of Amsterdam, he employed Dutch architects to create canals within its ramparts which are still well preserved today. The canals themselves, branching off the central Christianshavn Canal and lined with house boats and pleasure craft are one of the area's attractions. Another interesting feature is Freetown Christiania, a fairly large area which was initially occupied by squatters during student unrest in 1971. Today it still maintains a measure of autonomy. The inhabitants openly sell drugs on \"Pusher Street\" as well as their arts and crafts. Other buildings of interest in Christianshavn include the Church of Our Saviour with its spiralling steeple and the magnificent Rococo Christian's Church. Once a warehouse, the North Atlantic House now displays culture from Iceland and Greenland and houses the Noma restaurant, known for its Nordic cuisine.\n\n\n==== Vesterbro ====\n\nVesterbro, to the southwest of Indre By, begins with the Tivoli Gardens, the city's top tourist attraction with its fairground atmosphere, its Pantomime Theatre, its Concert Hall and its many rides and restaurants. The Carlsberg neighbourhood has some interesting vestiges of the old brewery of the same name including the Elephant Gate and the Ny Carlsberg Brewhouse. The Tycho Brahe Planetarium is located on the edge of Skt. J\u00f8rgens S\u00f8, one of the Copenhagen lakes. Halmtorvet, the old haymarket behind the Central Station, is an increasingly popular area with its caf\u00e9s and restaurants. The former cattle market \u00d8ksnehallen has been converted into a modern exhibition centre for art and photography. Radisson Blu Royal Hotel, built by Danish architect and designer Arne Jacobsen for the airline Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) between 1956 and 1960 was once the tallest hotel in Denmark with a height of 69.60 m (228.3 ft) and the city's only skyscraper until 1969. Completed in 1908, Det Ny Teater (the New Theatre) located in a passage between Vesterbrogade and Gammel Kongevej has become a popular venue for musicals since its reopening in 1994, attracting the largest audiences in the country.\n\n\n==== N\u00f8rrebro ====\n\nN\u00f8rrebro to the northwest of the city centre has recently developed from a working-class district into a colourful cosmopolitan area with antique shops, non-Danish food stores and restaurants. Much of the activity is centred on Sankt Hans Torv and around Rantzausgade. Copenhagen's historic cemetery, Assistens Kirkeg\u00e5rd halfway up N\u00f8rrebrogade, is the resting place of many famous figures including S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Niels Bohr, and Hans Christian Andersen but is also used by locals as a park and recreation area.\n\n\n==== \u00d8sterbro ====\n\nJust north of the city centre, \u00d8sterbro is an upper middle-class district with a number of fine mansions, some now serving as embassies. The district stretches from N\u00f8rrebro to the waterfront where The Little Mermaid statue can be seen from the promenade known as Langelinie. Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, it was created by Edvard Eriksen and unveiled in 1913. Not far from the Little Mermaid, the old Citadel (Kastellet) can be seen. Built by Christian IV, it is one of northern Europe's best preserved fortifications. There is also a windmill in the area. The large Gefion Fountain (Gefionspringvandet) designed by Anders Bundgaard and completed in 1908 stands close to the southeast corner of Kastellet. Its figures illustrate a Nordic legend.\n\n\n==== Frederiksberg ====\n\nFrederiksberg, a separate municipality within the urban area of Copenhagen, lies to the west of N\u00f8rrebro and Indre By and north of Vesterbro. Its landmarks include Copenhagen Zoo founded in 1869 with over 250 species from all over the world and Frederiksberg Palace built as a summer residence by Frederick IV who was inspired by Italian architecture. Now a military academy, it overlooks the extensive landscaped Frederiksberg Gardens with its follies, waterfalls, lakes and decorative buildings. The wide tree-lined avenue of Frederiksberg All\u00e9 connecting Vesterbrogade with the Frederiksberg Gardens has long been associated with theatres and entertainment. While a number of the earlier theatres are now closed, the Betty Nansen Theatre and Aveny-T are still active.\n\n\n==== Amagerbro ====\nAmagerbro (also known as S\u00f8nderbro) is the district located immediately south-east of Christianshavn at northernmost Amager. The old city moats and their surrounding parks constitute a clear border between these districts. The main street is Amagerbrogade which after the harbour bridge Langebro, is an extension of H. C. Andersens Boulevard and has a number of various stores and shops as well as restaurants and pubs. Amagerbro was built up during the two first decades of the twentieth century and is the city's northernmost block built area with typically 4\u20137 floors. Further south follows the Sundby\u00f8ster and Sundbyvester districts.\n\n\n==== Hellerup ====\n\nHellerup is the city's northernmost district with a central city feeling. It's located north of \u00d8sterbro and is known to be the perhaps most fashionable part of Copenhagen. Along Strandvejen (a street and further north a road leading to Elsinore) various shops, stores and restaurants are located. And by its crossing streets plenty of large villas are found. Hellerup is not a part of Copenhagen municipality, but constitutes the eastern parts of Gentofte. Hellerup is nevertheless a typical city environment without any notable bound towards the south.\n\n\n==== Other districts ====\nNot far from Copenhagen Airport on the Kastrup coast, The Blue Planet completed in March 2013 now houses the national aquarium. With its 53 aquariums, it is the largest facility of its kind in Scandinavia. Grundtvig's Church, located in the northern suburb of Bispebjerg, was designed by P.V. Jensen Klint and completed in 1940. A rare example of Expressionist church architecture, its striking west fa\u00e7ade is reminiscent of a church organ.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nApart from being the national capital, Copenhagen also serves as the cultural hub of Denmark and wider Scandinavia. Since the late 1990s, it has undergone a transformation from a modest Scandinavian capital into a metropolitan city of international appeal in the same league as Barcelona and Amsterdam. This is a result of huge investments in infrastructure and culture as well as the work of successful new Danish architects, designers and chefs. Copenhagen Fashion Week, the largest fashion event in Northern Europe, takes place every year in February and August.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nCopenhagen has a wide array of museums of international standing. The National Museum, Nationalmuseet, is Denmark's largest museum of archaeology and cultural history, comprising the histories of Danish and foreign cultures alike. Denmark's National Gallery (Statens Museum for Kunst) is the national art museum with collections dating from the 12th century to the present. In addition to Danish painters, artists represented in the collections include Rubens, Rembrandt, Picasso, Braque, L\u00e9ger, Matisse, Emil Nolde, Olafur Eliasson, Elmgreen and Dragset, Superflex and Jens Haaning.\n\nAnother important Copenhagen art museum is the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek founded by second generation Carlsberg philanthropist Carl Jacobsen and built around his personal collections. Its main focus is classical Egyptian, Roman and Greek sculptures and antiquities and a collection of Rodin sculptures, the largest outside France. Besides its sculpture collections, the museum also holds a comprehensive collection of paintings of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painters such as Monet, Renoir, C\u00e9zanne, van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec as well as works by the Danish Golden Age painters.Louisiana is a Museum of Modern Art situated on the coast just north of Copenhagen. It is located in the middle of a sculpture garden on a cliff overlooking \u00d8resund. Its collection of over 3,000 items includes works by Picasso, Giacometti and Dubuffet. The Danish Design Museum is housed in the 18th-century former Frederiks Hospital and displays Danish design as well as international design and crafts.Other museums include: the Thorvaldsens Museum, dedicated to the oeuvre of romantic Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen who lived and worked in Rome; the Cisternerne museum, an exhibition space for contemporary art, located in former cisterns that come complete with stalactites formed by the changing water levels; and the Ordrupgaard Museum, located just north of Copenhagen, which features 19th-century French and Danish art and is noted for its works by Paul Gauguin.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\n\nThe new Copenhagen Concert Hall opened in January 2009. Designed by Jean Nouvel, it has four halls with the main auditorium seating 1,800 people. It serves as the home of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra and along with the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles is the most expensive concert hall ever built. Another important venue for classical music is the Tivoli Concert Hall located in the Tivoli Gardens. Designed by Henning Larsen, the Copenhagen Opera House (Operaen) opened in 2005. It is among the most modern opera houses in the world. The Royal Danish Theatre also stages opera in addition to its drama productions. It is also home to the Royal Danish Ballet. Founded in 1748 along with the theatre, it is one of the oldest ballet troupes in Europe, and is noted for its Bournonville style of ballet.\n\nCopenhagen has a significant jazz scene that has existed for many years. It developed when a number of American jazz musicians such as Ben Webster, Thad Jones, Richard Boone, Ernie Wilkins, Kenny Drew, Ed Thigpen, Bob Rockwell, Dexter Gordon, and others such as rock guitarist Link Wray came to live in Copenhagen during the 1960s. Every year in early July, Copenhagen's streets, squares, parks as well as caf\u00e9s and concert halls fill up with big and small jazz concerts during the Copenhagen Jazz Festival. One of Europe's top jazz festivals, the annual event features around 900 concerts at 100 venues with over 200,000 guests from Denmark and around the world.The largest venue for popular music in Copenhagen is Vega in the Vesterbro district. It was chosen as \"best concert venue in Europe\" by international music magazine Live. The venue has three concert halls: the great hall, Store Vega, accommodates audiences of 1,550, the middle hall, Lille Vega, has space for 500 and Ideal Bar Live has a capacity of 250. Every September since 2006, the Festival of Endless Gratitude (FOEG) has taken place in Copenhagen. This festival focuses on indie counterculture, experimental pop music and left field music combined with visual arts exhibitions.Copenhagen is home to the \"K-Town\" punk and hardcore music community. This community developed around the underground scene venue Ungdomshuset in the late 1990s punk scene, with punk- and hardcore acts such as Snipers, Amdi Petersens Arm\u00e9, Gorilla Angreb, Young Wasteners, and No Hope for the Kids emerging as significant bands. The term \"K-town\" got international recognition within the punk-scene with the emergence of \"K-Town\" festivals. In 2001, the first of these was held in Ungdomshuset, on Jagtvej 69, N\u00f8rrebro, Copenhagen. The festival temporarily moved to Freetown Christiania after Ungdomshuset was evicted from its original location until a new Ungdomshuset location was opened on Dortheavej 61.For free entertainment one can stroll along Str\u00f8get, especially between Nytorv and H\u00f8jbro Plads, which in the late afternoon and evening is a bit like an impromptu three-ring circus with musicians, magicians, jugglers and other street performers.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nMost of Denmarks's major publishing houses are based in Copenhagen. These include the book publishers Gyldendal and Akademisk Forlag and newspaper publishers Berlingske and Politiken (the latter also publishing books). Many of the most important contributors to Danish literature such as Hans Christian Andersen (1805\u20131875) with his fairy tales, the philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813\u20131855) and playwright Ludvig Holberg (1684\u20131754) spent much of their lives in Copenhagen. Novels set in Copenhagen include Baby (1973) by Kirsten Thorup, The Copenhagen Connection (1982) by Barbara Mertz, Number the Stars (1989) by Lois Lowry, Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow (1992) and Borderliners (1993) by Peter H\u00f8eg, Music and Silence (1999) by Rose Tremain, The Danish Girl (2000) by David Ebershoff, and Sharpe's Prey (2001) by Bernard Cornwell. Michael Frayn's 1998 play Copenhagen about the meeting between the physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in 1941 is also set in the city. On 15\u201318 August 1973, an oral literature conference took place in Copenhagen as part of the 9th International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences.The Royal Library, belonging to the University of Copenhagen, is the largest library in the Nordic countries with an almost complete collection of all printed Danish books since 1482. Founded in 1648, the Royal Library is located at four sites in the city, the main one being on the Slotsholmen waterfront. Copenhagen's public library network has over 20 outlets, the largest being the Central Library (K\u00f8benhavns Hovedbibliotek) on Krystalgade in the inner city.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nCopenhagen has a wide selection of art museums and galleries displaying both historic works and more modern contributions. They include Statens Museum for Kunst, i.e. the Danish national art gallery, in the \u00d8stre Anl\u00e6g park, and the adjacent Hirschsprung Collection specialising in the 19th and early 20th century. Kunsthal Charlottenborg in the city centre exhibits national and international contemporary art. Den Frie Udstilling near the \u00d8sterport Station exhibits paintings created and selected by contemporary artists themselves rather than by the official authorities. The Arken Museum of Modern Art is located in southwestern Ish\u00f8j. Among artists who have painted scenes of Copenhagen are Martinus R\u00f8rbye (1803\u20131848), Christen K\u00f8bke (1810\u20131848) and the prolific Paul Gustav Fischer (1860\u20131934).A number of notable sculptures can be seen in the city. In addition to The Little Mermaid on the waterfront, there are two historic equestrian statues in the city centre: Jacques Saly's Frederik V on Horseback (1771) in Amalienborg Square and the statue of Christian V on Kongens Nytorv created by Abraham-C\u00e9sar Lamoureux in 1688 who was inspired by the statue of Louis XIII in Paris. Rosenborg Castle Gardens contains several sculptures and monuments including August Saabye's Hans Christian Andersen, Aksel Hansen's Echo, and Vilhelm Bissen's Dowager Queen Caroline Amalie.Copenhagen is believed to have invented the photomarathon photography competition, which has been held in the City each year since 1989.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nAs of 2014, Copenhagen has 15 Michelin-starred restaurants, the most of any Scandinavian city. The city is increasingly recognized internationally as a gourmet destination. These include Den R\u00f8de Cottage, Formel B Restaurant, Gr\u00f8nbech & Churchill, S\u00f8ller\u00f8d Kro, Kadeau, Kiin Kiin (Denmark's first Michelin-starred Asian gourmet restaurant), the French restaurant Kong Hans K\u00e6lder, Rel\u00e6, Restaurant AOC, Noma (short for Danish: nordisk mad, English: Nordic food) with two Stars and Geranium with three. Noma, was ranked as the Best Restaurant in the World by Restaurant in 2010, 2011, 2012, and again in 2014, sparking interest in the New Nordic Cuisine.Apart from the selection of upmarket restaurants, Copenhagen offers a great variety of Danish, ethnic and experimental restaurants. It is possible to find modest eateries serving open sandwiches, known as sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d \u2013 a traditional, Danish lunch dish; however, most restaurants serve international dishes. Danish pastry can be sampled from any of numerous bakeries found in all parts of the city. The Copenhagen Baker's Association dates back to the 1290s and Denmark's oldest confectioner's shop still operating, Conditori La Glace, was founded in 1870 in Skoubogade by Nicolaus Henningsen, a trained master baker from Flensburg.Copenhagen has long been associated with beer. Carlsberg beer has been brewed at the brewery's premises on the border between the Vesterbro and Valby districts since 1847 and has long been almost synonymous with Danish beer production. However, recent years have seen an explosive growth in the number of microbreweries so that Denmark today has more than 100 breweries, many of which are located in Copenhagen. Some like N\u00f8rrebro Bryghus also act as brewpubs where it is also possible to eat on the premises.\n\n\n=== Nightlife and festivals ===\n\nCopenhagen has one of the highest number of restaurants and bars per capita in the world. The nightclubs and bars stay open until 5 or 6 in the morning, some even longer. Denmark has a very liberal alcohol culture and a strong tradition for beer breweries, although binge drinking is frowned upon and the Danish Police take driving under the influence very seriously. Inner city areas such as Istedgade and Enghave Plads in Vesterbro, Sankt Hans Torv in N\u00f8rrebro and certain places in Frederiksberg are especially noted for their nightlife. Notable nightclubs include Bakken Kbh, ARCH (previously ZEN), Jolene, The Jane, Chateau Motel, KB3, At Dolores (previously Sunday Club), Rust, Vega Nightclub, Culture Box and Gef\u00e4hrlich, which also serves as a bar, caf\u00e9, restaurant, and art gallery.Copenhagen has several recurring community festivals, mainly in the summer. Copenhagen Carnival has taken place every year since 1982 during the Whitsun Holiday in F\u00e6lledparken and around the city with the participation of 120 bands, 2,000 dancers and 100,000 spectators. Since 2010, the old B&W Shipyard at Refshale\u00f8en in the harbour has been the location for Copenhell, a heavy metal rock music festival. Copenhagen Pride is a gay pride festival taking place every year in August. The Pride has a series of different activities all over Copenhagen, but it is at the City Hall Square that most of the celebration takes place. During the Pride the square is renamed Pride Square. Copenhagen Distortion has emerged to be one of the biggest street festivals in Europe with 100,000 people joining to parties in the beginning of June every year.\n\n\n=== Amusement parks ===\n\nCopenhagen has the two oldest amusement parks in the world.Dyrehavsbakken, a fair-ground and pleasure-park established in 1583, is located in Klampenborg just north of Copenhagen in a forested area known as Dyrehaven. Created as an amusement park complete with rides, games and restaurants by Christian IV, it is the oldest surviving amusement park in the world. Pierrot (Danish: Pjerrot), a nitwit dressed in white with a scarlet grin wearing a boat-like hat while entertaining children, remains one of the park's key attractions. In Danish, Dyrehavsbakken is often abbreviated as Bakken. There is no entrance fee to pay and Klampenborg Station on the C-line, is situated nearby.The Tivoli Gardens is an amusement park and pleasure garden located in central Copenhagen between the City Hall Square and the Central Station. It opened in 1843, making it the second oldest amusement park in the world. Among its rides are the oldest still operating rollercoaster Rutschebanen from 1915 and the oldest ferris wheel still in use, opened in 1943. Tivoli Gardens also serves as a venue for various performing arts and as an active part of the cultural scene in Copenhagen.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nCopenhagen has over 94,000 students enrolled in its largest universities and institutions: University of Copenhagen (38,867 students), Copenhagen Business School (19,999 students), Metropolitan University College and University College Capital (10,000 students each), Technical University of Denmark (7,000 students), KEA (c. 4,500 students), IT University of Copenhagen (2,000 students) and Aalborg University \u2013 Copenhagen (2,300 students).The University of Copenhagen is Denmark's oldest university founded in 1479. It attracts some 1,500 international and exchange students every year. The Academic Ranking of World Universities placed it 30th in the world in 2016.The Technical University of Denmark is located in Lyngby in the northern outskirts of Copenhagen. In 2013, it was ranked as one of the leading technical universities in Northern Europe. The IT University is Denmark's youngest university, a mono-faculty institution focusing on technical, societal and business aspects of information technology.The Danish Academy of Fine Arts has provided education in the arts for more than 250 years. It includes the historic School of Visual Arts, and has in later years come to include a School of Architecture, a School of Design and a School of Conservation. Copenhagen Business School (CBS) is an EQUIS-accredited business school located in Frederiksberg.\nThere are also branches of both University College Capital and Metropolitan University College inside and outside Copenhagen.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nThe city has a variety of sporting teams. The major football teams are the historically successful FC K\u00f8benhavn and Br\u00f8ndby. FC K\u00f8benhavn plays at Parken in \u00d8sterbro. Formed in 1992, it is a merger of two older Copenhagen clubs, B 1903 (from the inner suburb Gentofte) and KB (from Frederiksberg). Br\u00f8ndby plays at Br\u00f8ndby Stadion in the inner suburb of Br\u00f8ndbyvester. BK Frem is based in the southern part of Copenhagen (Sydhavnen, Valby). Other teams are FC Nordsj\u00e6lland (from suburban Farum), Fremad Amager, B93, AB, Lyngby and Hvidovre IF.\n\nCopenhagen has several handball teams\u2014a sport which is particularly popular in Denmark. Of clubs playing in the \"highest\" leagues, there are Ajax, Ydun, and HIK (Hellerup). The K\u00f8benhavn H\u00e5ndbold women's club has recently been established. Copenhagen also has ice hockey teams, of which three play in the top league, R\u00f8dovre Mighty Bulls, Herlev Eagles and Hvidovre Ligahockey all inner suburban clubs. Copenhagen Ice Skating Club founded in 1869 is the oldest ice hockey team in Denmark but is no longer in the top league.Rugby union is also played in the Danish capital with teams such as CSR-Nanok, Copenhagen Business School Sport Rugby, Frederiksberg RK, Exiles RUFC and Rugbyklubben Speed. Rugby league is now played in Copenhagen, with the national team playing out of Gentofte Stadion. The Danish Australian Football League, based in Copenhagen is the largest Australian rules football competition outside of the English-speaking world.Copenhagen Marathon, Copenhagen's annual marathon event, was established in 1980.Round Christiansborg Open Water Swim Race is a 2-kilometre (1.2-mile) open water swimming competition taking place each year in late August. This amateur event is combined with a 10-kilometre (6-mile) Danish championship. In 2009 the event included a 10-kilometre (6-mile) FINA World Cup competition in the morning. Copenhagen hosted the 2011 UCI Road World Championships in September 2011, taking advantage of its bicycle-friendly infrastructure. It was the first time that Denmark had hosted the event since 1956, when it was also held in Copenhagen.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nThe greater Copenhagen area has a very well established transportation infrastructure making it a hub in Northern Europe. Copenhagen Airport, opened in 1925, is Scandinavia's largest airport, located in Kastrup on the island of Amager. It is connected to the city centre by metro and main line railway services. October 2013 was a record month with 2.2 million passengers, and November 2013 figures reveal that the number of passengers is increasing by some 3% annually, about 50% more than the European average.\n\n\n=== Road, rail and ferry ===\nCopenhagen has an extensive road network including motorways connecting the city to other parts of Denmark and to Sweden over the \u00d8resund Bridge. The car is still the most popular form of transport within the city itself, representing two-thirds of all distances travelled. This can however lead to serious congestion in rush hour traffic. The \u00d8resund train links Copenhagen with Malm\u00f6  24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \nCopenhagen is also served by a daily ferry connection to Oslo in Norway. In 2012, Copenhagen Harbour handled 372 cruise ships and 840,000 passengers.The Copenhagen S-Train, Copenhagen Metro and the regional train networks are used by about half of the city's passengers, the remainder using bus services. N\u00f8rreport Station near the city centre serves passengers travelling by main-line rail, S-train, regional train, metro and bus. Some 750,000 passengers make use of public transport facilities every day. Copenhagen Central Station is the hub of the DSB railway network serving Denmark and international destinations.The Copenhagen Metro expanded radically with the opening of the City Circle Line (M3) on September 29, 2019. The new line connects all inner boroughs of the city by metro, including the Central Station, and opens up 17 new stations for Copenhageners. On March 28, 2020, the 2.2 km (1.4 mi) Nordhavn extension of the Harbour Line (M4) opened. Running from Copenhagen Central Station, the new extension is a branch line of M3 Cityring to Osterport. The M4 Sydhavn branch is expected to open in 2024. The new metro lines are part of the city's strategy to transform mobility towards sustainable modes of transport such as public transport and cycling as opposed to automobility.Copenhagen is cited by urban planners for its exemplary integration of public transport and urban development. In implementing its Finger Plan, Copenhagen is considered the world's first example of a transit metropolis, and areas around S-Train stations like Ballerup and Br\u00f8ndby Strand are among the earliest examples of transit-oriented development.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\n\nCopenhaden has been rated as the most bicycle-friendly city in the world since 2015, with bicycles outnumbering its inhabitants.

          "Beautiful place and they give free entrance to top of the building. Yes with elevator. Perfect place to see city from some heights. Just be ready to stand in a long queue. It\u2019s worth. Go early in morning and you will get less people in \u2026",

We spent most of the day here..unfortunately the stables downstairs were empty because the horses were away on summer holiday. Not over priced and plenty to see.",

          "Beautiful palace and beautiful square in front of it for a night/dawn stroll. The view of the river next to it and the light during the night I think represents the real essence of what Copenhagen city is. It's a stop that everyone visiting Copenhagen should do at least once.",
          "Must to go when in Copenhagen. You can visit 4 places by one ticket: ruins, palace, kitchen and stable.\n\nYou can learn the history of Copenhagen in \"ruins\" and find the beautiful decoration in palace. I didn't go to stable, since the smell was so bad....... I couldn't stand it",

Well lit, sumptuous, spacious there was plenty of room for everyone without feeling you are stepping on each other. One of the highlights of my trip!",
          "The palace stands and looks sublime. It has  royal reception rooms, kitchen and ruins under it. The stable is also looks good but pales in comparison to some others. There is also the parliament and theatres. The one  point deducted is due the same reason as with other buildings in Copenhagen, i.e. ticket price is high.",
          "It\u2019s absolutely beautiful place n nice backgrounds",
          "Royal reception rooms are really exquisite, the rest of the areas are ho hum. The elegance of the interiors of the royal apartments of this palace are unmatched in this area and a must see. Each room is tastefully done and the staircase, \u2026",

          "In the ruins: Fantastic telling of the castle's history, with miniature editions of the former castles and great stories of how Copenhagen became. In the castle: great look into what a modern constitutional monarchy looks like. You can easily spend most of your day here.",
          "Located near the canal System and next to Thorvaldsens Museum, Christiansborg was impossible for us to miss. With Baroque styled architecture constructions, this Palace is impressive indeed. While there are many photos of the Palace online already, I am Uploading a picture of its showground.",

          "Beautiful view. Visit the tower and enjoy the view of Copenhagen. The restaurant at the top is quite good.",
          "The palace is amazing. Make sure you visit the queen's residence. The stables were disappointing as there was no horse. Only carriages. The kitchen was nice but nothing interesting. The ruins or underground was average too but the history was explained nicely. Only the queen's residence is a must if you are short of time",

          "Nice view from the top - for free!",

          "Truly beautiful, immaculate in every way. A must  see palace for every visitor to Copenhagen. The carpet style tapestries and the fairytale library (looks like it came straight out of a Beauty and the Beast film) make it worth the entrance price itself",
          "The place is alright, interesting objects to sort of explore and spin your tail around but the price to visit the museum is sort of expensive and you have to also pay for your own locker as large bags are not allowed although you do get \u2026",

          "Phenomenal palace! The luxury shown in here is incredible. This is a great stop in Copenhagen",
          "A little grey to be honest. There are many lovely Castles in  Denmark, this one seemed a bit dull.  I only saw outside as it is a working building with the politicians, etc being here. Maybe inside is better.",

          "Ok, never been a fan of Royal Houses. But this was well worth it. To see such a great palace and also the ruins from early middle ages, was an experience. You will have to wear show covers.",
          "Spectacular place and a living residence for the Danish Royal Family. Very near to Frederik's Cathedral which has a stunning interior including a domed ceiling.",
          "History buffs will really enjoy this wonderful place. Full of r\u00f3yal artifacts, really seeing it closely will take more than a couple of days. As a tourist, I could give it only an hour. But what an hour!",

          "A not very long street (about 300m) that connects two squares: Stortorget and Gustav Adolfs Torg. On both sides, mainly old buildings, with nice architecture and a couple of new ones,all of them housing at ground floor a lot of expensive shops. At the end of Stortorget there is",
          "Window shopping in Malmo is very pleasant and relaxed. The squares are generally large and there are some interesting old pharmacies as well as street sculptures. Try and look around the quiet and historic back streets for more genuine city life.",

        "wiki": "Copenhagen (Danish: K\u00f8benhavn [k\u02b0\u00f8pm\u0329\u02c8h\u0251w\u02c0n] (listen)) is the capital and most populous city of Denmark. As of 1 January 2020, the city had a population of 794,128 with 632,340 in Copenhagen Municipality, 104,305 in Frederiksberg Municipality, 42,989 in T\u00e5rnby Municipality, and 14,494 in Drag\u00f8r Municipality. It forms the core of the wider urban area of Copenhagen (population 1,330,993) and the Copenhagen metropolitan area (population 2,057,142). Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of Zealand; another small portion of the city is located on Amager, and it is separated from Malm\u00f6, Sweden, by the strait of \u00d8resund. The \u00d8resund Bridge connects the two cities by rail and road.\nOriginally a Viking fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now Gammel Strand, Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. Beginning in the 17th century, it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions, defences and armed forces. During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the Kalmar Union, governing the entire present day Nordic region in a personal union with Sweden and Norway ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state. The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of Scandinavia under the union for well over 120 years, starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion. After a plague outbreak and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. After further disasters in the early 19th century when Horatio Nelson attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the Second World War, the Finger Plan fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.\nSince the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the cultural, economic and governmental centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the service sector, especially through initiatives in information technology, pharmaceuticals and clean technology. Since the completion of the \u00d8resund Bridge, Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of Scania and its largest city, Malm\u00f6, forming the \u00d8resund Region. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens, The Little Mermaid statue, the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces, Rosenborg Castle Gardens, Frederik's Church, and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions. The largest lake of Denmark, Arres\u00f8, lies around 27 miles (43 kilometers) northwest of the City Hall Square.\nCopenhagen is home to the University of Copenhagen, the Technical University of Denmark, Copenhagen Business School and the IT University of Copenhagen. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the FC K\u00f8benhavn and Br\u00f8ndby football clubs. The annual Copenhagen Marathon was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world.\nThe Copenhagen Metro, launched in 2002, serves central Copenhagen. Additionally the Copenhagen S-train, the Lokaltog (private railway) and the Coast Line network serve and connect central Copenhagen to outlying boroughs. Serving roughly two million passengers a month, Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup, is the busiest airport in the Nordic countries.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nCopenhagen's name reflects its origin as a harbour and a place of commerce. The original designation in Old Norse, from which Danish descends, was Kaupmannah\u01ebfn [\u02e1kaupman\u02d0ah\u0252vn] (cf. modern Icelandic: Kaupmannah\u00f6fn [\u02e1k\u02b0\u00f8yhpman\u02d0ah\u0153pn], Faroese Keypmannahavn), meaning \"merchants' harbour\". By the time Old Danish was spoken, the capital was called K\u00f8pmann\u00e6hafn, with the current name deriving from centuries of subsequent regular sound change. An exact English equivalent would be \"chapman's haven\". However, the English term for the city was adapted from its Low German name, Kopenhagen.\n(English chapman, German Kaufmann, Dutch koopman, Swedish k\u00f6pman, Danish k\u00f8bmand, Icelandic kaupma\u00f0ur: in all these words, the first syllable comes ultimately from Latin caupo, \"tradesman\".) Copenhagen's Swedish name is K\u00f6penhamn, a direct translation of the mutually intelligible Danish name.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nAlthough the earliest historical records of Copenhagen are from the end of the 12th century, recent archaeological finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's Kongens Nytorv from c. 1020. Excavations in Pilestr\u00e6de have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the 11th century, have been unearthed near where Str\u00f8get meets R\u00e5dhuspladsen.\nThese finds indicate that Copenhagen's origins as a city go back at least to the 11th century. Substantial discoveries of flint tools in the area provide evidence of human settlements dating to the Stone Age. Many historians believe the town dates to the late Viking Age, and was possibly founded by Sweyn I Forkbeard. \nThe natural harbour and good herring stocks seem to have attracted fishermen and merchants to the area on a seasonal basis from the 11th century and more permanently in the 13th century. The first habitations were probably centred on Gammel Strand (literally \"old shore\") in the 11th century or even earlier.The earliest written mention of the town was in the 12th century when Saxo Grammaticus in Gesta Danorum referred to it as Portus Mercatorum, meaning Merchants' Harbour or, in the Danish of the time, K\u00f8bmannahavn. Traditionally, Copenhagen's founding has been dated to Bishop Absalon's construction of a modest fortress on the little island of Slotsholmen in 1167 where Christiansborg Palace stands today. The construction of the fortress was in response to attacks by Wendish pirates who plagued the coastline during the 12th century. Defensive ramparts and moats were completed and by 1177 St. Clemens Church had been built. Attacks by the Germans continued, and after the original fortress was eventually destroyed by the marauders, islanders replaced it with Copenhagen Castle.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nIn 1186, a letter from Pope Urban III states that the castle of Hafn (Copenhagen) and its surrounding lands, including the town of Hafn, were given to Absalon, Bishop of Roskilde 1158\u20131191 and Archbishop of Lund 1177\u20131201, by King Valdemar I. On Absalon's death, the property was to come into the ownership of the Bishopric of Roskilde. Around 1200, the Church of Our Lady was constructed on higher ground to the northeast of the town, which began to develop around it.As the town became more prominent, it was repeatedly attacked by the Hanseatic League, and in 1368 successfully invaded during the Second Danish-Hanseatic War. As the fishing industry thrived in Copenhagen, particularly in the trade of herring, the city began expanding to the north of Slotsholmen. In 1254, it received a charter as a city under Bishop Jakob Erlandsen who garnered support from the local fishing merchants against the king by granting them special privileges. In the mid 1330s, the first land assessment of the city was published.With the establishment of the Kalmar Union (1397\u20131523) between Denmark, Norway and Sweden, by about 1416 Copenhagen had emerged as the capital of Denmark when Eric of Pomerania moved his seat to Copenhagen Castle. The University of Copenhagen was inaugurated on 1 June 1479 by King Christian I, following approval from Pope Sixtus IV. This makes it the oldest university in Denmark and one of the oldest in Europe. Originally controlled by the Catholic Church, the university's role in society was forced to change during the Reformation in Denmark in the late 1530s.\n\n\n=== 16th and 17th centuries ===\n\nIn disputes prior to the Reformation of 1536, the city which had been faithful to Christian II, who was Catholic, was successfully besieged in 1523 by the forces of Frederik I, who supported Lutheranism. Copenhagen's defences were reinforced with a series of towers along the city wall. After an extended siege from July 1535 to July 1536, during which the city supported Christian II's alliance with Malm\u00f6 and L\u00fcbeck, it was finally forced to capitulate to Christian III. During the second half of the century, the city prospered from increased trade across the Baltic supported by Dutch shipping. Christoffer Valkendorff, a high-ranking statesman, defended the city's interests and contributed to its development. The Netherlands had also become primarily Protestant, as were northern German states.\nDuring the reign of Christian IV between 1588 and 1648, Copenhagen had dramatic growth as a city. On his initiative at the beginning of the 17th century, two important buildings were completed on Slotsholmen: the T\u00f8jhus Arsenal and B\u00f8rsen, the stock exchange. To foster international trade, the East India Company was founded in 1616. To the east of the city, inspired by Dutch planning, the king developed the district of Christianshavn with canals and ramparts. It was initially intended to be a fortified trading centre but ultimately became part of Copenhagen. Christian IV also sponsored an array of ambitious building projects including Rosenborg Slot and the Rundet\u00e5rn. In 1658\u201359, the city withstood a siege by the Swedes under Charles X and successfully repelled a major assault.By 1661, Copenhagen had asserted its position as capital of Denmark and Norway. All the major institutions were located there, as was the fleet and most of the army. The defences were further enhanced with the completion of the Citadel in 1664 and the extension of Christianshavns Vold with its bastions in 1692, leading to the creation of a new base for the fleet at Nyholm.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\n\nCopenhagen lost around 22,000 of its population of 65,000 to the plague in 1711. The city was also struck by two major fires which destroyed much of its infrastructure. The Copenhagen Fire of 1728 was the largest in the history of Copenhagen. It began on the evening of 20 October, and continued to burn until the morning of 23 October, destroying approximately 28% of the city, leaving some 20% of the population homeless. No less than 47% of the medieval section of the city was completely lost. Along with the 1795 fire, it is the main reason that few traces of the old town can be found in the modern city.A substantial amount of rebuilding followed. In 1733, work began on the royal residence of Christiansborg Palace which was completed in 1745. In 1749, development of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden was initiated. Designed by Nicolai Eigtved in the Rococo style, its centre contained the mansions which now form Amalienborg Palace. Major extensions to the naval base of Holmen were undertaken while the city's cultural importance was enhanced with the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts.In the second half of the 18th century, Copenhagen benefited from Denmark's neutrality during the wars between Europe's main powers, allowing it to play an important role in trade between the states around the Baltic Sea. After Christiansborg was destroyed by fire in 1794 and another fire caused serious damage to the city in 1795, work began on the classical Copenhagen landmark of H\u00f8jbro Plads while Nytorv and Gammel Torv were converged.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nOn 2 April 1801, a British fleet under the command of Admiral Sir Hyde Parker attacked and defeated the neutral Danish-Norwegian fleet anchored near Copenhagen. Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson led the main attack. He famously disobeyed Parker's order to withdraw, destroying many of the Dano-Norwegian ships before a truce was agreed. Copenhagen is often considered to be Nelson's hardest-fought battle, surpassing even the heavy fighting at Trafalgar. It was during this battle that Lord Nelson was said to have \"put the telescope to the blind eye\" in order not to see Admiral Parker's signal to cease fire.\n\nThe Second Battle of Copenhagen (or the Bombardment of Copenhagen) (16 August \u2013 5 September 1807) was from a British point of view a preemptive attack on Copenhagen, targeting the civilian population to yet again seize the Dano-Norwegian fleet. But from a Danish point of view the battle was a terror bombardment on their capital. Particularly notable was the use of incendiary Congreve rockets (containing phosphorus, which cannot be extinguished with water) that randomly hit the city. Few houses with straw roofs remained after the bombardment. The largest church, Vor frue kirke, was destroyed by the sea artillery. Several historians consider this battle the first terror attack against a major European city in modern times.\n\nThe British landed 30,000 men, they surrounded Copenhagen and the attack continued for the next three days, killing some 2,000 civilians and destroying most of the city. The devastation was so great because Copenhagen relied on an old defence-line whose limited range could not reach the British ships and their longer-range artillery.Despite the disasters of the early 19th century, Copenhagen experienced a period of intense cultural creativity known as the Danish Golden Age. Painting prospered under C.W. Eckersberg and his students while C.F. Hansen and Gottlieb Bindesb\u00f8ll brought a Neoclassical look to the city's architecture. In the early 1850s, the ramparts of the city were opened to allow new housing to be built around The Lakes (Danish: S\u00f8erne) that bordered the old defences to the west. By the 1880s, the districts of N\u00f8rrebro and Vesterbro developed to accommodate those who came from the provinces to participate in the city's industrialization. This dramatic increase of space was long overdue, as not only were the old ramparts out of date as a defence system but bad sanitation in the old city had to be overcome. From 1886, the west rampart (Vestvolden) was flattened, allowing major extensions to the harbour leading to the establishment of the Freeport of Copenhagen 1892\u201394. Electricity came in 1892 with electric trams in 1897. The spread of housing to areas outside the old ramparts brought about a huge increase in the population. In 1840, Copenhagen was inhabited by approximately 120,000 people. By 1901, it had some 400,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, Copenhagen had become a thriving industrial and administrative city. With its new city hall and railway station, its centre was drawn towards the west. New housing developments grew up in Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j and Valby while Frederiksberg became an enclave within the city of Copenhagen. The northern part of Amager and Valby were also incorporated into the City of Copenhagen in 1901\u201302.As a result of Denmark's neutrality in the First World War, Copenhagen prospered from trade with both Britain and Germany while the city's defences were kept fully manned by some 40,000 soldiers for the duration of the war.In the 1920s there were serious shortages of goods and housing. Plans were drawn up to demolish the old part of Christianshavn and to get rid of the worst of the city's slum areas. However, it was not until the 1930s that substantial housing developments ensued, with the demolition of one side of Christianhavn's Torvegade to build five large blocks of flats.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\n\nIn Denmark during World War II, Copenhagen was occupied by German troops along with the rest of the country from 9 April 1940 until 4 May 1945. German leader Adolf Hitler hoped that Denmark would be \"a model protectorate\" and initially the Nazi authorities sought to arrive at an understanding with the Danish government. The 1943 Danish parliamentary election was also allowed to take place, with only the Communist Party excluded. But in August 1943, after the government's collaboration with the occupation forces collapsed, several ships were sunk in Copenhagen Harbor by the Royal Danish Navy to prevent their use by the Germans. Around that time the Nazis started to arrest Jews, although most managed to escape to Sweden.In 1945 Ole Lippman, leader of the Danish section of the Special Operations Executive, invited the British Royal Air Force to assist their operations by attacking Nazi headquarters in Copenhagen. Accordingly, air vice-marshal Sir Basil Embry drew up plans for a spectacular precision attack on the Sicherheitsdienst and Gestapo building, the former offices of the Shell Oil Company. Political prisoners were kept in the attic to prevent an air raid, so the RAF had to bomb the lower levels of the building.The attack, known as \"Operation Carthage\", came on 22 March 1945, in three small waves. In the first wave, all six planes (carrying one bomb each) hit their target, but one of the aircraft crashed near Frederiksberg Girls School. Because of this crash, four of the planes in the two following waves assumed the school was the military target and aimed their bombs at the school, leading to the death of 123 civilians (of which 87 were schoolchildren). However, 18 of the 26 political prisoners in the Shell Building managed to escape while the Gestapo archives were completely destroyed.On 8 May 1945 Copenhagen was officially liberated by British troops commanded by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery who supervised the surrender of 30,000 Germans situated around the capital.\n\n\n==== Post-war decades ====\nShortly after the end of the war, an innovative urban development project known as the Finger Plan was introduced in 1947, encouraging the creation of new housing and businesses interspersed with large green areas along five \"fingers\" stretching out from the city centre along the S-train routes. With the expansion of the welfare state and women entering the work force, schools, nurseries, sports facilities and hospitals were established across the city. As a result of student unrest in the late 1960s, the former B\u00e5dsmandsstr\u00e6de Barracks in Christianshavn was occupied, leading to the establishment of Freetown Christiania in September 1971.Motor traffic in the city grew significantly and in 1972 the trams were replaced by buses. From the 1960s, on the initiative of the young architect Jan Gehl, pedestrian streets and cycle tracks were created in the city centre. Activity in the port of Copenhagen declined with the closure of the Holmen Naval Base. Copenhagen Airport underwent considerable expansion, becoming a hub for the Nordic countries. In the 1990s, large-scale housing developments were realized in the harbour area and in the west of Amager. The national library's Black Diamond building on the waterfront was completed in 1999.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nSince the summer of 2000, Copenhagen and the Swedish city of Malm\u00f6 have been connected by the \u00d8resund Bridge, which carries rail and road traffic. As a result, Copenhagen has become the centre of a larger metropolitan area spanning both nations. The bridge has brought about considerable changes in the public transport system and has led to the extensive redevelopment of Amager. The city's service and trade sectors have developed while a number of banking and financial institutions have been established. Educational institutions have also gained importance, especially the University of Copenhagen with its 35,000 students. Another important development for the city has been the Copenhagen Metro, the railway system which opened in 2002 with additions until 2007, transporting some 54 million passengers by 2011.On the cultural front, the Copenhagen Opera House, a gift to the city from the shipping magnate M\u00e6rsk Mc-Kinney M\u00f8ller on behalf of the A.P. M\u00f8ller foundation, was completed in 2004. In December 2009 Copenhagen gained international prominence when it hosted the worldwide climate meeting COP15.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCopenhagen is part of the \u00d8resund Region, which consists of Zealand, Lolland-Falster and Bornholm in Denmark and Scania in Sweden. It is located on the eastern shore of the island of Zealand, partly on the island of Amager and on a number of natural and artificial islets between the two. Copenhagen faces the \u00d8resund to the east, the strait of water that separates Denmark from Sweden, and which connects the North Sea with the Baltic Sea. The Swedish towns of Malm\u00f6 and Landskrona lie on the Swedish side of the sound directly across from Copenhagen. By road, Copenhagen is 42 kilometres (26 mi) northwest of Malm\u00f6, Sweden, 85 kilometres (53 mi) northeast of N\u00e6stved, 164 kilometres (102 mi) northeast of Odense, 295 kilometres (183 mi) east of Esbjerg and 188 kilometres (117 mi) southeast of Aarhus by sea and road via Sj\u00e6llands Odde.The city centre lies in the area originally defined by the old ramparts, which are still referred to as the Fortification Ring (F\u00e6stningsringen) and kept as a partial green band around it. Then come the late-19th- and early-20th-century residential neighbourhoods of \u00d8sterbro, N\u00f8rrebro, Vesterbro and Amagerbro. The outlying areas of Kongens Enghave, Valby, Vigerslev, Vanl\u00f8se, Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j, Utterslev and Sundby followed from 1920 to 1960. They consist mainly of residential housing and apartments often enhanced with parks and greenery.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nThe central area of the city consists of relatively low-lying flat ground formed by moraines from the last ice age while the hilly areas to the north and west frequently rise to 50 m (160 ft) above sea level. The slopes of Valby and Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j reach heights of over 30 m (98 ft), divided by valleys running from the northeast to the southwest. Close to the centre are the Copenhagen lakes of Sortedams S\u00f8, Peblinge S\u00f8 and Sankt J\u00f8rgens S\u00f8.Copenhagen rests on a subsoil of flint-layered limestone deposited in the Danian period some 60 to 66 million years ago. Some greensand from the Selandian is also present. There are a few faults in the area, the most important of which is the Carlsberg fault which runs northwest to southeast through the centre of the city. During the last ice age, glaciers eroded the surface leaving a layer of moraines up to 15 m (49 ft) thick.Geologically, Copenhagen lies in the northern part of Denmark where the land is rising because of post-glacial rebound.\n\n\n=== Beaches ===\n\nAmager Strandpark, which opened in 2005, is a 2 km (1 mi) long artificial island, with a total of 4.6 km (2.9 mi) of beaches. It is located just 15 minutes by bicycle or a few minutes by metro from the city centre. In Klampenborg, about 10 kilometers from downtown Copenhagen, is Bellevue Beach. It is 700 metres (2,300 ft) long and has both lifeguards and freshwater showers on the beach.The beaches are supplemented by a system of Harbour Baths along the Copenhagen waterfront. The first and most popular of these is located at Islands Brygge and has won international acclaim for its design.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nCopenhagen is in the oceanic climate zone (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb\u202f). Its weather is subject to low-pressure systems from the Atlantic which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Apart from slightly higher rainfall from July to September, precipitation is moderate. While snowfall occurs mainly from late December to early March, there can also be rain, with average temperatures around the freezing point.June is the sunniest month of the year with an average of about eight hours of sunshine a day. July is the warmest month with an average daytime high of 21 \u00b0C. By contrast, the average hours of sunshine are less than two per day in November and only one and a half per day from December to February. In the spring, it gets warmer again with four to six hours of sunshine per day from March to May. February is the driest month of the year. Exceptional weather conditions can bring as much as 50 cm of snow to Copenhagen in a 24-hour period during the winter months while summer temperatures have been known to rise to heights of 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F).Because of Copenhagen's northern latitude, the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight. There is therefore a difference of 10 hours and 31 minutes in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nAccording to Statistics Denmark, the urban area of Copenhagen (Hovedstadsomr\u00e5det) consists of the municipalities of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Albertslund, Br\u00f8ndby, Gentofte, Gladsaxe, Glostrup, Herlev, Hvidovre, Lyngby-Taarb\u00e6k, R\u00f8dovre, T\u00e5rnby and Vallensb\u00e6k as well as parts of Ballerup, Rudersdal and Fures\u00f8 municipalities, along with the cities of Ish\u00f8j and Greve Strand. They are located in the Capital Region (Region Hovedstaden). Municipalities are responsible for a wide variety of public services, which include land-use planning, environmental planning, public housing, management and maintenance of local roads, and social security. Municipal administration is also conducted by a mayor, a council, and an executive.Copenhagen Municipality is by far the largest municipality, with the historic city at its core. The seat of Copenhagen's municipal council is the Copenhagen City Hall (R\u00e5dhus), which is situated on City Hall Square. The second largest municipality is Frederiksberg, an enclave within Copenhagen Municipality.\nCopenhagen Municipality is divided into ten districts (bydele): Indre By, \u00d8sterbro, N\u00f8rrebro, Vesterbro/Kongens Enghave, Valby, Vanl\u00f8se, Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j-Husum, Bispebjerg, Amager \u00d8st, and Amager Vest. Neighbourhoods of Copenhagen include Slotsholmen, Frederiksstaden, Islands Brygge, Holmen, Christiania, Carlsberg, Sluseholmen, Sydhavn, Amagerbro, \u00d8restad, Nordhavnen, Bellah\u00f8j, Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j, Ryparken, and Vigerslev.\n\n\n=== Law and order ===\nMost of Denmark's top legal courts and institutions are based in Copenhagen. A modern style court of justice, Hof- og Stadsretten, was introduced in Denmark, specifically for Copenhagen, by Johann Friedrich Struensee in 1771. Now known as the City Court of Copenhagen (K\u00f8benhavns Byret), it is the largest of the 24 city courts in Denmark with jurisdiction over the municipalities of Copenhagen, Drag\u00f8r and T\u00e5rnby. With its 42 judges, it has a Probate Division, an Enforcement Division and a Registration and Notorial Acts Division while bankruptcy is handled by the Maritime and Commercial Court of Copenhagen. Established in 1862, the Maritime and Commercial Court (S\u00f8- og Handelsretten) also hears commercial cases including those relating to trade marks, marketing practices and competition for the whole of Denmark. Denmark's Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret), located in Christiansborg Palace on Prins J\u00f8rgens G\u00e5rd in the centre of Copenhagen, is the country's final court of appeal. Handling civil and criminal cases from the subordinate courts, it has two chambers which each hear all types of cases.The Danish National Police and Copenhagen Police headquarters is situated in the Neoclassical-inspired Politig\u00e5rden building built in 1918\u201324 under architects Hack Kampmann and Holger Alfred Jacobsen. The building also contains administration, management, emergency department and radio service offices. In their efforts to deal with drugs, the police have noted considerable success in the two special drug consumption rooms opened by the city where addicts can use sterile needles and receive help from nurses if necessary. Use of these rooms does not lead to prosecution; the city treats drug use as a public health issue, not a criminal one.The Copenhagen Fire Department forms the largest municipal fire brigade in Denmark with some 500 fire and ambulance personnel, 150 administration and service workers, and 35 workers in prevention. The brigade began as the Copenhagen Royal Fire Brigade on 9 July 1687 under King Christian V. After the passing of the Copenhagen Fire Act on 18 May 1868, on 1 August 1870 the Copenhagen Fire Brigade became a municipal institution in its own right. The fire department has its headquarters in the Copenhagen Central Fire Station which was designed by Ludvig Fenger in the Historicist style and inaugurated in 1892.\n\n\n=== Environmental planning ===\n\nCopenhagen is recognized as one of the most environmentally friendly cities in the world. As a result of its commitment to high environmental standards, Copenhagen has been praised for its green economy, ranked as the top green city for the second time in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index (GGEI). In 2001 a large offshore wind farm was built just off the coast of Copenhagen at Middelgrunden. It produces about 4% of the city's energy. Years of substantial investment in sewage treatment have improved water quality in the harbour to an extent that the inner harbour can be used for swimming with facilities at a number of locations.\n\nCopenhagen aims to be carbon-neutral by 2025. Commercial and residential buildings are to reduce electricity consumption by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively, and total heat consumption is to fall by 20 percent by 2025. Renewable energy features such as solar panels are becoming increasingly common in the newest buildings in Copenhagen. District heating will be carbon-neutral by 2025, by waste incineration and biomass. New buildings must now be constructed according to Low Energy Class ratings and in 2020 near net-zero energy buildings. By 2025, 75% of trips should be made on foot, by bike, or by using public transit. The city plans that 20\u201330% of cars will run on electricity or biofuel by 2025. The investment is estimated at $472 million public funds and $4.78 billion private funds.The city's urban planning authorities continue to take full account of these priorities. Special attention is given both to climate issues and efforts to ensure maximum application of low-energy standards. Priorities include sustainable drainage systems, recycling rainwater, green roofs and efficient waste management solutions. In city planning, streets and squares are to be designed to encourage cycling and walking rather than driving. Further, the city administration is working with smart city initiatives to improve how data and technology can be used to implement new solutions that support the transition toward a carbon-neutral economy. These solutions support operations covered by the city administration to improve e.g. public health, district heating, urban mobility and waste management systems. Smart city operations in Copenhagen are maintained by Copenhagen Solutions Lab, the city's official smart-city development unit under the Technical and Environmental Administration.\n\n\n== Demographics and society ==\n\nCopenhagen is the most populous city in Denmark and one of the most populous in the Nordic countries. For statistical purposes, Statistics Denmark considers the City of Copenhagen (Byen K\u00f8benhavn) to consist of the Municipality of Copenhagen plus three adjacent municipalities: Drag\u00f8r, Frederiksberg, and T\u00e5rnby. Their combined population stands at 763,908 (as of December 2016).The Municipality of Copenhagen is by far the most populous in the country and one of the most populous Nordic municipalities with 601,448 inhabitants (as of December 2016). There was a demographic boom in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, largely due to immigration to Denmark. According to figures from the first quarter of 2016, approximately 76% of the municipality's population was of Danish descent, defined as having at least one parent who was born in Denmark and has Danish citizenship. Much of the remaining 24% were of a foreign background, defined as immigrants (18%) or descendants of recent immigrants (6%). There are no official statistics on ethnic groups. The adjacent table shows the most common countries of birth of Copenhagen residents.\nAccording to Statistics Denmark, Copenhagen's urban area has a larger population of 1,280,371 (as of 1 January 2016). The urban area consists of the municipalities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg plus 16 of the 20 municipalities of the former counties Copenhagen and Roskilde, though five of them only partially. Metropolitan Copenhagen has a total of 2,016,285 inhabitants (as of 2016). The area of Metropolitan Copenhagen is defined by the Finger Plan. Since the opening of the \u00d8resund Bridge in 2000, commuting between Zealand and Scania in Sweden has increased rapidly, leading to a wider, integrated area. Known as the \u00d8resund Region, it has 3.8 million inhabitants (of whom 2.5 million live in the Danish part of the region).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nA majority (56.9%) of those living in Copenhagen are members of the Lutheran Church of Denmark which is 0.6% lower than one year earlier according to 2019 figures. The National Cathedral, the Church of Our Lady, is one of the dozens of churches in Copenhagen. There are also several other Christian communities in the city, of which the largest is Roman Catholic.Foreign migration to Copenhagen, rising over the last three decades, has contributed to increasing religious diversity; the Grand Mosque of Copenhagen, the first in Denmark, opened in 2014. Islam is the second largest religion in Copenhagen, accounting for approximately 10% of the population. While there are no official statistics, a significant portion of the estimated 175,000\u2013200,000 Muslims in the country live in the Copenhagen urban area, with the highest concentration in N\u00f8rrebro and the Vestegnen. There are also some 7,000 Jews in Denmark, most of them in the Copenhagen area where there are several synagogues. There is a long history of Jews in the city, and the first synagogue in Copenhagen was built in 1684. Today, the history of the Jews of Denmark can be explored at the Danish Jewish Museum in Copenhagen.\n\n\n=== Quality of living ===\nFor a number of years, Copenhagen has ranked high in international surveys for its quality of life. Its stable economy together with its education services and level of social safety make it attractive for locals and visitors alike. Although it is one of the world's most expensive cities, it is also one of the most liveable with its public transport, facilities for cyclists and its environmental policies. In elevating Copenhagen to \"most liveable city\" in 2013, Monocle pointed to its open spaces, increasing activity on the streets, city planning in favour of cyclists and pedestrians, and features to encourage inhabitants to enjoy city life with an emphasis on community, culture and cuisine. Other sources have ranked Copenhagen high for its business environment, accessibility, restaurants and environmental planning. However, Copenhagen ranks only 39th for student friendliness in 2012. Despite a top score for quality of living, its scores were low for employer activity and affordability.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nCopenhagen is the major economic and financial centre of Denmark. The city's economy is based largely on services and commerce. Statistics for 2010 show that the vast majority of the 350,000 workers in Copenhagen are employed in the service sector, especially transport and communications, trade, and finance, while less than 10,000 work in the manufacturing industries. The public sector workforce is around 110,000, including education and healthcare. From 2006 to 2011, the economy grew by 2.5% in Copenhagen, while it fell by some 4% in the rest of Denmark. In 2017, the wider Capital Region of Denmark had a gross domestic product (GDP) of \u20ac120 billion, and the 15th largest GDP per capita of regions in the European Union.\n\nSeveral financial institutions and banks have headquarters in Copenhagen, including Alm. Brand, Danske Bank, Nykredit and Nordea Bank Danmark. The Copenhagen Stock Exchange (CSE) was founded in 1620 and is now owned by Nasdaq, Inc.. Copenhagen is also home to a number of international companies including A.P. M\u00f8ller-M\u00e6rsk, Novo Nordisk, Carlsberg and Novozymes. City authorities have encouraged the development of business clusters in several innovative sectors, which include information technology, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, clean technology and smart city solutions.\n\nLife science is a key sector with extensive research and development activities. Medicon Valley is a leading bi-national life sciences cluster in Europe, spanning the \u00d8resund Region. Copenhagen is rich in companies and institutions with a focus on research and development within the field of biotechnology, and the Medicon Valley initiative aims to strengthen this position and to promote cooperation between companies and academia. Many major Danish companies like Novo Nordisk and Lundbeck, both of which are among the 50 largest pharmaceutical and biotech companies in the world, are located in this business cluster.Shipping is another import sector with Maersk, the world's largest shipping company, having their world headquarters in Copenhagen. The city has an industrial harbour, Copenhagen Port. Following decades of stagnation, it has experienced a resurgence since 1990 following a merger with Malm\u00f6 harbour. Both ports are operated by Copenhagen Malm\u00f6 Port (CMP). The central location in the \u00d8resund Region allows the ports to act as a hub for freight that is transported onward to the Baltic countries. CMP annually receives about 8,000 ships and handled some 148,000 TEU in 2012.Copenhagen has some of the highest gross wages in the world. High taxes mean that wages are reduced after mandatory deduction. A beneficial researcher scheme with low taxation of foreign specialists has made Denmark an attractive location for foreign labour. It is however also among the most expensive cities in Europe.Denmark's Flexicurity model features some of the most flexible hiring and firing legislation in Europe, providing attractive conditions for foreign investment and international companies looking to locate in Copenhagen. In Dansk Industri's 2013 survey of employment factors in the ninety-six municipalities of Denmark, Copenhagen came in first place for educational qualifications and for the development of private companies in recent years, but fell to 86th place in local companies' assessment of the employment climate. The survey revealed considerable dissatisfaction in the level of dialogue companies enjoyed with the municipal authorities.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism is a major contributor to Copenhagen's economy, attracting visitors due to the city's harbour, cultural attractions and award-winning restaurants. Since 2009, Copenhagen has been one of the fastest growing metropolitan destinations in Europe. Hotel capacity in the city is growing significantly. From 2009 to 2013, it experienced a 42% growth in international bed nights (total number of nights spent by tourists), tallying a rise of nearly 70% for Chinese visitors. The total number of bed nights in the Capital Region surpassed 9 million in 2013, while international bed nights reached 5 million.In 2010, it is estimated that city break tourism contributed to DKK 2 billion in turnover. However, 2010 was an exceptional year for city break tourism and turnover increased with 29% in that one year. 680,000 cruise passengers visited the port in 2015. In 2019 Copenhagen was ranked first among Lonely Planet's top ten cities to visit.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe city's appearance today is shaped by the key role it has played as a regional centre for centuries. Copenhagen has a multitude of districts, each with its distinctive character and representing its own period. Other distinctive features of Copenhagen include the abundance of water, its many parks, and the bicycle paths that line most streets.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe oldest section of Copenhagen's inner city is often referred to as Middelalderbyen (the medieval city). However, the city's most distinctive district is Frederiksstaden, developed during the reign of Frederick V. It has the Amalienborg Palace at its centre and is dominated by the dome of Frederik's Church (or the Marble Church) and several elegant 18th-century Rococo mansions. The inner city includes Slotsholmen, a little island on which Christiansborg Palace stands and Christianshavn with its canals. B\u00f8rsen on Slotsholmen and Frederiksborg Palace in Hiller\u00f8d are prominent examples of the Dutch Renaissance style in Copenhagen. Around the historical city centre lies a band of congenial residential boroughs (Vesterbro, Inner N\u00f8rrebro, Inner \u00d8sterbro) dating mainly from late 19th century. They were built outside the old ramparts when the city was finally allowed to expand beyond its fortifications.Sometimes referred to as \"the City of Spires\", Copenhagen is known for its horizontal skyline, broken only by the spires and towers of its churches and castles. Most characteristic of all is the Baroque spire of the Church of Our Saviour with its narrowing external spiral stairway that visitors can climb to the top. Other important spires are those of Christiansborg Palace, the City Hall and the former Church of St. Nikolaj that now houses a modern art venue. Not quite so high are the Renaissance spires of Rosenborg Castle and the \"dragon spire\" of Christian IV's former stock exchange, so named because it resembles the intertwined tails of four dragons.Copenhagen is recognised globally as an exemplar of best practice urban planning. Its thriving mixed use city centre is defined by striking contemporary architecture, engaging public spaces and an abundance of human activity. These design outcomes have been deliberately achieved through careful replanning in the second half of the 20th century.\nRecent years have seen a boom in modern architecture in Copenhagen both for Danish architecture and for works by international architects. For a few hundred years, virtually no foreign architects had worked in Copenhagen, but since the turn of the millennium the city and its immediate surroundings have seen buildings and projects designed by top international architects. British design magazine Monocle named Copenhagen the World's best design city 2008.Copenhagen's urban development in the first half of the 20th century was heavily influenced by industrialisation. After World War II, Copenhagen Municipality adopted Fordism and repurposed its medieval centre to facilitate private automobile infrastructure in response to innovations in transport, trade and communication. Copenhagen's spatial planning in this time frame was characterised by the separation of land uses: an approach which requires residents to travel by car to access facilities of different uses.The boom in urban development and modern architecture has brought some changes to the city's skyline. A political majority has decided to keep the historical centre free of high-rise buildings, but several areas will see or have already seen massive urban development. \u00d8restad now has seen most of the recent development. Located near Copenhagen Airport, it currently boasts one of the largest malls in Scandinavia and a variety of office and residential buildings as well as the IT University and a high school.\n\n\n=== Parks, gardens and zoo ===\n\nCopenhagen is a green city with many parks, both large and small. King's Garden (Kongens Have), the garden of Rosenborg Castle, is the oldest and most frequented of them all. It was Christian IV who first developed its landscaping in 1606. Every year it sees more than 2.5 million visitors and in the summer months it is packed with sunbathers, picnickers and ballplayers. It serves as a sculpture garden with both a permanent display and temporary exhibits during the summer months. Also located in the city centre are the Botanical Gardens noted for their large complex of 19th-century greenhouses donated by Carlsberg founder J. C. Jacobsen. F\u00e6lledparken at 58 ha (140 acres) is the largest park in Copenhagen.It is popular for sports fixtures and hosts several annual events including a free opera concert at the opening of the opera season, other open-air concerts, carnival and Labour Day celebrations, and the Copenhagen Historic Grand Prix, a race for antique cars. A historical green space in the northeastern part of the city is Kastellet, a well-preserved Renaissance citadel that now serves mainly as a park. Another popular park is the Frederiksberg Gardens, a 32-hectare romantic landscape park. It houses a colony of tame grey herons and other waterfowl. The park offers views of the elephants and the elephant house designed by world-famous British architect Norman Foster of the adjacent Copenhagen Zoo. Langelinie, a park and promenade along the inner \u00d8resund coast, is home to one of Copenhagen's most-visited tourist attractions, the Little Mermaid statue.In Copenhagen, many cemeteries double as parks, though only for the more quiet activities such as sunbathing, reading and meditation. Assistens Cemetery, the burial place of Hans Christian Andersen, is an important green space for the district of Inner N\u00f8rrebro and a Copenhagen institution. The lesser known Vestre Kirkegaard is the largest cemetery in Denmark (54 ha (130 acres)) and offers a maze of dense groves, open lawns, winding paths, hedges, overgrown tombs, monuments, tree-lined avenues, lakes and other garden features.It is official municipal policy in Copenhagen that by 2015 all citizens must be able to reach a park or beach on foot in less than 15 minutes. In line with this policy, several new parks, including the innovative Superkilen in the N\u00f8rrebro district, have been completed or are under development in areas lacking green spaces.\n\n\n=== Landmarks by district ===\n\n\n==== Indre By ====\nThe historic centre of the city, Indre By or the Inner City, features many of Copenhagen's most popular monuments and attractions. The area known as Frederiksstaden, developed by Frederik V in the second half of the 18th century in the Rococo style, has the four mansions of Amalienborg, the royal residence, and the wide-domed Marble Church at its centre. Directly across the water from Amalienborg, the recently completed Copenhagen Opera stands on the island of Holmen. To the south of Frederiksstaden, the Nyhavn canal is lined with colourful houses from the 17th and 18th centuries, many now with lively restaurants and bars. The canal runs from the harbour front to the spacious square of Kongens Nytorv which was laid out by Christian V in 1670. Important buildings include Charlottenborg Palace, famous for its art exhibitions, the Thott Palace (now the French embassy), the Royal Danish Theatre and the Hotel D'Angleterre, dated to 1755. Other landmarks in Indre By include the parliament building of Christiansborg, the City Hall and Rundet\u00e5rn, originally an observatory. There are also several museums in the area including Thorvaldsen Museum dedicated to the 18th-century sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. Closed to traffic since 1964, Str\u00f8get, the world's oldest and longest pedestrian street, runs the 3.2 km (2.0 mi) from R\u00e5dhuspladsen to Kongens Nytorv. With its speciality shops, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, and buskers, it is always full of life and includes the old squares of Gammel Torv and Amagertorv, each with a fountain. Rosenborg Castle on \u00d8ster Voldgade was built by Christian IV in 1606 as a summer residence in the Renaissance style. It houses the Danish crown jewels and crown regalia, the coronation throne and tapestries illustrating Christian V's victories in the Scanian War.\n\n\n==== Christianshavn ====\n\nChristianshavn lies to the southeast of Indre By on the other side of the harbour. The area was developed by Christian IV in the early 17th century. Impressed by the city of Amsterdam, he employed Dutch architects to create canals within its ramparts which are still well preserved today. The canals themselves, branching off the central Christianshavn Canal and lined with house boats and pleasure craft are one of the area's attractions. Another interesting feature is Freetown Christiania, a fairly large area which was initially occupied by squatters during student unrest in 1971. Today it still maintains a measure of autonomy. The inhabitants openly sell drugs on \"Pusher Street\" as well as their arts and crafts. Other buildings of interest in Christianshavn include the Church of Our Saviour with its spiralling steeple and the magnificent Rococo Christian's Church. Once a warehouse, the North Atlantic House now displays culture from Iceland and Greenland and houses the Noma restaurant, known for its Nordic cuisine.\n\n\n==== Vesterbro ====\n\nVesterbro, to the southwest of Indre By, begins with the Tivoli Gardens, the city's top tourist attraction with its fairground atmosphere, its Pantomime Theatre, its Concert Hall and its many rides and restaurants. The Carlsberg neighbourhood has some interesting vestiges of the old brewery of the same name including the Elephant Gate and the Ny Carlsberg Brewhouse. The Tycho Brahe Planetarium is located on the edge of Skt. J\u00f8rgens S\u00f8, one of the Copenhagen lakes. Halmtorvet, the old haymarket behind the Central Station, is an increasingly popular area with its caf\u00e9s and restaurants. The former cattle market \u00d8ksnehallen has been converted into a modern exhibition centre for art and photography. Radisson Blu Royal Hotel, built by Danish architect and designer Arne Jacobsen for the airline Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) between 1956 and 1960 was once the tallest hotel in Denmark with a height of 69.60 m (228.3 ft) and the city's only skyscraper until 1969. Completed in 1908, Det Ny Teater (the New Theatre) located in a passage between Vesterbrogade and Gammel Kongevej has become a popular venue for musicals since its reopening in 1994, attracting the largest audiences in the country.\n\n\n==== N\u00f8rrebro ====\n\nN\u00f8rrebro to the northwest of the city centre has recently developed from a working-class district into a colourful cosmopolitan area with antique shops, non-Danish food stores and restaurants. Much of the activity is centred on Sankt Hans Torv and around Rantzausgade. Copenhagen's historic cemetery, Assistens Kirkeg\u00e5rd halfway up N\u00f8rrebrogade, is the resting place of many famous figures including S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Niels Bohr, and Hans Christian Andersen but is also used by locals as a park and recreation area.\n\n\n==== \u00d8sterbro ====\n\nJust north of the city centre, \u00d8sterbro is an upper middle-class district with a number of fine mansions, some now serving as embassies. The district stretches from N\u00f8rrebro to the waterfront where The Little Mermaid statue can be seen from the promenade known as Langelinie. Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, it was created by Edvard Eriksen and unveiled in 1913. Not far from the Little Mermaid, the old Citadel (Kastellet) can be seen. Built by Christian IV, it is one of northern Europe's best preserved fortifications. There is also a windmill in the area. The large Gefion Fountain (Gefionspringvandet) designed by Anders Bundgaard and completed in 1908 stands close to the southeast corner of Kastellet. Its figures illustrate a Nordic legend.\n\n\n==== Frederiksberg ====\n\nFrederiksberg, a separate municipality within the urban area of Copenhagen, lies to the west of N\u00f8rrebro and Indre By and north of Vesterbro. Its landmarks include Copenhagen Zoo founded in 1869 with over 250 species from all over the world and Frederiksberg Palace built as a summer residence by Frederick IV who was inspired by Italian architecture. Now a military academy, it overlooks the extensive landscaped Frederiksberg Gardens with its follies, waterfalls, lakes and decorative buildings. The wide tree-lined avenue of Frederiksberg All\u00e9 connecting Vesterbrogade with the Frederiksberg Gardens has long been associated with theatres and entertainment. While a number of the earlier theatres are now closed, the Betty Nansen Theatre and Aveny-T are still active.\n\n\n==== Amagerbro ====\nAmagerbro (also known as S\u00f8nderbro) is the district located immediately south-east of Christianshavn at northernmost Amager. The old city moats and their surrounding parks constitute a clear border between these districts. The main street is Amagerbrogade which after the harbour bridge Langebro, is an extension of H. C. Andersens Boulevard and has a number of various stores and shops as well as restaurants and pubs. Amagerbro was built up during the two first decades of the twentieth century and is the city's northernmost block built area with typically 4\u20137 floors. Further south follows the Sundby\u00f8ster and Sundbyvester districts.\n\n\n==== Hellerup ====\n\nHellerup is the city's northernmost district with a central city feeling. It's located north of \u00d8sterbro and is known to be the perhaps most fashionable part of Copenhagen. Along Strandvejen (a street and further north a road leading to Elsinore) various shops, stores and restaurants are located. And by its crossing streets plenty of large villas are found. Hellerup is not a part of Copenhagen municipality, but constitutes the eastern parts of Gentofte. Hellerup is nevertheless a typical city environment without any notable bound towards the south.\n\n\n==== Other districts ====\nNot far from Copenhagen Airport on the Kastrup coast, The Blue Planet completed in March 2013 now houses the national aquarium. With its 53 aquariums, it is the largest facility of its kind in Scandinavia. Grundtvig's Church, located in the northern suburb of Bispebjerg, was designed by P.V. Jensen Klint and completed in 1940. A rare example of Expressionist church architecture, its striking west fa\u00e7ade is reminiscent of a church organ.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nApart from being the national capital, Copenhagen also serves as the cultural hub of Denmark and wider Scandinavia. Since the late 1990s, it has undergone a transformation from a modest Scandinavian capital into a metropolitan city of international appeal in the same league as Barcelona and Amsterdam. This is a result of huge investments in infrastructure and culture as well as the work of successful new Danish architects, designers and chefs. Copenhagen Fashion Week, the largest fashion event in Northern Europe, takes place every year in February and August.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nCopenhagen has a wide array of museums of international standing. The National Museum, Nationalmuseet, is Denmark's largest museum of archaeology and cultural history, comprising the histories of Danish and foreign cultures alike. Denmark's National Gallery (Statens Museum for Kunst) is the national art museum with collections dating from the 12th century to the present. In addition to Danish painters, artists represented in the collections include Rubens, Rembrandt, Picasso, Braque, L\u00e9ger, Matisse, Emil Nolde, Olafur Eliasson, Elmgreen and Dragset, Superflex and Jens Haaning.\n\nAnother important Copenhagen art museum is the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek founded by second generation Carlsberg philanthropist Carl Jacobsen and built around his personal collections. Its main focus is classical Egyptian, Roman and Greek sculptures and antiquities and a collection of Rodin sculptures, the largest outside France.

Designed by Jean Nouvel, it has four halls with the main auditorium seating 1,800 people. It serves as the home of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra and along with the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles is the most expensive concert hall ever built. Another important venue for classical music is the Tivoli Concert Hall located in the Tivoli Gardens. Designed by Henning Larsen, the Copenhagen Opera House (Operaen) opened in 2005. It is among the most modern opera houses in the world. The Royal Danish Theatre also stages opera in addition to its drama productions. It is also home to the Royal Danish Ballet. Founded in 1748 along with the theatre, it is one of the oldest ballet troupes in Europe, and is noted for its Bournonville style of ballet.\n\nCopenhagen has a significant jazz scene that has existed for many years. It developed when a number of American jazz musicians such as Ben Webster, Thad Jones, Richard Boone, Ernie Wilkins, Kenny Drew, Ed Thigpen, Bob Rockwell, Dexter Gordon, and others such as rock guitarist Link Wray came to live in Copenhagen during the 1960s. Every year in early July, Copenhagen's streets, squares, parks as well as caf\u00e9s and concert halls fill up with big and small jazz concerts during the Copenhagen Jazz Festival. One of Europe's top jazz festivals, the annual event features around 900 concerts at 100 venues with over 200,000 guests from Denmark and around the world.The largest venue for popular music in Copenhagen is Vega in the Vesterbro district. It was chosen as \"best concert venue in Europe\" by international music magazine Live. The venue has three concert halls: the great hall, Store Vega, accommodates audiences of 1,550, the middle hall, Lille Vega, has space for 500 and Ideal Bar Live has a capacity of 250. Every September since 2006, the Festival of Endless Gratitude (FOEG) has taken place in Copenhagen. This festival focuses on indie counterculture, experimental pop music and left field music combined with visual arts exhibitions.Copenhagen is home to the \"K-Town\" punk and hardcore music community. This community developed around the underground scene venue Ungdomshuset in the late 1990s punk scene, with punk- and hardcore acts such as Snipers, Amdi Petersens Arm\u00e9, Gorilla Angreb, Young Wasteners, and No Hope for the Kids emerging as significant bands. The term \"K-town\" got international recognition within the punk-scene with the emergence of \"K-Town\" festivals. In 2001, the first of these was held in Ungdomshuset, on Jagtvej 69, N\u00f8rrebro, Copenhagen. The festival temporarily moved to Freetown Christiania after Ungdomshuset was evicted from its original location until a new Ungdomshuset location was opened on Dortheavej 61.For free entertainment one can stroll along Str\u00f8get, especially between Nytorv and H\u00f8jbro Plads, which in the late afternoon and evening is a bit like an impromptu three-ring circus with musicians, magicians, jugglers and other street performers.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nMost of Denmarks's major publishing houses are based in Copenhagen. These include the book publishers Gyldendal and Akademisk Forlag and newspaper publishers Berlingske and Politiken (the latter also publishing books). Many of the most important contributors to Danish literature such as Hans Christian Andersen (1805\u20131875) with his fairy tales, the philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813\u20131855) and playwright Ludvig Holberg (1684\u20131754) spent much of their lives in Copenhagen. Novels set in Copenhagen include Baby (1973) by Kirsten Thorup, The Copenhagen Connection (1982) by Barbara Mertz, Number the Stars (1989) by Lois Lowry, Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow (1992) and Borderliners (1993) by Peter H\u00f8eg, Music and Silence (1999) by Rose Tremain, The Danish Girl (2000) by David Ebershoff, and Sharpe's Prey (2001) by Bernard Cornwell. Michael Frayn's 1998 play Copenhagen about the meeting between the physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in 1941 is also set in the city. On 15\u201318 August 1973, an oral literature conference took place in Copenhagen as part of the 9th International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences.The Royal Library, belonging to the University of Copenhagen, is the largest library in the Nordic countries with an almost complete collection of all printed Danish books since 1482. Founded in 1648, the Royal Library is located at four sites in the city, the main one being on the Slotsholmen waterfront. Copenhagen's public library network has over 20 outlets, the largest being the Central Library (K\u00f8benhavns Hovedbibliotek) on Krystalgade in the inner city.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nCopenhagen has a wide selection of art museums and galleries displaying both historic works and more modern contributions. They include Statens Museum for Kunst, i.e. the Danish national art gallery, in the \u00d8stre Anl\u00e6g park, and the adjacent Hirschsprung Collection specialising in the 19th and early 20th century. Kunsthal Charlottenborg in the city centre exhibits national and international contemporary art. Den Frie Udstilling near the \u00d8sterport Station exhibits paintings created and selected by contemporary artists themselves rather than by the official authorities. The Arken Museum of Modern Art is located in southwestern Ish\u00f8j. Among artists who have painted scenes of Copenhagen are Martinus R\u00f8rbye (1803\u20131848), Christen K\u00f8bke (1810\u20131848) and the prolific Paul Gustav Fischer (1860\u20131934).A number of notable sculptures can be seen in the city. In addition to The Little Mermaid on the waterfront, there are two historic equestrian statues in the city centre: Jacques Saly's Frederik V on Horseback (1771) in Amalienborg Square and the statue of Christian V on Kongens Nytorv created by Abraham-C\u00e9sar Lamoureux in 1688 who was inspired by the statue of Louis XIII in Paris. Rosenborg Castle Gardens contains several sculptures and monuments including August Saabye's Hans Christian Andersen, Aksel Hansen's Echo, and Vilhelm Bissen's Dowager Queen Caroline Amalie.Copenhagen is believed to have invented the photomarathon photography competition, which has been held in the City each year since 1989.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nAs of 2014, Copenhagen has 15 Michelin-starred restaurants, the most of any Scandinavian city. The city is increasingly recognized internationally as a gourmet destination. These include Den R\u00f8de Cottage, Formel B Restaurant, Gr\u00f8nbech & Churchill, S\u00f8ller\u00f8d Kro, Kadeau, Kiin Kiin (Denmark's first Michelin-starred Asian gourmet restaurant), the French restaurant Kong Hans K\u00e6lder, Rel\u00e6, Restaurant AOC, Noma (short for Danish: nordisk mad, English: Nordic food) with two Stars and Geranium with three. Noma, was ranked as the Best Restaurant in the World by Restaurant in 2010, 2011, 2012, and again in 2014, sparking interest in the New Nordic Cuisine.Apart from the selection of upmarket restaurants, Copenhagen offers a great variety of Danish, ethnic and experimental restaurants. It is possible to find modest eateries serving open sandwiches, known as sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d \u2013 a traditional, Danish lunch dish; however, most restaurants serve international dishes. Danish pastry can be sampled from any of numerous bakeries found in all parts of the city. The Copenhagen Baker's Association dates back to the 1290s and Denmark's oldest confectioner's shop still operating, Conditori La Glace, was founded in 1870 in Skoubogade by Nicolaus Henningsen, a trained master baker from Flensburg.Copenhagen has long been associated with beer. Carlsberg beer has been brewed at the brewery's premises on the border between the Vesterbro and Valby districts since 1847 and has long been almost synonymous with Danish beer production. However, recent years have seen an explosive growth in the number of microbreweries so that Denmark today has more than 100 breweries, many of which are located in Copenhagen. Some like N\u00f8rrebro Bryghus also act as brewpubs where it is also possible to eat on the premises.\n\n\n=== Nightlife and festivals ===\n\nCopenhagen has one of the highest number of restaurants and bars per capita in the world. The nightclubs and bars stay open until 5 or 6 in the morning, some even longer. Denmark has a very liberal alcohol culture and a strong tradition for beer breweries, although binge drinking is frowned upon and the Danish Police take driving under the influence very seriously. Inner city areas such as Istedgade and Enghave Plads in Vesterbro, Sankt Hans Torv in N\u00f8rrebro and certain places in Frederiksberg are especially noted for their nightlife. Notable nightclubs include Bakken Kbh, ARCH (previously ZEN), Jolene, The Jane, Chateau Motel, KB3, At Dolores (previously Sunday Club), Rust, Vega Nightclub, Culture Box and Gef\u00e4hrlich, which also serves as a bar, caf\u00e9, restaurant, and art gallery.Copenhagen has several recurring community festivals, mainly in the summer. Copenhagen Carnival has taken place every year since 1982 during the Whitsun Holiday in F\u00e6lledparken and around the city with the participation of 120 bands, 2,000 dancers and 100,000 spectators. Since 2010, the old B&W Shipyard at Refshale\u00f8en in the harbour has been the location for Copenhell, a heavy metal rock music festival. Copenhagen Pride is a gay pride festival taking place every year in August. The Pride has a series of different activities all over Copenhagen, but it is at the City Hall Square that most of the celebration takes place. During the Pride the square is renamed Pride Square. Copenhagen Distortion has emerged to be one of the biggest street festivals in Europe with 100,000 people joining to parties in the beginning of June every year.\n\n\n=== Amusement parks ===\n\nCopenhagen has the two oldest amusement parks in the world.Dyrehavsbakken, a fair-ground and pleasure-park established in 1583, is located in Klampenborg just north of Copenhagen in a forested area known as Dyrehaven. Created as an amusement park complete with rides, games and restaurants by Christian IV, it is the oldest surviving amusement park in the world. Pierrot (Danish: Pjerrot), a nitwit dressed in white with a scarlet grin wearing a boat-like hat while entertaining children, remains one of the park's key attractions. In Danish, Dyrehavsbakken is often abbreviated as Bakken. There is no entrance fee to pay and Klampenborg Station on the C-line, is situated nearby.The Tivoli Gardens is an amusement park and pleasure garden located in central Copenhagen between the City Hall Square and the Central Station. It opened in 1843, making it the second oldest amusement park in the world. Among its rides are the oldest still operating rollercoaster Rutschebanen from 1915 and the oldest ferris wheel still in use, opened in 1943. Tivoli Gardens also serves as a venue for various performing arts and as an active part of the cultural scene in Copenhagen.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nCopenhagen has over 94,000 students enrolled in its largest universities and institutions: University of Copenhagen (38,867 students), Copenhagen Business School (19,999 students), Metropolitan University College and University College Capital (10,000 students each), Technical University of Denmark (7,000 students), KEA (c. 4,500 students), IT University of Copenhagen (2,000 students) and Aalborg University \u2013 Copenhagen (2,300 students).The University of Copenhagen is Denmark's oldest university founded in 1479.

It includes the historic School of Visual Arts, and has in later years come to include a School of Architecture, a School of Design and a School of Conservation. Copenhagen Business School (CBS) is an EQUIS-accredited business school located in Frederiksberg.\nThere are also branches of both University College Capital and Metropolitan University College inside and outside Copenhagen.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nThe city has a variety of sporting teams. The major football teams are the historically successful FC K\u00f8benhavn and Br\u00f8ndby. FC K\u00f8benhavn plays at Parken in \u00d8sterbro. Formed in 1992, it is a merger of two older Copenhagen clubs, B 1903 (from the inner suburb Gentofte) and KB (from Frederiksberg). Br\u00f8ndby plays at Br\u00f8ndby Stadion in the inner suburb of Br\u00f8ndbyvester. BK Frem is based in the southern part of Copenhagen (Sydhavnen, Valby). Other teams are FC Nordsj\u00e6lland (from suburban Farum), Fremad Amager, B93, AB, Lyngby and Hvidovre IF.\n\nCopenhagen has several handball teams\u2014a sport which is particularly popular in Denmark. Of clubs playing in the \"highest\" leagues, there are Ajax, Ydun, and HIK (Hellerup). The K\u00f8benhavn H\u00e5ndbold women's club has recently been established. Copenhagen also has ice hockey teams, of which three play in the top league, R\u00f8dovre Mighty Bulls, Herlev Eagles and Hvidovre Ligahockey all inner suburban clubs. Copenhagen Ice Skating Club founded in 1869 is the oldest ice hockey team in Denmark but is no longer in the top league.Rugby union is also played in the Danish capital with teams such as CSR-Nanok, Copenhagen Business School Sport Rugby, Frederiksberg RK, Exiles RUFC and Rugbyklubben Speed. Rugby league is now played in Copenhagen, with the national team playing out of Gentofte Stadion. The Danish Australian Football League, based in Copenhagen is the largest Australian rules football competition outside of the English-speaking world.Copenhagen Marathon, Copenhagen's annual marathon event, was established in 1980.Round Christiansborg Open Water Swim Race is a 2-kilometre (1.2-mile) open water swimming competition taking place each year in late August. This amateur event is combined with a 10-kilometre (6-mile) Danish championship. In 2009 the event included a 10-kilometre (6-mile) FINA World Cup competition in the morning. Copenhagen hosted the 2011 UCI Road World Championships in September 2011, taking advantage of its bicycle-friendly infrastructure. It was the first time that Denmark had hosted the event since 1956, when it was also held in Copenhagen.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nThe greater Copenhagen area has a very well established transportation infrastructure making it a hub in Northern Europe. Copenhagen Airport, opened in 1925, is Scandinavia's largest airport, located in Kastrup on the island of Amager. It is connected to the city centre by metro and main line railway services. October 2013 was a record month with 2.2 million passengers, and November 2013 figures reveal that the number of passengers is increasing by some 3% annually, about 50% more than the European average.\n\n\n=== Road, rail and ferry ===\nCopenhagen has an extensive road network including motorways connecting the city to other parts of Denmark and to Sweden over the \u00d8resund Bridge. The car is still the most popular form of transport within the city itself, representing two-thirds of all distances travelled. This can however lead to serious congestion in rush hour traffic. The \u00d8resund train links Copenhagen with Malm\u00f6  24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \nCopenhagen is also served by a daily ferry connection to Oslo in Norway. In 2012, Copenhagen Harbour handled 372 cruise ships and 840,000 passengers.The Copenhagen S-Train, Copenhagen Metro and the regional train networks are used by about half of the city's passengers, the remainder using bus services. N\u00f8rreport Station near the city centre serves passengers travelling by main-line rail, S-train, regional train, metro and bus. Some 750,000 passengers make use of public transport facilities every day. Copenhagen Central Station is the hub of the DSB railway network serving Denmark and international destinations.The Copenhagen Metro expanded radically with the opening of the City Circle Line (M3) on September 29, 2019. The new line connects all inner boroughs of the city by metro, including the Central Station, and opens up 17 new stations for Copenhageners. On March 28, 2020, the 2.2 km (1.4 mi) Nordhavn extension of the Harbour Line (M4) opened. Running from Copenhagen Central Station, the new extension is a branch line of M3 Cityring to Osterport. The M4 Sydhavn branch is expected to open in 2024. The new metro lines are part of the city's strategy to transform mobility towards sustainable modes of transport such as public transport and cycling as opposed to automobility.Copenhagen is cited by urban planners for its exemplary integration of public transport and urban development. In implementing its Finger Plan, Copenhagen is considered the world's first example of a transit metropolis, and areas around S-Train stations like Ballerup and Br\u00f8ndby Strand are among the earliest examples of transit-oriented development.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\n\nCopenhaden has been rated as the most bicycle-friendly city in the world since 2015, with bicycles outnumbering its inhabitants. In 2012 some 36% of all working or studying city-dwellers cycled to work, school, or university. With 1.27 million km covered every working day by Copenhagen's cyclists (including both residents and commuters), and 75% of Copenhageners cycling throughout the year. The city's bicycle paths are extensive and well used, boasting 400 kilometres (250 miles) of cycle lanes not shared with cars or pedestrians, and sometimes have their own signal systems \u2013 giving the cyclists a lead of a couple of seconds to accelerate.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nPromoting health is an important issue for Copenhagen's municipal authorities. Central to its sustainability mission is its \"Long Live Copenhagen\" (L\u00e6nge Leve K\u00f8benhavn) scheme in which it has the goal of increasing the life expectancy of citizens, improving quality of life through better standards of health, and encouraging more productive lives and equal opportunities. The city has targets to encourage people to exercise regularly and to reduce the number who smoke and consume alcohol.Copenhagen University Hospital forms a conglomerate of several hospitals in Region Hovedstaden and Region Sj\u00e6lland, together with the faculty of health sciences at the University of Copenhagen; Rigshospitalet and Bispebjerg Hospital in Copenhagen belong to this group of university hospitals. Rigshospitalet began operating in March 1757 as Frederiks Hospital, and became state-owned in 1903. With 1,120 beds, Rigshospitalet has responsibility for 65,000 inpatients and approximately 420,000 outpatients annually. It seeks to be the number one specialist hospital in the country, with an extensive team of researchers into cancer treatment, surgery and radiotherapy. In addition to its 8,000 personnel, the hospital has training and hosting functions. It benefits from the presence of in-service students of medicine and other healthcare sciences, as well as scientists working under a variety of research grants. The hospital became internationally famous as the location of Lars von Trier's television horror mini-series The Kingdom. Bispebjerg Hospital was built in 1913, and serves about 400,000 people in the Greater Copenhagen area, with some 3,000 employees.

        "brit": "Amalienborg,  residential square in Copenhagen, Den., built during the reign (1746\u201366) of King Frederick V and comprising four mansions and the octagonal courtyard surrounded by them. The complex was designed and constructed by the Danish architect Nicolai Eigtved, who also designed numerous other buildings in the surrounding district. At the centre of the court stands a much-admired equestrian statue of Frederick V by the French sculptor Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph Saly. Originally the mansions were city residences for nobility. After a fire at the royal residence, Christiansborg Castle, in 1794 the royal family moved to Amalienborg, and they have continued to use the mansions as residences and for state functions. Amalienborg Palace is considered to be one of the finest examples of the Rococo style of architecture in Europe.Copenhagen: AmalienborgAmalienborg, Copenhagen; the domed structure (centre) is the Marble Church (or Frederick's Church).Quistnix ",

          "The impressive thing at this \"must pass place\" is the architectural layout with the 4 wings, the symmetry, the details and somehow aligned the cathedrale. With the guards it feels quite outdated for a modern state like Denmark is ...",
          "There are 4 palaces in total but only one is open to the public. I was in and out of there in an hour as there is not much to see. I used my Copenhagen card so it was \"free\" but i would have been annoyed if i had to pay for this. Backpacks are not allowed and they force you to",
          "We were not able to take the time to tour any of the four palaces but it was interesting to hear the story behind them. The four palaces were originally built in the 1750s as homes for the nobility but were taken over by the Royal Family after the fire at Christiansborg in 1794.",

          "We visited Amalienborg and the museum and was very impressed. The architecture was amazing and it wasn\u2019t too busy although we did get there before the museum opening time. The museum was great and very informative of the history of the royals with a lot to see would definitely",

          "Amalienborg is a erfectly laid out square with four palaces and a statue of Fredrik Vth in the center. The Queen and the Crown Price actually reside here at times. There are guards manning posts throughout. The guards rotate every two hours and there is a changing of the guard",

          "This has not only the queen's residence but also the Prince and prince residence and many stately buildings and while not on the same scale as Buckingham Palace it still shows pomp and ceremony",
          "We were expecting to see a lot more of the building. The entry only gets you into a few recreated rooms on the first floor. There was a lot of space dedicated to the queen\u2019s costume designs which was interesting yet unexpected. We felt like it was overpriced for what we saw.",
          "The size of the place is hard to believe. The soldiers on guard were interesting particularly if you stood in a drive way - they yelled at you to get out. Scary!",

          "Beautiful and special square, where the Danish monarchy lives. No real guards or fences, if you lucky, you can see some princes in the window. Its about 20 minutes walking from city center, but its on the way to mermaid and around are many other tourist attractions.",
          "We stopped by the palace square as part of a Copenhagen city tour and found it interesting. While we could not stay very long we would recommend this as part of a city of Copenhagen tour. Since the queen was in residence we were not able to see the palace itself.",
          "It's a bit disorientating standing in the square and trying to figure out where the entrance is. Find the building with the clock and it's the one on the left of that one. If the Queen or the Crown Prince and Princess are home, a flag flies over their building. The Prince",
          "We came here to watch the changing of the guards and was blown away with the beauty of the buildings, etc. We was also informed that the royal family was actually currently residing too which was pretty awesome when comparing how close we could get.",

          "Visited during the day and night. Sunset photo attached not as good as limited clouds - perfect spot in the local square by statue. Can watch the guards also pacing or changing during the day",
          "Beautiful to walk around and view the historical building. Was hoping for a glimpse of the royals. Wish we could go inside for a visit.",
          "We thought this place was a bit clinical and small. There were a few rooms to see which were nice but everything was behind glass so you couldn't really get good photos. The royal family seem to be into amateur dramatics and there were lots of manaquins with costumes from their",

          "This is one of the three must see palaces in CPH but dear me what a disappointment. Few rooms on show and little information. The best items were the Faberge items. This like Rosenborg palace were happy to open to the public, take your money and provide little or no facilities.",
          "This is an exquisite castle in Denmark filled with a great display of history through art and other royal possessions that are part of the Danish monarchy. It is located in a busy area near the Marble Church and even though it's quiet, it's a beautiful place to visit. Don't",
          "We walked here from a lovely coffee shop. To be honest it isn't massively obvious, having visited royal palaces elsewhere in Europe it's very humble. OK, so it's still impressive but subdued and no obvious signs of wealth. You can watch the guards, but there's not too much else",
          "Interesting to see a very human side of the queen and some of the history of the royal family. Accessible for children too.",
          "The palace square is wide open and unrestricted. You can wander through ans observe the guards in their bearskin hats and blue coats. Nothing like the impersonal atmosphere in London.",
          "I visited when walking back to the city centre at 9:00 in the morning. The square was empty apart from the guards on duty. It's nothing special in my honest opinion, but it does provide the opportunity to photograph the guards. I suspect that visiting when the changing of the",
          "Some amazing history for a very interesting royal family. The changing of the guards happens at the same time every day and is well worth a watch - it's nowhere near as busy as other royal palaces across the world. The palaces are beautiful too, and there are often people",
          "Interesting to see the palace grounds and surrounding palaces. We were more fascinated with the guardsmen",
          "Missed the change of guards since visited during the evening. The whole square was empty excluding the guards walking or guarding. They must have wondered who visits the square that time of the year and time. :) If you are into historical building and such places you should",

          "We went to see the change of guard. Not so impressive like other places ( London , Athens ) and the museum ( I would disagree with the definition , as museum) it's not worth it. The most impressive is the church behind the palace. GO AND SEE IT.",

          "Just walking around the courtyard of the Palace was amazing (no ticket needed) and you get to see the guards change shift (on the hour I believe). Once you've purchased a ticket you only get to see a small part of the Palace but the staff/security were incredibly polite and",

          "Visited the palace to see the Queens passion for dressing up. Down to earth it was not - weird it was but when you look at the family tree they all are too closely related to escape some trace of nuttiness",
          "What surprised us most was that this winter residence of the Danish Queen is not gated or fenced . There is unhindered public access to the exterior , although there are the usual royal guards in attendance in red booths by the entrances at each building. The large square in the",

          "Amalienborg is the official residence of the Danish royal family, and it\u2019s an attraction worth visiting for those who are fascinated with royalties. The best time to visit is around noon, so that you can also witness the Changing of Guards ceremony which happens at 12 noon",
          "Watched the changing of the guards which was amazing. It\u2019s at 12 noon daily and is a must see. Great hour spent watching and listening to the change over",
          "We visited the Amalienborg palaces museum which was fascinating and extremely well done. I learnt a lot more about Danish Royalty. We also did the small group tour of the Guest Palace which I would highly recommend. You have to leave bags, coats etc all in a secure area and",
          "Access to Amalienborg is only to one of the 4 buildings. Don't miss the second floor which has costumes. Changing of the guard occurs at 12.00 midday: we asked one of the guides where the best place was to stand: in the centre by the statue , with the Amalienborg public entrance",
          "Went here after my Nyhavn Canal Tour. The architectural design of the buding is nice, all.four sides got thier own guards marching.. Unfortunately i didnt witnessed the changing of guards as i was there too early. I am rating it 4 for now as i havent visited the museum yet and",

          "One of the many palaces and castles of the Royal family. There are several blocks of building and each is occupied by different family members. You have free entry to the palace museum with copenhagen card. Be there about 12.30pm where there is changing of guards to each",
          "There were 4 buildings but only 1 can be entered with a hefty fee. Single ticket was more expensive than Christianborg (where the later is way better with a great free guided tour). Inside were rooms showing cramped decorations and interiors styled true to its museum form. I",
          "Immaculate building well kept. Worth a walk around nice fountains near by not far from th little Mermaid.",
          "The structures look more like government buildings and less like a Palace. The vast open space make the different sections seem unconnected. Something serene and calm about the place",

          "Amalienborg is the winter home of the Danish royal family and consists of 4 identical palaces. There is a museum where you can learn more about the the royal family. Every day there is a Changing of the Guard ceremony at 12:00 noon. The guards leave Rosenborg Castle at",

          "This square is huge. We didn't have time to go into the museum that was there but did see the changing of the guard. It is a small regiment so don't expect anything like you see in London but it was nice to see the uniforms and how they did the changing of the guards.",
          "The Amalienborg is a nice palace, similar to Buckingham Palace in London. It is nice to walk along the square, and if youre there at 12', watch the changing of the guards. The museum however was disappointing. The ticket was quite expensive, but there were not many rooms that",
          "As Royal Palaces go, this was nothing special,except for how close you could get to it. The ceremonial guards chase people off the sidewalk if they get to close and are not being respectful. The changing of the guard at noon is basically a long boring staring contest. Worth a",

          "After buying the joint ticket for this and Christianborg Palace I was anticipating that it would be as interesting as Christianborg. It is very small in comparison but with the cost minimal I guess it is worth having a look.",
          "You can\u2019t help but be impressed when you stand in the square surrounded by the 4 identical looking massive residences. The self guided tour thru the museum building showing the various studies and rooms of the current Royal Family since the mid 19th century will give the tourist",

          "I went to Amalienborg palace for the changing of the guard that happens every day from 11:30-12:30. Got lucky to witness. My hostel is just a few blocks away so i didnt waste my time. Hundreds of people gathered around to witness. A must to see the changing of the guard",
          "Even though the castles were closed upon our stay in Copenhagen, we included Amalienborg in our bike trip because it was easy to combine it with other hotspots in the neighborhood. If I ever return to the city, I definitely want to see the inside too.",
          "If you have good guides here, they provide personal glimpses about the royals. My favorite involves the queen's smoking habit (and her consort's gift). Otherwise, it's not particularly amazing architecture, and the changing of the guard ceremony is well short of spectacular.",
          "Amalienborg is the home of the Danish Royal Family. There are basically four palaces in a very large courtyard. You can walk right into the middle of the courtyard and be surrounded by the palaces. In the centre of the courtyard is a statue of King Frederick the fifth. There",
          "Around 12 in afternoon they have change of guards parade which is quite average and not up to the mark with castles around Europe. Behind the fountains one can enjoy good walk around the lake. Good place around the waterfront.",
          "If you\u2019re only going to visit one palace in Copenhagen, or be selective in any way, and aren\u2019t taking advantage of the Copenhagen Card, then I would make Amalienborg the last option. The free areas outside are impressive and should definitely be seen but the interiors, which",
          "A very large area showing the four palaces were interesting and we saw the changing of the guard. Spend time looking at the church",

          "We visited Amalienborg on two occasions. The first was while following the changing of the royal guard (they march from Rosenborg to Amalienborg every day). The second was two days later on a walking tour with Urban Adventures. It is definately worth a look. Even though you",

          "We went to the palace on a day when the king was home. We were fortunate enough to catch the changing of the guard. Our guide told us not to get too close to the guards but many people did not listen.",
          "There are four palaces facing a courtyard with a statue of King Frederick on a horse in the middle. Only one of the palaces is open to the public as the royal family still lives on site. The palace is OK but not much compared to others as it is more urbane and less opulent.",
          "I went there just in time to catch the Royal guards changing shift. It is rather interesting to experience the little bits of the life at the royal palace. Only one of the palace is opened to public and u get to see the exhibits that depicts the history and life of the royal",

          "Definitely go into the palace if you have the time to. There's a lot of information and rooms to see that you can't see at other locations. It also will give you a better explanation of the palace itself.",
          "This is one of several wonderful palaces in and near Copenhagen. Impressive interiors, I was disappointed that some rooms were not open especially the main staircase. But as part of a 4-building complex, it is a must-see and also close to the Marble Church. THe other three",

          "While the queen was not in the castle, some other members of the royal family were. We could not enter the castle, but it was fun to see the changing of the guard, at noon time. I did catch one of the men gazing at the crowd though! The courtyard was huge between the four",

          "We entered for a tour - beautiful rooms and library. Great views from the tower and the stables are worth the visit. Favorite place was the kitchens, really get a feel for how many people it would take to run a royal palace.",
          "Wished I had time to see inside the palace. We didn't have time to see inside. Plus I was unable to find the entrance to the part of the palace visitors were able to visit. If you are in that area of Copenhagen, it is well worth viewing the buildings",
          "So when you have 6 hours in a port, you want to see as much as possible. When the French president decides to visit at the same time, you get to see a lot of Danish police and crowd barriers and not a lot else. Amalienborg I am sure is lovely. What I saw was the square, guards",
          "We viewed the gardens, the marching guards, busts on side of building (busts of prior royals), but didn't enter the palace for a tour. The building was beautiful but not that interesting for us to enter and pay the fees.",
          "We visited this Royal residential palace whilst walking around Copenhagen. We just walked around the grounds to the square which is surrounded by four palace similar looking buildings , it is very impressive There are some lovely statues . We were so lucky to arrive 12pm when",
          "Interesting place, more interesting as you can have close access to this residential palace and if you get lucky like us, you could see one of the royal families.",
          "We visited Amalienborg Square in Copenhagen during our visit back in January. It was refreshing to see that despite it being the Royal residence that public access was possible. We were there for the changing of the guard at 1200 noon and it was a good spectacle to witness. It",
          "I went to this place on the first day of my stay, and it was a bit of walk from the centre, and it was a bit hot summer day, so I felt a little tired when I arrived there. I could see the changing of the guards at the right time, and the palace square is quite huge but nothing",
          "Residence of the royal family, so inside tours only offered Thursday-Satruday I believe, but the museum is open every day and really good. Tons of artifacts and information.",
          "A large, very clean square with an impressive statue in the centre. The square is surrounded by the royal palaces and if you time it right you can watch the changing of the guards. We managed to see a couple of the guards patrolling the area although the weather did dampen the",
          "This beautiful square should be visited at the time of the changing of the guards (1230) to view this ancient traditional spectacle. Get there early in summer as there's always a big crowd, especially at weekends.",
          "Fun to watch the guards posted around the square; they actually watch the people milling around, unlike the palace guards in London who just stand frozen.",
          "We happened to get there just as they were getting ready to change the guards. No Princeses or Royalty staying there ( no flags flying ), but it was a popular event as there were many people there.",
          "Since i love castles and im intrigued by monarchies history i enjoyed my visit and watching the guards.. we were able to cross on the other side and tour around the palace.. it was nice.",
          "This is the palace where the queen lives. The four buildings have a huge courtyard where the change of guard takes place.Worth watching.",
          "We were only allowed to visit the courtyard at Amalienborg Palace. There was a guard who acted unusual in so far as he kept looking around and moving his head and eyes. Never saw a guard do that before.",
          "This place has a changing of the guard which was cool. It is near the water heading toward the mermaid so you can hit this on the way.",
          "I don't know many places where you have the possibility of seeing the Queen and her children and grandchildren leaving to go about their daily business. We don't have this type of accessibility in the United States to our President (and probably with good reason) You can watch",
          "This lovely palace is the home of the present queen and sits within a lovely palace square with a statue in the centre of the courtyard. There were soldiers guarding the palace entrances,changing of the guards was fabulous to see. There is a entrance fee to the palace itself.I",
          "The changing of the guard takes place each day at midday when the guards from Rosenborg Palace change with those from Amalienborg. Be early to get a good viewing position. The square is a mecca for tourists, so lots of people about. The current Danish Royal family live in the",
          "We timed our visit for the afternoon changing of the guards. The queen was not in residence but the soldiers were and it ws cool to see these young people working and honoring their Queen",
          "Visited museum (combined ticket with Rosenborg - buy online first to book time at Rosenborg). Children are free at both. Inside museum lots of information about the royal family and family tree tying to many European royal families. Lots of exhibits had children\u2019s questions to",
          "Beautiful architecture. Four very similar palaces, once belonging to different aristocratic families, encompass an octagonal square in the middle of which is an equine statue of King Frederik V. At one end it opens onto a spectacular fountain, Amalienhavn gardens and the sea",
          "that a great place to spend an hour. The set up is nice, and the exhibits are really interesting. Better not to go on very hot day, because the place is not equiped with airconditioning. Gets only 4 out of 10 because i think that it is a bit expensive (95 kr pp). I would",
          "Visited the museum (by Copenhagen Card) free. You would know more about the Royal family, living environment in the past. The square was nice to view changing guard though you should not compare with the one at Buckingham Palace in terms of scale and duration; whereas you could",
          "Loved this entire area, great palace, interesting history about how it became palace. Make sure to check out museum kind of hidden in side. Near the marble church. Spend some time in this area.",
          "I have seen many guard-changing exercises around the world and this one was probably the most underwhelming. We stood out in the hot sun (and pity the poor guards with their beaver (?) hats!) waiting for it to start, and then waited some more after it began and nothing much",
          "Great palace to take pictures of the royal changing of the guard, thise that missed good pictures while at London's Buckingham Palace.",
          "Another lovely place to walk around and spend time admiring the buildings, and people watching. It is spacious, so even when there are lots of people arpund it does not feel crowded,",
          "The display was pretty interesting. Not many visitors. The interesting part for me was talking with the staff in the palace. He made my visit a whole lot more fun. Or otherwise the visit would be pretty quick. Walk outside of the palace was nice specially in the morning.",
          "The palace buildings and the square in front combine to make a visit here very pleasing to the eye. The royal guards who frequently change positions add to the overall experience.",
          "I visited the palace with my friend at the end of July, and we were a bit surprised to learn that there actually was only a very limited amount of rooms open and available for visitors. The ticket sales point was crowded and there was only one toilet for visitors, so the lines",
          "This was a nice place to spend a little time. The palace comprises four almost identical buildings and there is a nice museum in one. You can walk from the square to the water front which is lovely, especially in the sunshine. We enjoyed a walk past all the yachts.",
          "Nicely curated museum with some royal paraphernalia and lots of history for the royalty buffs out there. The square is also great for those essential IG shots... managed to catch the changing of the guards while we were there. It\u2019s not as formal an affair as at Buckingham palace",
          "This is a huge Palace. Not all areas are open to the public. Were there during record heatwave so wasn\u2019t able to enjoy it as much as if the temperature was in the normal range. Had to laugh at one of the guardsmen who kept telling people not to sit on steps. Asked him where",
          "Understood to be the living quarters for the current monarch, she requested a museum be established and open to the public. Although our visit was a bit rushed, it was still very interesting to visit and learn a bit more about the current House of Gl\u00fccksburg and their differing",
          "Amalienborg is home of Danish royal family. It is made up of four identical buildings, and one of them is a museum. Opening hours: 10am \u2013 5pm Ticket: - adults 95DKK - children (0-17years) free",
          "I recommend to go there and look at the courtyard and the buildings. There is a museum, but that is a bit underwhelming. I would only recommend it if you have purchased a combo ticket, like the Copenhagen card. We spent 5-10 min in the museum walking through. The other two,",
          "I found that for the size of the place, there actually wasn\u2019t much to see in comparison to other palaces.",
          "Gathered at the Amelienborg Palace for the changing of the Guard ceremony at noon. We got there a bit early and so we could appreciate the lovely buildings and the square itself. There was a medium crown gathered there for the ceremony and we soon found out where the process",
          "Lovely square, but we were a bit surprised that the royal winter palace was so simple, especially when there are so many more interesting royal castles and palaces in Copenhagen. But it was impressive nonetheless.",
          "A great square in the typical European tradition. I found the inside of the Amalienborg palace not worth the visit - just the same stuff you can see elsewhere.",
          "From my bus tour, it was a 5 min walk to these quirky and weird palaces. Loved the stories told of the chimneys on each palace. The present Queen occupies the palace with the 5 chimneys (they say because she smokes so much), the crown prince and his family occupy the one with",
          "This palace was just down the street from our hotel the Strondic front! Worth a look! The queen wasn\u2019t staying here at our time of visiting, but they do have a changing of the guards every day at 12!",
          "this is a neat and quite lovely attraction. The Royal guards are nice to view. Did the palace tour and was very pleased- no crowded at all. the interiors were lovely",
          "One of the locations in Copenhen not to be missed. An early morning visit is recommended as it gets crowded with tourists specially at 12.00pm. This is due to the changing of the Palace Guards. It is amazing to view four Palaces facing each other in a square. There are guards on",
          "The stop is more there for being able to check out some architecture as there isn't a lot you can do here. It was interesting to see how close you can get to the royal family. As an American we aren't used to more layed back security measures so it is intriguing to see you can",
          "Royal family residence. The changing of the palace guards is always a show at noontime. This one of the significant structures in the city and a crowded attraction. Unfortunately tourist are not allow inside. The palace sits overlooking the open square in front with several",
          "We watched the changing of the Danish royal guards as a bonus - lucky timing by our guide. Lovely architecture",
          "A beautiful palace square where you can watch the changing of the guards and take nice pictures of the majestic buildings.",
          "Our guide was very informative about the royal family. They were not in residence . This was a stop on our walking tour.",
          "This is a nice palace to see from the outside (the guards) and from the inside. The rooms are nice and provide good information but it is not as big as you would expect. My advice if you are pushed for time Rosenborg castle is better to see.",
          "The sides of the square are composed of royal palaces and it was really surprising that you could get so close to the entrance of these buildings. However, don't get so close that you get in the way of the guards when they start marching! The palaces are really majestic and",
          "Arrived in time for the build up to COTG, as crowds were gathering. Not a lot really happens, but fun to watch. Crowds started to disappear when they thought it had finished, but it started up again and I got a much better position to take photos. Each individual guard station",
          "Came across this whilst on our self guided walking tour and it is beautiful. A large square surrounded by majestic buildings with guards. We didn't go in to the museum because of time constraints but so pleased we came across this - well worth a visit, I understand if your",
          "Make sure you get there about 11.30 am to get a good position. The guards approach from Frederiksgade Rd. And March into the square. They then turn right and changeover in front of the guard room. When they put the red crowd control rope out, line up along the black line of",
          "We used our Copenhagen card and enjoyed seeing the royal rooms and photographs. It was very hot and airless. We went outside to see the changing of the guard at noon. There are large crowds. If you want to take photos the crowd thins out towards the end of the ceremony at 12.30.",
          "Excited to see the changing of royal guard at the Amalienborg palace square. You can also take photo with the guard on duty with the nice uniform.",
          "Amalienborg is a beautiful structure as you would assume since it is the home of the royal family. Beautiful as you approach it through the large courtyard.",
          "The Palace is magnificent viewed both from the quadrangle in front and when a tour of the inside it taken. The Palace has so much history attached to it and is the home of the Danish Royal family.",
          "We arrived at the palace square in time to see the Changing of the Guard. It was a very interesting process and we had the unique experience of meeting an off-duty guard who filled us in on a variety of details concerning the guards, training, their schedules, etc.. Very",
          "I recommend at least walking through here if you have the time whilst in Copenhagen. You can walk through it on your way to the little mermaid. Lovely to see the guards and where royalty lives.",
          "Beautiful classical architecture of royal palace surrounding a huge parade area with statue. It reminds me of Paris or Vienna. Changing of the guard ceremony is interesting",
          "A lovely and informative display on the modern incarnation of the Danish monarchy. It was fun to go through and learn about the monarch in the 20th century.",
          "an impressive square with the monument in the center. you get the royal groove standing here... enjoy.",
          "loved visiting Amalienborg square. the museum is quite nice and has just a lot of items you don't see anywhere else. from here is a good access point to go to the Frederik church and in the opposite direction to the garden, where we spent some time enjoying the fountain and a",
          "This is the summer home of the Royal family which actually consists of 4 buildings, and one of them you can see inside. the other 3 belong and are used by the royal family. They were at home this weekend, but we didn't see them! This is my favourite palace and lots of",
          "At first glance this Residence of the Royal family is not so impresive BUT the most fantastic and unique is that this IS the Residence of the Royal family and we as visitors can come up so close - touch the building. Realy says something about Copenhagen, the Danish people.",
          "Enjoyed the visit.Got so close to the changing of the guards and also their marching upto the palace.",
          "This was interesting to watch and worth the wait. The square is quite large and we happened upon the changing of the guard after walking around surrounding area.",
          "Enjoyed strolling around the plaza and admiring the Guards marching from one corner of the sidewalk to the other. Even though it was a very hot day the guards took their jobs very seriously. Liked the buildings, cobblestones which are well maintain and the area is very clean. If",
          "What a wonderful place to live! It has beautiful little gardens leading up from the harbour side. How different from our Royal Family, where here you can walk through their private grounds. HM wasn't at home on the day of our visit. the Guards look splendid in their uniforms and",
          "We tried to visit at the end of the day with our Copenhagen card, after following the cards instructions of checking each sites openning hours on their own websites. We planned to go at the end of the afternoon, but after walking out there were told that they were closing",
          "The museum is well designed and has interesting descriptions at each room. Best for those interested in monarchy history from more recent periods.",
          "This is a really interesting area with lovely statues buildings and guards. The guard changes at 12pm each day which unfortunately we missed but would have been well worth being there for we think",
          "Lovely square to have the Royal Danish Family living on, to watch the changing of the guard was nice if the flag is flying it means the Royal are at home. The marble church is just down the road all in all lovely setting.",
          "My husband and I made this our first stop of the day and we loved it. Make sure you plan on being there for the changing of the guards at noon. And take the tour too. It was an amazing palace to visit and it gave us great background about the history of Denmark too!",
          "I wandered round here one quiet Saturday morning ... it was so pretty and picturesque i couldn\u2019t help but marvel .. lovely chilled place to wander",
          "One of the four buildings of this palace is a museum that offers a glance of the history of the royal family. We also were fortunate to see the changing of the guard",
          "If you're feeling a bit \"palaced-out\" by all of the Copenhagen palaces/castles, still go to this one! It has much more of the immediate history, and will help you gain an understanding of the royal family much more.",
          "Visited here with wife and friends, before going on a cruise the next day. Interesting that if you see flags on top of the building, it means that the royal family is home! Also the changing of the guards was fun to watch.",
          "The square itself is lovely and has guards marching around. What we enjoyed was the museum part that lets you walk around a section of the palace and see what it was like during different reigns. The information was in English and easy to follow. The rooms were full of furniture",
          "Not expensive to enter, so worth the visit. You are not rushed so you can sit and enjoy the beauty. Be sure to see the changing of the guards.",
          "Definitely visit the Amalienborg when in Copenhagen. It was very beautiful and we were there during the changing of the guards at noon. It was a beautiful tradition to witness. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "We visited the Palace after seeing the changing of the guard. The Palace is small but the exhibits and rooms are very interesting with a great deal of information in English for you to follow. We certainly left better informed about the Danish Royal Family",
          "You will get a small glimpse of how the royal family lived & their family history. If you read all the information it will take you about an hour",
          "As you are looking at the picture, the building immediately to the right is the museum. Don't try to visit on Monday. Lots to see and worth the visit",
          "Went there to see the changing of guards, started at 12 noon. Everyone was taking photos or videos. Was an unique,unforgettable experience. The crowd was not bothered by the hot sun. After this, we went to visit the castle.",
          "We saw all 3 palaces in Copenhagen and 2 outside of the city and found that they were all really unique; if I had to cut one, though, this would be it. The cool thing about this palace is that the royal family still inhabits some of the buildings, so you'll see the guards. We",
          "Amalienborg is an existing residence so you can only tour certain places. You should go before noon, so you get a spot to watch the changing of the guards. Amalienborg's 4 structures with a circular courtyard. The upper floors where tickets are sold is like a museum. You also",
          "Beautiful palace to see. You can visit the museum using the Copenhagen card for free. Nice places around the palace.",
          "It is worthwhile visiting it and take a stroll around it. Behind it there is the harbour which provides you with all the peace the sea brings",
          "We just visited the square and the guide discussed the royal family, who lived in which palace surrounding the square. It was interesting to me that we had physical access so close to the royal residences.",
          "Visiting this palace, especially the Great Hall and the Danish Crown Jewels is an experience not to be missed.",
          "This is an impressive area to take in Danish, culture, government, and the monarchy. We were lucky and arrived right when some form of military inspections were occurring. There were lots of horses, and officers. We also witnessed the changing of the guards. Pay attention to",
          "Very lovely! Queen Margaret was there...when the Danish flag flies she's there and when it doesn't she's not. Very fasinating palace. Worth your time.",
          "Nice place, a good museum that gives you an insight into the life of royalties, but also try to be there just before noon to see the royal guard exchange.",
          "Walk an great area to walk around. Beautiful square and so easily accessible to the public. Great history and a working palace of the Royal family. Changing of the guard every day at noon. Definitely a worthwhile visit.",
          "Interesting grounds to walk around. Got photos of guards walking their assigned post. The court yard is enormous. Besure to go to the museum. They had a great displays of the life of the Royals. I'd highly recommend.",
          "Amalienborg is home to the royal family and as such a closed sight. But it is also one of the most beautiful sqaures we have ever seen in Europe, and to our surprise a public roundabout.",
          "Do not get too close to the guards as they do not like it very much. I did only visit the outside the palace but it was relaxed and pleasant to be allowed so close",
          "Easy to get to and make sure you get there just before 12 noon for thd spectacle of changing ghe royal guard zt the palace. Its an unusual architecture for a palace being separate buildings around a square, however the square zcts as a great parade ground to see the royal",
          "It was nice being allowed to walk so close to the current residences of the country's royal family, something you could never do elsewhere.",
          "Stunning interiors, a Palace with a wow factor. Well maintained. The square outside is huge and lively. Close to the waterfront. We were lucky enough to see the change of guards. Entry fee applicable. Gift shop available. Credit cards accepted. Free entry with the Copenhagen",
          "The palace of the Danish Royal, we visited the 29 of April unfortunately there is only a guided visit at 1:30pm because they are the private rooms of the royals.",
          "We didn\u2019t take the time to go inside this beauty only enjoyed it from the outside, however we timed it properly to watch the changing of the guards. And what a sight to see! It was perfect place for our littles to watch such a tradition. Possibly our favorite stop in our journey",
          "The palace was marvellous as the grounds are open to all tourists to walk in and visit. We visited on the 16th April 2018, which so happened to be Queen Margrethe II of Denmark's birthday and was able to see her on the balcony with the rest of the royal family. Truly a",
          "The castle was closed. We did watch the changing of the guard which is interesting. You get to see the different ways each country does it.",
          "For the money charged this was a big letdown. You have access to a small part of one level of this palace, and quite honestly the interior is somewhat plain. Best to visit Rosenborg or Christiansborg over this place.",
          "I was visited this place with my wife yesterday.Very nice palace, we really enjoyed that walk , after we walked to the Copenhagen port, and we were planed to have a dinner to some nice restaurant",
          "Having watched the Guard march out of the barracks adjacent to Rosenborg Castle walked down to Amalienborg. Nice to able to observe the Guard close up and also tour the apartments. Nice to be able to compare with Buckingham Palace but this pretty unique with the four mansions.",
          "Toured the palace rooms in about an hour. You can learn a history of the Danish royal family and see royal memorabilia on display. Quite interesting but nothing extraordinary. I was expecting more from a royal palace. In fact, changing of the guards you can watch every day at",
          "The amalienborg palace is located next to the waterfront across from the Opera House and next to the Marble Church. One of the better stops for a photo.",
          "Walking up towards the palace we realised that the guards were walking up the road behind us! Just 3 policemen controlled the small crowd who behaved impeccably. We were never more than 20 metres from the guards as they changed over and at one point, were almost walking with",
          "It\u2019s refreshing to visit a royal palace where you can simply walk into the main square unhindered, even if the danish royal family are in residence, which speaks to their culture of openness, access and being part of the danish people. Interesting to see the houses for each",
          "dropped by Amalienborg since my tour bus passes by here. Not very crowded like most tourist spots are,maybe perhaps because its a lil out of the way or perhaps everyone was avoiding the winter cold. Came here slightly after 12pm and managed to see the change of guards,which was",
          "The changing of the guard is worth watching as the soldiers march around the palace square in their colorful uniforms. The palace itself is worth a tour to experience how the royalty live, see some wonderful artifacts and learn a bit of history.",
          "We happened upon Amalienborg, it wasn't on our itinerary as we had reached our castle limited after visiting two castles. We were lucky, the changing of the Guard was just taking place as we entered. It was lovely to see this tradition. All the guards were the exact same height,",
          "The changing of the guards, the green copper dome, the sight line with the opera, the waiting chambers near the water, the flag indicating if the royal family is in or out, the fact that part is open for the public: very good!",
          "Amalienborg palace is home to the Danish royal family. Located on Amalienborg square, the palace consists of four, identical buildings with classical fa\u00e7ades. Two of four buildings are open to the public. A large equestrian statue stands in the middle of the square. It is also",
          "There are many palaces in Copenhagen..But at Amalienborg Palace one can see the Architectural work of Copenhagen as well as Change of guard ceremony..Change of guard ceremony takes place at noon..Its a very nice experience..One should definitely visit this place..",
          "We enjoyed the freedom of wandering around the buildings of the palace and exploring the square, the fountain and the section of the palace open to visitors. Make sure you arrive on time to see the changing of the guard.",
          "It's worth it to follow the guards all the way from Rosemborg Slot to Amelienborg to see the change of the guards",
          "Lovely architecture in the heart of Kobenhavn - we walked all around and watched the changing of the guard then went for coffee and cake at the Union Kitchen quite nearby",
          "We arrived in Copenhagen just the same day as Prince Henrik was buried, so there was a special mood around the castle with lots of flowers and parades of castle guards in their colorful 'toy soldiers' clothes. The castle is very centrally located and it is walking distance to",
          "The palace is still used by the royal family, so all is not always open. Beautiful house and location, so close to the waterfront.",
          "It\u2019s worth it the to see the changing of the guard at noon. We were there in March, so it wasn\u2019t very crowded. It would have been early enough to arrive at 11:30, take a few pictures with the guards on duty and then line up to view the change. The police line you up a few",
          "Love how relaxing it is; Its lovely when soldiers change shifts; Really tourist attraction; Must see place for sure",
          "Fantastic to watch the changing of the guards, In January it was quite cold, actually freezing but worth the wait and the blue fingers i got waiting. I also found the inside of the palace very beautiful and very interesting, a real masterpiece.",
          "An octagonal square, formed by majestical buildings, that is what it is. Walk around, take a picture, smile at the guards strolling to and fro, why not?",
          "The palace itself was gorgeous from the outside and had very pretty rooms. The decor was stunning however most rooms were completely empty and the rooms with things in them had everything cramped in which made it look to busy and you couldn't focus very well on anything in",
          "A cluster of buildings located in one of the nicest rococo plazas which can be accessed through four large streets. One of the attractions of the area is the changing of the guard , at about 11:30 , each morning , by the impressive soldiers wearing their bearskin headgears",
          "We went to see the changing of the guards.When that concluded the film industry was set up to produce a film depicting the Earlier Copenhagen up to the current. Very interesting and great to watch.",
          "We walked by the Amalienborg Palace whilst venturing amongst the northern area of Copenhagen. The palace itself is a big and open structure with plenty to see and take in. We were walking back from Kastellet and the Little Mermaid statue when we ventured through. We didn't stop",
          "Beautiful palace belonged to danish monarchy. Still today it\u2019s one of the residences where the royal family stays and where they welcome guests on a diplomatic visit, so you can visit only a small part of four great palaces. Despite this it\u2019s worth spending a couple of hours",
          "Very good changingg of the Guard. Not same as the London one, but very good, and shorter in time. Dont wait them to start at midday. When we were there they arrived in formation at 11 55. So be there with time enough. Magnificent four palaces Amalienborg among them over an",
          "Make sure you see the changing of the guards here it is very good and you can get up really close. The rooms in the palace are beautiful.",
          "Great to see the four Palaces and guards on duty, however the museum is small, mostly just empty rooms to walk through and some areas behind glass featuring desks which are fairly cluttered. Visit the museum if you have the Copenhagen Card, not worth paying for if you don\u2019t.",
          "We'd decided not to visit Amalienborg due to mixed reviews. However we ended up in the large square amidst Amalienborg after following the marching band from Rosenborg Castle one Sunday morning, felt very Pied Piper like! It was a bitterly cold but pleasant walk passing through",
          "If you are going to come here, I would recommend that you get a combined ticket that would also allow you to visit The Rosenborg Castle. This place looks grand on the outside but you can only visit one of the buildings and only a tiny part of it. Most exhibits are behind the",
          "Interesting to find out about the history of the royal family. But the information is presented quite simply and we didn\u2019t find the rooms that special to look at. Worth doing if you have the Copenhagen card but not our favourite attraction.",
          "Go and see the changing og the guards every day at 12. Great with children. There is also a museum that is great to see when the weather is bad.",
          "This is Where Our Queen and crownprince and crownprincess. A museum is Also there Where you can see the the history of the Danish Royal House. If you are interested in history a must see in Copenhagen.",
          "I went first thing in the morning and there was no one there! It was amazing! One of the guards was very kind and allowed for me to take a picture with him as long as I didn't get \"too close.\" I loved that there wasn't a huge wall or gate around it. It says a lot about the",
          "Changing of the guard takes place at midday. If the Queen is in residence there is a full musical band accompanying the change. It is amazing how close you get to watch this. A must see if you visit Copenhagen",
          "As an Aussie, I enjoyed seeing the Palace and understanding who lived in which building. Kept looking out for Frederik and Mary who had just returned from a trip down under! The Changing of the Guard was amazing; the police were personable and kept the crowds in order but still",
          "Like most European countries, there is always a show with the Changing of the Guard. From the plaza there are a few corners where the royal guards are present, unlike England, pictures are each to take. Less formal, it is not uncommon to see the process with her kids riding",
          "Huge palace square. Very impressive. Unable to go inside any of the buildings due to time constraints. Definitely worth a visit. Glad I checked it out.",
          "This huge octagonal space was empty the day we visited. We didn't go into the palace or museum,but wandered around and watched the guards doing their thing. The 4 palaces surround the courtyard, and at the end of the road is the Marble Church. Behind the Palaces in the other",
          "Really not treally be missed - the changing of the guards. A lot grander a ceremony than that at Buckingham Pakace in London. There is an orchestra and especially during the wintertime when they are in their coats, looks quite impressive and interesting to watch. The tour of the",
          "We would have like to watch the changing of the guard - very tin soldier-like in their uniforms - but the downpour forced us to move on. Such a shame because the setting is wonderful.",
          "After reviewing all of the palace options, opted out of Amalienborg, but the plaza where it\u2019s situated is architecturally stunning, especially with the Marble Church in the background.",
          "We were lucky enough to watch the queen say her new year address and all the cameras were around , even without such an event it is worth visiting.",
          "This is a nice open area with four identical palaces on each side. These are still used as royal residences today. Be sure to go at noon for the changing of the guard ceremony, each day. If the royal family are in residence over winter, the ceremony is accompanied by a marching",
          "The weather was cool and there wasn't much pedestrian traffic. Architecture of the buidings was beautiful.",
          "Great to wander over here. You can get very close to the guards and on one day we passed they welcomed a foreign diplomat with a little ceremony which was interesting to see with various members of the royal family passing by as well.",
          "Spent the new years eve here,absolutely fantastic,everybody is allowed to do fireworks ,very unusual and unique..recomend",
          "I am sure this palace had more to offer but it is a very dark building and with limited information available in English it made it less than exciting. We also had a large group of young children visiting when we were there which didn't add to the overall enjoyment much.",
          "Changing of the guard, the history, elegance and fun of seeing how the Danes do it is worth a visit at the right time of day.",
          "This place was amazing! We watched the changing of the guards (which our 5yo thought was hilarious and intrigued at the same time!). We didn\u2019t go into the paid part of the site (inside the palace). Visited the adjoining church and simply walked around soaking up the atmosphere!",
          "Walking around the palaces in the squre, watching the palace guard activities, was a refreshing change to peering through theBuckingham palace fences. Denmark\u2019s royalty has a refreshing casual attitude and openness with their citizens.",
          "Well worth the time to stop and see the changing of the guard if you're there at noon. Easy access to the square. No admission charge. Can't get too close to the guards or they will remind you to step back.",
          "Be sure to be here at 12am for the daily changing of the guards. Only one of the four rococo aisles of the Palace can be visited",
          "The square is open and there is no admission fee. There are options to go in to some of the buildings depending on who is in residence at the moment. There is a changing of the guard at noon that is not to be missed ( the other times for the change, are boring).",
          "The changing of the guard at noon (When the Queen is in residence) is definitely one to see if you're in the city. As it goes on for an hour (with a lot of standing around). We took the time to go and look inside part of the palace. This was most interesting and free with the",
          "Stubbled across the changing of the guard as we arrived. Happens every day around noon. Nice to watch",
          "This royal palace complex, residence of the queen, and huge central courtyard is an impressive and apt representation of Copenhagen in all its glory. It says history, classic art, royal might and good city planning. Everywhere you look the sightlines capture something",
          "We took an hour-long guided tour and we visited the rooms of the castle. The tour guide was very good and enlightened us about the different functions and history of every room. Catch the changing of the guards at noon. It isn't the same as the one in Buckingham but it's",
          "Official residence of the royals and a museum. There is military guards here patrolling. If you are lucky you may see the royals.",
          "Very clean and worth a look. Changing of the Guard at noon. Soldiers march from the road under the archway so stand over that side of the square for a good view.",
          "These royal rooms are delightful to see and if you time your trip correctly you can see the changing of the Guard outside in the courtyard at 12 noon.",
          "This complex of 4 palaces is where the Danish royals actually call home. The museum provides an excellent overview of the history of the Danish Crown and the relationship with other royal houses in Europe. The changing of the guard is always fun but it was raining and we ended",
          "The actual palace is four grand palaces in a square where the changing of the guard can be seen daily; there is a beautiful central square and access to a museum about the royal family, including rooms replicating some of the palace rooms as they were in the past. The museum is",
          "We arrived here at 10.00, just as they were changing the guard (there is a much more elaborate ceremony at 12.00 too). The palace is the home of the Danish royal family, and comprises four separate buildings around a large circular open area. You can walk around this area",
          "If you're going to visit Denmark, of course you need to see where the queen lives. I thought we would be able to see some of the inside of the castle, but the only part you can go into is a museum in one wing of the castle. It was interesting, with a lot of the more modern",
          "The buildings are beautiful to admire from the outside - palaces set round a central square adorned with a statue of one of the Danish kings - Christian VIII?. The museum housed in one of the palaces is well worth a visit, setting out the history of Danish royalty with just",
          "After the change of guard, we visited the\u201d museet\u201d. It\u2019s a great visit to introduce the royal family and understand the history of the monarchy in Denmark. Rooms are not extravagant but interesting to see.",
          "Nice area not far from the water , good place to see on the way to Little Mermaid - impressive buildings and lucky enough to be there for the band and changing of the guard",
          "We got curious about this place because our walking tour with Ben stopped here, but opted to return at a later point of time. Rightfully so, as the museum linked to it (to be found in the building on the right of the road to the marble church, yes, the one that looks like being",
          "At 12 pm each day, the changing of the guard occurs at Amalienborg Palace. It is good to be there early for the start of the ceremony (which runs for about 15 mins, although you don't have to stay for its entirety) which is quite dramatic with drumming and calling out of",
          "Delightful area offering access to the waterway and a large open space in the centre of the city. Rooms were beautiful and exhibits very interesting. Being an active royal residence we were visited by Prince Joachim.",
          "Came here to see the Changing of the Guard, it happens every day at 1200 and is pretty cool to watch. Was pretty cold standing in the wind and rain though so plan carefully! It does go on for quite a long time but you can come and go as you please and you don't have to stay for",
          "Visited here on our way back from little mermaid. This is close by so we just walked to the castle. Since it was November the castle was closed for admission by the time we visited. The palace is large and still looking glamourous. We couldn't visit inside since it was closed.",
          "I enjoyed watching the changing of the guard and touring one of the palaces that has been made into a museum. I enjoyed learning about the history of the Danish royal family at the museum but wish they offered a good souvenir book for purchase.",
          "it was amazing visit the palace, and also see the guardian. It is very cosy and it is pretty nice. I am thinking come back to copenhaguen.",
          "Plan your visit so you can see the changing of the guard. While a nice little ceremony it is more casual than what you would see in England at the palace. It does reflect the casual attitude of the Danish population which is a little laid back and friendly.",
          "We did not go inside for a tour but we did watch the changing of the guard outside. It was a little boring (no band because the Queen was not at home). Still, it was nice to see.",
          "Four identical buildings connected to one another form the palace. One belongs to the queen, one for each of her 2 sons and one for invited guests. We spent a few minutes in the large open square and in that time we were lucky to catch a brief glimpse of the queen's car leave",
          "At 11:30 you can see changing of the guard, amazing! Before that visit Amalienborg rooms with royal apartments. Worth visiting.",
          "Walk here, not far from Tivoli. Gives a glimpse of the splendour enjoyed in 1 of 4 identical buildings built by the royalty of Denmark.",
          "Very interesting self guided tour of the Castle and, Armory, Grounds. This well worth the price of admission.",
          "When the Rosenborg Castle burnt out, the royal family moved to this castle. It is enormous with exceptional architecture and many details. Be sure to visit",
          "One of my favorite sightseeing places in Copenhagen. The Castle is located in the center of Copenhagen, with a nice view to the Opera House. I recommend this beautiful place.",
          "This palace is definitely more beautiful on the inside than it is outside and I believe it's still being used by the Danish royal family, which is quite cool. You can walk through a lot of their rooms and they also have some small antiques on display. I don't think it should",
          "We arrived to see the Palace and were able to walk through the square which surprised me. Four identical buildings facing on to the square, if the flag is up the monarchy are home. A beautiful walk through a beautiful square, very peaceful. If you would like you could visit the",
          "We didn't actually get to enter the palace but admired it from the outside. During our time there a crowd started to gather - as it turned out we arrived just in the for changing of the guard. If you're nearby shortly before noon you should definitely visit to watch this",
          "It is located in the heart of Copenhagen which can be easily reached from the central station on foot or cycling. There are guard shows sometimes in the square. Otherwise, it is nice to go there and enjoy the view.",
          "We didn't go inside on our visit but we did see the changing of the guard which happens every day at about midday. The guards leave Rosenborg Castle at 11.30am each day and march through the streets to arrive at Amalienborg at about midday. Great spectacle.",
          "The courtyard area around the palace is open to public and you can walk around. The changing of the guard takes place everyday at midday and it is worth seeing although I have to admit it was not the most impressive compared to some of the other ones we have seen elsewhere. It",
          "Watch the royal guards do their duty protecting her highness! Our tour guide was most helpful giving us the history and traditions still in play. Great sight right across the water from the opera house.",
          "Since the royalty occupies part of the palace,the rooms open to public are limited and they are crammed with antiques and things used by former kings and queens.We can enjoy the change of guards in the courtyard at 12 noon without taking the entrance ticket.",
          "Whether you walk, or ride is a bicycle rickshaw the Amalienborg Palace is something worth looking at. There is a changing of the guard at 12 noon, but guards can be seen at all times.",
          "It was an unfortunately wet day - but we wanted to see the change of guard taking place at midday. It was nice to see. The palace itself from the outside is a little underwhelming but well kept and secure. Was very close to our hotel so good attraction to see at ease.",
          "Amalienborg is special to us Aussies, seeing as Mary Crown Princess of Denmark is originally from Australia. Amalienborg houses the official residences of the Royal Family, which makes it a significant site in the Danish monarchy. It's free to enter, though you have to be",
          "A beautiful regal compound that will give you a glimpse of the royal life and history especially if you have an expert fantastic guide as we had that will give flavour to every detail he lays out about this place, enjoyed it, go for it...",
          "Not worth the money. We love castles and palaces and found this to be a very short visit to a very large palace. It\u2019s beautiful but there is not much to see. Off to see Rosenborg now hope it\u2019s better",
          "We stumbled upon this palace square by chance. We were so glad that we did. It has beautiful buildings all around it and a huge statue in the middle. There are also guards in dress uniforms with big fuzzy hats that are cool to see.",
          "I love the castles in Europe---we do not have this kind of history in the USA. Loved the changing of the guard too. Was one of the highlights of my trip.",
          "Nice display of historical royal apartments/rooms maintained as they were used by past royals, along with a number of rooms used for official business today. We caught the end of the Changing of the Guard just prior to our museum entrance. Not quite the same as Buckingham",
          "This is a beautiful square surrounded by striking buildings but I did not have time to explore further. It is nonetheless well worth a visit",
          "My least favorite of the 3 main castles/palaces in central Copenhagen. We visited as we had bought the discounted combo ticket for Rosenborg and Amalienborg. Not worth paying for Amalienborg even with the discount. Unless you visit on certain days/times, you can only see one",
          "Having missed Buckingham Palace we were determined to see the changing of the guard at Amalienborg. We wished we had data and could have looked up the ceremony details as it was very slow; had we known what to anticipate we may have stayed longer. It is worth arriving early",
          "After watching the changing of the guards, we ventured into the palace and really enjoyed it - especially the recreated rooms of the king & queen. Seems they lived cluttered and busy lives!",
          "During our stay in Copenhagen, we visited this large palace square several times. The only time that it was really busy was when the \"Changing of the Guard\" ceremony was in progress. For our other visits, the square was very quiet. It was wonderful to be able to admire the four",
          "The palaces of the reigning monarch. Subdued and tasteful. Placed in a very attractive plaza. Don't miss the gardens. Small but very well laid out.",
          "we stopped by only at 12 noon, to see the changing of the guards it was ok, to see old school traditions being handed down, we stayed for about an hr, till they were done. Not much else we did here but interesting to see it happen, hey it only takes an hour of your time, so why",
          "it consists of 4 buildings. Very well located. Beautiful design. The location of the palace square is amazing.",
          "Honestly, I was not very impressed. Christianborg and Rosenborg are much better, but you cannot miss the place where the monarch is living. Be there when there is a change of guards to add some spice to the experience.",

          "Diane & I visited and were impressed by the architecture and accessibility - you can walk right up to the buildings and peer in the windows, although I doubt you'd see much! Interesting to note you can often see Royals nipping out for a paper.......!!",
          "My wife loves all royalty wherever in the world. Denmark no exception She(and I) really liked the structure of the square with 4 identical buildings facing each other. Built initially for 4 wealthy families before Danish royalty took over. There is a small museum which devotes",

          "It's worth visiting Amalienborg for the architecture alone (four palaces, designed in the 1750s surround the square), but it's a bonus if you manage to see the Changing of the Guard. We were lucky enough to arrive just before noon when there is a complete change.",

          "I say this having visited Copenhagen twice before & never coming across this palace, you won't stumble across it if you stick to the main tourist runs. The square is effectively the centre of a little tourist hotspot with the guard changing at 1200, the marble church off one",
          "Changing of the guard is 12 noon. You can go in and visit the palace and return again if you haven't managed to finish, if you arrive at 11.15am like we did. Very helpful staff, one lady in particular, whose name we unfortunately didn't get was wonderful. Daughter on",

          "A great place to watch the tradition of changing the guard at the Danish Royal Court. Very similar in tone to Buckingham Palace, with a much more family feel to the affair.

          "This is an exquisite castle in Denmark filled with a great display of history through art and other royal possessions that are part of the Danish monarchy. \nIt is located in a busy area near the Marble Church and even though it's quiet, \u2026",

          "Definitely worth seeing this historic feature. You can really just walk to it from downtown Copenhagen and you'll see lots of other interesting things a long the walk. Like everything in Copenhagen,  doing things outside of the summer months will be a bit colder and darker but much more fulfilling due to the reduction of tourists.",

          "A really interesting place to see. All the architecture is amazing, all the sculptures and the design of the place. It's really nice to see how the guards work and how they do their routine. We didn't had a chance to see the inside, but just the outside is impressive",
          "There are 2 ways of looking at this palace \u2013 we can either call it a palace which allows crowd to pass by or a square which has identical buildings on 4 sides. In the center of this palace is a big statue of a member of the royal family and \u2026",

It made my day.",

          "I enjoyed visiting this museum but I did not like that I had to download a link which gave information of the plots and rooms. My husband was never handed a brochure when he paid for a visit so we o lu had the link to use. It was awkward finding the rooms matching the link.",
          "The castle tour will take between two and three hours to walk through. The gardens are very well maintained and the facility is easy to navigate. If you activate the free wifi and loginto their website, there is a free guide that you can access to tour the castle. It is well",
          "The castle itself is fine, up to par with other European royal castle, The \"crown jewel\", pun intended, of the visit is its Denmark's crown jewels exhibits downstairs. It is definitely worth the visit for that alone. Personally, this is much better than the exhibits of",
          "If you're interested in old world art and castles I say see this castle. It is large, but not as large as other European castles. It has some inetersting art, guns, swords, etc inside and also the crown jewels of Denmark are here as well. The grounds are small but nicely",
          "Located in the centre of Copenhagen and surrounded by a nice park, the castle is relatively small but as the palace of Christian IV and successive Danish monarchs, more than worth your time. Castle and grounds are well kept and the castle is not huge so can be visited in half a",
          "Probably one of the best tourist destinations in Copenhagen. A real medieval castle surrounded by a fantastic park. I strongly recommend that you take a few hours for a tour of the castle and just take a walk in the beautiful, well-kept park. For Copenhagen-card owners, a guided",

          "An interesting castle, which is free for children/teenagers. If you don't want to be parted with your bag take a really small one for you essentials. The rooms on the ground floor are quite dark. The treasury and the crown jewels in the basement were a highlight for us.",
          "Free wifi!! The castle was interesting and well-maintained. The grounds and gardens are spectacular. The glass and china rooms are fascinating. The audio tour and app have more information than you could possibly want. Highly recommend!",
          "What history and amazing things to see! This castle from the 1600s is superb.... Can buy combined ticket with Amalienborg and save a bit. The crown jewels that are kept here, as well as some of the Royal Household items are incredible. Also cool was the blood stained clothes",

          "There is a lot to see in this museum, and there are a lot of valuable stuffs on exhibition. You can get a combined ticket from here and visit Amalienborg Palace later.",
          "This palace is an easy walk from the N\u00f8rreport station and it gets busy and crowded. The building is very old and in the basement are held some exquisite jewels and treasures. One of the large precious stones look like the Pink Panther stone! These are all heavily guarded and",

          "This is a nice castle- good overview in the flier that gives a summary for every room. The app that also has information is a little bit to detailed and takes too long to read. The military band had trumpet and marching band perform on the balcony next to the castle, which was",
          "They said it used to be a castle but I can't find the big entrance for my photo op. The best I've seen and it's my first are crowns and jewelries and so many personal items of royalties in precious stones, ivory or metals. We didn't get to go around the garden but it was huge",
          "Upstairs there are 2 floors of galleries showing how the Royals lived. Highlight is the Treasury where crown jewels are kept. Take note you have to visit the galleries above before going to the Treasury.",
          "The castle is set in pretty formal gardens that are free to visit without entry to the castle. There was a nice caf\u00e9 in the gardens and it was also close to the botanical gardens so easy to visit both.",

          "Wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen. Don\u2019t miss this castle, there ARE so many to see but this one shouldn\u2019t be missed. Allow an hour plus to take in a leisurely tour of the castle and it\u2019s history",
          "This is very close to the centre of Copenhagen. It is a well organised tourist attractions and the main part of the castle contains masses of articles, in my opinion, too many. The Treasury was much more interesting with the equivalent to our Crown Jewels. Many of the items are",
          "Rosenborg Castle is a fascinating place to visit. Unlike many royal residences of its period, Rosenborg has much of it's period furnishings and personal effects intact. The castle is somewhat smaller and less grand than more famous royal residences, but the sense of history",

          "Set in the beatiful Kings Garden just outside the city centre, this castle is worth visiting, although it can get crowded at times.",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the Rosenborg Castle. They do a nice job of crowd control, so there are never too many people in any one room which makes the experience much more enjoyable. The Treasury is probably the best part of the tour as many of the displays are incredible.",
          "Some really interesting things to see and it is right in the middle of the city, Lovely gardens surrounding it,",
          "This is the best castle in Copenhagen! It is wonderfull! There are fornitures, royal jewels and beautiful things. The garden is cool!",

          "We did this as our final stop on the hop on hop off tour. We spent time walking around inside and it was fairly interesting. The definite highlights were - Musical cabinet - this huge music box plays every 30 or 60 minutes and it was amazing to hear. Over 300 years old and",

          "Fascinating old building in lovely grounds, plenty of quirky details to enjoy - Christian IV's tiled toilet for example! - this is well worth a visit. Interesting to view the Crown Jewels too. While we were waiting to go in, the guardsmen in the adjoining barracks were preparing",
          "The palace itself has a number of really interesting rooms. There is a map/written guide in English too so could read as we were walking round. A few of the collections seem so over the top, they become a bit ridiculous but I guess that's a sign of the Royals during the time",
          "This Castle is very small and more like a large house. It does have an impressive collection of art and jewels but don't expect a game of thrones style castle.",
          "Rosenborg Castle is a must visit, not so much to admire it but to wonder how a group of Rococo nobles could have built something in such atrocious taste. True, it was built as a party palace in an age where everything was over the top, but this place is way too much!",

          "Walking through the Kings Garden, and watching the Rosenborg Castle appear is fabulous. The park is a great place for Danes to unwind in the evenings and on the weekend and the Castle proves a nice backdrop. We did not go inside, though i can vouch for a walk around this",
          "Rosenborg Castle is a beautiful structure in its own right but is also filled with an amazing array of artifacts and the Crown Jewels. It is a fascinating example of a Renaissance Castle and a must-do activity if ever in Copenhagen. The Castle is just a short walk from the city",

          "One of the top 10 attractions , it is definitely worth visiting . 115K to get in. You have to put your bags in a locket but that is free of charge. Worth getting tickets in advance as the queue was quite long. You offer you a booklet and an app to view, hear info about each",
          "This is a nice summer palace, worth to see the treasury. Unfortunately there are now desciptions by the objects.",
          "This is not a stuffy walk through an old castle with everything behind glass walls. Everything here is up close and personal so you get a real feel for life in this castle. There were only a couple of rooms (with china and porcelain on display) behind glass walls. You can't",

          "Really enjoyed the castle visit not to mention topping it off by seeing the Crown Jewels. But we really enjoyed the history and the wonderful preserved pieces they have. The dark rooms made us feel what it must have been like back in 1600\u2019s. The grounds are a pretty walk but",
          "The castle is very interesting and so much to see, however you will miss a lot of you do not have guide. The great architecture is interesting, the bust, the porcelains, the clothing, the decor, the jewels, amazing jewels!",
          "Buying a ticket gets you into the castle which has 3 floors showing what the castle looked like years ago. Many individual rooms that are roped off house dishes and porcelain and precious antiques. The 2 basement levels houses the royal jewelry, crowns, antique swords etc. Lots",
          "It is worthwhile if you have the time, to visit Rosenborg Castle. Ask your guide about the kitchen and dining room. Don't miss the crowns at the end, in the heavily guarded basement.",
          "Visited here as part of a multi-castle day tour, and it was my favorite of the bunch. A bit crowded but it was high season. Be prepared for winding stairs and crowds, but rooms are mostly ample size to allow a bit of wandering and experiencing the views. Treasury has some lovely",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed the palace, it's a beautiful place. There is a tour done via your phone, the wifi is a bit patchy in some of the side rooms so I just used mobile data. The tour could do with providing more context about the people mentioned and their position in history,",
          "This is where the crown jewels are kept. The castle and grounds are beautiful. I would not miss this.",
          "Excellent presentation of art and history. There is an electronic phone guide that is very useful to learn about the castle. (You can learn about the room of mirrors, the mysterious chair, etc if you read the interesting writeups provided electronically.) Take your time, this",
          "We stopped in the park outside the castle while on a bike tour. I wish we had made time to tour the castle while in Copenhagen",
          "Very interesting venue and thoroughly enjoyed the visit. The cost per person is reasonable and the guide offered for free was very helpful. Each room was enjoyable with something new in each room! Definitely a must-do!",
          "Majestic from the outside, imposing. Not imposing like Buckingham Palace , but with lots of history. A must see for castle lovers, different but with similarities to other castles like change of guards etc. Different in the sense of size and also guards include females.",
          "Like a fairy tale the castle is situated in the middle of Kongens Have. Love architecture. Interesting history. Important is the Skattekammer with the crown jewelry.",
          "The throne/receiving room is a must when visiting. The rooms are ornately adorned, and the crown jewels of Denmark are in the basement. Really gives you a good feel for the Danish monarchy over the centuries.",
          "This palace,surrounded by a moat,and,indeed,a large park,has a great n8umber of spectacular items.If you buy a Parkmuseums ticket,you can also visit the State Museum of art,the Hirschsprung Collection,and more,all in the vicinity.",
          "Every inch of this castle's walls and floor spaces, it seems, is covered with art. It's a hoarder's dream of high-class, rich art and furniture all neatly arranged and kept up. That said, it's one of the most poorly labeled \"museums\" (for that's what it really is. Sure, there's",
          "The grounds and the castle are very pretty and interesting. Would recommend having a guide to get the full history",
          "Wonderful place with lots of grass lawns Lots of people picnic on the lawn on weekends. The castle is wonderful",
          "The Crown Jewels are not to be missed - amazing collection! The tour through the castle is not as impressive as Fredericksburg however.",
          "Great way to pass an hour or two, wondering the gardens and taking in the sights. Regardless of the amount of people, it never felt cramped. You're not too far from anything there so I recommend it. You won't need a whole day there. Very clean area, well maintained and an all",
          "My friends and I went here when the visited me in Copenhagen and it's quite beautiful. The King's Garden is a wonderful place to just relax, smell the lavender, and people watch. The Danish crown jewels are also kept here, which are stunning. Must see when visiting Copenhagen.",
          "Nice castle in the city centre. The highlight for me was the crown jewels. Backpacks are not allowed and have to be deposited in their lockers (free of charge). I spent 2 hours here and saw everything that i wanted to see.",
          "Visited this place fish thing in the morning straight after opening it's a little busy as everyone tries to go to the ticket office then use the lockers provided for storage as well. I would recommend visiting at about 11am in the morning as the morning rush would be gone by",
          "We have visited quite a few palaces- and this one is maybe the nicest we have seen. It is a very nice building with very nice gardens. The museum inside is breathtaking, leading you throughout all the furnished rooms used by the Danish Kings, Queens & families, and the icing on",
          "Inspect crown jewels, jewelry, ivory collections, and clocks. This was a quaint castle, but worth the walk through. Finally, on the top floor, make sure you find the glassware. Yes. Plates and glasses. Venetian glass work of the time makes this worth the visit by itself.",
          "It was originally built as a country summerhouse in 1606 for King Christian IV. It's beautiful inside and having a tour guide made the visit extra special.",
          "Well preserved royal castle with lots of interesting exhibits ( includes the original 17th century King\u2019s toilet). Audio guide available and excellent on line guide goes room by room with barcodes on some items. If you like castles and stately homes this is one of the best.",

          "We toured the castle while in Copenhagen. The grounds are nice. The castle has many rooms with all kinds of artifacts from the past 500 years or so including weapons, jewelry, carvings, artwork, and a bunch of eclectic items like a mirrored room, a handmade music box, and a",
          "This a lovely castle and the collection that it holds gives one a good insight of a royal life. Naturally, the royals led/lead a very opulent life, but it\u2019s not over the top compared to some of their past European counterparts. The grounds of the castle are lovely and I feel",
          "Within easy walking distance of Stroget, Rosenborg provides a look at Danish royal life. Wonderful architecture with interesting artifacts within. So glad we had a chance to tour here.",
          "One of the best collection of royals in this castle. Pick up the brochure as you enter which gives the details of all the rooms and it is done in an orderly fashion. The treasure is in the next building basement. You are given a timed ticket which allows you to enter with few",
          "You can't miss this castle! Beautiful gardens and buildings (inside and out) with the crown jewels included in the tour.",
          "You will get so much more information and the extra fee isn't a lot. We booked online and met our guide Louisa. There were only 2 others and they were busy taking pictures so we had the guide pretty much to ourselves. She was a font of information (history major) and gave us",
          "I did a self guided tour of this castle. There was very little available for information. The maps we received at the ticket counter did little more than to label the rooms and their locations. I did not have much idea of what any of the items were or significance of the",
          "We would highly recommend you see Rosenborg Castle. It\u2019s an incredible place with beautiful original Danish artifacts that must be seen. Don\u2019t miss it!",
          "Beautifully maintained tranquil grounds, which are perfect for a stroll regardless of the weather! Worth taking the time out to visit.",
          "Loved seeing all of Rosenborg Castle. You can tour the interior which is well maintained. The top floor with the large ballroom and tapestries is especially nice. The Danish crown jewels are in the treasury in the basement of the castle. The grounds themselves are lovely and",
          "The gardens are quite vast (being in the centre of a capital), laid out beautifully and the castle with it. Not to miss.",
          "Wonderful and well maintained Castle. Perfect organisation typical of Danish people. Bravo! Only remarks the Treasure room so small, tiny and dark . That's a pity for an heritage like this.",
          "Better than the royal palace...! Well preserved with an amazing atmosphere. Surely worth a visit. The gardens around are amazing, too.",
          "A short walk from city center and our Hotel we were pleasantly surprised with Rosenborg Castle. We didn't pay to go into the castle however we did walk around the grounds which were beautiful. Excellent views were also appreciated on different parts of the grounds.",
          "If you are the royal guard changing fans, you should come to Rosenborg at 1130 And follow the guards to march to Amalienborg Palace for the change at 1200! A difference experience from other country to march with the guard in the street!",
          "It\u2019s nice to walk around there if it\u2019s sunny day many options of resturant but I recommend the street food after the bridge",
          "Stunning castle in large park, easy location to reach by bicyle, beautiful rooms, amazaing crown jewels in basement including royal crowns. arrive early or late to miss crowds.",
          "We did not tour the inside of the castle but the outside and grounds were amazing. I wished I had my Kindle and could just spend the day there. There were benches everywhere, plenty of shade, and lots of people enjoying the day. It was peaceful and relaxing, with so many spots",
          "A two minute walk from our hotel, so we visited a couple times. Didn't do the interior tour but admired many times from the surrounding green space and gardens. Very nice!",
          "I found this to be a small historic Palace rather than a castle, beautiful exterior with splendid interior, don\u2019t forget to take the information leaflet at the entrance, you can read about the different parts of the palace while walking through, I loved the marvelous cupboards",
          "Great castle surrounded by garden, nice collection of artifacts related to Dutch royals. Castle policy requires checking bags and other personal items, so come 15 min prior to reserve a locker",
          "We spent 2 hours at the castle and grounds. It was amazing. We had the fortune of seeing the changing of the guards and the associated ceremony. The grounds are immaculate and the shrubbery designs in the gardens are unlike anything I've seen before. Embedded within each",
          "One of the best I've ever seen. True treasures.Nice well kept castle in a neat and organised garden, full of flowers. If you have limited time in Copenhagen keep this one on the shortlist.",
          "Beautiful small palace. Stroll through the park, relax outside, then it is somehow bigger inside than you would estimate when walking around it. True gems, surprising architectural extras, conserved with eye for detail. Breathing history. Highlights: the large hall with the",
          "This was a very historic castle. The grounds are beautiful and the inside very interesting. Do not miss the jewels in the basement. It adds a little to the ticket price and is optional. My advice go for it. When are you going to have that opportunity again?",
          "Three floors of antique furniture and objects, such as glassware, China, paintings, etc. If not for the provenance I doubt whether an estate sale would generate much interest. BUT then, you enter the basement and the Royal Treasury. Here is where you will find items that are",
          "Period furniture, art, ivory, amber & glass work is outstanding. Crown jewels also. Grounds are beautiful too. Would recommend spending a.whole day here.",
          "While enjoying our second stay in Copenhagen, we again visited the Rosenborg Castle. The castle is located in the central part of the city but it is surrounded by the botanical gardens and other parks. Because of its location, the castle is easily accessed by public transport",
          "Very nice place, the castle is huge and you are walking in group's, worth to see. Around the castle is a huge park and its completely free, so if you wana skip the case you can still enjoying outside and take a great photos. You need to leave your stuff in locker, so do not",
          "Very quaint, little castle with 3 different sections to it. Loved seeing the Crown Jewels and all the Ivory work from the queen and princess\u2019 lathe. We used our Copenhagen Card to get in here for free.",
          "A place in the trip that should not be missed. Gardens all around and the tour of the museum is really great and detailed. The crown jewels on display is something that u don't see often.a place to spend your afternoon and relax.",
          "My wife and I visited Rosenborg Castle, partly because admission was covered by our Copenhagen Card and partly because it is so close to a couple of other museums we were interested in. It was also a stop for our Hop Off/Hop On bus. We waited for the time on our ticked, then",
          "We were on a cruise ship but decided to visit the Castle on our own. Very glad that we did. The castle is easy to find and there was not a long line to enter. They sell timed entries on the internet if you know what time you will arrive. Otherwise you can just show up and",
          "We bought tickets and were given a time to enter (about 45 minutes wait). The floors are not handicap accessible. The sequential movement made it easy to go from room to room. But, there was not enough information to read and understand. It is hard to download an app for",
          "Nice castle! Were there in the summer morning, and it was great! you of course must to see this nice place!",
          "When checking the entry times, look at the castle website and not at a guide book. The DK guide book to Copenhagen says the castle is open until 6 in the summer months (including August), however this is incorrect, the castle was only open until 5 when I went (on 14 August).",
          "One of the smaller castles around Denmark, but right downtown Copenhagen. You can easily spend the same amount of time inside the castle and outside in the park and gardens. Any traveler should at least take a walk in the park.",
          "The gardens are just beautiful and perfect for a relaxing stroll, I\u2019d recommend a visit. We never went into the castle but the building itself was beautiful too.",
          "Quite a nice castle, very well preserved and filled with all kinds of things from the mundane to the opulent. I wouldn't say it's a big castle but there are a lot of things to see and learn there, great place if you want to get to know more about Denmark's history. Right next to",
          "Rosenborg Castle itself is an amazing sight with great architecture and beautiful gardens. The royal rooms inside had great art and interesting artefacts. It is full of history with good information along the way. The best part was seeing the Crown Jewels. Would highly recommend",
          "Not only is this castle well maintained, it has am amazing collection of items from its time - everything used for meals, swords, crown jewels, armor, guns, art of all sorts, clothing... One of my favorite parts were actually the amazing ceilings from room to room. Great way to",
          "For me was the best historical objective in Copenhagen...It,s like a castle from a fairy tale. It is surrounding by a very nice park.",
          "Recommend buying your tickets online. The queue can be quite long once you get there. There is a tour guide website you can use but our internet connection is slow and it used a lot of battery on your phone. We were in time for the guided tour but our entry time wouldn\u2019t let us",
          "A huge castle and good for a snap or two. Marvel the structure and architecture. The gardens are well maintained.",
          "We got here at 3.45 thinking we had 75 mins to walk around the palace. We got a timed admission for 4.30 which gave us just 25 mins to look round and 5 mins to pick up our possessions from the locker as the staff said they promptly close at 5. Personally I think they should have",
          "I am not a fan of touristy places like this. I struck it at the height of summer; thousands jostling for a look around. However you can appreciate it from various vantage points in the park close by. I don't think there is a need to go in unless you have a special interest.",
          "Interesting castle but a bit tricky to manage with young children. Was very busy when we visited (early afternoon, mid week in summer) which meant we had to wait for about an hour for a slot to enter the main building and treasury in the basement. Very hard to move around with",
          "We spent a lovely afternoon here playing cards and just enjoying the sun. And roses! It was our good luck to make it here while the flowers were in their prime. Beautiful and peaceful right in the city center.",
          "Smaller than the Christiansborg Palace so it can seem crowded as you walk through the various rooms. Very ornate furnishings and lots of old paintings. A lot to see. The grounds are nice to walk around. I would definitely include it on my list of things to see in the city.",
          "A lovely castle with lots to see, soldiers on guard, old living quarters of the Danish royal family and a treasury with some of the royal jewels. Lovely gardens.",
          "This small fairytale-like castle in Copenhagen is well worth a visit as it is more intimate than many larger and grander castles in Europe. This castle, built in the early 1600's, was the favorite of Christian IV who died here. There is even a showcase with his clothing from a",
          "You\u2019ll need at least two to three hours to explore the castle and extensive grounds. Gardens are well worth the visit.",
          "The Copenhagen Card will get you in for \u201cfree.\u201d Even if you have to pay, visiting this Castle is well worth the price. We walked from Nyhaven and came through the gates to see the beauty of Rosenborg Gardens. There is good reason why over 2 million people visit here. The",
          "Disappointing for what it is, expensive to go in and very long queues in the heat, we just did the outside and moved on,.",
          "I went to visit the jewelry mainly but then they force you to visit everything before getting there: i was not interested before and the visit didn't convinced me as well after the jewels were impressive but we were not lucky and got stocked 1locked! for a good 30 min or more",
          "Rosenborg is a nice Castle in a beautiful place. When we visited There were lots of Hamlet shows. Very interesting.",
          "Park is large and beautiful - well frequented by the Danes and the tourists. the building is like a fairy castle with lots of towers. The tour of the interior was excellent and well worth the 115Kr it cost - there are many rooms to look at on 4 floors and the crown jewels must",
          "This is a really nice palace in Copenhagen with lots of history as well as the Danish Crown Jewels on display. Well worth the visit - but go early when there are no crowds.",
          "You can see the exquisite fine collection from the past.... small palace yet mesmerizes you with its collections. Dont forget to visit the basement. Easily accessible via metro. We had no wait nor long lines. We had taken the CPH pass for 48 hours which was very useful.",
          "You can see rooms on five floors, including two basement levels (one for the treasury and the other for wine and weapons). There are many beautiful and unique items, but we were particularly impressed with the 3-D ceiling decorations and intricate ivory carvings.",
          "Me and husband had a stop off on our cruise at Copenhagen, so we decided to go around Rosenberg Castle. We had around a 40 min wait to get in which was fine, we explored the lovely gardens and managed to catch the changing of the guard! Any bags that cannot fit into their box",
          "Timed entrance keeps the crowd reasonable. Start at Ground level, the 2nd living level,on up to the throne room on the 3rd level, then the treasury in the basement. The personal bathroom, trick chair, the queen's nude picture on the ceiling. The King's throne of narwhal",
          "We had to wait a short time to enter the castle so enjoyed a stroll around the garden before going in. The castle contains a lot of interesting portraits, paintings, tapestries and other antiquities which bring to life the periods of the castles occupation by the Danish Royal",
          "This is a very interesting castle as it is still original, compared to Christiansborg, which burned a few times. The visit is in two parts. First, you visit some of the rooms in the castle. Some are rather nice, while some are dark and not offering so much interest. But",
          "Rosenborg Slot may is not the largest castle in the city, but it is certainly the most beautiful! Its architecture is reminicent of the dutch houses in Amsterdam, but more ornate and elegant. The setting couldnt be better, the gardens sorrounding the castle are also beautiful",
          "Booked the tickets online before we went to save some time. This was simply to do, sent email with tickets straight away and had no trouble using them. You can pay for a guide but we did not. You can pick up a nice paper leaflet with the castle layout when you are there. You",

          "Free withCopenhagen Card, but you still need to queue to convert it into a ticket and wait the entrance time slot. Allow an extra 30min to the visit for that. It tajes about 1hr30/2hrs for the Palace plus the garden on top. Combine with Kunst Museum nearby and botanical Gardens",
          "The Rosenburg Castle is located in central Copenhagen with an interesting history and the Danish Royal Jewels. We booked the English language tour on-line that meant that we jumped the queues and had a very informative tour guide for 45DKK each.",
          "Such and interesting and beautiful \"castle\". They recommend one hour, entrance it timed but I would say take your time and stay at least two so that you can really appreciate the beauty of the castle. the grounds are free to enter and are beautifully kept.",
          "We visited late July on a weekday; arrived at around 1100 am and were assigned an entry time an hour and 20 minutes later. So, hot tip, if you want to maximize your time, buy a ticket online and pick a time. It turns out, this a big tourist bust site, with loads of people",
          "The castle is fairly typical except for the crown jewels. They are very special and interesting. Would have liked to explore the gardens but the tour was moving on to another place. Individuals visitors without reservations were having a long wait.",

          "We toured this castle museum with Richard Karpen (separate review). It\u2019s a great way to learn more about Danish history. The Crown Jewels are beautiful. Lots of interesting rooms and displays.",
          "Very interesting, the gardens are very peaceful and popular with the locals in nice weather. When you visit here, don\u2019t miss the Crown Jewels.",
          "I stumbled across Rosenberg Castle and Gardens after an afternoon spent wandering in the botanics (they\u2019re pretty much down the road from one another so good sites to combine into a day trip if you get there early!). The grounds are very picturesque to great for taking some",
          "What a great place to visit. You can begin by walking through the King's Garden and snapping some wonderful photos of flowers you've probably never seen before. While wandering about, we came across a rehearsal of an unusually presented piece of theatre but were not there to",
          "I visited the castle in July as solo. You can purchase the entrance ticket and need to put your bag in the locker for security reasons. The castle seems not too big but inside has several floors including downstairs to see and lots of art works. Can take photos and can be",

          "Wonderful Palace which houses the Danish Crown Jewels with lovely gardens to walk around. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Just looked from the outside. Nice garden and great park. Dead ducks in the pond was a special sight. Floating feet up along with big carp-fish. Had a glimpse off army musicians training close by.",
          "Really impressive, and worth visiting. The paintings, marble work and artifacts centuries old were great viewing. Try to go when there aren\u2019t multiple tour groups, otherwise, moving among rooms and areas of interest is more like you are in a hurd of cattle!",
          "A must see attraction while visiting Copenhagen. Beautiful gardens surround a former Royal Residence. Each room decorated with family treasures, art and furniture. Throne room impressive. Highlight is the trip into the vault to see the Royal treasures,from crowns to weapons, to",
          "This is the one former Royal Palace that really is worth spending time going through slowly,. Used by the Royal Family until about 1710 it is now the place where all of the royal jewels are stored and showcased in the \"basement.\" The upper floors are filled with portraits,",
          "Stunning castle and didn\u2019t actually book to visit this until we got to Copenhagen. Worth several hours here possibly 4 to get a good view of castle. Check online but they also do changing of the guard around 12 and they march over to another area. Soldiers on guard outside who",
          "As royal palaces go, Rosenborg Castle is quite small. But the exhibits on display are beautiful, intriguing and very interesting. So a visit is very much recommended. To avoid being overwhelmed by crowds the tickets are sold with a designated entry time. If you miss your slot",
          "We arranged for a small group tour through the castle website. A few in our group were late getting there (taxi got lost- unbelievable!), and they waited for us, helped our older folks manage. The stories made the history come alive. Excellent tour guide (wish I could remember",
          "We had a guided tour of the Castle and it was very informative and interesting. You can go all over and the descriptions by the guide were wonderful. Such a sense of a different kind of history and how and why it came to be. Whatever you do, don't get in the way of the guards",
          "We passed through the grounds on foot. The grounds are now a public parks with people doing all sorts of relaxing activities. The park was clean and well maintained. Definitely a nice visit.",
          "Definitely visit the Castle! Loved the wine room, crown jewels, furniture, dishes, throne, etc. It was very interesting to view the architecture and art. Thoroughly enjoyed our 3 hours at the Castle.",
          "This is an impressive facility and collection of furnishings and art collections more than 300-400 years old. With three floors in the castle plenty to see along with the crown jewels in the basement area. The opulence of the period is overwhelming.",
          "The castle is stunning - crammed full of Royal furnishings, curios and the Crown jewels. Well worth visiting.",
          "Lovely castle and park, which is open to the public. There is an entrance fee to the castle. It\u2019s here the Guards reside and march from to Amalienborg everyday at around 11.00am. Plenty of space here for relaxing in the middle of the big city.",
          "One of the best I've ever seen. True treasures. If you have limited time in Copenhagen keep this one on the shortlist. Be prepared for hordes of Asian tourists and try to go off hours.",
          "My wife and I visited the Palace during our stay in Copenhagen. The Palace itself is in a beautiful garden setting. The cost was 115K/person. There is a wonderful collection of items to see in the Palace, including the crown jewels. The solid silver lions are also incredible. We",

          "We had a beautiful, sunny day to visit and loved the gardens. In the future we would probably take a picnic lunch to enjoy in he gardens. The Castle is very pretty too. Small restaurant on the premises has very limited menu, but is an option (with all outdoor seating) if you",

          "Really enjoyed touring this castle and beautiful grounds. The ceilings in some of the rooms were outstanding and the floors were as well. Definitely these crafts are lost arts. Loved seeing all the people using the grounds for leisurely enjoying the day. Highly recommend touring",

          "We live in CPH so decided to go for the offer to view many attractions on one ticket. Rosenborg castle was our first stop. We were particularly impressed with the app and that you can tour at your own pace. It was a hot day and the castle was warm. The highlight is the area you",
          "Once upon a time a King built a castle for his summer home, as you do. Who doesn\u2019t love a moat, the Crown Jewels as worn by our Mary, swords and stories of whoopsie cushions and ornate commodes - right in the middle of Copenhagen.",
          "Full disclosure : we had such good weather that we only went on the outside where the gardens are pristine. Small \"changing\" of the guard routine was a bonus",
          "The view of the castle was great, especially with the surrounding moat. We didn't go inside the castle, however we did detect a photo shop next to it. Several photographs were really great and we ended up spending quite a sum on two photographs. We also bought two solid looking",

          "If you plan to visit the castle inside do book online since it saves you standing in the queue which could be excessive. If you enjoy history then do venture indoors but if you just want a stroll, a picnic and maybe see the guards preparing for the changing, stroll around the",
          "This extremely beautiful castle holds a lot inside. Most notable are the thrones and the crown jewels. There is also a lot on Danish culture, artifacts, and past kings/rulers which is at a high level of detail, but I feel one should at least get a basic understanding since it'll",

          "This was a vibrant and beautiful park, filled with locals and visitors. The castle area is crowded, but worth the visit!",
          "I did not visit the castle itself due to lack of time but it is located in a very beautiful garden and park.",
          "Unlike most palaces and historical residences, this place feels actually lived in and comfortable. You could really imagine how it's residents lived on a daily basis. The gardens are beautiful and the crown jewels are super impressive.",

          "I used to walk in this park everyday when I lived in Copenhagen and I must say:it's beautiful in every season! Covered in snow or in the sun, it's a must see. The visit of the castle, though, is not as good. Crown jewels are kept in the castle but the price of the ticket is too",
          "Walking through the castle you can use an app to learn about each room in English and there is free WI-FI. There are a lot of interesting things to see throughout the castle and with the admission fee you can go into the basement and view the crown jewels which are gorgeous. The",

          "If you can only see one castle in Copenhagen, I think Christiansborg would be a better choice as there is more to do and see there. However this was a nice place to spend an hour and is close to many other nice parks and museums. The castle itself is filled with beautiful art",
          "This is very peculiar castle. It is not huge. However, it has a lot of small rooms, which makes you feel like this is a large castle. Still totally worth visiting, especially Crown Jewels.",

          "I loved this palace because of the man in the top hat whose guided tour I jumped on at the last moment. He\u2019s simply hilarious but also highly knowledgeable; the tour made the visit entirely worthwhile. A beautiful spot that I highly recommend but one that is made much more",
          "Interesting but very dark in many parts of the Castle. The jewels were amazing and the building fascinating.",

          "We had a visit to this castle at the end of one of our tours and it was a lovely place for some photo snaps. Very well kept gardens, a little tearoom, lockers, a small souvenir shop and bathrooms, although they were not the cleanest I\u2019m afraid - maybe too many tours! Enjoyed",

          "I was happy we made the stop here as we did not make it to Fredericksborg and made a quick pass through Christiansborg. A local told us this was the best and I believe they were right. He castle itself is quite small but had four levels including the basement. Plenty of items",
          "I was spell bound despite not being big fan of castle and museums .very well documented and wasy to follow . All floors capture life of monarchy well. They have website which you van open on phone and with free wifi you can follow and know about each and every detail . Treasury",

          "This is very much worth seeing but be aware you have to queue to get a ticket (if if you have a Copenhagen card) and then wait a while longer until it is your allocated time to visit (visiting times are staggered). It's poosible to save a bit of time by buying the tickets online",
          "We were pleasantly surprised with this place. The museum is well organized and there are so much stuff to see! We were surprised to see how preserved the artifacts and castle are. And don\u2019t forget to visit the basement to see the jewels. Spectacular!",

          "If you are in Copenhagen for more then a couple of days than you should probably go to have a look at it. Solid castle not as old as it is fascinating it is a must to go if you want to experience the city to the fullest. Be aware at the hours it is open because they vary a lot.",
          "I missed the crown jewels because the time Google recommends was too short, but I would be perfectly happy to see the whole exhibit again at the same (very reasonable) price. The place is gorgeous and overflowing with treats of Baroque art, \u2026",
          "A must visit castle if you are in Copenhagen. I had managed to visit it on my last day in Copenhagen and had to hurry for my flight.. but it was all worth it! One must definitely check out the Crown Jewels which are on display!! And you don\u2019t want to miss feeding the fishes in lake near the castle..absolute delight!!",
          "The rooms are full of exhibition item so you really get a unique glimpse of the lives of European nobility. The upstairs felt cramped with too many items (every inch of walls are covered with paintings and ornaments) and not enough light \u2026",
          "A glimpse in the history of Denmark, great place for a traveler to stop by. And for those who dream of a fairytale proposal, great location to do it, guys!! \ud83d\udc4c",
          "Perfectly keeped castle, very organized visit. Nice quality/price rate. Lovely park around the castle. Very nice the visit to the treasure room.",
          "Loved our time here. If your in Copenhagen for a few days its worth going here. I would suggest going early in the morning  before the crowds turn up.",
          "The castle is absolutely beautiful. If you are interested in knowing more about the history of the castle, be sure to bring a fully charged device. You could connect to their WiFi and get a detailed written guide about the castle. That \u2026",
          "A well manicured museum and collection, with excellent information provided on the website to guide you on your visit. Very impressive rooms, fun to discover and learn about the history of the palace and the royalty.",
          "Yes that\u2019s me in the photos. Feel free to follow me on my Instagram. I have more photos of this beautiful place but won\u2019t post them here in case it gets misappropriated. But this place is beautiful! Entrance fee is pretty cheap plus you get the views and get to visit two museum!!",
          "Amazing garden. It's possible to feed fish in the lake near the castle. Nature is so green even in January. I discovered this place accidently, just walking around the city. Here you can see wonderful species of birds. I've never seen them before. So it's a must-see place in Copenhagen.",
          "Definitely worth a visit. The throne room is luxurious. Pay attention to the thrones, delicate tapestries. Also not to miss: the green glass room (Venetian glass collection) and the treasury ( basement ). Keep the ticket carefully, as you \u2026",
          "Beautiful,  historic, wonderful tour. We all thoroughly enjoyed it, including my 2 teenage sons. The treasures in the basement were priceless and stunning.\nHighly recommend.",
          "We headed to Rosenborg Castle Gardens, by now in glorious sunshine.  The castle is a beautiful building and the grounds are dotted with statues and formal displays, although there wasn't much greenery in January!  There were plenty of \u2026",
          "What an amazing place the treasury was particularly good. The artifacts are very well looked after and displayed. The staff were very friendly and helpful.",
          "The castle is tiny (relatively speaking for a castle) but absolutely stunning. Every room is completely unique in a different style. Every surface is covered with paintings, carpets and wood decorations. The extravagance is almost overwhelming. Definitely worth a visit",
          "Great Renaissance Castle, with beautiful reception rooms. Lovely gardens, great pictures might be taken here. Visit also the Crown Jewels, if you have the time to do so. \nThe best moment is the changing of guardsplease dont miss it. Just \u2026",
          "Historical castle rich in history of the Danish royal family.   Smaller than it looks.  Amazing crown jewels",
          "The Rosenborg Castle has reopened. So happy about it...",
          "Famous for being one of the best preserved castles in Europe, Rosenborg Castle is definitely worth a visit. From the Great Hall room with its exquisitely preserved thrones to the mesmerising Crown jewels in the basement, you will be \u2026",
          "I didn\u2019t have time to go inside, there is one big garden nearby also looks beautiful. During spring or autumn must be looked more colorful than in winter that I went.",
          "Beautiful castle. \nIf possible go inside. This should be better option than visiting the palace museum. \nThe garden in front it is much more beautiful in summer and autumn than december (obviously).",
          "This palace was definitely worth the money. I was wary at first due to the size in comparison to other palaces I have travelled to in the past but I found it insightful. There was a map that contained information on all of the rooms and \u2026",
          "Very nice visit. The website offers a decent guided tour, with items having labels for you to easily find out more about them. The most impressive is certainly the crown jewels. But the palace itself is filled with very interesting \u2026",
          "Definitely recommend seeing if you have limited time in Copenhagen. Castle unlike any I've visited before. Small but very rich in detail.",
          "Loved it. A small quirky castle.\nVery interesting",
          "Worth a visit (free with the copenhagen card). The palace has many rooms and the garden is also beautiful.",
          "Cool palace grounds though the museum itself is pretty limited. Spent only 35 minutes here. Long waiting time. Forced to spend 30-40 minutes outside in the courtyard and it was pretty cold and windy.",
          "Beautiful castle which totally deserves a visit. Guides available in different languages. The crown is AMAZING! Will take you one-two hour(s) to complete the tour. After the visit, you can relax in the very nice garden!",
          "Beautiful inside and outside. Nice garden and park also. To see",
          "I enjoyed my visit to the castle. If you love learning about history you will enjoy the castle. It\u2019s a different history to learn rather then the usual Viking history and it was a great visit.",
          "Very interesting and surprising interior and architectural features (a centuries old surround sound 'Winter Room' for example). But otherwise darker and less impressive than expected. However, if you want to see some crown jewels without being pushed about like sheep... This is the Castle for you!",
          "A beautiful castle full of incredible artifacts of 17th century and later. Truly marvelous, I recommend visiting it for anybody who is a first-timer in Copenhagen.",
          "Even if you have a pass you need to wait in a long line (in the rain when I went) then you wait in a long line to get a locker. Then it\u2019s time to line up in the rain again to wait in a queue to get in. These places are open limited hours \u2026",
          "Good old structure maintained. All the old paintings are well preserved. The throne and crown are good citings.",
          "Very disappointing experience... The castle is tiny, there\u2019s no guide or audio guide and the only leaflet available is confusing and with limited information.. Not recommended unless you want a place to wait for the rain to pass",
          "Good visit, short and entertaining if you\u2019re into history.",
          "Worthwhile visit! Beautiful old castle with gorgeous exterior and stunning interior. So many neat rooms to see and historical artifacts. It's also surrounded by amazing gardens. Below it is where the crown jewels are kept. Also definitely worth checking out. Highly recommended!",
          "The castle was nice but very rare info inside, no stories are written there and you can hardly understand what is inside even if you scan the QR code that takes you to thr website it lacks many info. Needs improvement.",
          "A beautiful historic castle. It's actually a castle I could imagine living in. The first rooms are outstanding and they keep getting better.",
          "Was very excited to visit the place. Saved the visit for my last day in town for a couple hours before heading to the airport. I showed up at opening, 10am, only to get a ticket for 40 minutes later. It was suggested that I take a walk in \u2026",
          "Wow. Amazing important antiquities that are well worth the price of admission. Don't be like the young Americans who were rude to the military guards and tried to sneak in with out paying. Be better than that. Gardens are great for a rest after riding around Copenhagen.",
          "Castle in the heart of Copenhagen. Explore history of the kings and quines (mostly kings) of Denmark. The castle staff is very particular with the order you explore the castle in, so tread carefully as you see the halls splendour of riches \u2026",
          "Amazing castle even more wonderful inside the building for me. Thousands of pictures in all walls with some extremely beautiful and ancient decorated rooms, furniture, treasury items... It is a must see in Copenhagen! Really worth it with \u2026",
          "The line for the entry tickets (you still have to line up with the Copenhagen Card) could be better managed, but we found out why it was so slow - they restrict the number of people entering the castle, so when you eventually get your \u2026",
          "Went here on a solo holiday to Copenhagen and absolutely loved it, hugely recommended. The garden and park next to the castle are gorgeous but the real treat is to go round the castle on a tour and see all the amazing antiques, paintings \u2026",
          "More like a stately home than a castle. Lovely to see inside; very interesting. Not accessible to all.",
          "Not a good experience. We were total 8 people including 2 kids and we were given two different tickets just for reusing someone else tickets at the ticket counter with different time. Big tall and fat security guard near entrance of castle \u2026",
          "Simply a beautiful spot. Definitely to be on your to do list.",
          "A great glimpse into what the castle life was like at the time. Very detailed cabinets, artwork, tapestries displayed. The Great hall is the best part of the tour.",
          "Gorgeous gardens. The curators have done an excellent job of presenting each room representing various eras and notable kings.",
          "Beautiful castle to visit. Very impressive. Was with my little girl their and she loved it",
          "Amazing grounds, I didn't get a chance to go inside but just walking around the grounds is magical",
          "The pieces of arts from ivory and amber there are uniqly perfect",
          "This was a last minute decision and definitely one we don't regret! The place was magnificent and the way it was decorated surpasses all expectations! Just a piece of art! Worth visiting!",
          "The castle was built in the Dutch Renaissance style in 1606. The castle, now state property, was opened to the public in 1838. The Rosenborg Castle Garden is the country's oldest royal garden and attract an estimated thousands of visitors every year.",
          "This was my second visit to Rosenborg Castle, and I think I enjoyed it even more than the first. They do a great job with the booklets, which are informative, and provide interesting, and sometimes even funny, stories about the past \u2026",
          "Really cool museums where you can see a palace that has preserved its old historical decor, which are beautiful. 115kr for entrance, can easily spend a couple hours exploring. Not the biggest exhibits, but some beautiful pieces.",
          "Amazing castle! Allow about 2 hrs for a visit. The great hall with its glass and porcelain exhibits are a must see. The basement with its collectibles and jewelry is really special. The gardens are also nice to hangout or walk about.",
          "Visited the gardens and grounds. Did not go inside. Beautiful piece of history used for barracks and tourism. Clever Danes!",
          "What an exquisite castle experience. Great collections. The Royal jewels and the remarkable Christian IV's Crown, simply breathtaking",
          "Beautiful and opulent. Nice for a quick wander around, but there's so much detail in each piece that you won't be able to see it all if you tried.",
          "Very good tourist attraction in Copenhagen.. Many attractions are closer to this place",
          "Fun time with the family.",
          "Amazing to see the excessive oppulance of the old monarchs of Europe. A great history lesson and well worth the visit.",
          "Very worth the visit. The crown jewels are spectacular and so is the throne room. I would say the lighting could be better to see all the intricate details of the upper floors.",
          "The castle and the gardens are quite beautiful. It is definitely one of the top sights of Copenhagen. The rooms are very well decorated and there is one full of mirrors. You need a few hours to enjoy this place. It is worth a visit.",
          "Beautiful place! The best season to visit it is on spring (because of the garden). The visit of the castle is about 1 hour.",
          "Wonderful castle but extremely rude staff!",
          "Very interesting! Don't touch anything though! Very much enjoyed all the exhibits and history.",
          "Unique and dark palace with Danish Crown jewels.",
          "Adorable palace that has a lot of rooms with mirrors, golden things and treasure.",
          "Worth the wait! You will probably queue for tickets, but don't be discouraged. We got there early, but took a later tour time and went to the National gallery across the street for and hour and a half. Then came back and there were no \u2026",
          "It was raining heavily when I visited. Despite that, it's worth a visit. It's a bit small compared to the grand castles in Europe but it's very well maintained. Definitely pay a visit to the crown jewels at the basement!",
          "A lot bigger than it looks, allow a good 2 hours for your visit.",
          "Very pretty. Really nice gardens around. Didn't go inside but was already worth from the outside.",
          "A must visit place at Copenhagen....may take an entire day if you are really keen to feel the place!",
          "Awesome and full of history with well explained brochures",
          "Rosenborg castle \ud83c\udff0. Worth visiting \ud83d\udc4c. Looks tiny from outside, but there are a lot of beautiful things to see. There are actually two entrances: the castle itself and the chambers with royal treasures. Entrance is free if you have the Copenhagen card.",
          "This is another of Copenhagen's beauties and a definite must see during your time in the city.  It is located on the grounds of \"King's Gardens\", which is a thing of beauty in itself. \nThe castle is a nice construction with a regal vibe, \u2026",
          "Nice gardens, interesting to see the guard marching",
          "Small compact castle with such great history and so well preserved, the kings toilet was especially interesting. Also the holes in the floor for music and the wine cellar 'phone line'.",
          "Interesting and well preserved castle with lots of information on objects and furnishings throughout. Worth the visit if you're in Copenhagen",
          "Nice castle dating back to 1600. Well kept, nice furniture and house ware. Amazing jewellery in the basement. Entry ticket about \u20ac 15,00. The visit is worth the price.",
          "5/5 looks like a small Versaille but with less people. Insane castle with amazing rooms and gardineers.",
          "Book online before you go so you skip the ticket queue. You will get a time slot and only need to arrive 5 minutes before that time. Lots to see and I particularly enjoyed the treasury which is included in the ticket. Lots of English explanations, as well you can use Google's lense app for further explanation",
          "Easy to get to on public transport,  good on a wet day.  Nicely laid out with some good parkland nearby",
          "Very loooooooooooooooooooooooooooong queue even on a rainy day.",
          "Wonderful castle that is beautifully maintained. The museum is great, and there is a lot to see. If you go on the website of the castle and click \"your tour starts here\", you can follow along with the rooms as you walk through them and get \u2026",
          "An excellent castle with excellent gardens. The exhibitions are well worth the small wait you might have, as your ticket comes with an allocated time to slot to enter the castle and see the floors. Get there early enough and you'll see the royal guards begin their march to Amalienborg.",
          "I did not get to go inside his castle, but I got to walk around the garden area take pictures of the outside. There are very long line to get inside, and tickets are sold out for the day. It\u2019s probably best to make reservations at advance. The outside is very beautiful.",
          "This place is a must see in Denmark. The castle is beautiful and the crown jewels are a once in a lifetime experience. Book ahead to avoid the line.",
          "Very nice place to visit. A must see I would say, if you like history.",
          "Only a train stop from Tivoli gardens, but the feeling that you're worlds away from modern Copenhagen.  This quaint, but ornately adorned castle houses the many collected treasures of King Christian IV.  The treasury also houses the crown jewels of Copenhagen.  Well worth the visit.  A cafe and restrooms on the grounds as well.",
          "Worth getting there for the beginning of the changing of the guard march.",
          "I loved this Castle. The Arms prototypes are lovely.",
          "Wonderful step back in time. Only the rude officious sentry guards were the slightest drawback but not enough to prevent 5 stars!",
          "BEAUTIFUL! The grounds are gorgeous! The surrounding park is large, has seating, many people picnic. The castle garden is so beautiful and well maintained. The moat has large fish in it and ducks. Great place to visit. So much green. Very well kept! I didn't go into the castle wasn't in the mood for the line.",

          "Castle that hosts Crown Jewels. There are 3 floors of various of old royal halls and small basement with limited collection of crown jewels",
          "One of the highlights of my trip to Europe this year.  The grounds were beautifully manicured and in full bloom.  The castle was magnificent, far better than I expected when looking at the size of it.  The timed ticket system worked very well, as I never felt over crowded or rushed.",
          "Lovely seeing the old furniture and buildings",

          "I think this castle is one of my favourites, together with the Peles Castle in Romania. It\u2019s pretty small and full of wonderful details. You should visit it when in Copenhagen!",
          "It\u2019s a great place to visit!",
          "I haven't visited the inside of the castle, because you have to wait a very long time to get in (I recommend buying your tickets online) even if you hav your tickets (this is why I don't give a 5 stars rating). However, the gardens are free and opened, they are full of roses, it's quite nice to chill there!",

          "Beautiful castle with a large area of green garden!\nSuper cool place for visiting in Copenhagen \nHighly recommended!!!",
          "Small and nice castle. The garden area around it is more worth the visit than the castle itself. Didn't actually go inside, there was a long queue.",
          "A spectacular castle that is absolutely worth visiting when you go to Copenhagen! So much history gathered on one place. Also here you can by a double ticket if your planing to see Amalienborg Castle.",

          "Didn't know what to expect when I went here. I knew nothing about it but would definitely recommend. It's a very grand castle set in a beautiful park. The collection of antiques is amazing, there are lots and lots of very interesting pieces along with some fabulous paintings all set within the excellent castle.",
          "Super experience to visit.  to see the very king and queen story super super story experience.  There is so much to see of history experience.  You see the place you a history experience you will remember and at the same time a beautiful experience.  Remember to use about 3 to 4 to see everything",

          "The Rosenborg Castle is very popular. All the tourists go there. The art and furnishings see every impressive. The throne room is something to see. So it's the bathroom, the other throne room. \nThis place would have rated five stars were out not for the self guiding app. I found it slow to respond and confusing to use.",
          "Stunning castle with beautiful surroundings. Can spend along time just wondering around the grounds of the castle. The castle itself takes you back to the time of the kings of old  and how they lived with there vast wealth. Must visit when in Copenhagen, probably the best attraction.",

          "Great little museum, worth the trip, definitely book if you can",

          "Lovely building and gardens, worth a visit.",
          "Crowded, but really packed with antiques. I would suggest buying tickets online to avoid lines. Don't forget to store your bag in museum shop. Have some spare change for that.\nThe inside of the castle is really awesome: a lot of paintings and relics packed in number of rooms across multiple floors.",
          "This park is absolutely beautiful, even though it was undergoing some construction. However, it\u2019s still a very nice place to walk around with bathrooms and many benches to sit on and relax. Many people were just people watching or reading \u2026",

          "The castle is nice enough with a few things to see. Wish there was more to read on the exhibits themselves without having to go through the web guide. Also, found one of the soldiers to be very rude when he gestured for us to move out of his way when we were waiting to enter the building.",
          "Beautiful palace. The Crown Jewels are in the basement. You need to keep it down as the room is sound sensitive.",

          "This is a must see for anyone visiting Copenhagen from a variety of perspectives including history, architecture, art and jewelry. It is well worth the time to take a look and to contemplate Danish culture and history. Especially the strategic location of Denmark to sea traffic in and out of the Baltic.",
          "My goal was to try and find some genuine Danish memorabilia from the gift shop.  Just my luck that they had reduced prices on some great little gift trinkets.  I also enjoyed the grounds and enjoyed taking photos of the winter scenery. \u2026",

          "When we arrived, the doors were closed and there were a lot of tourists wondering what's happening. If this happens to you, don't be alarmed. \n\nApparently some alarm was triggered, prompting a shut-down and security check. After all, there are all a whole lot of valuables in this castle!",
          "A must see in Copenhagen. Everything that is left of Danish kings of the 16th, 17th and 18th century is brought together in that castle. \n\nSome rooms are really dark, so don't visit on overcast days or close to dawn of twilight.",
          "Nice, but rather a poor park. The castle is little and not spectacular. Large part of it is a protected military area (west of the castle itself). Being in Denmark, you'd rather expect something more attractive.",
          "Front desk staff very friendly and knowledgeable. Rooms are comfortable. Located near attractions and Shoppes.",
          "The palace is full of jewerly, painting, ordinary objects and thrones that belonged to the Royal family, nt to mention Royal's crowns!\nThe pamphlet we were given along with  the tickets was well structured, as it described every single room \u2026",
          "It looks wonderful! But I didn\u2019t come inside because of big queues of people even in December",

          "Historical castle and like an adventure. More to follow \ud83e\udd29. Must see for turist that likes juwelery and gold. Take a walk in Kings Garden and see the flowers and rest at a bench or have fun with friends. Nearby a small rose garden.",
          "AMAZING PLACE! Don\u2019t skip this one. The Crown Jewels in the basement were breathtaking. Pictures don\u2019t do them justice. You have to see them.",
          "One of the few castle in Europe where you see about everything.  The self guided tour is good. Some very interesting bits of history shared.  Go during the week and avoid the crowds.",

          "Beautiful castle. Got to view the Crown Jewels, which was Olsen Bandens plan to heist.",

          "Excellent. Treasury is a very interesting collection.",
          "Small but very pretty palace. With the treasury being the highlight with some incredibly intricate works of ivory on display. Them royals really love a dinner plate tho, there's a astonishingly large collection of plates.",
          "Really liked this castle.  Enjoyed walking through at our own pace.  Although you walk through the doorway do not touch the handle..oops.  Staff was very nice.  Do not forget to go to the basement!  Crown jewellery and weaponry very cool.",
          "The castle presents authentic rooms where danish absolute monarchy lived. Very interesting to see old decorations and treasures presented in the treasury",
          "Beautiful place to walk.",
          "Beautiful place to visit, we didn't have the time to go inside, but the view alone was very impressive. Great green area around to sit down and take a break.",

          "Absolutely stunning in every aspect",
          "Great place to visit. Gardens are very pretty. Worth seeing Armoury with the Crown Jewels",
          "Easy to get to, walking distance,  free entrance unless you want a tour",
          "Nice visit. Not only old but very beautiful furniture",
          "Old and beautiful castle to visit. Three floors of tapestries, paintings, dishes and many other things are really need to visit in Copenhagen. Just try to come before 11 a.m.as there will be lines to cash desks but they go fast.",
          "Everywhere ard this castle is picturesque shot by cam. Best place for me was a big salon where there is throne chair. From there, you can see the best side view of castle garden via window.",
          "The Crown jewels were the highlight. The changing of the guard was also well worth seeing.",
          "A beautiful small castle right next to the royal guard training grounds.",
          "Spectacular castle with a gorgeous collection of artefacts and grandly decorated rooms. Keeper of the crown jewels! The gardens are just fabulous and deserve a good long walk around. It's picture perfect, like it's from a fairy tale!",

          "Amazing jewellery exhibition.",
          "Very dark place, crown jewels were the best bit",
          "Rosenborg castle is one of my favourite sight seeing stops in Copenhagen. The grounds and building itself is beautiful and walking around the building and seeing all the historic artifacts, paintings and what it looked like to live in this \u2026",
          "All the waiting aside, the exhibit is impressive. \nThe reason for poor rating is I witnessed a person needing a wheelchair disallowed AFTER they purchased the tickets with the full price and waited for over an hour to get inside. Absolutely shameful.",
          "Nice from the outside but a long que to get inside so we just visited the park",
          "Great castle set in a lovely surround of garden right by the botanical gardens. Copenhagen is full of lovely architecture but this was one of my highlights. I never managed to venture inside but the view from afar is fantastic so make sure \u2026",
          "Rosenborg Castle (Danish: Rosenborg Slot) is a renaissance castle located in Copenhagen, Denmark. The castle was originally built as a country summerhouse in 1606 and is an example of Christian IV's many architectural projects. It was built \u2026",

          "Next to a beautiful park there is a entry for the Castle",
          "A cool, small castle to introduce how the Danish kings and queens lived through the absolutism. The crown jewels are really the cherry on the top.",
          "Awesome historical place to visit. Lots to see and photograph.",
          "If you want jewels, diamonds and a taste of the Danish Royalties. Please go, you will love it....",
          "Just love it. In winter it feels very gothic, and in summer you just bask in the sun.",
          "Opulent, over the top - bling by the shovel-load.",
          "Wonderful historic castle and the staff superb in how they present their tours!  Exceptional!  We had a great visit.",
          "You get a great feeling of how kings were living in the 17th century. Enjoyed the castle more than the actual jewelry.",
          "Historical, do be prepared to wait a bit because the only let a set amount of  people inside at one time. However, you can just walk around in the beautifull gardens around. Surely worth a visit.",

          "Very beautiful place.",
          "I absolutely loved this place! I felt it was a bit expensive at first but after going through it, I think it was worth it! It was the perfect size: so much to explore but not too much that you get too tired. I especially loved all the cool \u2026",

          "Nice castle full of Danish history. It's a must in Copenhagen",
          "Not a good designed place for visitors - especially for kids ('no touch' place). Quiet dark inside, easily fed up with paintings. (But some of them are good. And some items can make music. Apart from clocks. ;) )\n\nBut...\n\nThe Treasury is \u2026",
          "impressive grounds, beautiful castle.  some confusion between the line to get into the castle and where to purchase the tickets for the line to get into the castle. there was a downloadable app, skip it, did not work on the 2nd floor.  go \u2026",
          "It was a excellent castle and they take vaery good care of it. They preserved ammunition in the basement of castle and  displayed jewellery as well. It worth visiting there.",
          "One of Denmark's Beauty.",
          "I would say impressive. Especially inside. With many hidden secrets, what most impressed me is the luxurious style it had although it was buit in 1606. Also, I tried to imagine how life was back then: as you can see, it's pretty dark by construction... Beautiful!! Not to be missed! \ud83d\ude4b\ud83d\udc4c",

          "Danish Royals living quarters, Crown Jewels exhibits are not to be missed.",

          "A bit disappointing, I would say. Compared to other castles Rosenberg is small, dark and not too special. \n\nThe outside is astonishing. Wonderful garden with plenty of roses. However the inside is not quite there. There is a three-floor \u2026",
          "Went in for a quick look as we passed by. Lots of beautiful rooms and interesting items. Apperantly missed the information about the phone app or web page (?) with information about the rooms and items, I only realized by chance that was why everyone had their phones out...",

          "Inside the kings garden.\nBeautiful castle , you can feed the fishes here in a small pond.",
          "Nice garden, never been in the castle, but a nice chill place",
          "I would definitely recommend you take a guided tour instead of doing on your own.\n\nThere's so much here and the guide book doesn't even scratch the surface. We got a lot more out of the visit by staying near the tour guides that entered some rooms while we were there.\n\nThe price is free if you get the Copenhagen card.",
          "lovely castle, with a nice exterior.. don't forget to walk around the castle as you will end up seeing much more...",
          "This was an interesting Castle to visit. It's cool to see how they used to live and what they used to think it was fashionable. You can go downstairs and see something called the treasury where they have all the jewels and wine and swords \u2026",
          "It is a must to visit. Highly recommended, however, if you did visit the mansions and castles in Turkey, you might find it not that interesting.",

          "Very beautiful castle!",

          "A small slot. Looks beautiful and the park that surrounds the castle is definitely worth a visit.",
          "You can't miss it, especially if you are a foreigner or tourist in Denmark. They have an amazing park outside too where kids can play and you can enjoy fantastic color gardens. You are allowed to sit and picnic on the grass. The castle is located very close to the Botanical Gardens, The Geological Museum and The National Art Gallery.",
          "Still has lived in feel!",
          "If there is just one thing you can do while in Denmark, this is it! Do not miss it!",
          "One of the highlights of my recent visit to Denmark, a country rich in history and tradition. A lot of the focus here at Rosenberg is on Christian IV but a lot of other interesting things including the Danish Crown Jewels. Another venue with free entry if you have a Copenhagen Card - highly recommended.",
          "Pretty cool collection of paintings, jewels, and artifacts from Danish history. Very expansive garden to just stroll around in too. Grab a self-guide manual and spend some time on each floor browsing the collection. The jewels in the basement are well worth the visit.",

          "Set in the heart of the city on vast grounds, with it's beautiful Danish Renaissance architectural design, the castle may not be the grandest in it's size from the inside, but is definitely rich with treasures from history. It was a fantasy \u2026",
          "The castle is not so much a castle, as an amazing art gallery in the shell of a castle. Interesting mix of media including oil on canvas, frescoes, furniture, tapestries, clocks, and of course jewellery.\n\nHere's a tip, if you are arriving \u2026",

          "It's a very nice castle to visit, and despite its three floors and two underground levels where the jewels are, it doesn't take much more than an hour to go through it. The jewels are amazing, and the rest of the castle is beautiful too, just not quite as majestic as Buckingham Palace. Photos are permitted, which is great.",

          "V\u00e6sentlig bes\u00f8g i K\u00f8benhavn. Jeg har aldrig set s\u00e5dan et charmerende sted. At se den danske krones juveler er berusende.\nImprescindible visita en Copenhague. Jam\u00e1s he visto un sitio tan encantador. Ver las joyas de la corona danesa es \u2026",
          "Beautiful outside. Totally inaccessible for people with accessible needs.",
          "This is a wonderful 16th century castle, quite different than the Royal palaces elsewhere in Europe. It is preserved as it was in the days of Danish kings and queens in the 17th and 18th century. The grounds, including the Rosegarden are very picturesque.",

          "Traditional castle with beautiful garden!",
          "Nice an unusual castle, without a tower or a wall to protect the Royal family. It offers a quick overview about the life of the royal family during XVII -XVIII century. The room of mirrors will let you know that Mr Grey didn't invent the room of toys, simply imitated.",

          "Outstanding and beautiful place! Great garden with atmosphere where you can take  a rest and just relax :) Really really worth to see!",

          "This place looks small but holds an exciting and extensive collection of European art, furniture. and weapons dating back to the 14th century. The crown jewels are located in the basement and are amazing.  If you can stop one place to get you history fix - this is the place!",

          "One of the Best castles in Denmark. Free entrance on the territory and garden. Lots of fish in the pond. A must visit in Copenhagen",
          "Fantastic palace, loads to see. Great historical content. Arrive early, opens at 9am, as it gets really busy. It's good they only allow 150 people in at a time so it's not crowded but this adds to the wait.",

          "One of must visit place in Copenhagen, but close time is too early.",
          "This castle is in the city and there are real royal jewels here. It was great to see a part of Danish history laid out for visitors. I wish they had audio devices too though. There are time slots for visits and the visit is about 2 hrs. The park in front of it is great for picnics.",
          "Must see!!! The castle is not that big, but it is full of interesting things. The last floor with the thrones looks like a Game of Thrones scene. Take some time to also visit te treasury. The crown jewels are really amazing, some stones are \u2026",
          "Great history.  Lighting was really inadequate.",
          "Rosenberg Castle is an impressive castle from the exterior. The gardens surrounding the site are nice.

A downturn in the overall skateboard market in the 1980s, coupled with high liability insurance premiums, contributed to the demise of the first wave of skateparks. Some second-generation parks, such as Upland, California's Pipeline, survived into the 1980s.  However, many public parks of that era can still be found throughout Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\n== Gallery of Skateparks ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nMany more in Category:Skateparks yet to be processed\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Free Port of Copenhagen is a bonded area in the northern part of Harbour of Copenhagen, Denmark. Created to consolidate Copenhagen's position as an important maritime hub in Northern Europe, it was established in the area just north of the fortress Kastellet and later expanded northwards several times. The original grounds, now known as S\u00f8ndre Frihavn (English: South Free Port), has since been released for other uses. It comprised Amerika Plads, a modern mixed-use development, America Quay, India Quay, Langelinie and Marble Pier, the four quays which bounded the harbour, and Midtermolen, a pier which divides it into an east and west basin.\nThe free port is now located in Nordhavnen and is part of Copenhagen Malm\u00f6 Port.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Planning and construction ===\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, Copenhagen's growth and the increasing industrialization made it clear that the city's harbour was becoming too small and in the same time old plans to create a free port were revitalized. In a plan from 1862 it was decided to dig out the area to allow access for the largest ocean-going wessels and use the materials removed for land fills along the coast. A suggestion to make all of Amager into a duty-free zone was abolished and instead it was decided to create a free port in the area in the Svanem\u00f8lle Bay north of the fortress Kastellet. Construction began in 1891, prompted by Germany's construction of the Kiel Canal that was begun in 1887 and threatened Copenhagen's position.\n\n\n=== Management and use ===\nThe new free port was inaugurated on 9 November 1894. A private limited company, K\u00f8benhavns Frihavns-Aktieselskab  (KFA), was given a concession on operating the port by the Ministry of Interior Affairs. All shares in the Free Port Company was taken over by Port Authority in 1951 and the company was dissolved and replaced by K\u00f8benhavns Frihavns- og Stevedoreselskab A/S in 1879.\n\n\n=== Expansions ===\nIn 1915\u201315, the free port was expanded with a new basin, Jronl\u00f8n Basin (Danish: Kronl\u00f8bsbasinet), located to the north. It made it blocked the access to the Kalkbr\u00e6nderihavnen dock, making it necessary to dig out a new access canal to it. The next expansion of the free port took place between 1919 and 1931, creating the harbour basin now known as Orient Basin.\n\n\n=== Late history ===\nThe free port left its original grounds in 1885. An architectural competition was launched for the future use of the area. Among the entries were a proposal from J\u00f8rn Utzon which included a highrise and several other buildings on Langelinie Pier but none of the submissions were realized. The Amerika Plads area was redeveloped in the 2000s.\nThe free port is now located in Nordhavnen and is part of Copenhagen Malm\u00f6 Port.\n\n\n== Layout and key figures ==\n\nThe original free port was designed by Holger Christian Valdemar M\u00f8ller, who later served as managing director of the Free Port Company, based on an initial proposal drafted by the politician and engineer Holger Hammerich. It consists of a West Quay (now America Quay, a South Quay (now India Quay and an East Pier (now Langelinie), together forming an enclosed dock which was entered from the north. A shorter pier, Midtermolen (Rnglish: Middle Pier), extended north from South Quay, separating the harbour into an east and a west basin. Only the west side of East Pier was part of the free port. The east side of the pier was used for recreational purposes as a replacement of the promenade which had previously followed the coastline. The two sides were separated from each other by the Langelinie Promenade, a raised promenade constructed on top of a long row of low warehouses. The dock is to the north closed by the Marble Pier, leaving only a narrow entrance in the north-east.\nIn 1931, after the second expansion had been completed, the free port covered a total area of 82.5 hectares of which 49.1 hectares were land and 33.4 hectares were water. The total length of the quays was approximately 4,770 metre with water depth between 7.5 m to 9.5 m.\n\n\n== Buildings and features ==\n\n\n=== Custom Guard Building ===\nThe Custom Guard Building (Danish: Toldvagten) was built in 1894 to designs by Erik Schi\u00f8dt. It was expanded in 1918 by J.C.M. Agerskov and again in 1932 with a three storey extension designed by John Dich. The complex was listed in 1988.\n\n\n=== Central Power Station ===\nThe Central Power Station (Danish:Frihavnens Elektriske Centralstation) was built in 1894-95 to designs by Vilhelm Dahlerup. A boilerhouse with a detached chimney designed by Frederik L. Levy was added in 1899. A workshop building designed by Henning J\u00f8rgensen is from 1913.\n\n\n=== Dahlerup's warehouses ===\nDahlerup also designed many other buildings in the original free port, including warehouses, guardhouses, quays and the fence which surrounded the area. Warehouse I on Langelinie Pier is now known as the Dahlerup Warehouse after him and is listed. Another warehouse on Middle pier, which for decades was a prominent landmark in the Free Port aream was demolished after a fire in 1968.\n\n\n=== Manufaktorhuset ===\nManufakturhuset at 8-10 Dampf\u00e6rgevej was designed by Frederik L Levy and built in 1899. The architectural firm PLH Arkitekter is among the companies which are based in the building.\n\n\n=== Silo Warehouse ===\nThe Silo Warehouse was completed in 1903 to designs by Frederik L. Levy. It was listed in 1985. It is colloquially known as the Cathedral of the Free Port due to its twin towers. Adapted and expanded by Erik M\u00f8ller Architects in 1993, it now houses Danish Regions.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

          "Nice for evening stroll and open air casual dining with the locals. Not a tourist in site despite it being on the way to the little mermaid... The day tourists are probably eating in a tourist trap somewhere else.",
          "Honestly I was underwhelmed. I understand the story of the mermaid becoming human and it is a pretty sculpture however it is small and surrounded by a crowd of tourists taking selfies making it hard to see or admire. It is free though and \u2026",
          "The air is so fresh and the scene is amazing",

          "Denmark\u2019s most archetypal statue, The Little Mermaid sits on a rock in the northern part of Copenhagen\u2019s harbour. This bronze sculpture has been been lounging in the harbour for more than a hundred years and, though it might seem \u2026",
          "Nice and popular pier with the Little mermaid statue",
          "It's a nice statue and has a good back story but both times I visited throughout the day it was being rather clumsily being stood upon by tourists (I visited it at 5am and 5pm). It kind of ruined the experience.",
          "Nice piece of history to walk around in and watch.",
          "Nice monument/ fountain near little mermaid, nice walk back to city centre",
          "Always a beautiful experience when the Japanese cherry trees are blossoming.",
          "The famous little mermaid. Crowded with tourists but nice to visit. 5 min walk from the parking.",
          "What can you say more about The Little Mermaid statue?! Worth a visit to see it and the water, but expect that there always be lots of people, because it\u2019s famous. Easy to visit from Bus and subway and on foot.",
          "Lovely peaceful place... To visit!",
          "The area is very scenic with a fantastic view of the blue harbour. There are also many restaurants which offer good menus. There is a park nearby which makes the place good for a family visit with children.",
          "This is where you go to see the Little Mermaid. But, the place also has other things to see. A weird perspective on the harbour of Copenhagen, on your way out you get to see the Opera as well. There is a park with loads of statues and \u2026",
          "If your hoping for a big statue you better think twice. Little Mermaid is, as the name says, quite small. Probably, human size. But is a must! The walk 'til there is amazing and if your a fan of the story you sure will enjoy it. I know I did.",
          "Very good place for walk around. You can see lots of things by walk of 2 kms. Keep talking and keep enjoying. Don't forget to walk with harbour side.",
          "This was a fantastical stop. To hear the stories behind the stories. One of a kind experience that will stay with you forever. Such a fun place.",
          "Nice spirit and Greta Danish heling people",
          "mermaid looks like she needs a vacation in canaries",
          "Totally worth the walk if you want to visit the nearby palace and fortress (hint: you do want to do these things!).  Amazing view of the town and harbor from the fortress nearby.  Give yourself about 2 hours here.  We went when it was cold and still really enjoyed ourselves.  Can't imagine how busy this place is during the summer!",
          "Fantastic experience watching the changing of the guards.",
          "We finally got to see the little mermaid, it wasn't all that unfortunately. However, it seems to be a big attraction to the Asian community. We enjoyed Copenhagen very much it's a beautiful city and wonderful people.",
          "very nice",
          "It\u2019s really crowded by tourists, the mermaid is small and you don\u2019t really see her. Nice to see because it\u2019s famous but nothing really special!",
          "Great place to hang out.",
          "We were there in November was a bit of disappointment. Not much to see i believe a summer walk would be nice but if you miss it. Its not much of experience you losing.  One public toliet with a long que waiting for you. So make sure you pee before you go",
          "It is one of the most overrated attractions in the world. It is small regular statue. Though the walk by the water from Copenhagen city center is really nice. And each time I'm in Copenhagen, I walk there because of the beauty of Copenhagen, not little mermaid itself.",
          "It is so beautiful in a sunny days",
          "Impressive, would have been great to see it working.",
          "Visiting it was a little overrated... There is ALWAYS a lot of tourists there, so if you don't like crowds... Best you do a canal tour and see it from the other size, it's more informative and less crowded.",
          "It is nice to walk around in this park. I was lucky when visited this park, it was spring with a nice weather. There's a many statue around here, also some cherry blossom tree! You can find a  food stalls around Mermaid statue.",
          "A nice destination on a walk through the city.",
          "Nice place but around 45 minutes walking from city center, but you can't leave Copenhagen without visiting.",
          "Interesting place and story behind it.",
          "Beautiful place",
          "Little mermaid is along the river bank. Walk past it towards the Centers with its colourful houses and restaurants. Very clean city. Best time is spring before the tourist rush in July-August",
          "Quite a picturesque spot. We can easily spend about 1 hour taking photographs by the pier, mermaid and at the parks.  We enjoyed the breathtaking views with a cup of coffee.",
          "The Mermaid in Denmark is little but the journey to see her is ultra-amazing. Not too crowded and you can go by boat or take a tour bus. Loved Copenhagen.",
          "Not sure why people complain about the size of the Little Mermaid statue, it's approximately life size (slightly smaller, but she was only 16 if I remember correctly) and that makes sense to me.",
          "Nice statue on a rock. Copenhagen is full of sculpture, and to be brutal, I don't see why this one is anything special. But if you're visiting the citadel nearby, wander down to the coast and make your own mind up.",
          "Did walking tour of city. Little Mermaid smaller than imagined and very busy there. Watch out for bicycles: they have priority and don't take prisoners! City very clean and airy, with lovely green spaces.",
          "Beautiful place to walk along the pier with possibility to catch an ice cream on the way. but don't go there only to see the little mermaid then you will be disappointed. After all it's only a statue beautiful yes. But not something to look at for hours.",
          "If you want to take a nice and relaxing walk in Copenhagen, this is the place to be, especially in the Spring where all the cherry blossoms and other flowers are in full bloom. It is located near the pier and also near the statue of the \u2026",
          "Near to little mermaid\nSimple place to visit and take photos",
          "Good but make sure you don\u2019t go in afternoon then it\u2019s too crowded to take a picture with statue!",
          "Beautiful place to have had the privilege of visiting. Also a great place to sit, reflect and grab a bit to eat by the bar/restaurant.",
          "Beautiful place to walk around",
          "Smaller than I expected but a nice visit and with a lot of history to tell without any word.",
          "I had to visit the famous mermaid of Copenhagen, but this is extremely crowded during normal ours. I'd recommend going either really early in the morning or late at night.",
          "really nice :D a lot to see. sadly a lot of tourists around the mermaid",
          "Great cafe downstairs. Nice staff",
          "It's a beautiful area with a nice mix of culture and nature. Something Denmark does really well!",
          "Really beautiful.  The Sakura trees look wonderful at this season.",
          "Worth a quick visit if you are around.",
          "I enjoy the morning walk to this small church with a big signboard WELCOME VISITORS and is free entrance. Very peaceful area.\nOutside the church, nice landscapes and a short walking distance to Little Mermaid.",
          "The symbol of Denmark and especially Copenhagen of course. Once you discover the siren you realize that it's smaller than expected and you'll have to fight with Chinese tourists to get a beautiful picture of her. Good luck.",
          "It's a good place to visit. No matter the season, weather. Many other places to visit are nearby too.",
          "It's one of the must do things if you are visiting Copenhagen. It is a bit of a way out of the centre but you can get there on some of the local buses or the river bus. While there the St Alban's church is well worth a look too.",
          "I recommend to walk all the way up there, you can see many interesting buildings on your way or just admire the harbor view. Although it's a super crowded around the Little Mermaid, I guess it's worth it to go and see it once as it is part of the Danish culture.",
          "Loved the little mermaid, but you should visit early because there are so many people",
          "It's a pier. Not more, no less. But you get a nice view at the opera house.",
          "It has some stores and a cafeteria, around the corner is the little mermaid and another monument. I'd say the little mermaid must be my least favourite attraction in Copenhagen. Langelinie at least has a great view to the water.",
          "it was a raining summer day . but a must see monument.",
          "Lovely the little mermaid is special. Lovely place for a waterside stroll",
          "Easy to miss due to its small size, but beautifully simple, elegant and straight out of a fairy tail..",
          "You can walk to the Mermaid from here.",

          "Beautiful walk if you\u2019re a little mermaid fan. If not, you\u2019re not missing out on too much. Can get crowded with tourists and is a little out of the way but is a great walk if it\u2019s a nice day out!",
          "It have been upgraded and the shops are a bit better but all in al not a pier to visit for its own sake... it\u2019s not a destination in itself",

          "Within walking distance of several other nearby points of interest. This one is interesting to see. The mermaid is much smaller than I anticipated it would be. One of the must see land marks.",

          "Well she is pretty but very small",

          "nice place, it s a must for visitors in copenhagen.",

          "It's a nice spot, a very touristy location, but in my opinion it's a bit boring. There's not much to do, other than take a few photos and selfies, and it's always very crowded, you can't get a picture of just yourself and the mermaid",

He was the son of Philip Ludvig von Platen and Eva Hedvig Ingeborg Ehrenborg. He first studied mathematics, physics, and astronomy at Lund University.Together with inventor and entrepreneur Carl Munters (1897\u20131989), he was the inventor of the gas absorption refrigerator in 1922 while they were both Swedish engineering students at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. The Platen-Munters design could operate without a pump. The technique produced \"cold\" from a heat source such as propane, electricity, or kerosene. In 1923, production by AB Arctic began. In 1925, AB Arctic was purchased by Electrolux, which began selling them worldwide. In 1925, American manufacturer Servel purchased the rights to the Swedish patent for a continuous absorption refrigerator and started to focus on the gas refrigeration market. The company manufactured refrigerators and was the only U.S. manufacturer for many years.Baltzar von Platen and Carl Munters both received the Polhem Prize (Polhemspriset) awarded by Swedish Association of Graduate Engineers in 1925. Baltzar von Platen was awarded the Franklin Institute John Price Wetherill Medal in 1932. He was awarded the Adelsk\u00f6ld Medal (Adelsk\u00f6ldska medaljen) in gold from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences during 1940. Von Platen also worked with ASEA, Sweden's major electrical company,  on the development of a process which used heat and pressure to produce diamonds. Von Platen left the project before it succeeded in producing the first synthetic diamonds in 1953.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Gas Model Refrigerator Alex Imholtz",

          "Great place to take kids! They have an indoor playground in basement that is excellent in the wintertime. You can bring your own fika to enjoy in the lounge next to play area.",
          "This was a great museum with well put together and interesting displays of trains, cars and other technology. The best bit was being able to go into a real submarine. My 6ft 2in husband was definitely not built for submarines but we had a lot of fun! The ticket was only about",
          "We were looking forward to visiting this museum so were disappointed that it was closed for renovations until October 2019. However the surrounding area with the fishermen's houses were very nice.",
          "An old but interesting museum about the old days with cars, inventions, MC, aeroplanes and how people lived. There is an updated (newer) level where you can test more by yourself, with a blue screen, IR-camera, wind effects, strength and many more things. Family-friendly",
          "An interesting museum and with the ticket you can also visit Malmo castle. There is a real submarine with crew members possible to enter",
          "This is an awesome and must see museum in Malmo. There are several different exhibits to visit and lots of different things to see. There was a real submarine that you could go inside, and even some crew members that served were there talking to people. I've been to this place",
          "The museum is worth a visit even if you visit Malmo for one day. The ticket price is really low (40SEK= around 4 euro/$). By using this ticket you can also visit a small natural history museum and the Malmo castle. I reccomend it to people (younger and older) interested in",
          "It is quite attractive museum, not a big museum but enough to make visitors busy for 1-2 hours. Plenty of technology displays related to maritime stuffs, old tools and stuffs, air planes, motor cycles and bicycles, cars, horse drawn cart, old machines, old small locomotives, and",
          "I've been surprised by this museum. I wanted to visit it for the submarine (they have an entire submarine you can get into on Tuesdays and Sundays - if i'm not mistaken), but everything else was just as cool. Trains, automobiles and different machines. There's also a section",
          "Teknikens & Sj\u00f6fartens hus Malmo is a Great place to spend time if the weather isn't great! Enjoy it!",
          "This place is really cool if you like culture and technology, they even have a sub-marine where you can go inside and have a look. They also have a table where you can stear two small balls with your mind and compete. Even though I grew up in Malm\u00f6 I just recently visited this",
          "Went two grown ups and three kids 9,10 and 12. The first two floors are filled with all kinds of machines and engines and also a few science bits. The submarine is really cool for all to go in to. All of us found the top floor the best though with all the experiments and things",
          "We spent this day in Malmo visiting the science and technology museum which is part of the castle...which contains MORE museum. The Tekniska museum though was so compelling we were there 4 hours...wandering through the submarine, looking at the development and future of cars,",
          "We went to this museum based on a friend recommendation and we are happy that we went. For only 40SEK/4EUR you get to see a great museum with a lot of things to see. You get to see planes, cars, bikes, boats, boat captain crew, get in a submarine, home invention and a lot of",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to the Technology & Maritime Museum. We especially enjoyed going through the large submarine and exploring the boats. This would be a great place to take kids.",
          "The entrance ticket (about \u00a34-00) also includes the nearby castle (Malmohus). You could easily spend the best part of a day visiting both. The museum is full of old aeroplanes, cars and old technology as well as a submarine that you can walk through. There is also a park",
          "For the cost of 40SEK we got to visit the maritime museum and malmo castle. The technological and maritime museum was the first place and we were blown away....... From the working engines to the cockpit, to the air traffic control room where you could hear live broadcasts to",
          "a very nice and interesting museum in the city center of Malm\u00f6. a mix of a lot of technology to understand",
          "I really enjoyed this museum which had a good collection including plenty of hands on exhibits and the staff were very friendly and the restaurant was very nice. The fully restored submarine which you can climb aboard and explore was the highlight for me. On the down side, while",
          "Very good Museum in Malmo. The aviation engines and turbines are very good. But not the best in this aerea around the world. But the great renacentist astronomer that was Danish, ( at that moment Malmo belonged to the Kindon of Denmmark), Tycho de Brae was born in this city. The",
          "We didn't have enough time for this (spend an hour there). You get to try out real machines and learn about all sorts of things. Definitely a revisit!!",
          "The submarine was the highlight, amongst lots of interesting and interactive exhibits. Was good value for money when you consider you also get access to the castle.",
          "I visited Technology & Maritime museum on Sunday. Museum did not have many visitors at the time, giving me opportunity to read thoroughly presentations. Museum focuses on airplanes, cars and of course, ships and submarines. Jet and other engines are displayed well so that",
          "We stayed in Malmo with family, my 14-year-old son and I found this lovely museum and really enjoyed what was on offer, the U-Boat and Saab fighter planes were incredible!",
          "For a verry cheap price, you get a trip in the history of science and technology. My favourite places are plan the planetarium and the area with experiments and ideas. My daughter loves this place, and she has lots of fun every time she comes here! And it\u2019s great for me too!",
          "We enjoyed our visit to this museum. It's so nice and refereshing to visit a museum that actually is self-confident enough to let the objects and museum texts speak for themselves, instead of getting lost in interactive displays that alienate many visitors. The aviation",
          "I was surprised to see so good museum with a real submarine, opened for visitors. Children love it. There are a lot of retro motor machines, and a good exposition showing development of Swedish aviation. The shop is small and nice. This museum remains one of my strongest",
          "Costing only 40 Kroner and including nearby castle was great value. Looking at some of the old Scandinavian cars was really cool but the highlight was crawling through the U boat which is there, you also can probably do it in an hour so doesn't take up to much of your trip.",
          "This is museum was includein the ticket price for malmo castle.about 200m out side the castlle.i surpurize it was great museum forcoolections of vehiclels transportations,inventions ,ships,airoplanes.The best thing to must see the submarine which ia actual one and the driver of",
          "As this place was included in the ticket price for Malmo castle, I went in to take a look. It had a great collection of vehicles, technological inventions and a great one on how these advances helped the Swedish people over the ages. It is an amazing place and I learnt so much.",
          "We popped into the museum thinking it would just be a walk around the submarine and a few more exhibits, however you can board the submarine and explore inside- be careful it\u2019s extremely cramped as expected! There are also a variety of airplane exhibits, road transport, small",
          "Never been inside a submarine and this attracted us over from Copenhagen - apparently the Danes close their own one for the Winter. Very warm welcome at the reception desk and the bonus was that our tickets are also valid for the neighbouring museum. Superb displays, great",
          "experimentarium full of exciting activities on the subject of our planet and our future! You'll learn new and experience the magic of everything in your everyday life around you. Here you will also find the star room - a new kind of planetarium where visitors can navigate",
          "My kids just love The Technical museum. We could be here all day and they would ask to come back the next day. Loads to do and see for all ages and for those interested in engineering feats, cars, trains etc. They even have a science lab upstairs for older kids. In the basement",
          "this is a hidden gem. Some great exhibitions. Most of the descriptions are in Swedish with only a few in English but this adds to the charm. Was not that crowded when I went there and could stroll through at a leisurely pace. It is surprisingly large.",
          "I really enjoyed the museum. Plenty of exhibits, well-explained. I particularly enjoyed the real submarine (cut in three to transport it to the museum and then put back together). Talk about claustrophobic! Kids will enjoy so much about this venue, lots of working exhibits,",
          "This is well worth a visit with young kids. A huge submarine you can climb inside and look around. Some good trains, trams and airplanes. There is a also a nice maritime theme playroom for kids to run off some energy.",
          "I absolutely loved this museum. The layout was well done and there is tons of information on all the items. It was also very hands on for those that like to touch things. Having the Google Translate app with Swedish downloaded helped me get more out of the experience.",
          "This museum contains a lot of cool stuff. Old vehicles, engines, airplanes and a submarine that you can enter. Then a whole floor of interactive learning. You can spend hours here. Highly recommend it!",
          "For a city the size of Malmo, this museum is impressive. The museum is not crowded at all and it offers great hands on experiences. The exhibits are well kept and make sure not to miss the submarine. There is a guided tour of the submarine in English once a day so check the",
          "Nice enough and interesting enough to keep even rather small Children interested. Especially the submarine which is very real and kind of awesome for kids and adults. Avoid the mouldy, sauna-hot playroom in the cellar. Awful.",
          "This place is pretty cool to go either as a family or a few adult friends. Lots to do and always lots of kids so its a pretty fun atmosphere",
          "Contains pictures on how Malm\u00f6 have changed over time. Shows technical advancement and it makes you realize how fast that development was.",
          "It is a bit unorthodox, with its mix of local history, technological and maritime exhibits. There are some interactive elements, but we found a few to be badly designed or broken. Others like the \"can you pull one horsepower\" meter incited great enthusiasm. Generally some nice",
          "Don't miss the top floor, especially if acompanied by young persons. Stimulates interest in science. Exhibitions need time to take in and are for enthusiasts of 'planes and cars. Sub is unique in that you can go through it, with difficulty as doors are tight and space tighter.",
          "The exhibitions haven't really changed in three decades, and a lot of stuff is outdated. The 'ide planet' on the top floor doesn't look too inviting anymore -- some of the stuff was broken, and the camera/speed experiment wasn't properly explained. We had the place more or less",
          "The museum was an excellent excursion trip from Copenhagen with young kids. The submarine and other stationary exhibits are great but the interactive science room was extraordinary and had we not been overcome by hunger then we would probably still be there!",
          "We did not expect to visit a nice museum in a small city! Have to admit it had nicer things than similar museums in bigger cities! don't miss this one if you happen to come to Malmo.",
          "20 Kr for visit the Technology & Maritime Museum, malmo castle and malmo museum. They are using the same ticket for all the entry. Personally i love the technology exhibition the most. One of the science display called \"mind ball\" is my favourite! The mechanism of the mind ball",
          "A nice way to spend a couple of hours with many exhibits and covering many areas of interest. I liked the star room.",
          "It was raining, so we needed an indoor activity that would provide some of the local history, some art, and an underwater museum. Does this seem an odd combination? Well, that is what you get for the all in one price, and, well, this is Malmo, and they do it just a bit",
          "although not all exhibits had English translations, it was interesting to look round. great hands on stuff and being able to climb through the submarine",
          "In the hierarchy of science and technology museums, the Technology museum would not rank highly, but I would still recommend visitors to Malmo visit the museum, if they are filling a program of local sights. It is reasonably inexpensive @ 40 sek, which includes entry to the",
          "We paid 20 DKK (about us $3.00 per person. Children under 18 is free. For this price free entrance to the castle",
          "On the day we visited the museum was quite busy initially with a number of different primary school visits. The price you pay to go into the museum also gives you access to the castle museum. Liked the science area that had a lot of hands on activities as well as the submarine.",
          "Went mostly for The Bridge exhibit, which was amazing! It's not very well signposted. There's exhibits behind cracks in walls (I assume because it was graphic), but these weren't very well sign posted. There's a small cinema with an hour long behind the scenes film playing, but",
          "A small, funky museum we liked far more than we expected. Only 40 krona admission. One half was about Malmo. Moderately interesting. Fun to see what a kitchen from the '50s looked like. We liked the Muscles to Machine Power better. The machines that shaped local history.",
          "Alright for spending an hour or two and if you have kids they will probably get something from it. about \u00a34 to get in so pretty cheap. Tells you about Swedish inventions and discoveries but not really very modern of exciting to look at.",
          "This place was like several museums in one - if you go right, it took you into an area of artifacts and items from 20th century Malmo. But the arrangement of items was very difficult to understand, since the organizing principles were unclear. It seemed very random, so it was",
          "A rather small collection of technical devices. Center pieces include a submarine and a Saab 35 Draken aircraft.",
          "A well thought-out and wide-ranging Museum across two buildings. Reasonably priced too. We enjoyed the exhibition about The Bridge. The Submarine was fascinating. The basement of the Maritime building was brilliant for children.",
          "The museum has some nice objects from the history of science and technology, most obbvious are objects from the history of transportation. More remarkable appear the objects related to Tycho Brahe on the first floor, they have a nice way of contextualising him and his work. The",
          "Lived in Malm\u00f6 for almost eight years now and visited the technical museum first now. The exhibition about the Tv-serie BROn(The Bridge) was in my focus. A bit tiny but well made. The submarine was another given attraction. Next time I will make sure I have more time because",
          "The coolest thing there is the U3 submarine. I wish there was some expert guided tour about its history. Not a very big museum, but well worth the price as the ticket valid for the Malmo Castle as well.",
          "I recently visited this museum with my soon to be 2 year old son, and my friend with her 18 month old twins. The museum is well organised to cater for young children and families. Lockers for excess clothing and bags are located just inside the door, after paying. The cost of",
          "For one entry fee you get a ticket valid in both the Technological museum, exhibition space Kommendanthuset and the Malm\u00f6hus Castle (including its aquarium) so don't miss out on all three! (They're situated across the road from one another, next to a large car park, a HUGE",
          "What a great place, bought with the ticket to the castle, plenty of English too on the boards.Its a real must even on our one day trip from Copenhagen. We also enjoyed , as fans , the exhibits on The Bridge TV drama",
          "I have visited over 400 museums. This is the poorest one? It's not that it had few items - it was kind of mid-sized for being in a small-ish town, but the labels were extremely poor or absent. The typeface on some posters was very hard to read and the various departments were",
          "Well worth the visit. We paid to get in to Malmo Castle on the same street and had entry to this museum included. The Submarine was amazing. You can actually go inside. There was a man on board who told us lots of interesting facts and was really enthusiastic. The planes, bikes",
          "Very interesting museum with plenty of exhibits: old cars, airplanes, ships and a hit - submarine! We enjoyed also part of the museum with experiments. Buying a ticket to this museum in the price there is also admission to the museum in the castle (we had not enough time to see",
          "Great Indoor playground for the kids on the bottom floor. Very confusing exhibition about Malm\u00f6 in one hall. Not very cohesive!",
          "The museum is most bizarre with a selection of exhibits that I wouldn't bother crossing the road to see.! I really would not waste any time in going.",
          "A must if in Malm\u00f8. Museum very close to Malm\u00f8hus, good parking close by. A museum for young and old, telling a lot about the swedish industri, cars-Volvo, airkraft-Saab, u-boat-Kochums and a lot more. Full scale U-boat were you can go in and realy file how narrow every thing",
          "I enjoyed this even more than the castle. It is a bit of a kiddie museum, but with some really cool stuff. I came for the submarine. I had been on a similar sized one in Pearl Harbor, but this was excellent. They have removed the periscope and you can look around the",
          "Very many and interesting things exposed in these museum. We were most impresed by the real planes, trains and even military submarine exposed, where you can touch and feel everything. Highly recommend especially for children!",
          "A good one day visit from Denmark. The museum is def better than the Malmo castle. I just loved the submarine. The car exhibits were good. A good way to spend a day in Malmo",
          "1) First of all, note: this museum, and the submarine U3, are NOT in the Museum Malmo / Malmohus Slott in the middle of the moat per the map. That's a different museum (and aquarium). Admission to one grants admission to the other, but this is a separate building across the road",
          "We went here to find out more about the submarine that is located here, and which you can enter and see from the inside. Very fun - but we also found the other parts of the museum very fun and intresting.",
          "A little bit of everything when it comes to modern day transport. The museum is interactive and would be a good place for school aged kids.",
          "Visited with grandchildren - it is an excellent experience which totally involves them and we all enjoyed it very much.",
          "I am afraid that the unknowing visitor (or young Swedish child) leaves this museum under the impression that most inventions are Swedish. Very little information that some inventions were a development of earlier inventions, or theories, of other (foreign) inventors. The",
          "a wonderfull museum with plenty of old new and whatever emotions and feelings flowting with a salty taste.",
          "a small but incredibly interesting and diverse museum, well worth a visit and buy the combined ticket for the Slott too.",
          "The museum is surprising in variety and it has an interactive area. The most interesting experience was the submarine where, if you are lucky, you can meet a veteran explaining you the daily activities onboard. Unfortunately, we arrived one day after the flood and one room pf",
          "We started our visit at the submarine.the kids loved it.later we went through the various parts of the museum and the kids were interested in everything. This was a great expreiuand we didn't even go through the entire place. A great way to spend half a day. The same ticket was",
          "A bit of everything ...engines, trolley car, submarine you can enter with sailors to explain life onboard.",
          "I went with my friends on our day trip to Malm\u00f6. It's definitely a great place for kids, but it was still fun for us as college students. The whole museum had cool things that were very interesting to read about. The top floor had interactive science games, which were so much",
          "I went there with my children and we liked it a lot. We went there for 2 days in a row. We really liked and the children were busy all the time. I will be back there. Across the street is another museum \"Stadsmuseum\" and that was also very good museum.",
          "It's a really good place to spend your almost all day :) You can have fun and see some really interresting things :) So if you have time, don't miss it ;)",
          "Ever been inside an old submarine? About time maybe, or try a couple of experiment of your own, fun and interesting for young and old!",
          "This museum had not been on our list of things to do while in Malmo, but we decided to check it out because our tickets to the Malmohus Castle also included entrance to this museum. My four year old nephew would have loved it!!! This museum was basically a museum full of",
          "One great thing about this museum is that you may touch most of the displays. Get inside a submarine, or an airport control booth. Kids love it.",
          "Would you like to enter an U-boat or take a close look on a SAAB jetfigther or an old tram this is the place. You can easily use 2 or 3 hours in this part of the Malm\u00f6 Museums...",
          "So hands on that everyone I talk to about this place loves it!! My two year old loves to touch everything and have a run around the play area at the bottom and my dad loved walking round and seeing how things worked and reminding himself of his past as an engineer!",
          "It doesn't look much from the outside but there's much more that it seems. All sorts of science from Swedish invention to cars, aircraft and a submarine.",
          "Small interesting museum with displays about science and technology in Sweden. The high point of any visit is going inside a Swedish submarine with a guided tour by a former submariner, who was a member of the boat's crew.",
          "This is part of a package ticket when you go to the museum. It is well worth a stop. The models are well built--lots to see. The displays are well done and there is ample signage in English. The building is good looking and well maintained. There is a U boat that you can",
          "The museum is a perfect spot to bring Children between 5 and 15 with lots of technical activities. Among others a submarine you can walk inside in and get a feeling for how tough life underwater is. Also old trains and aircrafts.",
          "This museum at first glance looks to be a bit small and perhaps somewhere to entertain the kids for an hour or two. However, the more time you invest in the exhibits, the more you will gain in return. The highlight is the WW2 submarine. Impressively large from the outside but",
          "If you have young children to entertain then this is well worth a visit. It is located across the road from Malmo castle, and on the edge of Kungsparken (the King's Park). The museum contains several aircraft, a submarine that you can explore and various entertaining child",
          "This is a bit worn down, some exhibitions are really not so well composed but it is very accessable especially for small kids. They can get near a lot of stuff, it is not too big and there is a bit of a human touch to it, not so institutional",
          "It's a good place to go if you have time and don't really know what to do. There was a lot of kids when I went, so it was really lively.",
          "There's a lot to see in the museum and I think the going inside a submarine was the highlight. There were a lot of children there when I visited and parts of the museum dedicated to children's activities. I bought a combined ticket for this museum and the art gallery/castle down",
          "Its more for people who love history and interested in science. Yes it has some sections for fun , but its a informative place with war aircraft and the submarine in display . Do have atleast 2-3 hours to visit it fully.",
          "technology through the indistrial period. quite interesting. a real submarine is also on display. there is also a an exibition of malm\u00f6's history. you can easily spend a couple of hours here with the kids.",
          "A real mix of exhibits but really interesting and worth going to see. From Jet planes to a submarine and everything else in between. We really enjoyed it!",
          "Very much loved for kids & students; nice & clean, is like a big & interesting travel trought the mankind achievments & inventions; recomended!",
          "This is a super museum 'cause it's full of technology and you can find the description of all those machines in English, no need to speak Swedish . For guys is more than fun!",
          "One of the best museum i have ever visited. You can see a lot of of cool and interesting things,touch them, see how they work, learn something new. Most of all i was impressed by science exibit, a must-visit place if you have kids! They will come out smarter then they were when",
          "We spent a great couple of hours around this museum, there is lots to see and do and we were surprised at how cheap it was! All of the exhibits were great and despite it being a busy Saturday we still felt like there was room to explore and read the English explanations.",
          "Lots of cool things too see. In addition it has a really attractive interactive science center. It is centrally located next to a nice park.",
          "The museum contain many technology objects from the old days, airplane engines of all kind and many other common use objects of the last centuries. Lifestyle of old days is well explained by the objects exposed. The section of physics allows the kids to experiment by himself a",
          "Me and couple of my university mates visited this museum during our day trip to Malm\u00f6. The plan was to stay an hour or so. Impossible. There was so many cool things in this place that we ended up messing around for almost 2 and a half hours! Absolutely amazing museum with plenty",
          "We were visiting Malmo and looking for places to go. This was high up on the list and it did not disappoint. Well to start with it did, purely because some of the write ups had no english. We kept going round and more and more started to appear. The power room was great,",
          "Very nice museum. Cheap enough to get in and a good range of things to see. The submarine is amazing and worth the entrance fee on its won",
          "it was pretty good for a museum, we paid to go in malmohus which is the main castle thing. this paymaent covered the entry fee for the techno museum.",
          "With a combined ticket you visit this museum as well as the castle and the commandant's house, and in between you run into a small but live fish market...located in Malm\u00f6's Kings Park it offers a vast amount of exhibits and oportunities to test your mental skills , has a",
          "Very nice. wonderful if you are traveling with kids. Interesting if you like tecnology. Near the downtown. whit a coffe shop not expensive.",
          "Really interesting collection of mainly technical exhibits. Helpful friendly staff on hand to demonstrate and assist.",
          "It doesn't matter how old you are or if you aced or flunked science, this suits everyone! Visit an actual submarine, go experimenting, learn about air crafts, cars and boats. Perfect when tired of the beach in the summer or tired of the apartment a rainy winter day.",
          "Literally planes, trains and automobiles plus a lot of social history from Sweden. All exhibits in English and Swedish. There was a lot to see and it is worth half a day. Scrambling through the submarine is fun. Kids will love a special area in the basement for them to play in.",
          "Among the usual techical stuff there are some cars, aircraft and even a U-boat you can visit. The ticket also give you entrance to the bigger \"Malm\u00f6 Museum\" some houndred yards away.",
          "Very interesting place to see how technology has evolved in terms of maritime. One can go inside a decommissioned submarine.",
          "This museum contains some exhibits that might be of use or interest to children but falls far short of being spectacular. My husband and son enjoyed the U-boat - I found it claustrophobic bit that's my problem. The rest of the exhibits were mildly interesting. a shame really.",
          "It was a nice exhibit, I have to say that it was a bit short. I also saw the permanent exhibit. I would not have gone otherwise, but the entrance was cheap so I am happy I went. Love, love, love the submarine.",
          "GREAT museum for kids or adults who like interactive museums :) My toddler had a blast in every section of this museum, and so did I! It is interesting and fun, and should be top on anyone's list who is visiting the area (southern Sweden, Denmark, wherever!) It is worth a side",
          "I visited the castle which is surrounded by a moat. There is a picnic courtyard and fashion museum in the castle. There are two other museums nearby-the commandants house and technical museum. Of the three the technical museum is great. Amongst an eclectic mix are lots of",
          "Housed in the Malmoe castle, this museum is probably its best attraction. Vintage locomotives, tractors and motorcycles are on display, as well as very old fire truck, a submarine and a fighter jet.",
          "If you have the time, you should drop by this museum. It has the history of technology here, you will even find a submarine where you can go in and see the inside.",
          "Whilst the focus of the museum is sometimes a bit lost, yes it says maritime, but it doesn't stick to that, its all a bit jumbled, anyway, its also fun. Enjoyed the visit, especially the sub, U3. The best bit was that there was english words every where, worth taking the kids if",
          "As part of our trip to Copenhagen, we decided to travel across the \u00d8resund Bridge and spend the day in Malmo. After a breezy walk to look at the Turning Torso, we entered the museum which was very reasonable - 80 SEK (US$12.60) for two adults and two children (who were free!).",
          "For young children this is a great spot to visit. Plains, cars, trains and the submarine. All there to be seen and touched. Not expensive. Only thing that is missing a museum cafeteria, although they have a good inside picknick spot where you can eat your own sandwiches.",
          "Visited Sweden for the day from Copenhagen. Museum was great, easy to find with a quick map from the tourist info just outside the station. 10 minute walk to find it and 40 Sek each adult. Displays are good, with signs in English and Swedish. Not too much on display but loads",
          "I went to the museum as a part of my \"museum tour\" - 4 different museums in Malmo for one price - and I loved it. Although I am not a technical geek, I can imagine how enthusiastic could they be (children, daddies, grandfathers ;-))! I spent almost 2 hours there, the best part",
          "Highlight was the submarine which you could walk inside and see how cramped working conditions were. Rest of displays whilst interesting was nothing really extraordinary.",
          "Saw the review and went to this with a younger child (5-10 years). Great interactive museum - one of the most enjoyable we have found with lots of hands on activities. Really glad we found and others should look for this. We spent nearly 3 hours.",
          "Great for kids, not really big in size but very attractive museum, a submarine, a first dialysis machine that was introduced in Lund, several aircrafts, an old air traffic control. Tower, a very historical place to understand Sweden's origin and discoveries.",
          "People are normally turned off when it comes to Technology and Maritime, especially when you use them in the same sentence as Museum. Perhaps it's because we went along with such low expectations but we had such a good time here! The exhibits are, themselves, very interesting",
          "You're allowed to sit in/on some of the vehicles, which was fun. There's some good info about \"varied stuff\" (in English) and you can go in the submarine. I like places that let you touch and climb on and interact and this does it, has a bit of info about Malmo/Sweden but it's",
          "One of those rare finds, a museum with exhibits you can interact with. A fire engine, a motorbike and best of all the sub! Really wanted to see this just for the novelty value, it's a lot easier to imagine the 35 men in their cold, cramped claustrophobic conditions, working with",
          "What a fantastic place, staff so friendly and helpful.. And so many different wonderful things to see, my son of 8yrs and his uncle loved playing on the vehicles and the u3 submarine.. What a place and the castle the other side wow!",
          "Just along from the Malm\u00f6hus, with metered parking in front of the castle. It would be very easy to play the smug cosmopolitan card as soon as you walk through the doors of this museum, and if you have sullen teenagers in tow they may well hate you for bringing them in here.",
          "I only visited part of the museum, the part with the submarine and some jet engines and also the mezzanine with a natural history exhibition. It was beautiful, and I should know, I am a museum studies grad. The one thing I love about Scandinavian museums is that there are areas",
          "Very attractive price for a visit - SEK 40 (children under 19 - f.o.c.!), especially after Copenhagen. Interesting exibits of technology, impressive submarine with real ex-marines telling about it. The third store of the museum is extemelly interesting for both teens and adults.",
          "This was amazing value for money. It cost around \u00a38 for a family of four and we spent a good four hours in just the Technology and maritime museum - the ticket allows you to access the historical museum also. There are lots of hands on science exhibits, they were fascinating",
          "This is art of Malmo Musee so see that for more details. Lots to see and do here for everyone. There was an exhibition about astronomy and about discoveries made in Sweden. As someone on dialysis I was fascinated to discover that the first dialysis machine was developed in",
          "Great for adults too. This place kept our kids amused for a few hours while the rain fell outside. We were surprised to see a full submarine to walk/climb through, the third level is all hands on challenges and there's several aircraft inside. Overall great value and more",
          "Really good for children as there is an indoor play area. Lots to see. Inside a submarine, an old air traffic control tower, cars past and present to mention just a few. \u00a34 ish for a ticket that also covered the art/natural history/aquarium (aquarium was the best bit) museum.",
          "As the combined ticket price of 40SEK covers so much - don't miss this if you like the history of transport and travel in Sweden. It's got a lot for the kids with little interactive features and even for bigger kids with planes, boats and cars. The exhibition on life in Sweden",
          "My husband and I had visited the Malm\u00f6hus Castle and the visit to the Technology and Maritime Museum was included in our ticket. My husband being a great technology and maritime fan we knew we could not miss this museum. We decided to walk the short walk to the museum."

          "Getting to walk through the submarine was very neat. I advise tall people to do some stretches first; it's real narrow. If you're claustrophobic, don't go on a busy day. Absolutely recommended.\n\nFor the entry fee of only 40kr you can enter their other museums close by, which include the castle and museum of natural history. Good deal.",

        "wiki": "Malm\u00f6 (; Swedish: [\u02c8m\u00e2lm\u00f8\u02d0] (listen); Danish: Malm\u00f8 [\u02c8m\u00e6lm\u02cc\u00f8\u02c0]) is the largest city in the Swedish county (l\u00e4n) of Sk\u00e5ne (Scania). It is the third-largest city in Sweden, after Stockholm and Gothenburg, and the sixth-largest city in Scandinavia, with a population of 316,588 (municipal total 338,230 in 2018). The Malm\u00f6 Metropolitan Region is home to over 700,000 people, and the \u00d8resund Region, which includes Malm\u00f6, is home to 4 million people.Malm\u00f6 was one of the earliest and most industrialized towns in Scandinavia, but it struggled to adapt to post-industrialism. Since the construction of the \u00d6resund Bridge, Malm\u00f6 has undergone a major transformation, producing new architectural developments, supporting new biotech and IT companies, and attracting students through Malm\u00f6 University and other higher education facilities. The city contains many historic buildings and parks, and is also a commercial center for the western part of Scania.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest written mention of Malm\u00f6 as a city dates from 1275. It is thought to have been founded shortly before that date, as a fortified quay or ferry berth of the Archbishop of Lund, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) to the north-east. Malm\u00f6 was for centuries Denmark's second-biggest city. Its original name was Malmhaug (with alternate spellings), meaning \"Gravel pile\" or \"Ore Hill\".\nIn the 15th century, Malm\u00f6 became one of Denmark's largest and most visited cities, reaching a population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. It became the most important city around the \u00d8resund, with the German Hanseatic League frequenting it as a marketplace, and was notable for its flourishing herring fishery. In 1437, King Eric of Pomerania (King of Denmark from 1396 to 1439) granted the city's arms: argent with a griffin gules, based on Eric's arms from Pomerania. The griffin's head as a symbol of Malm\u00f6 extended to the entire province of Scania from 1660.\nIn 1434, a new citadel was constructed at the beach south of the town. This fortress, known today as Malm\u00f6hus, did not take its current form until the mid-16th century. Several other fortifications were constructed, making Malm\u00f6 Sweden's most fortified city, but only Malm\u00f6hus remains.\n\nLutheran teachings spread during the 16th century Protestant Reformation, and Malm\u00f6 became one of the first cities in Scandinavia to fully convert (1527\u20131529) to this Protestant denomination.\nIn the 17th century, Malm\u00f6 and the Scanian region (Sk\u00e5neland) came under control of Sweden following the Treaty of Roskilde with Denmark, signed in 1658. Fighting continued, however; in June 1677, 14,000 Danish troops laid siege to Malm\u00f6 for a month, but were unable to defeat the Swedish troops holding it.\nBy the dawn of the 18th century, Malm\u00f6 had about 2,300 inhabitants. However, owing to the wars of Charles XII of Sweden (reigned 1697\u20131718) and to bubonic plague epidemics, the population dropped to 1,500 by 1727. The population did not grow much until the modern harbor was constructed in 1775. The city started to expand and the population in 1800 was 4,000. 15 years later, it had increased to 6,000.\n\nIn 1840, Frans Henrik Kockum founded the workshop from which the Kockums shipyard eventually developed as one of the largest shipyards in the world. The Southern Main Line was built between 1856 and 1864; this enabled Malm\u00f6 to become a center of manufacture, with major textile and mechanical industries. In 1870, Malm\u00f6 overtook Norrk\u00f6ping to become Sweden's third-most populous city, and by 1900 Malm\u00f6 had strengthened this position with 60,000 inhabitants. Malm\u00f6 continued to grow through the first half of the 20th century. The population had swiftly increased to 100,000 by 1915 and to 200,000 by 1952.\n\n\n=== 1900\u20131969 ===\n\nIn 1914 (15 May to 4 October) Malm\u00f6 hosted the Baltic Exhibition. The large park Pildammsparken was arranged and planted for this large event. The Russian part of the exhibition was never taken down, owing to the outbreak of World War I.\nOn 18 and 19 December 1914, the Three Kings Meeting was held in Malm\u00f6. After a somewhat infected period (1905\u20131914), which included the dissolution of the Swedish-Norwegian Union, King Oscar II was replaced with King H\u00e5kon VII in Norway, who was the younger brother of the Danish King Christian X. As Oscar died in 1907, and his son Gustav V became the new King of Sweden, the tensions within Scandinavia were still unclear, but during this historical meeting, the Scandinavian Kings found internal understanding, as well as a common line about remaining neutral in the ongoing war.\nWithin sports, Malm\u00f6 has mostly been associated with football. IFK Malm\u00f6 participated in the first ever edition of Allsvenskan 1924/25, but from the mid-1940s Malm\u00f6 FF started to rise, and ever since it has been one of the most prominent clubs within Swedish football. They have won Allsvenskan 23 times in all (as of February 2018) between 1943/44 and 2017.\n\n\n=== 1970s and later ===\nBy 1971, Malm\u00f6 reached 265,000 inhabitants, but this was the peak which would stand for more than 30 years. (Svedala was, for a few years in the early 1970s, a part of Malm\u00f6 municipality.)\nBy the mid-1970s Sweden experienced a recession that hit the industrial sector especially hard; shipyards and manufacturing industries suffered, which led to high unemployment in many cities of Scania. Kockums shipyard had become a symbol of Malm\u00f6 as its largest employer and, when shipbuilding ceased in 1986, confidence in the future of Malm\u00f6 plummeted among politicians and the public. In addition, many middle-class families moved into one-family houses in surrounding municipalities such as Vellinge Municipality, Lomma Municipality and Staffanstorp Municipality, which profiled themselves as the suburbs of the upper-middle class. By 1985, Malm\u00f6 had lost 35,000 inhabitants and was down to 229,000.The Swedish financial crises of the early 1990s exacerbated Malm\u00f6's decline as an industrial city; between 1990 and 1995 Malm\u00f6 lost about 27,000 jobs and its economy was seriously strained. However, from 1994 under the leadership of the then mayor Ilmar Reepalu, the city of Malm\u00f6 started to create a new economy as a center of culture and knowledge. Malm\u00f6 reached bottom in 1995, but that same year marked the commencement of the massive \u00d6resund Bridge road, railway and tunnel project, connecting it to Copenhagen and to the rail lines of Europe. The new Malm\u00f6 University opened in 1998 on Kockums' former dockside. Further redevelopment of the now disused south-western harbor followed; a city architecture exposition (Bo01) was held in the area in 2001, and its buildings and villas form the core of a new city district. Designed with attractive waterfront vistas, it was intended to be and has been successful in attracting the urban middle-class.\nSince 1974, the Kockums Crane had been a landmark in Malm\u00f6 and a symbol of the city's manufacturing industry, but in 2002 it was disassembled and moved to South Korea. In 2005, Malm\u00f6 gained a new landmark with completion of Turning Torso, the tallest skyscraper in Scandinavia. Although the transformation from a city with its economic base in manufacturing has returned growth to Malm\u00f6, the new types of jobs have largely benefited the middle and upper classes.\nIn its 2015 and 2017 reports, Police in Sweden placed the Roseng\u00e5rd and the S\u00f6dra Sofielund/Seved district in the most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMalm\u00f6 is located at 13\u00b000' east and 55\u00b035' north, near the southwestern tip of Sweden, in the province of Scania.\nThe city is part of the transnational \u00d6resund Region and, since 2000, has been linked by the \u00d6resund Bridge across the \u00d6resund to Copenhagen, Denmark. The bridge opened on 1 July 2000, and measures 8 kilometres (5 miles) (the whole link totalling 16 km), with pylons reaching 204.5 metres (670.9 feet) vertically. Apart from the Helsingborg-Helsing\u00f8r ferry links further north, most ferry connections have been discontinued.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nMalm\u00f6, like the rest of southern Sweden, has an oceanic climate. Despite its northern location, the climate is mild compared to other locations at similar latitudes, mainly because of the influence of the Gulf Stream and also its westerly position on the Eurasian landmass. Owing to its northern latitude, daylight lasts 17 hours in midsummer, but only around seven hours in midwinter. According to data from 2002\u20132014 Falsterbo, to the south of the city, received an annual average of 1,895 hours of sunshine while Lund, to the north, received 1,803 hours. The sunshine data in the weather box is based on the data for Falsterbo.Summers are mild with average high temperatures of 20 to 23 \u00b0C (68 to 73 \u00b0F) and lows of around 11 to 13 \u00b0C (52 to 55 \u00b0F). Heat waves during the summer arise occasionally. Winters are fairly cold and windy, with temperatures steady between \u22123 to 4 \u00b0C (27 to 39 \u00b0F), but it rarely drops below \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F).\nRainfall is light to moderate throughout the year with 169 wet days. Snowfall occurs mainly in December through March, but snow covers do not remain for a long time, and some winters are virtually free of snow.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\u00d6resund Line trains cross the \u00d6resund Bridge every 20 minutes (hourly late night) connecting Malm\u00f6 to Copenhagen, and the Copenhagen Airport. The trip takes around 35\u201340 minutes. Additionally, some of the X 2000 and Intercity trains to Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Kalmar cross the bridge, stopping at Copenhagen Airport. In March 2005, excavation began on a new railway connection called the City Tunnel, which opened for traffic on 4 December 2010. The tunnel runs south from Malm\u00f6 Central Station through an underground station at the Triangeln railway station to Hylliev\u00e5ng (Hyllie Meadow). Then, the line comes to the surface to enter Hyllie Station, also created as part of the tunnel project. From Hyllie Station, the line connects to the existing \u00d6resund line in either direction, with the \u00d6resund Bridge lying due west.\nBesides the Copenhagen Airport, Malm\u00f6 has an airport of its own, Malm\u00f6 Airport, today chiefly used for domestic Swedish destinations, charter flights and low-cost carriers.\nThe motorway system has been incorporated with the \u00d6resund Bridge; the European route E20 goes over the bridge and then, together with the European route E6 follows the Swedish west coast from Malm\u00f6\u2013Helsingborg to Gothenburg. E6 goes further north along the west coast and through Norway to the Norwegian town Kirkenes at Barents Sea. The European route to J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping\u2013Stockholm (E4) starts at Helsingborg. Main roads in the directions of V\u00e4xj\u00f6\u2013Kalmar, Kristianstad\u2013Karlskrona, Ystad (E65), and Trelleborg start as freeways.\nMalm\u00f6 has 410 kilometres (250 mi) of bike paths; approximately 40% of all commuting is done by bicycle.\n\n\n=== Ports ===\nThe city has two industrial harbors; one is still in active use and is the largest Nordic port for car importation. It also has two marinas: the publicly owned Limhamn Marina (55\u00b035\u2032N 12\u00b055\u2032E) and the private Lagunen (55\u00b035\u2032N 12\u00b056\u2032E), both offering a limited number of guest docks.\nPublic transport consisted of a tram network from 1887 until 1973. Afterwards, it was replaced by a bus network.\n\n\n=== Malm\u00f6 S-Train ===\nA local train line with circular traffic at seven stations was opened in December 2018. The stations are Malm\u00f6 Central Station (underground platforms) \u2013 Triangeln station \u2013 Hyllie station \u2013 Malm\u00f6 South/Sv\u00e5gertorp \u2013 Persborg \u2013 Roseng\u00e5rd \u2013 \u00d6sterv\u00e4rn \u2013 Malm\u00f6 Central Station (main overground terminus). Some trains arrive from Kristianstad and finish with a lap around Malm\u00f6, whilst other trains at this circular line, never drive outside the city limits. There is at least a 30 minutes service between each departure, but far more between the Central Station and Hyllie. Extension plans of a minor network system exists.\n\n\n=== Proposed metro ===\nThe \u00d6resundsmetro is a proposed rapid transit network linking Malm\u00f6 with the existing Copenhagen Metro through a 22 km tunnel under the \u00d6resund.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nMalm\u00f6 Municipality is an administrative unit defined by geographical borders, consisting of the City of Malm\u00f6 and its immediate surroundings.\nMalm\u00f6 (Malm\u00f6 t\u00e4tort) consists of the urban part of the municipality together with the small town of Arl\u00f6v in the Burl\u00f6v Municipality. Both municipalities also include smaller urban areas and rural areas, such as the suburbs of Oxie and \u00c5karp. Malm\u00f6 t\u00e4tort is to be distinguished from Malm\u00f6 stad (the city of Malm\u00f6), which is a semi-official name of Malm\u00f6 Municipality.\nThe leaders in Malm\u00f6 created a commission for a socially sustainable Malm\u00f6 in November 2010. The commissions were tasked with providing evidence-based strategies for reducing health inequalities and improve living conditions for all citizens of Malm\u00f6, especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged and issued its final report in December 2013.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nMalm\u00f6 has a young population by Swedish standards, with almost half of the population under the age of 35 (48.2%).After 1971, Malm\u00f6 had 265,000 inhabitants, but the population then dropped to 229,000 by 1985. The total population of the urban area was 280,415 in December 2010. It then began to rise again, and had passed the previous record by the 1 January 2003 census, when it had 265,481 inhabitants. On 27 April 2011, the population of Malm\u00f6 reached the 300,000 mark. In 2017 the total population of the city was 316,588 inhabitants out of a municipal total of 338,230.In 2019, approximately 55.5% of the population of Malm\u00f6 municipality (190,849 residents) had at least one parent born abroad. The Middle East, Horn of Africa, former Yugoslavia and Denmark are the main sources of immigration. In addition, 14.8% (50 999 residents) of the population in 2019 were foreign nationals.Foreign-born population by country, 31 December 2018:\n\nGreater Malm\u00f6 is one of Sweden's three officially recognized metropolitan areas (storstadsomr\u00e5den) and since 2005 is defined as the municipality of Malm\u00f6 and 11 other municipalities in the southwestern corner of Scania. As of 2019, its population was recorded as 740,840. The region covers an area of 2,522 square kilometres (974 sq mi). The municipalities included, apart from Malm\u00f6, are Burl\u00f6v, Esl\u00f6v, H\u00f6\u00f6r, K\u00e4vlinge, Lomma, Lund, Skurup, Staffanstorp, Svedala, Trelleborg and Vellinge. Together with Lund, Malm\u00f6 is the region's economic and education hub.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Malm\u00f6 was traditionally based on shipbuilding (Kockums) and construction-related industries, such as concrete factories. The region's leading university, along with its associated hi-tech and pharmaceutical industries, is located in Lund about 16 kilometres (10 miles) to the north-east. As a result, Malm\u00f6 had a troubled economic situation following the mid-1970s. Between 1990\u20131995, 27,000 jobs were lost, and the budget deficit was more than one billion Swedish krona (SEK). In 1995, Malm\u00f6 had Sweden's highest unemployment rate.However, during the last two decades, there has been a revival. One contributing factor has been the economic integration with Denmark brought about by the \u00d6resund Bridge, which opened in July 2000. Also the university founded in 1998 and the effects of integration into the European Union have contributed. In 2017 the unemployment rate is still high but Malm\u00f6 has, in the last 20 years, had one of the strongest employment growth rates in Sweden. But a lot of those jobs are taken by workers outside the neighboring municipalities.As of 2016, the largest companies were:\nSkanska \u2013 heavy construction\nNobina \u2013 transport\nPostNord \u2013 postal services\nP\u00e5gen \u2013 bakery\nIKEA \u2013 furnitureAlmost 30 companies have moved their headquarters to Malm\u00f6 during the last seven years, generating around 2,300 jobs. Among them are IKEA who has most of its headquarter functions based in Malm\u00f6.The number of start-up companies is high in Malm\u00f6. Around 7 new companies are started every day in Malm\u00f6. In 2010, the renewal of the number of companies amounted to 13.9%, which exceeds both Stockholm and Gothenburg. Especially strong growth is in the gaming area with Massive entertainment and King being the flagship companies for the industry. Among the industries that continue to increase their share of companies in Malm\u00f6 are transport, financial and business services, entertainment, leisure and construction.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMalm\u00f6 has the country's ninth-largest school of higher education, Malm\u00f6 University, established in 1998. It has 1,600 employees and 24,000 students (2014).\nIn addition nearby Lund University (established in 1666) has some education located in Malm\u00f6:\n\nMalm\u00f6 Art Academy (Konsth\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nMalm\u00f6 Academy of Music (Musikh\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nMalm\u00f6 Theatre Academy (Teaterh\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nThe Faculty of Medicine, which is located in both Malm\u00f6 and Lund.The United Nations World Maritime University is also located in Malm\u00f6. The World Maritime University (WMU) operates under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized agency of the United Nations. WMU thus enjoys the status, privileges and immunities of a UN institution in Sweden.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Film and television ===\nA striking depiction of Malm\u00f6 (in the 1930s) was made by Bo Widerberg in his debut film Kvarteret Korpen (Raven's End) (1963), largely shot in the shabby Korpen working-class district in Malm\u00f6. With humour and tenderness, it depicts the tensions between classes and generations.  The movie was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1965. In 2017, the film Medan Vi Lever (While We Live) was awarded the prize for best film by an African living abroad at the Africa Movie Academy Awards. It was filmed in Malm\u00f6 and Gambia, and deals with identity, integration and everyday racism.The cities of Malm\u00f6 and Copenhagen are, with the \u00d6resund Bridge, the main locations in the television series The Bridge (Bron/Broen).\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\nIn 1944, Malm\u00f6 Stadsteater (Malm\u00f6 Municipal Theatre) was established with a repertoire comprising stage theatre, opera, musical, ballet, musical recitals and experimental theatre. In 1993 it was split into three units, Dramatiska Teater (Dramatical Theatre), Malm\u00f6 Musikteater (Music Theatre) and Sk\u00e5nes Dansteater (Scanian Dance Theatre) and the name was abandoned. The ownership of the last two were transferred to Region Sk\u00e5ne in 2006 Dramatiska Teatern regained its old name. In the 1950s Ingmar Bergman was the Director and Chief Stage Director of Malm\u00f6 Stadsteater and many of his actors, like Max von Sydow and Ingrid Thulin became known through his films. Later stage directors include Staffan Valdemar Holm and G\u00f6ran Stangertz. Malm\u00f6 Musikteater were renamed Malm\u00f6 Operan and plays operas and musicals, classics as newly composed, on one of Scandinavia's large opera scenes with 1,511 seats. Sk\u00e5nes dansteater is active and plays contemporary dance repertory and present works by Swedish and international choreographers in their house in Malm\u00f6 harbor.Since the 1970s the city has also been home to independent theatre groups and show/musical companies. It also hosts a rock/dance/dub culture; in the 1960s The Rolling Stones played the Klubb Bongo, and in recent years stars like Morrissey, Nick Cave, B.B. King and Pat Metheny have made repeated visits.\nThe Cardigans debuted in Malm\u00f6 and recorded their albums there. On 7 January 2009 CNN Travel broadcast a segment called \"MyCity_MyLife\" featuring Nina Persson taking the camera to some of the sites in Malm\u00f6 that she enjoys.\nThe Rooseum Center for Contemporary Art, founded in 1988 by the Swedish art collector and financier Fredrik Roos and housed in a former power station which had been built in 1900, was one of the foremost centers for contemporary art in Europe during the 1980s and 1990s. By 2006, most of the collection had been sold off and the museum was on a time-out; by 2010 Rooseum had been dismantled and a subsidiary of the National Museum of Modern Art inaugurated in its place.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nIn 1992 and in 2013 Malm\u00f6 was the host of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nModerna Museet Malm\u00f6 was opened in December 2009  in the old Rooseum building. It is a part of the Moderna Museet, with independent exhibitions of modern and contemporary art. The collection of Moderna Museet holds key pieces of, among others, Marcel Duchamp, Louise Bourgeois, Pablo Picasso, Niki de Saint Phalle, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Carolee Schneemann, Henri Matisse and Robert RauschenbergMalm\u00f6 Museum (Malm\u00f6 Museer) is a municipal and regional museum. The museum features exhibitions on technology, shipping, natural history and history. Malm\u00f6 Museum has an aquarium and an art museum. Malm\u00f6hus Castle is also operated as a part of the museum.\nExhibitions are primarily shown at Slottsholmen and at the Technology and Maritime Museum (Teknikens och sj\u00f6fartens hus).Malm\u00f6 Konsthall is one of the largest exhibition halls in Europe for contemporary art, opened in 1975.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMalm\u00f6's oldest building is St. Peter's Church (Swedish: Sankt Petri). It was built in the early 14th century in Baltic Brick Gothic probably after St Mary's Church in L\u00fcbeck. The church is built with a nave, two aisles, a transept and a tower. Its exterior is characterized above all by the flying buttresses spanning its airy arches over the aisles and ambulatory. The tower, which fell down twice during the 15th century, got its current look in 1890. Another major church of significance is the Church of Our Saviour, Malm\u00f6, which was founded in 1870.\nAnother old building is Tunneln, 300 metres (1,000 ft) to the west of Sankt Petri Church, which also dates back to around 1300.\nThe oldest parts of Malm\u00f6 were built between 1300\u20131600 during its first major period of expansion. The central city's layout, as well as some of its oldest buildings, are from this time. Many of the smaller buildings from this time are typical Scanian: two-story urban houses that show a strong Danish influence.Recession followed in the ensuing centuries. The next expansion period was in the mid 19th century and led to the modern stone and brick city. This expansion lasted into the 20th century and can be seen by a number of Art Nouveau buildings, among those in the Malm\u00f6 synagogue. Malm\u00f6 was relatively late to be influenced by modern ideas of functionalist tenement architecture in the 1930s.\nAround 1965, the government initiated the so-called Million Programme, intending to offer affordable apartments in the outskirts of major Swedish cities. But this period also saw the reconstruction (and razing) of much of the historical city center.Since the late 1990s, Malm\u00f6 has seen a more cosmopolitan architecture. V\u00e4stra Hamnen (The Western Harbor), like most of the harbor to the north of the city center, was industrial. In 2001 its reconstruction began as an urban residential neighbourhood, with 500 residential units, most were part of the exhibition Bo01. The exhibition had two main objectives: develop self-sufficient housing units in terms of energy and greatly diminish phosphorus emissions. Among the new building's towers were the Turning Torso, a skyscraper with a twisting design, 190 metres (620 ft) tall, the majority of which is residential. It became Malm\u00f6's new landmark. The most recent addition (2015) is the new development of Malm\u00f6 Live. This new building features a hotel, a concert hall, congress hall and a sky bar in the center of Malm\u00f6. Point Hyllie is a new 110 m commercial tower that is under construction as of 2018.\n\n\n=== Other sights ===\n\nThe beach Ribersborg, by locals usually called Ribban, south-west of the harbor area, is a man-made shallow beach, stretching along Malm\u00f6's coastline. Despite Malm\u00f6's chilly climate, it is sometimes referred to as the \"Copacabana of Malm\u00f6\". It is the site of Ribersborgs open-air bath, opened in the 1890s.\nThe long boardwalk at The Western Harbor, Scaniaparken and Daniaparken, has become a favorite summer hang-out for the people of Malm\u00f6 and is a popular place for bathing. The harbor is particularly popular with Malm\u00f6's vibrant student community and has been the scene of several impromptu outdoor parties and gatherings.\n\n\n=== Annual events ===\n\nIn the third week of August each year a festival, Malm\u00f6festivalen, fills the streets of Malm\u00f6 with different kinds of cuisines and events.\nBUFF International Film Festival, an international children and young people's film festival, is held in Malm\u00f6 every year in March.\nNordisk Panorama \u2013 Nordic Short & Doc Film Festival, a film festival for short and documentary films by filmmakers from the Nordic countries, is held every year in September.\nMalm\u00f6 Arab Film Festival (MAFF), the largest Arabic film festival in Europe, is held in Malm\u00f6.\nThe Nordic Game conference takes place in Malm\u00f6 every April/May. The event consists of conference itself, recruitment expo and game expo and attracts hundreds of gamedev professionals every year.\nMalm\u00f6 also hosts other 3rd party events that cater to all communities that reside in Malm\u00f6, including religious and political celebrations.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nSydsvenskan, founded in 1870, is Malm\u00f6's largest daily newspaper. It has an average circulation of 130,000. Its main competitor is the regional daily Sk\u00e5nska Dagbladet, which has a circulation of 34,000. The tabloid Kv\u00e4llsposten still has a minimal editorial staff but is today just a version of a Stockholm tabloid. The Social Democratic Arbetet was edited and printed at Malm\u00f6 between 1887 and 2000.In addition to these, a number of free-of-charge papers, generally dealing with entertainment, music and fashion have local editions (for instance City, Rodeo, Metro and N\u00f6jesguiden). Malm\u00f6 is also home to the Egmont Group's Swedish magazine operations. A number of local and regional radio and TV broadcasters are based in the Greater Malm\u00f6 area.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\n\n==== Football ====\n\nSports in southern Sweden are dominated by football. Over the years the city's best football teams have been Malm\u00f6 FF who play in the top-level Allsvenskan Malm\u00f6 FF had their most successful periods in the 1970s and 1980s when they won the league several times. In 1979, they advanced to the final of the European Cup defeating AS Monaco, Dynamo Kiew, Wisla Krakow and Austria Wien (Vienna) but lost in the final at the Munich Olympic Stadium against Nottingham Forest by a single goal just before half time scored by Trevor Francis. To date, they are the only Swedish football club to have reached the final of the competition. Malm\u00f6 FF is the club where for instance, Bosse Larsson and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 began their football careers.  A second football team, IFK Malm\u00f6 played in Sweden's top flight for about 20 years and the club's quarterfinal in the European Cup is the club's greatest achievement in its history. Today, the club resides in the sixth tier of the Swedish league system.\nFC Roseng\u00e5rd (former LdB Malm\u00f6) are playing in the top level in Damallsvenskan, women's football league. FC Roseng\u00e5rd girls have won the league 10 times and the national cup title 5 times. In 2014, they reached the semi-final in Champions League, which they ultimately went on to lose to the German side 1. FFC Frankfurt. Brazilian football player Marta, widely regarded the best female football player of all time, played in FC Roseng\u00e5rd between 2014 and 2017.\nAt the 1958 FIFA World Cup Malm\u00f6 Stadion was inaugurated in combination with the opening match of the cup, as World Champions West Germany defeated Argentina 3\u20131, in front of 31,156, a record attendance for Malm\u00f6 in general. Another two games were decided at the stadium.\n\n\n==== Other sports ====\nMalm\u00f6 has athletes competing in a variety of sport.\n\n\n===== Ice hockey =====\nThe most notable other sports team is the ice hockey team Malm\u00f6 Redhawks. They were the creation of millionaire Percy Nilsson and quickly rose to the highest rank in the early to mid-1990s and won two Swedish championships, but for a number of years have found themselves residing outside of the top flight. \n\n\n===== Handball =====\nA first division handball team, HK Malm\u00f6, attracts a fair amount of attendance. \n\n\n===== Rugby =====\nRugby union team, Malm\u00f6 RC, founded in 1954, have won 6 national championships.

          "I visited Den Bla Planet with my sons, 9 and 11 years old. Our transportation and entrance were free with the Copenhagen card, so I can speak only the value I felt in spending our time at Den Bla Planet. It's was very easy to get to from our hotel in Nyhavn with public",
          "Not the biggest aquarium but a good mix of animals including tropical fish and polar fish. Also a great shark tank with large rays",
          "The fish here are amazing, and so is the presentation. There is everything from piranhas and crabs to octopuses and huge cute fish \ud83d\udc09 We both loved the interactive attractions such as the area where you can touch fish and the area with fish who eat your dead skin. Sure, there",

          "I can compare this aquarium to many others, and it's really a well maintained one with many exhibits. At the same time, it doesn't have anything special, one or two things to remember, to let it stand out. It could be a good idea to visit this attraction, especially if you come",
          "It's Chrismas day, rains, nothing else is open, you have a Copenhagen card that grants you free access...sure go for it It's small so if you have visited bigger aquariums like Genova you will likely not find it worth the money Side note staff very nice",
          "Not an overly large aquarium, but there are some really lovely features. The otters were very cheeky and playful and the tropical walkthrough area was nice and warm on such a cold rainy day! The large viewing tank with rays and sharks is extremely relaxing and it really is a",
          "This was a great place for adults and children. We went in December with our 5 year old and almost 2 year old - they both enjoyed it. The place was not overcrowded like you would get if you were in London. We got to touch the rays and starfish. The rainforest part was actually",
          "This wasn\u2019t the largest aquarium I\u2019d ever been to but was really good. The staff were friendly and helpful and even did their talks in both danish and English. Watching the sea otters being fed and playing was fun, but for me watching the large tank with the sharks and rays was",
          "I am big aquarium enthusiast. If I hear of an aquarium in a town that I am traveling to I will go out of my way to visit it just because I dig seeing beautiful underwater animals in their element. The Blue Planet National Aquarium of Denmark is not the biggest or best aquarium",
          "Great to go before the airport as there\u2019s a free shuttle bus and big lockers. Could stay all day on the beanbags watching the main tank. The otters were very cute and lots of interactive things. There\u2019s deckchairs and kids play area outside. Cafe tasty and ok price.",
          "Far smaller than I had hoped/was led to believe from guidebooks & the Internet. The building is beautiful & designed to look like a whooshing wave. The Amazon Rainforest Exhibit was great - both above & below the waterline. I was thrilled to see arapaima swimming around,",
          "Not so good. I was expecting something better, and bigger. No big fish like sharks,except 2-3. If it\u2019s your first time in aquarium is ok. If you have been in other, don\u2019t go.",
          "A beautiful aquarium with a variety of sea life. There is a interactive area where you can touch the fish and starfish. Very popular with family with kid. Expect lots of noises. Quite a walking distance from the closest train station. Tips: included in Copenhagen Card 72 hours",
          "10 minutes ago The aquarium itself is beautiful. Still I'm concerned about the animals' health. People are constantly taking pictures with flash. Visitors (mostly parents with children) are loud as hell, making the fish uncomfortable and very very stressed. They're constantly",
          "It was the last thing visited by me in Copenhagen, on the way to the airport, which is very close. Much smaller than I expected, in just a little over an hour I had seen everything. To this sensation contributed probably the fact that \u201cThe rainforest\u201d section was closed for",
          "This is a great indoor activity when it\u2019s raining outside, but it\u2019s a decent trek from the city center. It takes about an hour to go though the entire thing. The sea otters were active and the underground shark tunnel was cool - but much shorter than I was expecting. There were",
          "We visited again and though we were gutted that the Amazon/rain forest area was closed it was still a brilliant place to visit Also want to give a thankyou to the shop assistant in the gift shop, he was brilliant, we went to leave and he said about the animal coming out",
          "The overall experience of the place, is that it is an impressive place. They have several good lectures and guided tours. My but, goes on to several of their aquariums, where it seems as if there is too little space for the animals.",
          "This is one of the must-see attractions in Copenhagen. We didn't pay an entrance fee because we had a Copenhagen Card, and the line wasn't long either, even if it was a saturday. The fish are beautiful. My favorite part was the tunnel that went under the aquarium with the big",
          "Just to preface, if you need to go to the airport and not sure what to do with your luggage theres storage lockers here for suitcases and bags so you can go straight to the airport. I found this aquarium really small, as you walk it is separated into 3 sections. sections 2 and",
          "The aquarium has some fantastic exhibits such as the tank full of piranhas, the shark tunnel, and the sea birds exhibit (where you can watch the birds swim underwater). To get to the aquarium, take the M2 train and get off the Kastrup Station. You can then walk east for 10",
          "the aquarium \"blue planet\" offers a great seletion of species, including a relatively large tank wich features sharks. it is located in the vecinity of Copenhagen Airport and travellers may want to use their time in transit to visit the place. it is certainly worth a visit.",
          "Went here just to look around and because it was a nice walk from the hotel. The aquarium is well thought out and has a lot of educational pieces that take more than one visit to take it all in--if you read every thing. The large tank with the sharks, rays, etc., is amazing",
          "Great experience! So well laid out and presented and so well run! Excellent information boards in three languages (including English). Lockers to leave your luggage. Good cafe etc. Highlights - fish which nibble the skin from your hands, touching rays in a big open pool, seeing",
          "Cool aquarium with some interesting attractions like the sea otters. The location next to the sea is great and the building beautiful. Nothing special though... it wouldn't be a highly recommended attraction in Copenhagen for me as it is quite small and expensive for what it is.",
          "This will take your breath away. The size of the main tank is amazing. It looks like the size of an Imax screen. All wellaid out. And the otters are really good to watch. Easy to get to by the very accessible Metro.",
          "Beautifully designed aquarium with lots of varied viewing set ups. Many different \u201cenvironments\u201d all full of marine life. There also seemed to be lots of active and hands on areas for kids- school groups and families. It\u2019s closer to the airport than the city center so only go",
          "Not the biggest aquarium which I quickly learned with 9 hours to still krill before my flight! But enjoyed it nether-less, the shows were informative and in English and danish",
          "The Danish have extraordinary skill and talent for presentation - any museum will confirm that - but this modern aquarium is a prime example of marrying architecture, content, accessibility and experience. Size appropriate for the city, the displays are diverse, beautifully",
          "Visited on a sunny day with a 9 year old and a 16 months old - both were greatly entertained (and I learned a little as well ;) ) expensive and heard from others that it can be crowded on a rainy day, but in total a great experience.",
          "Lots of fish to look at. Some kids were moaning that they couldn't find Nemo, but they obviously didn't look too hard as I found him without any trouble. Worth a visit if you like fish. Not so much if you don't.",
          "The aquarium is located a short walk from the new driver less Metro. You can bring a picnic and there is an outdoor playground for smaller children. The fish were obviously the main attraction and there is loads to see and touch. A great place to visit.",
          "We decided to visit the aquarium during our few days in Copenhagen as it looked interesting and took us to a different part of the city. Entry was included in our Copenhagen cards and it was easy to get to using the M2 metro line with about a 10 minute walk to the Aquarium",
          "Yes, it has fish in tanks, touch pools, ecological explanarions, a big glass tunnel through one of the tanks - all the things you expect. But it's also in a very cool curvy star-shaped building on the harbour which really works well to make it a good experience. And it has",
          "This is a fairly new building made for the purpose, and therefore well suited to modern ways of exhibisions. Divided in different areas and with good descriptions. We were there on a rainy day, and it was a bit crowded.",
          "Great family outing when visiting Copenhagen. Easy to reach from the city on the M2 Metro line with a short walk from the Kalstrup Station. We used our Copenhagen (tourist) Card to cover the entry fees for two adults and two children, so was good value (would have cost around",
          "Beautiful, a nice aquarium, outstanding for little ones, it's Interactive, there a little play diving boot, you can pet seastars, there is a beautiful playground .. we've had 2 hours full of fun! Even our little one of 8 months loved to watch the Fishes.",
          "Spent more than 3hours in Aquarium with my teenage daughter, seen all the exhibitions, huge aquariums, touch pools, watched the training and feeding of sea otters - no suppression, only positive approach. The territory is rather big, with nice open air patio and play ground for",
          "Beautiful aquarium with different things to do rather than just look at fish to keep the kids entertained. They have a kids play submarine inside and an underground little cave for them to crawl into and look up at fish also little games along the walls to play with and a lovely",
          "Aquarium is just amazing, a lot of different animals, divided in three sections. They offer a lot of activities for children. There is also a terace with great see view.",
          "Probably the best place to observe the life of the animals in both ocrans, rivers and tropical climate. It deserves the money. You will be able to see and touch different animals that live in water, divided in 3 regions. The space is preety big and there are many surprises on",
          "This Aquarium is well worth a visit! Loads if interactive things for all to do including \"Doctor Fish\" - Loads of talks and a playground! Lockers also available to store all your bags which was great!",
          "Pretty, but somewhat limited for what you pay. We made the mistake of coming during the school holidays, but despite tge crowds it didn't take us very long to see everything there was to see.",
          "Disappointing. I did not see anything special in this aquarium, and it was quite small compared to the other European ones. The place is quite family friendly though.",
          "From the minute you approach this building you are drawn in by the architecture. It is well designed to make your experience as enjoyable as possible. There are three main sections to it and the talks are really good. The kids can get involved in feeding some of the fish, and",
          "We visited the aquarium using our Copenhagen Card on the final day of our trip after dropping our luggage off at the airport. It\u2019s easy to access by public transport, just 10 minutes from the metro station and about five minutes from a bus stop. The aquarium was very hands on",
          "Blue Planet is one of the main attractions in Copenhagen. It\u2019s a good day out for all. Everything in the way of fish and sea life here. Even Sea Otters. Pricey souvenir shop. Easy to get to using the Metro. It\u2019s a short walk from the station, but is well signposted. Hop on, Hop",
          "The fish and wildlife are beautiful and amazing, totally worth seeing! As a tropics lover I adored the second wing with the rainforest part, piranha and etc. Also very important to mention that it was the first aquarium, where we saw a nice exhibition of European waterlife, fish",
          "The Blue Planet is a very beautiful aquarium with many fascinating fishes and sea creatures - we especially liked the big ocean aquarium where sharks are swimming close pass you. With every aquarium there is an interactive display with useful information about each of the",
          "I've been to lots of aquariums and this was the best. You can walk around yourself and sitting on beanbags gazing at the huge fish tank was amazing. Top floor water play area was a hit too.",
          "So glad went to the Aquarium ( not something we would do in a city break). Loved the setting loved the exhibits and the big tank with the tunnel was lovely. Great place to spend a few hours and is suitable to all ages.",
          "Really enjoyed it. Was looking to a time filler due to flight cancellations and getting an extra day on a low budget. Could stroke the fish and star fish and the shark tank was fantastic Went 4pm and was out by half 5 spent most of the time with the sea otters (who love to put",
          "This was included in our Copenhagen card, and what a great couple of hours we had. We got there early and managed to beat the queues, when we were leaving the queue was huge! The aquarium has different sections, including sea lions outside which happened to be feeding time when",
          "I came here with my friend & her 2 little ones. The kids (both under 5) loved it, great outdoor area too for when the weather is dry, lots to see & do, very interesting.",
          "It was a nice aquarium to visit. We loved viewing the different areas. It would be a great place for littles. They had a wonderful outdoor play area and the kids seem to love it",
          "Whenever there's an aquarium in a city we're visiting, we just go to see it. So we've seen quite a lot of them, the past decades. And maybe they're not always very modern or large, they never fall to impress. But a few of them deserve some extra praise. Like this fairly new one",
          "My family and I spent delightful hours in the aquarium. The aquarium has many areas for children to interact with sea animals and touching the stingrays was the highlight of their day. The kids had lots of fun playing outside with all the water toys. Highly recommend.",
          "The design is a strong reason for the success. A drawback is that many of the (plexi)glass is difficult to see through murky waters. If they could solve those viewing issues it would greatly improve experience.",
          "Took the family here on a warm sunny day and ended up spending most of it in the play area where there is a lot of water-based toys for kids to play with. Ideal when it\u2019s hot. There is also a lot of different displays inside and a stand where kids can get up close to small fish",
          "It's a nice experiance, but it's nothing special. There aren't so many things to see and it takes a lot to come there. Around 45 minutes from the city centre. And the price is not so popular.",
          "We've visited a wide range of aquariums from Osaka in Japan to Monterey on the west coast of the US. 10 years ago the Danish aquarium was in the dark ages in an old building north of the city, but with their move to this absolutely amazing new building right by the sirport",
          "I loved my recent visit to Den Bla Planet. There were many hands-on activities for children but it was also very impressive and fun for adults. There were also live informational \"exhibits\" involving the sea otters, oceanic fish, and even a mermaid meet & greet in the rainforest",
          "This place is a good choice for families with kids especially if weather is bad outside. We liked it. Kids were impressed that it was allowed to touch some fish, crabs and starfish! It to approximately 3 hours to walk around, read some info in interactive screens. We could spend",
          "Worthwhile for kids. The sections are quite informative. I was wondering about the amount of resources required to maintain the Amazon rainforest. Watching the sea otters feed is pleasant. There is aplenty outdoor space for kids and adults and if the weather permits, one can",
          "Spent part of a day at the aquarium with the family while on vacation. We all enjoyed our time there wandering through the different displays of fish, sea creatures and more. The aquarium is a bit outside central Copenhagen - one stop from the airport at Kastrup. Still, it is",
          "I'm not sure if I should rate this as average or a bit higher. This was my 2nd trip to Copenhagen this time with my family. One of the things we were interested in doing was the National Aquarium even before we arrived in Denmark. So we got the Copenhagen card and figured use it",
          "We have enjoyed the visit a lot. If you travel with kids there are couple of interactive places where we found most interesting the one where kids can touch and \u201cplay\u201d with fish and other animals from local waters. Of course the big aquariums with mantas, turtles or sharks or",
          "I was really expecting something razzle-dazzle given the stats I read about the Aquarium and it's cool architectual design seen in aerial photos. And, the aerial photos are about the only way you get a sense of the design as it's not clearly apparent when you approach the",
          "The design of this building is starnge but when you comes inside you felt it is much bigger as it is. The museum has a active places for kids to understand the sea",
          "One of the nicer aquariums I\u2019ve visited. The coral reef exhibit is gorgeous! The cafe inside has delicious food and the view from the table is spectacular. Very nice afternoon!",
          "Den Bla is an aquarium and a very well designed one at that. It flows very nicely. It has a lot of activities and ways to keep kids occupied. I visited alone and managed to walk around in around half an hour and then moved on, however I didn't have a lot of time. Very",
          "My daughter likes sharks. This place is well worth a trip an you can probably spend a full day here absorbing all the knowledge available, studying all the animals, caressing the starfishes, aweing at the corals, taking selfies with the sharks and high-fiveing the giant otters.",
          "This was my first aquarium so I may not be objective, but it is really nice and woderful place to spend time with the kids. Each hours they have spacial events in which you can take part. Also they have place were you can touch the sea inhabitants. As for me the most interesting",
          "We went to this aquarium on a Monday. There were lots of students on school outings. If you have a Copenhagen card one can use it here. It is a large facility near the airport. One can take the train going to the airport. It's a great place as its. Well designed and",
          "This is a great aquarium to visit, there is so much to see. There were very cute Otters, Sharks, seahorses etc. There's a rain forrest with frogs, birds and Piranah fish. There is a shop and a cafe, or you can take a packed lunch and sit and eat while watching the Sharks and",
          "We had full use of the Copenhagen card. So easy, gained access to the aquarium. So worth spending about 2 hours here. Beautiful tanks, utterly breath taking tank with hammer heads and a sea turtle. Lady did a talk about a feed there in danish and English - couldn\u2019t fault her!",
          "The aquarium was included in the Copenhagen card which was good as I don\u2019t think think would be worth the entrance fee. The inside is very nice and it looked new and clean. Some of the enclosures could of been bigger and the sea otters looked quite stressed being cooped up in",
          "Really cool and nice aquarium, we spent couple of hours there, nicely designed and organised, 3 different sections plus rain forrest, our 5yo daughter loved it, and so did we.",
          "We visited on a Monday when open until 9pm. We used the CPH card to get in and for transport from the centre to here. Small walk from the train station and sign posted. The displays are good and informative and lots in English. There is a gigantic tank containing fish and sharks",
          "The Blue Planet is the Danish national aquarium. It is quite new, inaugurated in 2013... The aquarium is divided into three main sections, each being quite self-contained. The sea otters in an outside pool are fun to watch , especially during feeding time. There are regular",
          "We only came here as its included with the Copenhagen card. If you love fish in aquariums then you'll love it. There were plenty of talks and feeding going on. The sea otters were my highlight. Watching them at feeding time was great. You can tell they are well looked after by",
          "Loved our visit here. Got the train from central Copenhagen and it\u2019s a short walk from the station to the aquarium. The entry fee was covered on our Copenhagen card and the visit took about 3-4 hours. Highlights were the bats and poisonous tree frogs alongside all fish. The",
          "We arrived around 2:30 and found we had enough time to get around the aquarium by closing time at 5. There\u2019s 3 main sections attached to a central hub so it\u2019s quite easy to choose the sections in any order or easily make your way from a numbered attraction in one section to",
          "The aquarium is on the outskirts of the city, but easily reached by metro train. The aquarium is in a striking new building and consists of three main areas and around 50 tanks. Good interpretation. The highlight is the ocean reef tank with sharks and rays. A good tunnel takes",
          "We took the Train from Central station to the airport (3 stops) and then the Metro (1 stop) to Den Bla Planet which was so easy. We spent the whole morning just wandering round and then watched the Sharks being fed..interactive articles for children & adults to try too...",
          "This was a worthwhile visit for me. I live in California, where we have two fine aquariums, and I\u2019ve also visited The Maui Ocean Center in Hawaii. The marine tanks at Den Bla Planet are large, the water is clear, and viewing of an unusually large number of species is easy\u2014 some",

So many different creatures & so much to look at and learn about. Tanks are the usual kind of set up, but there is one massive one & a",
          "This aquarium is great. It has a good assortment of fish and marine life to see, and also has some really interesting unique areas, like a rainforest area with large river fish, and a huge tank full of sharks, rays, turtles and other fish, with a tunnel you can walk through and",
          "The Aquarium is 10 minutes away from Kastrup metro station. Although the crowd is generally mixed, children seem to be in majority. The Aquarium is divided into 3 sections, Coral Reef, Ocean, and River. All these three water regions have been very well represented. Beside each",
          "If you have a Copenhagen card this attraction is free. We went after 10 am and it was extremely busy and loud inside. I was also a bit dissappointed in the size of the aquarium. The sea otters were lovely.",
          "From the outside, this aquarium looks HUGE!! The building is magnificent and futuristic. Once you enter though you realise it is a lot smaller than it looks. The cafe takes up half of the building. There are only 3 areas to the aquarium. However I still recommend visiting,",
          "Visited here on a rainy day when travelling back to the airport. Easy to get to via public transport. Lots to see there and spent ages just sat watching the rays and sharks in the big tank. Big plus point - lockers big enough to put a large suitcase. Had to pay 10DKK but didn\u2019t",
          "I have visited better aquariums then this one, was very disappointed in the size of it. The aquarium's they have are nice but not many spectacular fishes. We went there to see the shark's getting fed and get some information about them, the lady giving the presentation was",
          "We visited on a cold and rainy day! Great day to see the aquarium. To be honest I was expecting a larger establishment, but being Australian I think we are already used to very big aquariums as standard. This one was no bigger than the one in Sydney. The displays were beautiful",
          "So much to see and so easy to see everything, a must to visit. The viewing is amazing, watchinv hammerhead sharks swim by you as you stand just inches away from them.",
          "Really interesting aquarium. There is a huge indoor tank that includes rays, hammerhead sharks and even a turtle, but in addition there is an area that showcases local fish and animals (cod, otters, puffins etc) and an exciting rainforest area too. Exhibits all have information",
          "This aquarium knows three important parts: \"The rainforest, the barrier reef and the Norethern seas\". The Great Barrier Reef, The rivers (under and above the surface) of therainforest; and the big tank with the sharks are top of the bill. You see a lot of species and special",
          "Nice place...but not so big.... Takes 3 hrs to see it completely... When we went some interesting some attraction were closed... For architecture must visit... Looks beautiful along sea shore. Prefer summer for visit",
          "This aquarium is on the outskirts of Copenhagen. It is in a Octopus shape building. It is very informative and well displays. Their big tunnel might not be very big but the warm water tank was impressive. My young son enjoyed this aquarium so much and so did we.",
          "We visited at opening time which I really recommend and headed straight towards the biggest tank so we could get photos without other people.. The aquarium was really clean, the fish/animals seemed happy and the tanks were huge..I loved the interactive area where children (or",
          "Split into 3 sections, my favourite part was seeing the sea otters. I also liked the rain forest and of course the shark tunnel. Had a fab time there.",
          "You can tell the animals are well cared for here. They all have huge areas to swim about and looks as natural as it can be. Plenty of things to do and see such as kids able to pick up starfish and crabs. Staff friendly. Well worth a visit.",
          "We visited this awuarium on a rainy monday and it was a very pleasant visit. The negative sides of the visit was that the booking.com attraction discount was not accepted there nor they didn't have any student discounts for internarional students. It is locared quite far from",
          "This a lovely aquarium and, as most places in Denmark are, really geared up for kids of all ages. We went last week with our daughter and her three children 5, 3 and 5 months who live in Copenhagen. The kids love it so much we bought them an annual family pass which pays for",
          "This is a good experience. If you like fish, sea, lake and the like!!! Be sure to visit the local Nordic/Danish areas, could be a little more interesting than The reefs +++ Use a couple of hours. We also took the tour behind the scenes. Very interesting for sure.",
          "This was a nice experience. The architecture from the outside is also beautiful. The inside is split into 3-4 sections including outdoor exhibits and the rain forest. The \u2018zoo keeper\u2019 had a short presentation during feeding time in the main aquarium which housed a bunch of",
          "Definitely worth a visit If you are in Copenhagen and are interested in wildlife in general. Interesting amount of different creatures to look at and watch. The shark room was by far my favourite part of the aquarium as you can sit down and just watch the sharks and other fish",
          "I've been here in a rainy January day and I didn't regret it. It was included in the copenaghen card so, why not? The place is not that big but it's very interesting and well organized with lots of information and activities for kids. You can also see otters being fed on the",
          "Stunning building and entrance, and good aquarium inside with nice variety. But we expected it would be bigger from the inside and more impressive; we were somehow disappointed. Visit ended in 1.5 hours. If you have visited the one in Barcelona or London, you can skip this one.",
          "Wonderful location close to the sea and many marine life areas to visit. It is really an interesting acquarium, it is worth a visit. It is quite easy to reach it by train. The station is just a few meters away. There is also a wide parking area for those who prefer arriving by",
          "Great venue for old and young alike. Very educational afternoon. Caters for many languages and definitely enjoyed feeding time on the coral reef",
          "Visited on our last day as it was so near the airport wish we had visited sooner so we could spend more time. Every tank was jaw droppingly brilliant and sooooo big. The shark tunnel is a must, listen to the announcements of the feeding times all are very informative and done",
          "I really liked the layout of Den Bla Planet. It was somewhat difficult to find but only because the street that was the main one leading to it was blocked and the detour was not well directed. There was ample parking. We got there early (about 1030) and it defitneily made a",
          "I have been to various aquariums around the world, but this is by far up there among the best. The variety of fish is good. There is a nice amount of information for every species. It is an impressive aquarium, and even though the price is a bit high, I would say that it is",
          "It is a good aquarium and easy to get to from the orebron. It's very kid friendly and the outdoor section is a must in warm weather with kids. A minor drawback is the fee parking and fee lockers, and a moe significant drawback is the restaraunt. The waitstaff was very slow and",
          "Yesterday I went to the aquarium with my friends. However, I was very disappointed with the false information that was given to us by the staff. We were at the shark tank and watched them getting fed and the staff said if you have any question you can come up and ask. So that is",
          "The aquarium is very nice, BUT the experience was terrible! Its like being in a gigantic kindergarden! There was children running around and shouting all over the place, sad because it could have been a nice experience.",
          "Highly recommend it! I spent a lovely morning visiting the aquarium, it's good for everyone. And it's tourist friendly, all the signs were also in english.",
          "Very interesting and informative. Fantastic aquariums and big oceanic aquarium. If just a little interested in sealife, set off at least a few hours.",
          "If you are a plus size person with backpains, the large areas without seating opportunities may be problematic. The restaurants floor was filthy. But the exhibits in themselves was so good, so beautiful and wonderful I highly HIGHLY recommend it.",
          "We visited here with my fiance. There were many interesting species at show and we got to see the sea otters being fed which was fun. The big tank was also worth seeing. However I do feel like this is more of a family destination and there are many activities that are mainly for",
          "My wife and I went with our 2 year-old daughter, and she was completely all over the place and enjoying herself. It was a great experience, and there was plenty for our daughter to do. Lots of colorful fish, big fish, small fish, sharks, and otters. Fish to touch, and things to",
          "A place that feels like a deep sea in the ocean with an interactive glass display of aquarium life and a walk through the indoor rain forest",
          "I came here for the second time in a year with my dad, and while the 3 sections are beautifully laid out and interesting, this place is ridiculously expensive for something you finish in less than an hour. 170DKK for an adult and 90DKK for a child. On top of the entry ticket you",
          "The aquarium is located in a brand new and modern building built by the sea. Its architecture make this place quite unique. It is not the biggest aquarium I have ever seen but probably a perfect size and number of species for a city like Copenhagen. It is a very good choice for",
          "One of the best attractions in Copenhagen! Me and my boyfriend visited the aquarium and it was amazing! We went to see some of the talks such as in the tropics section seeing the piranha's being fed and the arapaima fish (I had never seen them before but wow they are massive",
          "I visited many aquariums, but this is one of the best. We bought the ticket included bus transfer from the Central railway station. It was very useful. We spent 2 hours there. We saw fish feeding show - very interesting. I liked recreated environment for diving birds. You can",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the visit. A fantastic and very interesting aquarium. Easy rich from the city centre.",
          "Perhaps, one of the most relaxing things you can do is watch fish swim. We travelled on the S train, but buses can get you there, using our combined travel/entrance card, saves time and money. We stopped off at the Funkis caf\u00e9 on the corner after leaving the station, sandwiches",
          "This aquarium is lacking in terms of varieties of species and size if comparing to US aquariums. We had the Copenhagen card so entry fees come with it; otherwise, you may find it a bit expensive for what you're getting (USD 26 for adult and 15 for children). However, if you'd",
          "We didn\u2019t make it for the mermaid show, but the aquarium has a huge floor the ceiling glass that allow the children to be right next to the glass and see the fishes and the sharks! It was a lovely experience, my four years old love it!",
          "Spent a day at the aquarium, saw the feeding of the shark tank. A lot to explore and a truly unique world you step into.",
          "I've been to a lot of aquariums around the world and this is easily the best. Definitely not the biggest, but the perfect conditions, the layout, and the shark tunnel make it my favourite. Some of the information labels are incorrect (i.e. not on the correct tank), but that is",
          "It is a nice aquarium but it just filled two hours of our day. We used our Copenhagen Card and that was great - and we didn't have much time to spend there - but it's a good job as it was done in 2 hours. BIt of a let down....",
          "We spent our last day here before flying home and I cannot recommend it enough! Its about 800mt walk from the metro - clearly signposted, very helpful staff on reception. They have lockers for your luggage (10dkk). Everything is clearly signed, with interactive screens in both",
          "One of the better aquariums I've visited. The kids loved it. Especially the huge wall with the sharks and stingrays.",
          "We were waiting for check in in the hotel, so we went here. It's not some must see in Cobenhavn, but if you have some spare time I recomend to go. We really enjoyed our time in, espacially the \"tunel throiught the water\" and sea otters.",
          "This is a fantastic place for all of the family. You can see hammerhead sharks, stingrays and more in the huge tanks. You can touch crabs, small fish and starfish in the small aquariums (under the supervision of incredibly knowledgeable staff). You can witness a (fairly child",
          "This aquarium has been around for some time now, and compared to the old construction in Charlottenlund it has changed to something remarkable. But with advanced public aquariums being established many places it has to be compared to those, and in such a context it is 'just'",
          "Myself and my 11 year old visited the aquarium... cost \u20ac36.. very small and not very interesting... wouldn\u2019t recommend it... too expensive ... in and out in 40 minutes.. poor value...",
          "When we booked for Copenhagen this was on my to-do lists! It was raining on our first day there, and with this being an indoor activity we didn't mind doing that first - however be prepared to fork out for a taxi or find a way there - it's a bit further out than you'd think.",
          "There is something about an aquarium which always brings a smile and this one is no different. The areas are nicely broken up with signage and explanations in both Danish and English. It here were no seals but a couple otters doing their thing to the enjoyment of the viewers.",
          "Nothing special, sort of the same as other aquariums available in other cities. Still fun to see, and we spent a couple of hours here with the kids. Food was not good here, and would recommend to eat somewhere else. I ordered the sausage and it was so bad, really strange",
          "One of our party wanted to go here and even though it was a subway ride an a few mins walk ( we missed the shuttle) it was worth it! A very well done aquarium! Even had a sandwhich on the patio!",

          "We decided to visit as it was covered by our Copenhagen card and we had a little time to spare before our flight back. It\u2019s conveniently located on the way to the airport too, so I would recommend leaving it for the last day of your trip if you can. They do have luggage store,",
          "Despite being out of town, getting here was super easy via the metro system. As a solo traveller on a short trip it made the 'must see' short list and didn't disappoint. Very interesting, very tourist friendly and great views and exhibits as well as being topical and up to date.",
          "Really worth the trip; also outside were you can sit an contemplate the passage of ships into the Baltic.",
          "We spent 3 fun hours in the blue planet aquarium and it was so much fun. My 5 and 8 year old mostly loved the freshwater fish (piranhas) and my husband literally spent an hour in front of the ocean tank. The outside playground was also fun. A highlight for the whole family!",
          "Fairly big aquarium with lots of different animals to see. Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t enjoy our visit, because it was overrun by visitors. You could barely approach most of the fishtanks and if you managed to get a good view on the fishes you had to soon step aside to make room",
          "Really impressive setup for a reasonably big aquarium, lots to see and study, specially the big tank is almost mesmerizing. The was a clear focus on the selection of animals and viewing was easy with multiple viewpoints. Easy access to parking and from parking to aquarium. For",
          "The exhibits at the Bl\u00e5 Planet are quite good, but there were some disturbing problems when we were there. The hands on pool was poorly supervised with kids able to remove the animals from the water without sanction. Also, we found a tiny frog that was loose in the rainforest",
          "Location: Near the airport, after you finish here, pop over to Malmo for the day. Price: Free with the Copenhagen Card - If you're planning on doing lots of tourist attractions or using public transport, this is a fantastic purchase from 54Euro+. Otherwise, this is an",
          "This aquarium was great in and out and had many exhibits. We have been to many aquariums before, but being here allowed us to see fish that are not in aquairums here in the states. By far the best part was the huge fish tank! It was massive, i would say at least 20-30 feet",
          "Perfect Place for aquatic experience! This Place is huge and got so many diffrent spieces from Neon tetra to hammer head sharks. This is a must go if youre in kastrup copenhagen. Great value for the money",
          "We came today to the famous blue planet national aquarium. The queue at the entrance moved quickly enough, the entrance ticket a bit expansive. Inside the ocean wing the hammer shark and rays are great to see, alongside other colorful ocean animals. We came to the bistro&cafe",
          "All the exhibits had touch pads in Swedish, Danish, and English, which was good. Also, a good playground. The aquarium is not that large, so a couple of hours should be enough.",
          "This was an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours but it doesn't offer great value for money. It will keep the kids entertained for an afternoon but there are better attractions.",
          "In general a fantastic place to visit. It is great to see all the different fishes. But a bit expensive to get in. I am not sure if it is an attraction you must visit when in Copenhagen. There is a restaurant in there, but again a bit expensive. Anyway there's also a place where",
          "The sharks and sea otters were favorites for my kids. The outdoor play areas are also very popular. There are places to eat picnics if you bring your in food. It is not a huge aquarium, which makes it nice to visit in a couple of hours and not be too tiring.",
          "This was probably the top children's attraction we have ever been to. My 6 year old, 3 year old, husband and I just loved it. Immaculate and well laid out. Not too big, just perfect to spend a morning or afternoon.",
          "Spent few 2/3 hours here. Quite easy to get to, can catch bus or train to get here. Quite a small aquarium but they\u2019ve got plenty to see whilst you are there. They have different activities through out the day like watching the sharks being fed and seeing the otters interact",
          "I went there with family. I liked it but it didn\u2019t make me say wow. It is little bit expensive. Maybe I will visit one time again.",
          "Its is utter chaos inside, there is a lot to see but dont worry the place isnt that big. Take note, when there is a show on it is chaos if not dangerous the way everyone runs to the designated area. Strollers, prams, kids, adults, just get out of the way.",
          "Went alone with a toddler in a push chair. Everything was fairly well accessible, but had to carry him a few places. To get the most out of your stay: go a few hours before closing time (most people use approx 2,5 hours here). You can watch feeding hour in the \u201cjungle\u201d and also",

          "A truly nice place for children (and adults). Lots of fish inn large aquariums and feeding times for everyone's pleasure (especially the sea otters!!). A really pleasant outing, accessible by subway.",

          "We visited Den Bla Planet because I spoke about it for years. It's a small aquarium and has interactive stuff. The staff at Den Bla Planet is very unprofessional. I told one of the employees that children were playing with the elevator. I also told her that the children spat on",
          "they say it is the biggest Aquarium in northern Europe. that may well be, but it is a rather small one compared to places like Brest. it is well done and a nice building of modern architecture, and children will for sure love it (as the screaming and shouting proved), but for us",
          "Been to a fair few aquariums and this is up there with the best. Good value for money with lots of tanks with a variety of creatures and free transfer shuttle available from town centre. However, could add to the website and leaflet, a map of where the bus stop in Copenhagen",
          "If you want to take a break from touring palaces in Copenhagen, the aquarium offers a change of pace. Rather than focusing on local environments, it tries to cover everything (Amazon, tropical, rainforest, etc), with the result than none of the displays are spectacular - we saw",
          "Quite a good aquarium, not too big but a nice experience. Recommended if visiting with kids. Otherwise, you won\u2019t spend more than an hour there. The big tank with the tunnel is quite impressive, also - the sea otters are very funny :)",
          "Visited this aquarium as part of our holiday in Copenhagen with free admission free as it was included in the Copenhagen Pass. We took the free shuttle bus from Copenhagen central station. The aquarium is ok but not as good as the ones in San Diego and Osaka. However, the",

          "We visited the aquarium on the last day of our trip as it's located on the tram route to the airport. It has handy lockers for your luggage so is ideal if you've got a late flight and need something to do after you've checked out of your hotel. There are lots of things to see",
          "There are plenty of great things to see here, and the ocean tank - sharks, rays etc - is magnificent. The sea otters are also a strong highlight. The terrace for the cafe is really lovely, and the lockers are very useful.",

          "You have to go here if you are in Copenhagen. Firstly, the architecture is outstanding. It is expensive to get in but I would say it is worth it. The aquarium is organised into themes (rainforest, ocean etc.) and there is a wide variety of fish and other marine animals to be",

          "Great for a family (but probably even better with no kids in tow!) A great piece of modern architecture with a clever inside design. Designed to show off an amazing range of aquatic fish / sharks and even crocodiles, otters and frogs. The cafe was also very good with great",
          "The place is ok, too little information at many aquariums, there is a great opportunity to pat fishes and sea stars. We went through the whole exhibition in 1 hour",
          "Just follow the arrow from the kastrup stop on the metro. It is a BEAUTIFUL modern building that beautifully houses a plethora of marine life from around the world. I went twice in one week. Sure not the cheapest ticket but I think it was worth it. One of the best aquariums",
          "The extortionate entrance fee was justified alone by the feeding of the sea otters made even more special by the young lady who made the experience entertaining / funny, informative and educational. The presentation was made in both Danish and English. Don't miss it. This was",

          "This was in my top 3 atractions in Copenhagen. Do not miss this! Specially the <Rain Forest> section, with huge fish. The animals/ fish in aquariums are described on touchscreens nearby, in Danish, Swedish and English, with extended information. Some information is astonishing",
          "Very good aquarium, and we have been to many different ones around Europe. Especially good during spring-summer when you also can enjoy the outdoor activities, such as a playground and pond for \u201cfishing \u201c. The outdoor suits small kids (below 10) the best. Bring your own",
          "The Blue Planet was a very surprising place. It looked quite small from the outside compared to the other aquariums I have visited, but the design was interesting and it did contain way more than expected. The facility is new and well maintained. But here is the trick. If you",

          "From the outside - a stunning piece of architecture. Really something. But from the inside - well... Nicely presented, but just not enough tanks with fishes. You do a whole tour in less than an hour. And word of advice - avoid their caffe. You have to wait to be seated. You see",
          "The Aquarium was a great day out with the family. Lots to see and some great exhibits. All the talks where in Danish (as expected) but if you asked at the end the staff were happy to talk you through anything in English. The Sea Otters were a favourite amongst our kids.",
          "This is a nice aquarium on a windswept bit of coast near Copenhagen airport. It's a short walk from Kastrup station, only one stop from the airport and it's divided into 3 very manageable sections. It has all the usual things you would expect from an aquarium but in addition",
          "There was a lot of excitement before going to visit but it was a bit of a let down the be honest. You need to get a train to the venue which was quite straightforward and the building looks incredible but once you get inside the whole experience does not last long enough. My",

          "I spent the better part of a day at this aquarium with my two year old and we both enjoyed it. I was looking for an indoor activity as the weather was still very cold, and this fit the bill. We took the metro and it was an easy walk. My daughter loved the large tanks with rays",
          "Pretty much a must see when visiting Copenhagen with kids. Amazing building. 3 main zones occupies a few hours. Quite busy so have to wait to get right up to the tanks. Tanks are spotless and easy to see the fish. The big tanks are very impressive. Amazing to see a small",

          "If you have kids that are in the 3 grade to the 7 grade, those that have begin to learn about life forms based on different environments, this is education pure and simple with live examples. For the rest of the family it is a fascinating experience at the cost it is offered",

          "A perfect place for kids. Very crowded and alot of baby carriages. Nicely planned and good for kids to learn about the fish and seas and oceans. Would like some more about the environmental threats in the seas for kids to learn as well. The aquarium was not as big as I thought.",
          "The stunning architecture had us excited as we approached from the Metro station. On arrival we received a really warm welcome and every member of staff was pleasant, informative and a great ambassador. The displays of marine life were superb, the information panels were",
          "Booked our trip to the aquarieum from the hotel which was a good idea as the queue was quite long. It was really nice insid with lots of species. There is also a place to touch sea stars and shells.",
          "If you come in the morning you have a chance to see everything. All aquariums are done nicely. Lots of attraction especially for kids, for example, they can touch some fish and see sea otters.",
          "We got a taxi from the airport but it is actually really close. We put our bags in the lockers. There was also a coat rack near the toilets. The aquarium is large and includes feeding the stingrays. They put the food on a stick and you see how they eat. Very interesting.",
          "Beautiful well maintained and structured museum. Just the right amount of information, it is a place you have to sit down and enjoy. I was lucky, not too many people and I could really immerse in this beautiful ocean world.",
          "Visited in Dec. 5c Bus from City Centre will leave you outside Place is very Clean, Well Layed out, Excellent selection of Marine Life on Display, Some you would never think there was",
          "It is very close to the Airport and of course by the sea. Nice area with many kind of section about nature and water. There are also a underwater tunnel when you can observe big fishes. Yes it is expensive like everything in Denmark.",
          "The aquarium is next to the airport. They also have couple sea otters in addition to the fish. Worth the visit especially if you have kids. The most interesting part of the aquarium for the kids was where one can touch and fell the living fish and sea creatures.",
          "We waited for the new opening crowds to die down. Read a lot of bad reviews but thought we would try ourselves. We won\u2019t go back. Way oversold.",
          "Good aquarium,, decent number and quality of fish species.. decent shows.. but nothing spectacular, enormous .. one time visit if you have kids. but still for me that was expensive .. adjacent to airport",
          "amazing architect - building fantastic...aquarium out of this planet and loads to do - really close to the airport so even if you have a transit in Copenhagen it is only 12 minutes WALK - highly recommend Den Bl\u00e5 Planet",
          "Rather close place at the edge near the Bridge on a way to the CPH airport. Fine collection of sea animals, and great presentation of Amazon rain forrest and jungle humidity conditions... Special presentations of feeding the animals. Expected to see maybe some larger animal, but",
          "I lovee this huge aquarium with beautiful and amazing under water creatures. The otters were the cutest. Must recommended if in Copenhagen.",
          "Visited yesterday to escape the rain. Enjoyed it, very well thought out. The otters are gorgeous, and we spent a good deal of time just chilling watching the shark/ray tank. All the touch screen information for each tank was bilingual, which was very much appreciated and very",
          "We had been mildly warned by our tour guide that the blue planet might not offer what we expected. None of that was the case. The blue planet offers three very interesting tours of wet habitats. The first one centres on the Danish and Northerly oceans, explaining in detail how",
          "We had a fantastic time at the aquarium. All the exhibits were great & very interesting. Our favourite exhibit was the tropical section with the paranas & arapaima fish! We highly recommend checking it out. It's great for adults & children. M. CollectivelyME(dot)net",
          "Although few aquariums can compare to my home town Cape Town Two Oceans Aquarium, I really enjoyed this one. It houses so many different varieties of fish and other sea life - the otters were a highlight for me. Worth the train trip and walk to get there.",
          "An international aquarium of very high quality both for a single visitor and families as well. I especially enjoyed the octopus and the \"big aquarium\" together with beautiful corals - and the food from Meyers Kitchen running the restaurant. Do not miss The Blue Planet in",
          "The Blue Planet is located on the strait between Sweden and Denmark, between Kastrup Airport and the Amager Beach. It is close to the airport Clarion Hotel (formerly the Hilton) and is reachable via an easy bike ride on the way to the beach. If coming from elsewhere, it is an",
          "The National Aquarium is also a must see next to the Zoo. They have four different tours covering all the fish living areas in the world. Also here are special educational boards and games for the children. The big tank with sharks and rays is a exeptional view.",
          "Good place to visit and spent a day. New and modern center with many different species! Recommendable.",
          "We took public transportation from the island in Copenhagen. easy to get there, with a short walk. The place was not busy, the displays were well done, and we got to see them feed the sharks. It was clean, and the exhibits were well done.",
          "We took the metro to the aquarium on our visit to Copenhagen and it was a great afternoon. We had lunch in the cafe, the food was good and reasonably priced relative to other meals out in Copenhagen. Versus other aquariums there was a lot to educate the kids on sea life and",
          "We visited the aquarium with our kids and were quite happy with it. Lots to see and explore and among other things, couple of huge tanks where you just could stand for hours in front of them and watch. Be sure to take 10 kr coins with you if you don't want to carry your coats",
          "Large aquariums are great with some spectacular exhibits. The sea otters were my personal favourite. The rest of the fish were also really amazing. The building is a real architectural triumph. For me, there was just something missing about the experience. I can\u2019t quite put my",
          "We were there early and saw the ocean aquarium tank being fed. This involved a guy in a rubber dinghy dumping fish out while being bumped by sharks - a braver guy than me! We absolutely loved the sea otters!! It is huge and would be brilliant to let kids loose in, the rainforest",
          "A very nice and modern aquarium. Not sure whey they keep the sea otters, but nevertheless, a good trip. Food in the cafe is of good quality, but a bit overpriced. The sea life is in excellent condition and the staff are friendly enough. Three to four hours should be enought, get",
          "A good experience that is worth the trip and money. 2-3 hours is fine. Went 3 adults and 2 kids (5,8). Cafe is nice and good quality.",
          "Lot's of marine life and fishes. Was a fun place to go as a nature-fan, even though a bit too many fishes to my taste. Loved the sharks and the playful otters, and of course a cup of coffee out side the cafe-place when sunny and warm!",
          "This is a lovely aquarium to visit if you have kids or general interest in sea life. It\u2019s definitely not as large as other aquariums in the world, but this makes it manageable, especially if you are on the way to/from the airport. Highlights were the beautiful tank of coral",
          "As aquariums go, this one is beautifully laid out and quite extensive in ambition. But what was particularly impressive was the palpably sincere attempt to involve children and bring the wealth of nature to them, without being preachy or didactic.",
          "We went here on a Monday morning before our flight back home. Using google was very easy to find and catch a bus from Copenhagen centre to the street next to the location where you walk to the aquarium. Large lockers took our suitcase safely (and 2 small bags and coats in the",
          "Nice new aquarium but I think \u00a335 for an adult and 3 year old is too much; and then they have the nerve to charge parking on top despite the fact it's way out of the centre of town near the airport.",
          "We visited on a Monday when the aquarium is open until 9pm. There was lots to see and we were impressed by the layout and information available. I particularly enjoyed seeing one of the otters fast asleep floating on the surface of the water. Entrance was free with the",
          "The big tank contains quite a bit of shark and stingrays. The aquarium is not very big and divided into 3 sections. In the tropical section, they do have those large tropical fish. It worths a visit if you have the Copenhagen Card.",
          "Stunning building and great tanks done with thought. Rainforest area superb ditto the main ocean tank. Sea otter display typical caged species behavior despite what the aquarium says.on the whole the best aquarium I've been to, and I've gone to many",
          "My daughter wanted to visit this place while in Copenhagen. We took the metro from town and arrived at the nearby metro station. Took about 15 minutes to the aquarium by foot. Directory was not so clear and we were using the mobile GPS to find the building. The weather was good",
          "The free shuttle bus from the main station is useful but you need to have admission tickets to use it. The aquarium was a little disappointing overall. Possibly the smallest aquarium I've been to. Some of the shows were partly in English which was helpful.",
          "It looks great, most of the shows are in Danish, but you can ask the staff for more detailed information if required. It\u2019s not that big though, you can be done within 1,5-2 hours.",
          "It's about a 10-15mn walk from the station, in the rain it feels longer, but you can get a bus which drops you at the entrance to the aquarium. The building from photos looks fantastic, but as it was raining non stop we didn't get to admire the outside. Inside there is lots of",
          "There was nothing wrong with this place - a bit out of the way, but we were staying on that bit of the island anyway. Good views out to sea. Nice design to walk round, plenty of exhibits. Typical Blue Planet",
          "Perfect choice for a rainy day. Good restaurant. A lot of people though on rainy weekends. Worth to visit at least once but we will come back again.",
          "We visited Den Bla Planet mainly because it was cold and wet outside but we had a really delightful few hours here. The building itself was fascinating- very modern and beautifully laid out but as always the animals and fish made the visit. I have always loved sea otters and to",
          "This place is amazing. All exhibits are in English as well as other languages. It is maintained so well and is just beautiful It is large and there are a lot of people but it flows really well. We spent several hours there and saw everything. It does not smell fishy and it",
          "We stopped here for a visit before our flight as it's only one stop before the airport. They allow you a locker to store your case and the restaurant is very nice with good sea views. Theres a rainforest and a large viewing wall and tunnel with sharks which is very nice. Good",
          "We took a family trip out to the aquarium today and had a great time! It is a wonderful place for kids, the exhibits are visible enough that my one year old could see everything from his stroller. We loved watching the sea otters get their breakfast and the other exhibits were",
          "Came here on the wettest day I spent in Copenhagen and it was the best way to stay out of the rain. Relatively easy to get to via the metro trains. It is also free to enter with a Copenhagen card. The aquarium itself was pretty large and predominantly split into 3 sections",
          "Some spectacular tanks but not a patch on the Chicago aquarium for sheer variety. Hammerheads and Pirarucu were interesting to observe and the lizard and butterflies in the tropical section were great. The sea otters too.",
          "Interesting modern architecture with metal facade and organic curvy form, which is continued inside throughout the exhibition concept. Beautiful and diverse tanks, well maintained, but not overloaded. Several feedings (otters, sharks etc.) with live information in Danish and",
          "I visited several aquariums but this one was still interesting. This is a therapy - to sit and watch fishes\u2026",
          "Place where you'll find many interesting things to learn, see, and even touch. There you can spend the whole day with family, friends, and even alone. The majestic atmosphere of the ocean will attract and seduce your mind.",
          "While I find that most aquariums around the world look alike, this was very nice. A good variety of species and there are interactive screens with info about all the species right next to where they are. The building design is also very cool.",
          "The clean aquariums were nice, loads of different species and guiding information on interactive tablets. A nice place to spend the morning or afternoon. We have been to quite a bit aquariums around Europe, and we would rate this one above average. Also a good place to with kids.",
          "Conveniently located to a Metro station, it's a very well-designed aquarium with some excellent exhibits. Enough room that even when it's busy people can move around. Family-friendly, and not so noisy that people without chlldren won't enjoy themselves.",
          "We enjoyed our visit, it is easy to get around, and there are some amasing creatures to see. But parking is DKK12 an hour, and it is expensive to visit, and there is a fee for using a credit card.",
          "This Aquarium is a must for those visiting Copenhagen. We took the 5C bus from Central Station as this aquarium is located next to the airport and nearest metro stop was not close to the hotel. The bus was relatively easy and stops just outside the entrance. Fairly long walk to",
          "On arrival at Copenhagen Central station inquired about the bus to the Copenhagen zoo and chanced upon a \"Blue Line\" tour bus parked on the opposite side of the station advertising a free ride to the \"National Aquarium Den Bla Planet\". The National aquarium is situated at",
          "I visited the aquarium with my family including a three year old. We had a lot of fun looking at all the interesting aquariums and the artificial rain forest. Only downside is that the blue planet is very popular among tourists and locals so try to beat the crowds and buy",
          "Large number of individual tanks zoned into 3 areas, plus a giant tank with sharks amongst other things, and a walk-through tunnel. Also an excellent outside water play area and climbing frame plus seating for a picnic or something from the (expensive but this is Copenhagen)",
          "Plenty to do with educational displays and hands-on sessions organised by staff. Outside play/picnic area. Good food in the restaurant . I liked the rainforest display, birds and butterflies flying around. The otters seemed sad, one swimming back and forth sucking her paws. I",
          "Den Bla Planet is located next to the CPH airport and easily serviced by the Metro at Kastrup. They have managed to provide the aquatic life its very own habitat by cordoning off a little portion of the Baltic Sea for this aquarium. Wonderful experience and the variety of sea",
          "Really great aquarium. Amazing shark tank. Sea otters. Friendly and informative staff. Beautiful view over the harbour. The cafe serves beer and evening meals. Nice playpark. Warning: playpark contains water. It is possible to stay dry easily (unless you're an 8 year old",
          "We bought tickets online the same morning to avoid standing in line. We also brought our own picnic as it is expensive to buy food there. They have storage lockers, you need a 10danish crown. The aqarium Itself is very nice and there is information at every aqarium, for more",
          "We had planned to come here anyway, but great rainy day excursion. Its quite far away so plan ahead!",
          "The large aquarium was quite an experience. I was also impressed by the deep sea exhibit. There was actually hands on, where people could touch crabs and sea stars. The major downside was the number of people in such a small area. The restaurant was nice, although it took time",
          "Many nice exhibits in a lovely setting. There isa free bus to take you to the Aquarium and Back. Lunch is adequate.",
          "Loved this place. Lots to see. All posting and information provided in english on touch screens next to all exhibitions. Great cafe with quality tasty fastfood. Walking distance from metro station \"Kastrup\" Remember to buy tickets in advance, and avoid peak time at all costs,",
          "One of the best aquariums I've visited. Lots of different kind of fishes, lots of information about them.",
          "A nice place to visit with the kids.The very long queue should promise something, and \"Den Bl\u00e5 Planeten\" met our expectations. One thing was very annoying: As we had bought the Copenhagen Card, equipped with a QR-code, it should be totally unnecessary to wait in the line for the",
          "Have seen many better aquariums in Europe.. was quite small and barring the sharks, wasn't very impressive.",
          "My family loves aquariums so I felt this one oversold itself a bit as 'the largest in northern Europe'. It was great but not noticeably better than Birmingham, Portsmouth or Berlin. I particularly liked the large tank with the sharks and rays in. - the hammerhead sharks were",
          "If you haven't been to a big aquarium before this is a good choice on a rainy Danish summer day. Beware - the storage area eats away your 10dk without returning them (each time you lock it) - unlike every other public place I visited where you would get your money back after you",
          "Really impressed with the aquarium. Each tank has a screen where you can view all animals in the tank and then read more information on each, changing language between danish, Swedish and English. Very well laid out.",
          "We were impressed by this aquarium, having visited some other major ones like Sydney, we were pleasantly surprised by the range of things to see. We especially enjoyed the otter talk and the beautiful rainforest section. Lots of interesting things to see and read with touch",
          "We were a bit disappointed with the size of the aquarium. Took us just short of 2 hrs to walk through. Tanks are beautiful and great care has been put into this aquarium. Just not big enough to warrant a second visit.",
          "This is a wonderful acquarium, best I have ever visited. The fish are displayed in a variety of settings and we particularly enjoyed seeing the sharks. The live coral was also beautiful and the tropical rainforest section really interesting. Highly recommended to visit.",
          "Nice and relaxed atmosphere in Copenhagen these 5 days we were there. We especially liked the zoo and blue planet but also just walk in the center and enjoy the city.",
          "Travelling with my 5 year old son on a day when the weather suggested that indoor attractions may be the most appropriate so this was top of the agenda. 7 metro stops from Kongens Nytorv and 1 from the airport, the journey out wasn't too bad. The aquarium is signposted from the",
          "My boyfriend and I visited the aquarium during our stay in Copenhagen. I had heard and read great things about it. Several of the animals very impressive but I feel there could've been more species of animals. The rainforest was very cool and had huge fish (this was really the",
          "They have lots of piranhas! Lots of large rays, a few sharks, sea otters and some pig nosed turtles - super weird. This was a nice place to visit and kids would enjoy it - easy to get to and presenters provide interesting talks in English.",
          "Interesting deep sea exhibits, loved the sea otters, but not as good as I had expected in other areas",
          "With a Copenhagen card entrance is free as well as the metro a 10min stroll away. Not the largest of Aquarium but great informative displays. Best was the otter feeding and then the Pirahana feeding. The keepers presentations are full of enthusiasm and informative. My wife's",
          "We went to visit this place during our stay in Copenhagen this July. We had really high expectations, because we had heard so many positive things about this attraction. It was not as big as expected and the socalled attractions were a bit disappointing. Both the adults and the",
          "The title says it all. Wonderful displays, interesting information. There's supervised touch tanks and a chance to see the sea otters being fed which I would definitely put on your schedule and if children don't pull you along, sitting and spending a little time in the hothouse",
          "It is a fun place to spend an afternoon. A compilation of all kinds of aquatic animals can be seen here. My favourite part was definitely the Amazonas part where butterflies fly all around you.",
          "If you are in Copenhagen for long time and have nothing to do, then ok, about 15 pounds for ticket and you there. The aquarium is not big, compare with Sydney, Miami or Dubai, and has actually just one aquarium. Summer time seems to be busy, long queue outside, very slow ticket",
          "Den Bla Planet aquarium was a very pleasant excursion, easily reached by metro about 20 minutes from the city centre. Highlight was an exhibition (possibly temporary) about peculiar deep sea creatures, some of which were discovered as recently as last year. Presumably because",
          "We were disappointed after travelling to get to the aquarium. I think I prefer the one on St Malo, and the tanks seem bigger there. We did have high hopes, sea lions and whale sharks were promised by the website, but we're not in evidence. I wanted jelly fish, and though there",
          "We came and had a fab time! Lots of animals very educational and fun and interesting! Even had a segment on Loch Ness - made us scots feel right at home \ud83d\ude0d",
          "Worth half a day visit. they have some spectacular marine life in this place. They have a special interactive section where you can touch marine life. There were staff on standby who were very knowledge and were at hand to explain the species displayed. There is a huge aquarium",
          "The venue on the whole is ok - there is lots of fish as you would expect. Things that would interest kids and also a mini rain forest with the heat of the amazon which we were quite impressed with. But the main attraction was the giant aquarium with an abundance of sea life.",
          "The aquarium is really nice and well made, is definitely easy to reach with the public transportation. Tickets: the single ticket is not so cheap but with less more you can buy the annual pass that is valid for 365 days. After your purchase of your single ticket you have some",
          "Usually we go see only the historical monuments and cities of the countries, being a bit of a history/castle fans but this aquarium attracted us with their website, so we decided to take a chance. Three different underwater worlds that leave you amazed by the variety of sealife,",
          "We went with our two cildren, aged 6 and 3, with the hope of something spectacular. As it often is when the bar is raised to high, the experience sometimes isn\u00b4t quite up to it, unfortunately. The layout is somewhat confusing, and the individual aquariums are not that",
          "Our 4 yr old and 19 month old loved it, especially the tanks where you can touch the crabs & fish. Not sure how good that is for the crabs and fish though. They had some healthy things on the menu in the cafe and the food was really tasty. Beautiful views while you're eating",
          "Very nice little aquarium. The kids loved it and they had some very nice displays...Easy access from a hop on hop off.",
          "Perhaps I have been to too many aquariums. Favorite parts:restaurant which served fish and chips and a delightful wall with superimposed LED(?) images of fish of all varieties swimming. Approached by patrons touching the wall, the fish scatter and regroup after the intrusion.",
          "Things can be quite tricky to find in copenhagen if you rely on public transport even if you are armed with several maps,but this one is dead easy, signposted all the way, they even announce it on the metro tannoy large aquarium wiht a cool tunnel going through the hammer",
          "Huge collection of underwater world. It is divided in 3 areas, really easy to navigate through. The app provides tons of info which can also be accessed via touch monitor next to each aquarium. They also offer variety of shows throughout the day. We watched 'feeding the Otters'",
          "Very disappointed with the experience. There\u00b4s not enough space for the many fish, especally the big tank is not really that bog. It feels cramped just looking at it and you feel sorry for the fish. The archicture, however, is really cool. Maybe just go there and take pictures",
          "I visited this aquarium. I does have fish and birds but no amphibians and no invertebrates unlike some aquariums but I still I liked it. It is walking distance from Kastrup metro station.",
          "A great experience that the whole family enjoyed a whole lot. Easy parking, great facilities and not too time consuming exhibitions",
          "This was well laid out and very interesting. The Rain Forest area was unexpected and the size of the tank was great. There were lots of varieties of fish and information about them all in English.",
          "If you love acquariums you will like this even though it is fairly average on world standards. If, like me, your interest in fish extends only to how they taste with garlic and butter then you will appreciate the great architecture and location of the place.",
          "We had the Copenhagen card so did not pay extra to go here. If you have the card and young kids, it's probably worth it. Otherwise, skip it.",
          "As usual, everything in Denmark is very well designed, all the information is very clear, and very entertaining using the new technology combined with traditional approach. The only negativity is that the souvenirs can be considered very expensive..",
          "I came here just because it looked good from what I've read. The place is really huge! Lots of different types of fishes, starfish, Sea otters, sharks. It's an impressive set up just around the corner from the airport. If you wanna spend a couple of hours to see something",
          "Fun place for kids.... lots of fish of all different kinds; sharks, rays turtles and even some snakes and spiders you can touch Make sure u make it there around 12:30 for feeding time...you can view the bigger fish being fed in the giant ocean tank. I saw a huge ray munching",
          "The aquarium itself is stunning and the views over the water amazing! The aquarium itself is quite small but very well laid out. A bit out of the way but easy to get to on the city Bus!",
          "We had a long day near the airport before flying home at the end of our wonderful vacation. Our hotel recommended the aquarium, which was an easy 20 minute walk away. The walk along the marina was beautiful. The aquarium captures all we've experienced in Copenhagen. It is",
          "Escaping the rain we took a trip with the subway to Kastrup and a short walk to the aquarium. I think they have shuttlebusses - best to check online. Great display of sealife from different areas of the world. Good information (interactive, multilingual) and an underwatertunnel",
          "We came on June 4th, 17. It was the first rainy days after several good days outdoors. Seemed like a good idea to come by on our last day, bound to the airport. Just that everybody else seemed to have had the same idea! To the administrators, they should limit the amount of",
          "I had a morning free before my flight from Copenhagen and decided to visit the Blue Planet. It's a 15 minute walk from the airport and really pleasant. Not as impressive an aquarium as some, but very well organised , the setting by the coast is great and the Sea otters were",
          "We went along to the Blue Planet on the last of three days in Copenhagen. We had no idea of what to expect (except fish, of course!) We began in the Nordic/Cold Water section, and came across the touch pool of the aquarium, manned by a staff member called Rasmus. There we were",
          "This was a great place, with lots of scientific activities for the children to do as well as great fish exhibits. My 7 and 4 year old boys spent hours playing with the waterworks machinery, in particular the Archimedes screw. The fish exhibits were excellent and it was a great",
          "A bit off the beaten track. But worth the taxi ride to get there. They say it is the biggest acquarium in Europe. There is something of interest for everyone.",
          "It is an interesting aquarium located in the beautifully designed modern building. Although not the biggest comparing to other European Aquariums, this one has plenty of exhibits area which cannot be seen in other aquariums. It also has a distinct part dedicated to Baltic and",
          "Having visited other aquariums in Europe, this one seemed very small! It is however definitely very clean and the settings outside are really pleasant on a sunny day.",
          "Quick word: I am beyond the age for aquariums, and so the idea of visiting an aquarium does not entice me much. But visit I did, and it is certainly a fab place to go to, especially if you have young kids. The aquarium is very fun, interesting and educative place for kids.",
          "This is a very nice and educational place to take your children and grandchildren. The aquariums are very informative and easy to understand with displays next to each aquarium. Even their playgrounds for the kids are very nice with water games and climbing stands.",
          "Such an amazing building it really is a great piece of architecture! The inside is just as amazing, so many fish we had never seen before. Well worth a visit for adults and children alike x",
          "Free for Copenhagen Card holders. Very good for children, they will discover a new world, the sea world. Reachable by subway and S-train. You will feel like a kid again there.",
          "When we finally found this place it was worth it. We had asked many people how to get here but not many seemed to know where we were talking about. Anyhow we finally got a train which got us there. It was about a 10/15 minute walk from the station and thankfully there were signs",
          "I was in Copenhagen for 3 days and didn't plan to visit the National Aquarium, however when one day the weather wasn't quite as nice we decided to make the trip and spend some time at indoor attractions. I'm so glad we did as it's a lovely attraction with lots to see and some",

          "It is a metro 2 stop before the airport, or bus 2A to Kastrup St or Airport bus 5C, stop before the airport. Its a couple blocks to the aquarium. There are three different venues for fish including fresh water, salt water, and the rain forest. it was all interesting. I just",
          "Such a great place with lush ads of amazing fish to see. The aquarium has been split into 3 and each has a specific range of fish and bird species. The tropical section has the most amazing butterflies and frogs! The aquarium is a 10 min train from central station and a 5 min",
          "This is a lovely aquarium situated on the coast which adds to its aquatic ambiance. The venue is perfect for an afternoon lunch and a look at the exhibits. We loved the variety in different types of fish and birds it boasts which fit into a very thoughtful layout - using the",
          "We visited the aquarium on a Sunday afternoon prior to heading back to the airport. It was a fantastic way to spend a few hours! The main shark aquarium was stunning! It was huge, and the benches through the side of the tunnel meant you could sit and watch the sharks and rays.",
          "Good aquarium plenty of exhibits and a tropical area which I haven't seen in other aquariums, a lot of history and facts about Scandinavian waters which is very interesting also fun games for children",
          "A good aquarium. A lot of different fish. There are small jungles with piranhas and other tropical fish. Every hour some kind of program: feeding fish, a story about fish, etc. There is an aquarium where you can touch a small shark and a crab.",
          "I have been to many aquariums around the world and this was one of the better ones, also very kid friendly and located nicely along the coast.",
          "Great collection of marine life forms and educational shows will keep visitors entertained for the better part of the day. The big ocean aquarium is simply enchanting. The place is worth a separate visit to Denmark.",
          "i recommend taken your children for a one-day trip to see all the beautiful animals. blue planet is located near the airport. you can pay few days for the blue planet , zoo , museum and the buses",
          "Me an my to boys (7/11) went there for a Saturday trip with bad weather outside . Arrived at 10:15 just a small queue. I've heard all kind off stories about den bl\u00e5 planet and coming from the danish west coast I have too admit I've excepted a lager attraction. Put despite my",
          "I visited with my mom and we had a good time. All the text that describes the animals is in Danish, Swedish and English. The staff is very knowledgeable and will answer all the questions you might have. It is possible to lock your valuables in a locker for a the price of 10 DKK,",
          "Not so Much to say other than i felt myself bored and cheated. Go to the zoo instead,and you will have 3 times more fun for your money.",
          "This place is so well designed it's amazing. Divided into sections with different water environments, you can identify the fish and other creatures with an easy to use computerized screne next to each tank. The tube where humans are inside and fish are swimming over and under",
          "Den Bl\u00e5 Planet, the National Aquarium Denmark, is a small but very exiting aquarium. The most impressive part is the very big aquarium with the sharks and sting rays. The service peoples are very friendly",
          "We had a great time here. 3 adults and we still enjoyed it. What we found great for the families that were visiting here was the facilities. You had a place to hang coats, store luggage if you were on your way to the airport, lockers if you wanted to lock things away, and an",
          "Awesome experience for both adults and kids. Nice area surrounded but the sea, and many beautiful marine animals you don't always get to see - it's definitely worth the ticket price!",
          "A couple of hours looking at the fish, well maintained easy to navigate, good canteen , indoor and outdoor picnic area. No bad points.",
          "Really easy to get to either the free shuttle bus in summer or the number 5a bus from central station. Free if you bought a Copenhagen Card for your visit (a must if you want to do lots of attractions). Beautiful surroundings, amazing creatures from all watery ecologies. Lots",
          "They have big aquariums with sharks and many smaller aquariums with plenty of fishes, turtles and other animals. The otter was lovely.",
          "Really well designed and presented aquarium. Good variety of fishes and animals shown in 3 areas. They have also a rather good restaurant and a nice playground for kids outside. Much better than for example the Genova Aquarium which claims to be one of the greatest in Europe but",
          "It is a nice acquarium but a bit isolated...it is shameful that besides the expensive ticket you also have to pay for the parking space! The place is nice but compared to other European acquariums (genova or valencia to name two), it does not leave you breathless",
          "I think this is a great place to visit for all ages, we spend about 3 hours attending the events during the day, great education, and all the tanks are really interesting.",
          "this is a great place to visit in copenhagen. Kids, Adults everyone. easy to get to, a bit from the center",
          "Been to many aquariums around the world and this one for sure is one of the better ones. It has all the expected species you would expect in most aquarium. Given we are in Nordic land it was great to see an emphasis on the local species. Worth a visit if you are in marine life.",
          "I loved seeing all kinds of marine animals specially the otters\u2665 there is so much to see and admire we also go to see sharks and sting rays",
          "If you are interested in sealife - find somewhere else. This place has only one spectacular aquarium - the rest of the building is basicly a number of hallways with tiny aquariums - unpleasant to the unfortunate fish. Go diving if you care. Denmark boast many places of true",
          "English translations on all the displays made this a really enjoyable and informative visit. Glass tunnel gives fantastic close up views - brilliant for seeing the rays. Free shuttle to airport would make this a good last visit before flying home.",
          "The architecture alone is stunning! The aquarium is the perfect size- not too big and not too small. It is a short walk from the light-rail. It has a large diversity of autistic life. Some of the tanks are huge! They have a walk-through tunnel with sharks and rays. The otters",
          "I'd seen most of the other attractions here so I made a reservation to go behind the scenes to feed the sea otters and visit the aquarium. The special ticket was expensive (350 Kr) in addition to the 170 Kr admission fee. The sea otter experience was worth it. Two zoo keepers",
          "Good aquarium. Small compared to US ones. There is enough activities to entertain kids. Excellent indoor activity to do especially when it rains.",
          "Free with Copenhagen Card: Yes The aquarium is geared slightly more toward children but is still a solid experience for adults. Fun animals to see, with fun facts displayed in several languages. My favorites were the rain forest, the coral reef, and of course the open sea type",
          "Located on the bay with view over the bridge. Also great to watch landing airplanes. Cafe has not a huge selection of meals but everything we've tried was delicious. The big tank with the tunnel makes it nice to have sharks going kinda around you but to say the truth piranha",
          "Visited with a 3-year old, took the metro from the city centre, which was easy. The walk from the metro station to the aquarium is sign-posted. I am surprised that some say that the aquarium is quite small; I felt it to be quite big (certainly a bit too big for the 3-year old",
          "This is the best aquarium I've ever been to - the variety of aquatic life is massive and there are interactive touch screen displays at every tank (and an app to download which gives you all the info too). The viewing area of the sea otters could have been better as you can't",
          "You can get here by metro and it is included with Copenhagen Card. Fairly small if compared to other similar places. Three sections - we wandered from 2 to 3 by mistake and were disappointed that it all ended so quickly. There is a big tank with a small tunnel you can walk",
          "Their collection is not that huge but it is quite interesting still to explore. I also enjoyed the outside which has views of the water/beach, has picnic tables, playground for the kids but you can still have a spot for yourself if you like peace and quiet. I think Dutch people",
          "Free with a CPH card. I have been to better aquariums but worth a visit if you land in CPH in the afternoon - 15mins from airport",
          "This location is suited for families with children. Besides nice aquariums, there is a possibility to learn some practical things about the sea-life. In general, I would advise others to visit at least once this aquarium.",
          "We're glad we had the Copenhagen Card which gives entry to museums such as this; we wouldn't want to have paid full price. Despite the billing, it turns out to be quite small and surprisingly quickly done. The cafe is also small, and very limited in food, you need to eat",
          "Den Bla Planet is the national aquarium of Denmark and one of the best aquariums we have seen in the Nordics. The architecture of the aquarium itself is mesmerizing and the interiors are well designed as well. The aquarium is divided majorly into three sections: 1. Northern",
          "it was a nice stroll through a well done aquarium. The building is amazing, it has five wings to it. Be sure to get a cup of tea in the cafe.",
          "This was on the Copenhagen card and you can get to it by bus. (As quite a bit out from town and right near the airport). You are greeted by staff with their fancy dress costumes on and smiles all round. There is loads to see and I could have happily just sat there gawping at",
          "When arriving at the Aquarium you know that it is something special the architecture of the building is wonderful, even on a very wet dull day the buildings silver shell and shape were exciting. The Interior is well laid out with zones clearly defined, the exhibits were well",
          "A lot of different fishes. Kids like the experiment's table we they can touch sea stars, crabs and others. We like sharks, rajas and turtles.",
          "The National Aquarium is located just next to the Sea. The exibition is great and very interesting. Kids will love it - and their parents to",
          "I really enjoyed my trip here. Reasonable price in and plenty of different creatures. Theres little touch screens beside tanks and sn english button. Theres a beautiful seating area that is so relaxing watching a massive tank with the sharks. They also call u over the intercom",
          "It was pretty similar to other aquariums as is to be expected but nicely laid out and easily walk-able as not too big. Nice big tanks with good variety of fish as well as some that you can touch",
          "This acquarium is located just One metro stop before the airport, so we decided to go with our luggages. We could out them in the lockers provided. The entry price was about 43 euros for two people, and in monday it's open until 9 pm (usually until 6). The Aquarium is huge and",
          "We went to Copenhagen in February and desperately wanted to do something in Copenhagen that was warm. We headed to the Blue Planet and spent hours there. The range of species is great and there is a really lovely calm atmosphere here - not manic like London Aquarium. They have a",
          "Worth a visit. Outside of the city centre you will need a car, train or bike. Lovely fish, big aquarium, plenty to see.",
          "Would not have been my first choice to visit, we went there because we had kids in the company, but I ended up really enjoying it. There is a lot see and experience, well worth the trip to Kastrup.",
          "I love walking around looking at all the fish and learning all about them. Was very glad to see English was available everywhere to read. I loved watching the Otters as well. I didn't mind that they, (understandably), chose to only do the Otter talk in Danish as I was too busy",
          "We took the Metro to Kastrup, from where the Blue Planet Aquarium is well signposted. There is lots to see at the Aquarium and information panels are clear and easy to use. Some of the lighting graphics are amazing and caused a lot of amusement for the children visiting the",
          "So this was super close to the airport and we jumped on the metro and one stop away got off and a ten minute walk or so to the actual aquarium. Dragging our bags across was a bit of a pain, but well worth it especially as we could dump them in the large lockers. It was super",
          "A nice modern aquarium. Large tanks. Lots of interesting sea life. Decent caf\u00e9 (they had live jazz that day). A bit crowded with small kids.",
          "Being inside the Blue Planet is depressing. The fish are beautiful but the place has no soul. All the questions you may have about the animals are left unanswered. There is no information anywhere. I will definitely not come back.",
          "We went on a very cold day - impressive building a short walk from the station, but best are the displays - lots of room around them, lots of view points for the main tanks and the puffins are so sweet. Good cafe too with view across the sea.",
          "I'd travel back to Copenhagen just to see this again and to spend a lot longer in here. In fact I'll be doing exactly that very soon.",
          "My daughter loves all kinds of animals and creatures so wherever we are we have to find a zoo and an aquarium.This is without a doubt the best we have been to.There is so much to see and there is a little caf\u00e9 where you can sit outside and watch the planes coming into land at",
          "If you're interesting about sea life, you must visit the Aquarium. You can reach easily from downtown with metro or bus",
          "Quite small so didn't really understand the largest in Northern Europe tag. Good way to kill an hour before flying though as close to airport and suitcase size lockers.",
          "Just remember that it's really near by the airport. So you may visit it right after your arrival, or right before your departure. I did it, and the Fish & Chips at the restaurant is not a bad idea to have after watching so many fishes \ud83d\ude0a",
          "A beautiful new Aquarium with incredible displays and a social message of why we need to save the oceans. Easy to visit via train from the city, but also provides free bus transport to the Central train station. We loved the sea otter demonstration, which proved they are not",
          "This is not an aquarium only for local fish and sea species. It has the most interesting design, interior as well as the outside architecture. Do not forget to go outside to se the feeding of seals.",
          "When in Copenhagen you cannot miss going to this palace of fish and design. The display next to every tank are touch operated and give all the info in English and the displays and fish are spectacular. Entrance is 170k each about \u00a320 worth every penny very close to the Metro",
          "Very modern building. Well laid out. Plenty of loos/storage lockers/coat hanging space. Just next stop on Metro from Airport. Signs for each exhibit interactive in Danish, Swedish and English names. Several areas to sit and watch. We particularly liked watching the sea otters.",
          "A must see totally worthwhile visit- interesting, informative and great to see fish habitats from all over the world!",
          "Located only one stop from the airport on the metro line and with luggage facilities for cases this is a must see. Beautiful aquarium in large spacious building. You could sit relaxed watching the fish for hours.",
          "Many different kinds of fish, nicely displayed and in well kept aquariums. The sea otter show was very nice and well told by young staff members. We visited on a Monday around lunch time and it was quite a lot of people there, yet didn't feel crowded or difficult to see",
          "The aquarium is realitively small but modern and stylish with a good selection of animals on show. I was particularly thrilled by the hammerheads. I also had one of culinary delights of my life with the roast pork sandwich from their cafe. I'm not sure if it was as good as i",
          "Easy to get to via trains from central station. Lots to see. Lovely knowledgeable young lad who was talking with us about shark eggs and crabs in section one(forgot his name) all other staff seemed lovely. Nice restaurant",
          "Heard this place becomes like a stuffed mushroom on the weekends, so decided to come visit an early Monday afternoon in January, which meant the place was almost deserted. Unfortunately it only made it clear how rather small the aquarium is. The aquarium is divided into 3",
          "Nicem well organzed aquarium. Lots of fish - looked in good condition. A bit far from the town center but worth to com if you are an animal lover",
          "I am not really into aquariums if I am honest, but my 8 year old really wanted to go. I have to say it was fantastic and definitely worth a visit. We used our Copenhagen pass and had about 3 hours here and there is loads to see, There is a cloakroom and lockers which was great",
          "From ocean to africa rivers and even a rain forest. Here you will find numerous species. Good animation with explanation in English and Danish during feeding eg. of sharks. Good restaurant. Not enough space in wardrobe. Their are lockers. Close to metro and bus station. Will",
          "We visited the 'Blue Planet Aquarium' as our flight arrived at 11am and we were unable to check-in to our hotel until 3pm, if you find yourself in a similar situation, I thoroughly recommend doing the same. The transport links to the airport are easy, the 5A bus takes roughly",
          "I loved this place which included a rainforest and an outdoor viewing point along with the sea otters. Great place for families.",
          "We went to visit the aquarium on New Years Eve, the exterior of the building is very impressive although I have to say the walk from the Metro to the Aquarium was along dull and empty looking roads, not so bad on the way there but on the way back it was pretty creepy, i was",
          "Deb Blas Plant is situated outside the main area of the city, relatively close to the airport. With this in mind we planned our visit for out last day in the Country, so that we could drop our bags at the airport and take a taxi to the aquarium. Wow what a brilliant place,",
          "We were able to make it through all three areas of the aquarium in about 1.5 hours. The exhibits were small, but informative, and all displays were presented in both Danish and English. We visited on Christmas eve and got the special treat of watching Juleman (Santa) feed the",
          "Visited with a group of friends and the place was great. Though in the dead of winter, the place was still warm enough. I loved the variety of the creatures (not just fish) that the place had, including the puffins, seals and parrots (they were out of control!).",
          "Fantastic, engrossing collection of marine biomes. Enormous in scale and ambition. Top attraction in Copenhagen. Skip to oil and go blue",
          "There were large fish in a big tank where you could sit for long periods and watch the sharks and rays swimming a few feet away. There were many smaller tanks of colourful tropical fish, sea snakes and shell fish. Well worth the trip.",
          "Nice place to visit with children .you don't need to much time to visit.around two hours not more if use public transportation the bus 5 A in airport direction take u there. A good experience ,",
          "We visited on Christmas Day and we had a great day out. It isn't the easiest place to get to on public transport but we took the metro from the city centre and the followed the signs. There is lots to see and do. While we were there we saw the sharks being fed and managed to",
          "The crowds were fairly thick and a lot of the exhibit information was only available in Danish - English was only a summary and in a very small font. There was lots to see but I think the Toronto and Boston aquariums are much more impressive,",
          "The building is amazing outside. Inside it's just run down and very confusing how it's laid out. Some of the tanks are very dark. We won't go back.",
          "You either like aquariums or you don't. If you do, this one is a real treat. Everything is really well presented, information boards in English and Swedish as well as Danish. There were a lot of children when we visited (Sunday morning) but it didn't feel crowded and the",
          "As i mentioned in my other reviews...get a copenhagen Card costing about 53 Euros...valid for 24 hrs....free train and metro rides and free entry to the National Aquarium...located about 1 km from the airport at Kastrup...metro connectivity from airport to Den Bla",
          "You walk and walk - and it is not really exciting - You never get close to the animals. And restaurant dont serve fish",
          "This was an enjoyable afternoon out. The aquarium is a short bus ride out of central Copenhagen, and is very modern. There are a number of smaller exhibits featuring specimens from particular regions, but the main attraction is a massive floor to ceiling tank. In addition to the",
          "We came here on a Sunday. It was full of small kids as expected but it was amazing how many adult couples there were. This is an excellent aquarium, very well laid out with detailed explanations in Danish, Swedish and English. It's really good fun to visit and just one stop",
          "This is billed as the largest aquarium in Europe - the others must be very small. It is well laid out, and about a 10 minute walk from the nearest Metro station, and about a 15 minute walk from the airport. There are luggage storage facilities for all sizes of bags. Check the",
          "This is a beautiful aquarium and a lovely place to spend a morning or afternoon. Definitely a \"must see\" if you have kids. Our only regret was not being able to share the experience with our grandkids.",
          "We visited the aquarium in november and it was amazing, well arangerd the staff was very polite and atractions were interesting, I did not liket that you have to pay for locker, all other places that we visited had free place for our backpacks and clothes. it is great place to",
          "It's modern, very well made, with interactive touch panels to every exhibit in Danish, Swedish and English, and offers kids a lot of opportunities to learn stuff and have fun. There are feeding shows with the cute sea otters, and the big ocean tank (with walk-through tube) is",
          "Its a nice place, but my 4yrs kid didn't find it interesting. Maybe its focused on one older kids.. Many different kinds of sea fishes \ud83d\udc1f\ud83d\udc20 and etc, but nothing the kids could touch and experience. Go to the Zoologisk museum thats way more interesting for all ages of kids.",
          "Very well organized aquarium with a good show of plenty of animals in different seas. Free with Copenhagen ticket, or pre-booked ticket is recommended",
          "The Danish National Aquarium is an impressive venture. Nonetheless, all involved must have missed their ethical courses. Ther eare pitiful-looking puffins, it is very doubtful that the Californian otters should be kept there on display at all, and the giant arapaima do not seem",
          "I think the aquarium is not too big but despite that it has huge tanks and it looks fantastic. Great combination with modern architecture and aquarium. I do suggest to visit the place and your kids will surely enjoy it if they like finish. The current restaurant offers some nice",
          "This is a very well put together attraction. There are over 50 tanks with different species including a jungle room with high humidity. My wife and I really enjoyed it. And it was easy to get to on the M2 train from Copenhagen central or Nooresport stations",
          "It's pretty expensive, but it's worth a visit. The design is great, my son loved it. They don't have many bigger animals, and the only interactive exhibit was the otters, but that was worth the visit itself. They have an awesome playground out back, with a view of the ocean.",
          "The aquarium was smaller than I expected but made for a pleasant visit on a rainy Danish autumn day. The touch screens offer a lot of in depth information about the animals and I especially enjoyed the fascinating information about sharks.",
          "We had just arrived in Copenghagen from London in the afternoon and were a little tired to do the city centre. The aquarium is interesting, very dark but my 5 year old daughter didnt mind to much. Their is a lovely little playground outside for the children aswell. The views",
          "We spent around 3 hours visiting the aquarium. Great place that did not feel crowded even though we visited during the scool holidays. You get to visit different oceans and even a small rainforest area. Outdoors there are great playgrounds for he kids to enjoy, and the",
          "Went here on a rainy saturday. Busy with a lot Of families and lots Of kids. So if you go without kids - it just feels busy and I guess you need patience. But lots to see.",
          "I have seen better range of interesting sea life creatures in Tumbuktu. This aquarium is over-rated, over-proced and over-hyped. It is the least intersting of any aquarium in the world. A visit would take you 20 minutes. The designers of the species variety should have first",
          "Never thought I'd write a good review for a tourist attraction, but it was really good. The menu was developed by Meyers Kokken, which seems quite popular in Copenhagen, and in conjunction with the guys from Noma. We had the fish and chips, fish cakes and salmon salad. It was",
          "Visited with our 2 year old in Danish half term. Was busy, but nothing too silly. This is an excellent aquarium. Not huge, but a fantastic rain forest section and big shark tank. Modern touch displays with english translations. The restuarant food was superb. Best fish and chips",

          "Touted as one of the biggest aquariums in Europe but really nothing compared to the aquariums that u can find in America or Southeast Asia. There were only 2 otters. The big ocean aquarium had very small sharks . We were told to watch the shark feeding. There was a presentation",
          "We were tipped to avoid the weekend or a school holiday, as queues get lengthy, we live in south Sweden and drove over using the bropass opportunity of 20% discount on entry tickets, makes a hefty discount for a family. If you go at weekend get your ticket online before you go",
          "We used to go to Akvariet all the time as a kid. Now it has been moved out near the airport which I find a pitty, since it is not nearly as accesible as before. The new building is beautiful and I like that one can take a marine trip right from the Akvarium so I guess it makes",
          "Visited the aquarium on a busy Saturday afternoon. Entry was included as part of the Copenhagen card, as was transport to and from Kastrup via the metro. We enjoyed our visit but found it to be a little underwhelming when compared to Copenhagen Zoo and how much time it took to",
          "This is a great and exciting activity for families to learn about marine life. Maybe also the marine life gets to know a little about life on shore as there were many eyes behind the walls of glass gazing back on you. Maybe the most impressive sights were the tropical forest and",
          "About a 20 mins cab ride near the airport, this Aquarium is worth checking out. There's a large viewing area where you can see really close up, as well as a tunnel where you're surrounded by marine life. Also simulated rainforest, and adorable otters playing and splashing",
          "Loved this place! Nice and relaxed wondering around! The huge tank full of stingrays and dharks is fab sat watching it for ages!",

          "Great place to visit with kids. We brought our 1 year old and he was mesmerised by the fish tanks. It is informative for adults too. There are timetabled sessions, such as feeding the sharks and rays, where the staff explain in detail about the fish. The cafe is also brilliant",
          "Save this one for the last day when you're heading for the airport, if you can. The free bus stopped running from this evening through to April 2017 (it's seasonal only). The location of the shuttle bus has changed now, and is no longer the train station, it's City Hall.",
          "Part of Copenhagen Pass, went on free shuttle bus from airport on our last day, used left luggage lockers! Not disappointed. Beautiful day, fab view from coffee shop with children fishing from a pontoon. 3 curved corridors with tanks full of fish. Huge walk through aquarium with",

          "Went there with my 8 month old baby boy who was fascinated by the big shark aquarium (large glass wall aquarium with hammerheads and stingrays). The rain forest part was also a nice surprise. Plus the funny sea otters outside (only drawback is I wish they made people stand back",
          "Den Bla Planet (the Blue Planet) replaced the old Danmarks Akvarium at Charlottenlund as Denmark's new national aquarium. It is located near Copenhagen airport (take the metro to Kastrup station, from there it is only a short walk towards the sea to get to the aquarium). Inside",
          "We spent a morning there. The place is not too big and you can easily do it in 3 hours including watching a couple of feeding times. Apart for 'welcome to our foreign guests' and 'goodbye', the rest of any feeding time explanation is in danish and there is lots of talking",

          "Though it\u2019s far if you\u2019re from the city. I thought it was really big but you can actually roam around for a hour and a half like the whole place. It\u2019s nice for an indoor activity. So-so. \ud83d\ude09",

          "A very good, modern aquarium. The building itself is beautiful and there is a wide range of fish to see inside. Many of the tanks are huge, and house exotic fish and mammals from around the world. It probably takes 2-3 hours to look around. The staff were also very welcoming and helpful.",

They actually come to you for it!) or touch sea stars!\nVery nice experience! Great for families but totally enjoyable for couples too.",
          "Beautiful aquarium presenting sea life from all over the planet. You can easily spend several hours here. It's possible to touch different fish in the 'touching' pools. Relax in front of the big aquarium. Would advise to come on a week day \u2026",
          "The aquarium itself is very modern. I liked the visit.\nBut there is a string atached, leading to my rating:\n\nBe aware of the parking system. The parking barriers are open, suggesting a free parking. Indeed they are filming your car plate. \u2026"

          "Whilst this is a very colourful sculpture, its not worth a special visit to Malmo, but one of the places to see and admire whilst walking around Malmo. Its not far from the central station, so, it would be a real shame if you decide not to see it.",
          "What can one say, it's a sculpture of interlocking colourful rings. There are better sculptures and there are worse. It's not offensive to look at. Not worth a special trip though",

        "wiki": "Jakriborg is a housing estate in Hj\u00e4rup, Staffanstorp Municipality between Malm\u00f6 and Lund in Scania, southern Sweden.\nThe area was built from the late 1990s on by the real estate firm Jakri AB and has been growing ever since. Jakri AB was founded by two brothers, Jan Berggren and Krister Berggren. Jan Berggren's project was realised through collaboration with the two architects Robin Manger Architect SAR/MSA and Marcus Axelsson Architect SAR/MSA. The Jakriborg project displays similarities with the contemporary New Urbanism movement and is often compared to the Poundbury project in England built by Prince Charles. It is also a well-known example of traditional and New Classical Architecture.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nJakriborg's architectural style has a variety of intricate maze-like streets and passageways. Jakriborg is not connected to traditional styles of other, more northern, parts of Scandinavia, nor with the functionalism that has been dominant in most of Europe for much of the 20th century. Instead, the style is inspired by pre-industrial town architecture found in the coastal region of the southern Baltic and the North Sea between Flanders and Tallinn, of which the old Hansa City of L\u00fcbeck is the best known example.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHj\u00e4rup is built on the fields of the village of Upp\u00e5kra, which existed for over a thousand years as the predecessor of Lund until the town was moved in 990 to a new and more secure location a few miles away, at which time Upp\u00e5kra reverted to a small town. Jakriborg is combined and joint with Hj\u00e4rup by the railroad Malm\u00f6-Lund on the Copenhagen-Stockholm line.\n\n\n== Population ==\nInitially Jakriborg started with less than 300 families and by 2005 had over 500 families.  However a vast portion of the surrounding land was purchased in 2002 by Jakri AB which has additional space to further expand the town district by more than ten times its current size and capacity. Jakri AB have stated that they do not intend on rapidly growing Jakriborg as they believe growth should happen naturally through organic increase of the society. Therefore the number of yearly constructed apartment units remains deliberately moderate.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPoundbury\nBournville\nPort Sunlight\nWelwyn Garden City\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJakriborg homepage (in Swedish)",

        "wiki": "Malm\u00f6 (; Swedish: [\u02c8m\u00e2lm\u00f8\u02d0] (listen); Danish: Malm\u00f8 [\u02c8m\u00e6lm\u02cc\u00f8\u02c0]) is the largest city in the Swedish county (l\u00e4n) of Sk\u00e5ne (Scania). It is the third-largest city in Sweden, after Stockholm and Gothenburg, and the sixth-largest city in Scandinavia, with a population of 316,588 (municipal total 338,230 in 2018). The Malm\u00f6 Metropolitan Region is home to over 700,000 people, and the \u00d8resund Region, which includes Malm\u00f6, is home to 4 million people.Malm\u00f6 was one of the earliest and most industrialized towns in Scandinavia, but it struggled to adapt to post-industrialism. Since the construction of the \u00d6resund Bridge, Malm\u00f6 has undergone a major transformation, producing new architectural developments, supporting new biotech and IT companies, and attracting students through Malm\u00f6 University and other higher education facilities. The city contains many historic buildings and parks, and is also a commercial center for the western part of Scania.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest written mention of Malm\u00f6 as a city dates from 1275. It is thought to have been founded shortly before that date, as a fortified quay or ferry berth of the Archbishop of Lund, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) to the north-east. Malm\u00f6 was for centuries Denmark's second-biggest city. Its original name was Malmhaug (with alternate spellings), meaning \"Gravel pile\" or \"Ore Hill\".\nIn the 15th century, Malm\u00f6 became one of Denmark's largest and most visited cities, reaching a population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. It became the most important city around the \u00d8resund, with the German Hanseatic League frequenting it as a marketplace, and was notable for its flourishing herring fishery. In 1437, King Eric of Pomerania (King of Denmark from 1396 to 1439) granted the city's arms: argent with a griffin gules, based on Eric's arms from Pomerania. The griffin's head as a symbol of Malm\u00f6 extended to the entire province of Scania from 1660.\nIn 1434, a new citadel was constructed at the beach south of the town. This fortress, known today as Malm\u00f6hus, did not take its current form until the mid-16th century. Several other fortifications were constructed, making Malm\u00f6 Sweden's most fortified city, but only Malm\u00f6hus remains.\n\nLutheran teachings spread during the 16th century Protestant Reformation, and Malm\u00f6 became one of the first cities in Scandinavia to fully convert (1527\u20131529) to this Protestant denomination.\nIn the 17th century, Malm\u00f6 and the Scanian region (Sk\u00e5neland) came under control of Sweden following the Treaty of Roskilde with Denmark, signed in 1658. Fighting continued, however; in June 1677, 14,000 Danish troops laid siege to Malm\u00f6 for a month, but were unable to defeat the Swedish troops holding it.\nBy the dawn of the 18th century, Malm\u00f6 had about 2,300 inhabitants. However, owing to the wars of Charles XII of Sweden (reigned 1697\u20131718) and to bubonic plague epidemics, the population dropped to 1,500 by 1727. The population did not grow much until the modern harbor was constructed in 1775. The city started to expand and the population in 1800 was 4,000. 15 years later, it had increased to 6,000.\n\nIn 1840, Frans Henrik Kockum founded the workshop from which the Kockums shipyard eventually developed as one of the largest shipyards in the world. The Southern Main Line was built between 1856 and 1864; this enabled Malm\u00f6 to become a center of manufacture, with major textile and mechanical industries. In 1870, Malm\u00f6 overtook Norrk\u00f6ping to become Sweden's third-most populous city, and by 1900 Malm\u00f6 had strengthened this position with 60,000 inhabitants. Malm\u00f6 continued to grow through the first half of the 20th century. The population had swiftly increased to 100,000 by 1915 and to 200,000 by 1952.\n\n\n=== 1900\u20131969 ===\n\nIn 1914 (15 May to 4 October) Malm\u00f6 hosted the Baltic Exhibition. The large park Pildammsparken was arranged and planted for this large event. The Russian part of the exhibition was never taken down, owing to the outbreak of World War I.\nOn 18 and 19 December 1914, the Three Kings Meeting was held in Malm\u00f6. After a somewhat infected period (1905\u20131914), which included the dissolution of the Swedish-Norwegian Union, King Oscar II was replaced with King H\u00e5kon VII in Norway, who was the younger brother of the Danish King Christian X. As Oscar died in 1907, and his son Gustav V became the new King of Sweden, the tensions within Scandinavia were still unclear, but during this historical meeting, the Scandinavian Kings found internal understanding, as well as a common line about remaining neutral in the ongoing war.\nWithin sports, Malm\u00f6 has mostly been associated with football. IFK Malm\u00f6 participated in the first ever edition of Allsvenskan 1924/25, but from the mid-1940s Malm\u00f6 FF started to rise, and ever since it has been one of the most prominent clubs within Swedish football. They have won Allsvenskan 23 times in all (as of February 2018) between 1943/44 and 2017.\n\n\n=== 1970s and later ===\nBy 1971, Malm\u00f6 reached 265,000 inhabitants, but this was the peak which would stand for more than 30 years. (Svedala was, for a few years in the early 1970s, a part of Malm\u00f6 municipality.)\nBy the mid-1970s Sweden experienced a recession that hit the industrial sector especially hard; shipyards and manufacturing industries suffered, which led to high unemployment in many cities of Scania. Kockums shipyard had become a symbol of Malm\u00f6 as its largest employer and, when shipbuilding ceased in 1986, confidence in the future of Malm\u00f6 plummeted among politicians and the public. In addition, many middle-class families moved into one-family houses in surrounding municipalities such as Vellinge Municipality, Lomma Municipality and Staffanstorp Municipality, which profiled themselves as the suburbs of the upper-middle class. By 1985, Malm\u00f6 had lost 35,000 inhabitants and was down to 229,000.The Swedish financial crises of the early 1990s exacerbated Malm\u00f6's decline as an industrial city; between 1990 and 1995 Malm\u00f6 lost about 27,000 jobs and its economy was seriously strained. However, from 1994 under the leadership of the then mayor Ilmar Reepalu, the city of Malm\u00f6 started to create a new economy as a center of culture and knowledge. Malm\u00f6 reached bottom in 1995, but that same year marked the commencement of the massive \u00d6resund Bridge road, railway and tunnel project, connecting it to Copenhagen and to the rail lines of Europe. The new Malm\u00f6 University opened in 1998 on Kockums' former dockside. Further redevelopment of the now disused south-western harbor followed; a city architecture exposition (Bo01) was held in the area in 2001, and its buildings and villas form the core of a new city district. Designed with attractive waterfront vistas, it was intended to be and has been successful in attracting the urban middle-class.\nSince 1974, the Kockums Crane had been a landmark in Malm\u00f6 and a symbol of the city's manufacturing industry, but in 2002 it was disassembled and moved to South Korea. In 2005, Malm\u00f6 gained a new landmark with completion of Turning Torso, the tallest skyscraper in Scandinavia. Although the transformation from a city with its economic base in manufacturing has returned growth to Malm\u00f6, the new types of jobs have largely benefited the middle and upper classes.\nIn its 2015 and 2017 reports, Police in Sweden placed the Roseng\u00e5rd and the S\u00f6dra Sofielund/Seved district in the most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMalm\u00f6 is located at 13\u00b000' east and 55\u00b035' north, near the southwestern tip of Sweden, in the province of Scania.\nThe city is part of the transnational \u00d6resund Region and, since 2000, has been linked by the \u00d6resund Bridge across the \u00d6resund to Copenhagen, Denmark. The bridge opened on 1 July 2000, and measures 8 kilometres (5 miles) (the whole link totalling 16 km), with pylons reaching 204.5 metres (670.9 feet) vertically. Apart from the Helsingborg-Helsing\u00f8r ferry links further north, most ferry connections have been discontinued.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nMalm\u00f6, like the rest of southern Sweden, has an oceanic climate. Despite its northern location, the climate is mild compared to other locations at similar latitudes, mainly because of the influence of the Gulf Stream and also its westerly position on the Eurasian landmass. Owing to its northern latitude, daylight lasts 17 hours in midsummer, but only around seven hours in midwinter. According to data from 2002\u20132014 Falsterbo, to the south of the city, received an annual average of 1,895 hours of sunshine while Lund, to the north, received 1,803 hours. The sunshine data in the weather box is based on the data for Falsterbo.Summers are mild with average high temperatures of 20 to 23 \u00b0C (68 to 73 \u00b0F) and lows of around 11 to 13 \u00b0C (52 to 55 \u00b0F). Heat waves during the summer arise occasionally. Winters are fairly cold and windy, with temperatures steady between \u22123 to 4 \u00b0C (27 to 39 \u00b0F), but it rarely drops below \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F).\nRainfall is light to moderate throughout the year with 169 wet days. Snowfall occurs mainly in December through March, but snow covers do not remain for a long time, and some winters are virtually free of snow.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\u00d6resund Line trains cross the \u00d6resund Bridge every 20 minutes (hourly late night) connecting Malm\u00f6 to Copenhagen, and the Copenhagen Airport. The trip takes around 35\u201340 minutes. Additionally, some of the X 2000 and Intercity trains to Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Kalmar cross the bridge, stopping at Copenhagen Airport. In March 2005, excavation began on a new railway connection called the City Tunnel, which opened for traffic on 4 December 2010. The tunnel runs south from Malm\u00f6 Central Station through an underground station at the Triangeln railway station to Hylliev\u00e5ng (Hyllie Meadow). Then, the line comes to the surface to enter Hyllie Station, also created as part of the tunnel project. From Hyllie Station, the line connects to the existing \u00d6resund line in either direction, with the \u00d6resund Bridge lying due west.\nBesides the Copenhagen Airport, Malm\u00f6 has an airport of its own, Malm\u00f6 Airport, today chiefly used for domestic Swedish destinations, charter flights and low-cost carriers.\nThe motorway system has been incorporated with the \u00d6resund Bridge; the European route E20 goes over the bridge and then, together with the European route E6 follows the Swedish west coast from Malm\u00f6\u2013Helsingborg to Gothenburg. E6 goes further north along the west coast and through Norway to the Norwegian town Kirkenes at Barents Sea. The European route to J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping\u2013Stockholm (E4) starts at Helsingborg. Main roads in the directions of V\u00e4xj\u00f6\u2013Kalmar, Kristianstad\u2013Karlskrona, Ystad (E65), and Trelleborg start as freeways.\nMalm\u00f6 has 410 kilometres (250 mi) of bike paths; approximately 40% of all commuting is done by bicycle.\n\n\n=== Ports ===\nThe city has two industrial harbors; one is still in active use and is the largest Nordic port for car importation. It also has two marinas: the publicly owned Limhamn Marina (55\u00b035\u2032N 12\u00b055\u2032E) and the private Lagunen (55\u00b035\u2032N 12\u00b056\u2032E), both offering a limited number of guest docks.\nPublic transport consisted of a tram network from 1887 until 1973. Afterwards, it was replaced by a bus network.\n\n\n=== Malm\u00f6 S-Train ===\nA local train line with circular traffic at seven stations was opened in December 2018. The stations are Malm\u00f6 Central Station (underground platforms) \u2013 Triangeln station \u2013 Hyllie station \u2013 Malm\u00f6 South/Sv\u00e5gertorp \u2013 Persborg \u2013 Roseng\u00e5rd \u2013 \u00d6sterv\u00e4rn \u2013 Malm\u00f6 Central Station (main overground terminus). Some trains arrive from Kristianstad and finish with a lap around Malm\u00f6, whilst other trains at this circular line, never drive outside the city limits. There is at least a 30 minutes service between each departure, but far more between the Central Station and Hyllie. Extension plans of a minor network system exists.\n\n\n=== Proposed metro ===\nThe \u00d6resundsmetro is a proposed rapid transit network linking Malm\u00f6 with the existing Copenhagen Metro through a 22 km tunnel under the \u00d6resund.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nMalm\u00f6 Municipality is an administrative unit defined by geographical borders, consisting of the City of Malm\u00f6 and its immediate surroundings.\nMalm\u00f6 (Malm\u00f6 t\u00e4tort) consists of the urban part of the municipality together with the small town of Arl\u00f6v in the Burl\u00f6v Municipality. Both municipalities also include smaller urban areas and rural areas, such as the suburbs of Oxie and \u00c5karp. Malm\u00f6 t\u00e4tort is to be distinguished from Malm\u00f6 stad (the city of Malm\u00f6), which is a semi-official name of Malm\u00f6 Municipality.\nThe leaders in Malm\u00f6 created a commission for a socially sustainable Malm\u00f6 in November 2010. The commissions were tasked with providing evidence-based strategies for reducing health inequalities and improve living conditions for all citizens of Malm\u00f6, especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged and issued its final report in December 2013.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nMalm\u00f6 has a young population by Swedish standards, with almost half of the population under the age of 35 (48.2%).After 1971, Malm\u00f6 had 265,000 inhabitants, but the population then dropped to 229,000 by 1985. The total population of the urban area was 280,415 in December 2010. It then began to rise again, and had passed the previous record by the 1 January 2003 census, when it had 265,481 inhabitants. On 27 April 2011, the population of Malm\u00f6 reached the 300,000 mark. In 2017 the total population of the city was 316,588 inhabitants out of a municipal total of 338,230.In 2019, approximately 55.5% of the population of Malm\u00f6 municipality (190,849 residents) had at least one parent born abroad. The Middle East, Horn of Africa, former Yugoslavia and Denmark are the main sources of immigration. In addition, 14.8% (50 999 residents) of the population in 2019 were foreign nationals.Foreign-born population by country, 31 December 2018:\n\nGreater Malm\u00f6 is one of Sweden's three officially recognized metropolitan areas (storstadsomr\u00e5den) and since 2005 is defined as the municipality of Malm\u00f6 and 11 other municipalities in the southwestern corner of Scania. As of 2019, its population was recorded as 740,840. The region covers an area of 2,522 square kilometres (974 sq mi). The municipalities included, apart from Malm\u00f6, are Burl\u00f6v, Esl\u00f6v, H\u00f6\u00f6r, K\u00e4vlinge, Lomma, Lund, Skurup, Staffanstorp, Svedala, Trelleborg and Vellinge. Together with Lund, Malm\u00f6 is the region's economic and education hub.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Malm\u00f6 was traditionally based on shipbuilding (Kockums) and construction-related industries, such as concrete factories. The region's leading university, along with its associated hi-tech and pharmaceutical industries, is located in Lund about 16 kilometres (10 miles) to the north-east. As a result, Malm\u00f6 had a troubled economic situation following the mid-1970s. Between 1990\u20131995, 27,000 jobs were lost, and the budget deficit was more than one billion Swedish krona (SEK). In 1995, Malm\u00f6 had Sweden's highest unemployment rate.However, during the last two decades, there has been a revival. One contributing factor has been the economic integration with Denmark brought about by the \u00d6resund Bridge, which opened in July 2000. Also the university founded in 1998 and the effects of integration into the European Union have contributed. In 2017 the unemployment rate is still high but Malm\u00f6 has, in the last 20 years, had one of the strongest employment growth rates in Sweden. But a lot of those jobs are taken by workers outside the neighboring municipalities.As of 2016, the largest companies were:\nSkanska \u2013 heavy construction\nNobina \u2013 transport\nPostNord \u2013 postal services\nP\u00e5gen \u2013 bakery\nIKEA \u2013 furnitureAlmost 30 companies have moved their headquarters to Malm\u00f6 during the last seven years, generating around 2,300 jobs. Among them are IKEA who has most of its headquarter functions based in Malm\u00f6.The number of start-up companies is high in Malm\u00f6. Around 7 new companies are started every day in Malm\u00f6. In 2010, the renewal of the number of companies amounted to 13.9%, which exceeds both Stockholm and Gothenburg. Especially strong growth is in the gaming area with Massive entertainment and King being the flagship companies for the industry. Among the industries that continue to increase their share of companies in Malm\u00f6 are transport, financial and business services, entertainment, leisure and construction.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMalm\u00f6 has the country's ninth-largest school of higher education, Malm\u00f6 University, established in 1998. It has 1,600 employees and 24,000 students (2014).\nIn addition nearby Lund University (established in 1666) has some education located in Malm\u00f6:\n\nMalm\u00f6 Art Academy (Konsth\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nMalm\u00f6 Academy of Music (Musikh\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nMalm\u00f6 Theatre Academy (Teaterh\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nThe Faculty of Medicine, which is located in both Malm\u00f6 and Lund.The United Nations World Maritime University is also located in Malm\u00f6. The World Maritime University (WMU) operates under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized agency of the United Nations. WMU thus enjoys the status, privileges and immunities of a UN institution in Sweden.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Film and television ===\nA striking depiction of Malm\u00f6 (in the 1930s) was made by Bo Widerberg in his debut film Kvarteret Korpen (Raven's End) (1963), largely shot in the shabby Korpen working-class district in Malm\u00f6. With humour and tenderness, it depicts the tensions between classes and generations.  The movie was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1965. In 2017, the film Medan Vi Lever (While We Live) was awarded the prize for best film by an African living abroad at the Africa Movie Academy Awards. It was filmed in Malm\u00f6 and Gambia, and deals with identity, integration and everyday racism.The cities of Malm\u00f6 and Copenhagen are, with the \u00d6resund Bridge, the main locations in the television series The Bridge (Bron/Broen).\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\nIn 1944, Malm\u00f6 Stadsteater (Malm\u00f6 Municipal Theatre) was established with a repertoire comprising stage theatre, opera, musical, ballet, musical recitals and experimental theatre. In 1993 it was split into three units, Dramatiska Teater (Dramatical Theatre), Malm\u00f6 Musikteater (Music Theatre) and Sk\u00e5nes Dansteater (Scanian Dance Theatre) and the name was abandoned. The ownership of the last two were transferred to Region Sk\u00e5ne in 2006 Dramatiska Teatern regained its old name. In the 1950s Ingmar Bergman was the Director and Chief Stage Director of Malm\u00f6 Stadsteater and many of his actors, like Max von Sydow and Ingrid Thulin became known through his films. Later stage directors include Staffan Valdemar Holm and G\u00f6ran Stangertz. Malm\u00f6 Musikteater were renamed Malm\u00f6 Operan and plays operas and musicals, classics as newly composed, on one of Scandinavia's large opera scenes with 1,511 seats. Sk\u00e5nes dansteater is active and plays contemporary dance repertory and present works by Swedish and international choreographers in their house in Malm\u00f6 harbor.Since the 1970s the city has also been home to independent theatre groups and show/musical companies. It also hosts a rock/dance/dub culture; in the 1960s The Rolling Stones played the Klubb Bongo, and in recent years stars like Morrissey, Nick Cave, B.B. King and Pat Metheny have made repeated visits.\nThe Cardigans debuted in Malm\u00f6 and recorded their albums there. On 7 January 2009 CNN Travel broadcast a segment called \"MyCity_MyLife\" featuring Nina Persson taking the camera to some of the sites in Malm\u00f6 that she enjoys.\nThe Rooseum Center for Contemporary Art, founded in 1988 by the Swedish art collector and financier Fredrik Roos and housed in a former power station which had been built in 1900, was one of the foremost centers for contemporary art in Europe during the 1980s and 1990s. By 2006, most of the collection had been sold off and the museum was on a time-out; by 2010 Rooseum had been dismantled and a subsidiary of the National Museum of Modern Art inaugurated in its place.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nIn 1992 and in 2013 Malm\u00f6 was the host of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nModerna Museet Malm\u00f6 was opened in December 2009  in the old Rooseum building. It is a part of the Moderna Museet, with independent exhibitions of modern and contemporary art. The collection of Moderna Museet holds key pieces of, among others, Marcel Duchamp, Louise Bourgeois, Pablo Picasso, Niki de Saint Phalle, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Carolee Schneemann, Henri Matisse and Robert RauschenbergMalm\u00f6 Museum (Malm\u00f6 Museer) is a municipal and regional museum. The museum features exhibitions on technology, shipping, natural history and history. Malm\u00f6 Museum has an aquarium and an art museum. Malm\u00f6hus Castle is also operated as a part of the museum.\nExhibitions are primarily shown at Slottsholmen and at the Technology and Maritime Museum (Teknikens och sj\u00f6fartens hus).Malm\u00f6 Konsthall is one of the largest exhibition halls in Europe for contemporary art, opened in 1975.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMalm\u00f6's oldest building is St. Peter's Church (Swedish: Sankt Petri). It was built in the early 14th century in Baltic Brick Gothic probably after St Mary's Church in L\u00fcbeck. The church is built with a nave, two aisles, a transept and a tower. Its exterior is characterized above all by the flying buttresses spanning its airy arches over the aisles and ambulatory. The tower, which fell down twice during the 15th century, got its current look in 1890. Another major church of significance is the Church of Our Saviour, Malm\u00f6, which was founded in 1870.\nAnother old building is Tunneln, 300 metres (1,000 ft) to the west of Sankt Petri Church, which also dates back to around 1300.\nThe oldest parts of Malm\u00f6 were built between 1300\u20131600 during its first major period of expansion. The central city's layout, as well as some of its oldest buildings, are from this time. Many of the smaller buildings from this time are typical Scanian: two-story urban houses that show a strong Danish influence.Recession followed in the ensuing centuries. The next expansion period was in the mid 19th century and led to the modern stone and brick city. This expansion lasted into the 20th century and can be seen by a number of Art Nouveau buildings, among those in the Malm\u00f6 synagogue. Malm\u00f6 was relatively late to be influenced by modern ideas of functionalist tenement architecture in the 1930s.\nAround 1965, the government initiated the so-called Million Programme, intending to offer affordable apartments in the outskirts of major Swedish cities. But this period also saw the reconstruction (and razing) of much of the historical city center.Since the late 1990s, Malm\u00f6 has seen a more cosmopolitan architecture. V\u00e4stra Hamnen (The Western Harbor), like most of the harbor to the north of the city center, was industrial. In 2001 its reconstruction began as an urban residential neighbourhood, with 500 residential units, most were part of the exhibition Bo01. The exhibition had two main objectives: develop self-sufficient housing units in terms of energy and greatly diminish phosphorus emissions. Among the new building's towers were the Turning Torso, a skyscraper with a twisting design, 190 metres (620 ft) tall, the majority of which is residential. It became Malm\u00f6's new landmark. The most recent addition (2015) is the new development of Malm\u00f6 Live. This new building features a hotel, a concert hall, congress hall and a sky bar in the center of Malm\u00f6. Point Hyllie is a new 110 m commercial tower that is under construction as of 2018.\n\n\n=== Other sights ===\n\nThe beach Ribersborg, by locals usually called Ribban, south-west of the harbor area, is a man-made shallow beach, stretching along Malm\u00f6's coastline. Despite Malm\u00f6's chilly climate, it is sometimes referred to as the \"Copacabana of Malm\u00f6\". It is the site of Ribersborgs open-air bath, opened in the 1890s.\nThe long boardwalk at The Western Harbor, Scaniaparken and Daniaparken, has become a favorite summer hang-out for the people of Malm\u00f6 and is a popular place for bathing. The harbor is particularly popular with Malm\u00f6's vibrant student community and has been the scene of several impromptu outdoor parties and gatherings.\n\n\n=== Annual events ===\n\nIn the third week of August each year a festival, Malm\u00f6festivalen, fills the streets of Malm\u00f6 with different kinds of cuisines and events.\nBUFF International Film Festival, an international children and young people's film festival, is held in Malm\u00f6 every year in March.\nNordisk Panorama \u2013 Nordic Short & Doc Film Festival, a film festival for short and documentary films by filmmakers from the Nordic countries, is held every year in September.\nMalm\u00f6 Arab Film Festival (MAFF), the largest Arabic film festival in Europe, is held in Malm\u00f6.\nThe Nordic Game conference takes place in Malm\u00f6 every April/May. The event consists of conference itself, recruitment expo and game expo and attracts hundreds of gamedev professionals every year.\nMalm\u00f6 also hosts other 3rd party events that cater to all communities that reside in Malm\u00f6, including religious and political celebrations.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nSydsvenskan, founded in 1870, is Malm\u00f6's largest daily newspaper. It has an average circulation of 130,000. Its main competitor is the regional daily Sk\u00e5nska Dagbladet, which has a circulation of 34,000. The tabloid Kv\u00e4llsposten still has a minimal editorial staff but is today just a version of a Stockholm tabloid. The Social Democratic Arbetet was edited and printed at Malm\u00f6 between 1887 and 2000.In addition to these, a number of free-of-charge papers, generally dealing with entertainment, music and fashion have local editions (for instance City, Rodeo, Metro and N\u00f6jesguiden). Malm\u00f6 is also home to the Egmont Group's Swedish magazine operations. A number of local and regional radio and TV broadcasters are based in the Greater Malm\u00f6 area.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\n\n==== Football ====\n\nSports in southern Sweden are dominated by football. Over the years the city's best football teams have been Malm\u00f6 FF who play in the top-level Allsvenskan Malm\u00f6 FF had their most successful periods in the 1970s and 1980s when they won the league several times. In 1979, they advanced to the final of the European Cup defeating AS Monaco, Dynamo Kiew, Wisla Krakow and Austria Wien (Vienna) but lost in the final at the Munich Olympic Stadium against Nottingham Forest by a single goal just before half time scored by Trevor Francis. To date, they are the only Swedish football club to have reached the final of the competition. Malm\u00f6 FF is the club where for instance, Bosse Larsson and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 began their football careers.  A second football team, IFK Malm\u00f6 played in Sweden's top flight for about 20 years and the club's quarterfinal in the European Cup is the club's greatest achievement in its history. Today, the club resides in the sixth tier of the Swedish league system.\nFC Roseng\u00e5rd (former LdB Malm\u00f6) are playing in the top level in Damallsvenskan, women's football league. FC Roseng\u00e5rd girls have won the league 10 times and the national cup title 5 times. In 2014, they reached the semi-final in Champions League, which they ultimately went on to lose to the German side 1. FFC Frankfurt. Brazilian football player Marta, widely regarded the best female football player of all time, played in FC Roseng\u00e5rd between 2014 and 2017.\nAt the 1958 FIFA World Cup Malm\u00f6 Stadion was inaugurated in combination with the opening match of the cup, as World Champions West Germany defeated Argentina 3\u20131, in front of 31,156, a record attendance for Malm\u00f6 in general. Another two games were decided at the stadium.\n\n\n==== Other sports ====\nMalm\u00f6 has athletes competing in a variety of sport.\n\n\n===== Ice hockey =====\nThe most notable other sports team is the ice hockey team Malm\u00f6 Redhawks. They were the creation of millionaire Percy Nilsson and quickly rose to the highest rank in the early to mid-1990s and won two Swedish championships, but for a number of years have found themselves residing outside of the top flight. \n\n\n===== Handball =====\nA first division handball team, HK Malm\u00f6, attracts a fair amount of attendance. \n\n\n===== Rugby =====\nRugby union team, Malm\u00f6 RC, founded in 1954, have won 6 national championships. The club has teams for men, women and juniors.\n\n\n===== Gaelic football =====\nGaelic football has also been introduced to Malm\u00f6. The men of Malm\u00f6 G.A.A. have won the Scandinavian Championships twice and the women once.\n\n\n===== Additional Team and Individual Sport =====\nOther notable team a sports are baseball, American football and Australian football.\nAmong non-team sports, badminton and athletics are the most popular, together with east Asian martial arts and boxing. Basketball is also fairly a big sport in the city, including the clubs Malbas and SF Srbija among others.\nWomen are permitted by the city council to swim topless in public swimming pools. Everyone must wear bathing attire, but covering of the breasts is not mandatory.\n\n\n== Notable events ==\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nScania\nMalm\u00f6 Bulltofta Airport\nChapter 4 Concerning the Friary in Malm\u00f8 in Chronicle of the Expulsion of the Greyfriars\nList of governors of Malm\u00f6hus County\nPorts of the Baltic Sea\n\n\n== References ==\nFacts & Figures about Malm\u00f6, 2005 at the Wayback Machine (archived 7 October 2006) \u2013 in English.

          "Worth a visit. You only need an hour. It was built in the 1640s as a home for the university observatory. It has an interesting and easy to walk spiral ramp (not that dissimilar to the ramp at the Seville Cathedral tower). Lovely uninterrupted views of he city from the viewing",
          "We're at Copenhagen in late December, the line moved quickly and it was easy to get to the top. It offers a good view in 360\u00ba, it certainly deserves a visit.",
          "It is a 17th C. cultural landmark right in the middle of the city. Various interesting stories abound- but find out when you visit. As opposed to stairs (and no elevator, sorry), you proceed up a steep, winding ramp to the top. If you manage to get outside at the top that is",
          "We arrived in Copenhagen on 14/3/20 for a short city break to learn that the whole city was in lock down due to the Corona Virus. Great timing eh. This meant that the Round tower was closed for visitors, so if we ever want to climb to the top , we will have to make a return",
          "We went up in the evening on a night when the observatory at the top was open. The tower itself is interesting having a ramp instead of lots of steps. There is a small display room off to one side that shows the construction, the enormous beams. Copenhagen is not the",

          "I went up this tower on a rainy day, looking for something indoors, but I would definitely recommend doing this on a sunny day when you can get nice views of the city without being rained on! There's some history, but I found it a rather limited storyline and the best part was",
          "This tower is in excellent condition and was really nice to walk up (slight incline all the way around, only a few steps at the top). There are a few interesting facts on the way and at the top there is a observatory, which is open on Tuesday and Wednesday night's. The view",
          "Although not recognised as a \"must do\" when you think about visiting Copenhagen i would highly recommend that you do!! Set on the pedestrianised shopping street in the city centre you can climb the wide, cobbled spiral to the very top (around 35 metres from ground level). On",
          "Cheap entry to the tower, very informative exhibits about the tower off in the side rooms as you go up and there was a free art exhibition in a room part way up when we visited. The view at the top is lovely and I had just been expecting a nice view to be honest, so to come",

          "We visited the tower on a rainy January day. It\u2019s super cheap and definitely worth the money. Right in the centre it\u2019s an amazing view from the top.

          "If your in the neighbourhood it is a simple quick stop for 25 DKK per adult where you walk to the top in a swirling upwards indoor road to the top. The final rise is a really narrow staircase but then the view from the top shows you all of Copenhagen in a nice way. On Tuesdays",
          "If you are looking for the best views of Copenhagen, well this is the perfect place. I doubt it is as high as the Taarnet, but this one offers more interesting views since it\u2019s located right in the middle of the city. What\u2019s more interesting is the fact that it has no stairs, so",

          "On a rainy and cold friday we walked ariund in Copenhagen and stumbled upon this impressive (and sightly leaning?) tower. Unfortunately we did not have time to go up, but I imagine the views would be spectacular.",
          "There\u2019s lot of towers in Copenhagen to climb but this has got to be the easiest as most of it is a cobblestone pathway with only a few steps at the end. Even though it was raining when we got to the top the view was still with it. Also a very good exhibition space on the",
          "in the center of the city,enough of up walking to the top but you have a view of the whole city around",
          "This is worth the cost of admission. The walk up is easy. There are benches if you need to rest. You'll get some good pictures inside as well as aerial views from the top.",
          "It's a short walk up to the top on a helical ramp - round and round you go up to the top! The kind and queen used to ascend this by horse and carriage Costs 25 DKK to enter ($4 US) Definitely worth the price as the views from the top are pretty cool and you can peer down on",
          "I enjoyed walking up for the beautiful views and history. It was also conveniently located, which makes it easy for a quick stop! It is a fairly steep incline at parts.",
          "We walked back to the square with the city hall in and did some photos then took a very meandering route to the Round Tower. Sofia still wasn't sure about going in but I dragged her and we slowly spiralled our way to the top. There were lovely views from the top to the Oresund",
          "Stumbled across this as I don\u2019t recall seeing it in my travel guide. What a find! A rare cheap entry ticket for Copenhagen (less than \u00a33 each) and such a stunning building! Really interesting and great to be able to push the pram nearly to the top!",
          "On our trip to Denmark, this was a recommended stop. We walked to the top and were able to see Copenhagen views. It was a rainy day so nice to be indoors too.",
          "Outside the building, I didn't feel any special but round shape. When I entered it with my son, the ramp between the bottom and the top was interesting and good for taking pictures. On the top of tower, the city view was fantastic. The shop at the top was small but my son bought",
          "It's another sight you should see while you're here but it is a long way up (nearly 300m) the view is worth it, there's areas to stop on the way up/down, but there's a narrow flight of steps at the top, these are 2 way and people will just squeeze past you which can be a bit",
          "Easy but steep walk up the interior ramp. Top provides a good view over Copenhagen, especially towards Rosenberg Slot. Unfortunately the Conservatory was closed when we went, so I recommend checking its opening times before you go if you want to have a look.",
          "This church tower from the Danish king Christian the 4th is an absolute must during a visit to Copenhagen. The tower was built in a way that the king coud ride in a horse carrige to the top. The view is spectacular.",
          "It\u2019s a tower. With a view. There\u2019s little surprise here but worth a quick diversion from the main shopping street. A few interesting bits along the way up but I\u2019ll leave that to you to discover. Nice view of all of Copenhagen.",
          "Beautifully preserved, a good walk up to see the panoramic view but not much else. there are one stop with some interesting galleries, and one with historic of the astronomical tower - but that's that.",
          "City center landmark with a hollow core. 25 kr per person. Near the top is an exhibition area, which was free to enjoy. Windy at the top but views are unobstructed. Easily spend one-two hours here.",
          "A must visit right in the heart of Copenhagen. So fairly priced and a great little thing to do. It\u2019s a very individual tourist attraction with a great back story. Never done anything like it. All with a great view of Copenhagen at the top. As I say it is really cheap and a nice",
          "I was here in 2010 and I was looking forward to seeing it again this year. Never regretted I came for the second time. Do read it\u2019s interesting history. Really worth visiting it and not pricey at all compared to other sights in the town. Great views also!!!",
          "Just a few steps right at the top, the rest of the climb is a gentle slope ideal for buggies. There are toilet half way up and a coffee stop and shop. Amazing architecture superb views from the top. Not to be missed on any trip to this beautiful city.",
          "Well worth a visit whilst in Copenhagen. It is bit of a walk to the top with the spiral walkaway, but the views are well worth it when you get there of the rest of the city. They also had a really cool art exhibit on by the cafe halfway, which I recommend paying a visit too on",
          "I enjoyed the historic walk up to the top of the tower. We collected stamps and learned about different round towers around the world. Neat architecture and history. Loved that the view at the top had ID for the buildings you could see. Honestly, had super low expectations and",
          "The Round Tower is well worth the visit. A walk up the spiral walkway will get the heart pumping but the view from the top is worth the walk. A glimpse into the old bell tower makes one marvel at the stories that could be told. The construction of the tower is something to see.",
          "Interesting building. A tower you walk up inside. I can imagine running it as an event. Very unusual building. Nice walking climb to top. Top is an observatory. Lovely building and history inside it.",
          "Gentle slope instead of stairs. A floor with strange modern art. It\u2019s a bit of an unusual tower but worth going up.",
          "Round tower is great and accessible to all for the most part. The outside edge isn\u2019t very steep and there\u2019s entry ways on the way up to read about the history of the building so plenty rest stops. The last part of the tower has some stairs but if you can make it up the views are",
          "The Rundetarn is located in the Latin Quarter of Copenhagen. It was built in 1642 by King Christian IV as an observatory. Walk inside and start walking up the spiral ramp to the top. Great views of the city.",
          "Ok so it might look like a tough climb but the majority is quite an easy ramp. At the top there are around 30 stairs, and then a small spiral staircase. So yep for many it is do-able and the view at the top is well worth it. A few interning sights on the way up including the",
          "The tower is a beautiful building and I found it fascinating. Why would they build a slope this long? It was a nice \u2018climb\u2019 and the view from the top was beautiful. I liked the drawings on the fence at the top, which pointed out the visible landmarks.",
          "The building and it's history are unique and compelling, but otherwise it's a leisurely stroll to the top for a nice view of old Copenhagen. Not much going on in the exhibit spaces, but the old toilet facility and the hollow core through the center of the structure (zero",
          "We had the Copenhagen Card and had some time so we decided to get our monies worth and visit the Round Tower since we were nearby. It was interesting. They had an exhibit of the 1969 Moonwalk so that was cool. You can view the city from the top.",
          "The tower was really impressive on the inside! The entrance fee was around 25-30 DKK (3-4 \u20ac). The view from the top was amazing but you couldn't enjoy the view at the maximum because of the protective banisters.",
          "This tower is a very easy climb for everyone. The only stairs are the last maybe 15 feet otherwise it's mostly a ramp. Gives you a good view of the old city.",
          "This place is amazing very cheap entry the Atmosphere is lovely and there are great views from the top and its just beautiful there is a great observation deck its a great Heritage site which is right in we had a great time in the centre.",
          "Not very impressive architecture but good as an observation point.Nice views from the top.I don't know why this tower is listed twice here...\"Rundetaarn\" and \"Rundetarn\" are the same thing,the same tower.",
          "Worth a visit. Cheap entry, lovely atmosphere and great views at the top. Really Interesting heritage site right in the centre of a shopping street.",
          "Very unique building we decided to visit while walking around the city. A workout to get to the observation deck but worth the view.",
          "A tower in the center of the city overlooking the entire town. The view from the top is nice because you can see all of Copenhagen, but basically that's it - a viewpoint. Before you reach the end you will come across a gallery and toward the top there are a few steps to the",
          "Unique tower you don't use stairs to go up but a spiral ramp. Czar Peter the great drove his horse up there but it's more common no to go on foot. The ramp is easier on your knees than a staircase but the last 10 meter is a staircase. Once you're on the outside lookout platform",
          "Going up on to the top takes some time , Getting you tired unless you are well fitted. All the city is visible from the top with additional explanation of the surrounding.",
          "A spiral way leads all the way to the top. At the top, you can see a 360 degree view of the city. Superb! Tips: included in Copenhagen Card 72 hours ( cost ~ 739 DKK = 160 AUD)",
          "This place has a really fascinating history, and you can walk up the spiral tower (no stairs, just steep) to the very top. Located just about in the center of what is today the main shopping area of Copenhagen. Great view of the city from the top.",
          "So worth the walk up to the top for the view - stairs are a bit narrow at the top so be careful - expect queues at the weekends",
          "This is a building that offers a panoramic view of the whole city! You go up an uphill and roundabout. In the end it only has some steps but not a particular problem. The view is very good. It also includes toilets, which are well-kept. If you have a stroller, you can leave",
          "I wasn't too sure if this was the best thing to take the children too but really wanted to visit. They however loved it! They had fun making their way to the top, theres a few little nooks to hide in whilst they waited for the adults to make their ways up! Its a cheap attraction",
          "Down a side street. Easy to get up to the exhibition hall. Space exhibition was brilliant and unexpected.",
          "Great old tower in the middle of Copenhagen. interesting to see how it was used for the king back in time. Great view of the old town from the top.",
          "Unique tower, cylindrical. The history of the building is interesting. I didn't have time to walk up the tower.",
          "Do save your visit for a clear day, since the view from the top is less than stellar on a rainy, foggy one. However, even without the view, strolling up the 600-food spiral ramp makes one envious of Peter the Great's wife, Catherine, who took a carriage to the top.",
          "Other than the nature of the building and a space exhibition, this is not the most enthralling place to visit. However, there are really clear views from the top of the tower, although the staircase to them is very narrow for 2 way traffic - not too many steps though.",
          "The round tower provides a good view of the city, but it\u2019s not located very high. It was a little disappointing compared to other high sightseeing viewpoints in Europe. However, it\u2019s very cheap to get in (and included in the Copenhagen Card) so its worth a visit. We were in and",
          "A wonderful structure with the slope up to the top and great views of the city from the top. Great value.",
          "Taking in some local history with our Danish friends, a nice walk to the top of the tower, checking out the rooms ofc to the side.",
          "In what is a quite an expensive city to stay in, the Round Tower provided really good value. Cheap to get in, then you follow the circular ramp walkway to the top where you get amazing views. Half way up there is a museum space, when we visited there was an exhibition on",
          "Unique and historical site. A must see. There was an exhibition of the moon landing when I was there.",
          "I just walked past without going in as family were waiting, The building seemed impressive. I would have gone in if I had time.",
          "If you\u2019re looking for a place from where you can see the city center from above, this is the place! You\u2019ll have to walk a little bit and the top part of the tower will be a little bit harder to climb because of a small hall, but totally worth it!",
          "In like other view tower, this one has slope, not small right stairs, Till really in the end. So easy to go up, then view of the city from the top is beautiful. The area is artistic and fun shops, as well as many restaurants.",
          "Very beautiful view and interesting exhibition inside. Liked a lot, road to the top was cool also, you expect stairs and there is real road.",
          "Great view of the city from the top & in the middle of the city, so get to see it from the middle, so to speak. Cheap entry price as well. Worth a visit.",
          "This is an attraction you kind of stumble on in Copenhagen. It is located in one of the retail areas of the city and it is not immediately apparent that it is a point of interest. We used the Copenhagen cards to gain entry and then did the spiral walk up to the top passing one",
          "From an architectural point of view, there\u2019s nothing out of common, a cylindrical tower with a lot of windows around it. There is no change in the interior either. A wide access path (I think a car would fit there as well) that climbs in a stereotypical and quite steep spiral to",
          "Fun experience walking spiral path to the top. Historic, fun, great photo opportunities. We were able to see the observatory and learned that this was once used for surveying and map making. Original instruments are on display.",
          "Amazing 17th century structure which was an astronomical observatory. Few highlights: 1) a spiral, sloped staircase which I saw a person pushing her loved one on a wheelchair (but do take note the last part of the climb requires to navigate a narrow stairwell with steps) 2)",
          "This was included on the Copenhagen Card so we made the walk up. Worth doing in my opinion (only took about 20 min to see and do everything). Don't expect to be blown away with anything, just a spiral walk up to a nice view.",
          "Really interesting historic building with good museum and information. Good value - only 60K for a family",
          "It is a former astronomy site and very fascinating in terms of the history. It is very well kept and beautiful in terms of its construction and shapes. This is worth the small amount for an entrance fee. Lots of children running up and down. It certainly appears as though",
          "Cheap to visit and it slopes to nearly the very top. Us humans like to climb and this hits the spot. Slopes all the way round and up. Stairs at the top. Good views at top.",
          "This was one of the highlights of our trip to Copenhagen. It was amazing to walk up the cobbled ramp to the top. There\u2019s lots of window seats to sit in and rest / take photos. Plus a gift shop and exhibition area with plenty of toilets. The view from the top was lovely and we",
          "This interesting old tower has been very well revovated to accomodate todays visitors in a user friendly manner. Viewing stations and washrooms have been stategicly located. A great observation deck is located uptop.",
          "Impressive building from outside. The walk to the top is not a strenuous one and views at the top are nice though not spectacular. The library half way up had a special exhibition on space travel which was interesting.",
          "We could have gone up twice during our trip. It\u2019s inexpensive, central, has amazing views, and fun to walk. There are only stairs on the last part so the walk is easy up the ramp. It\u2019s very cool. All ages loved it.",
          "The ticket was rather cheap, less than 50 DKK if I recall it well. You get to have a beautiful view over the city from 41m and a really lovely exhibion about the moon and land on the moon missions. The tower is considered the oldest observatory in Europe, but if you want to",
          "This is, by far, the most important place to visit in Copenhagen. You'll easily locate it in Google maps. The top of the tower provides an overview of the city. On the way to the top there are 2 museums.",
          "located on a part of the walking street system this tower is a great way to see copenhagen from above. the interesting thing about it is that there is a \"road\" leading all the way up since a former king liked to visit thew place, but appearantly did not like stairs, so he went",
          "The views of Copenhagen from the Round Tower are very good ~ it's worth the trip up if time permits.",
          "The Tower is very central to town, the slope to the top is not too demanding. The Moon exhibition that was on when we visited was interesting. Good value for money. We were there for about 45 minutes.",
          "Amazing place! V surprising, incredible architecturally, amazing gallery too. Great visit, good value, highly unusual. Well worth a look.",
          "Only DKK25 to enter, sloped ramp up most of the way then steps for the last little bit, opening up to a viewing platform with splendid views over the city!",
          "I had read about the Tower in a guide book and had to go up to the top. There are things to look at on the way to the top too. The view at the top is great.",
          "Going to the top to see a 360 degree view of Copenhagen is a must. Excellent chance to see the city as long as the weather is clear. It\u2019s not too expensive and worth the climb.",
          "This building is so gorgeous \u2013 the sloped floors leading up to the top also give you an aerobic work out! The view from the top is a 360\u00b0 panoramic feast, complete with visual guides as to what you are looking at. Be sure to go to the very top and look at the inside of the",
          "This is free with the Copenhagen Card. The gentle spiraling cobblestone path is very wide. Apparently because a king wanted to ride his horse up to the top. So lucky for us, it is free of stairs for the most part and roomy. The final stretch of the climb is up narrow stairs,",
          "A very enjoyable experience with amazing views from the top. Also some fascinating things on the way up like the deep hole covered by glass and approached through a low narrow tunnel. Alarming if you don't know what to expect! But safe with a thick glass cover. This marks the",
          "No lifts but a round walk up to the top. Less part of the climb is up short steep flight of stairs. Offers a 360 view of copenhagen city.",
          "One of the stops along Kobmagergade should be the Rundetaarn. The tower is part of what is referred to as the Trinitatis Complex, the Copenhagen University Library and the Trinitatis Kirke being the other parts of the trinity. The Rundetaarn was built in the early 17th century,",
          "Round and round you go, up the round tower. Not a difficult climb, but not exciting either. Halfway up there are a couple of exhibit halls. We liked the exhibit on the space race. Once at the top (the final bit of climb is a narrow spiral staircase) there's a good view of the",
          "The tower is a good spot to see the city from above. Entry fee is very cheap and you can walk up in the tower nearly without any stairs (small spiral stairs at the very end of the tower to reach the platform) Good and freshly renovated toilets on two floors. Some additional",
          "You\u2019ll only need about half an hour here and the views from the top are worth it!! Gentle slope up to the top, but be warned there is a last tight spiral staircase that will test you!!!",
          "There is a wide cobbled spiralling path up this tower, with interesting side rooms to nip into. (Plenty of toilets, too --- a clear bonus for many of us.) We loved seeing kids enjoying the freedom to charge up and down and felt for the parents pushing prams up to the top! Don't",
          "This was an unusual way of getting a great view of the city. Very cheap to get in and once you reach the top. It gives you a fantastic view. We went on a clear day and could see a lot of the main buildings and even sweden. Nice thing to visit if you have the time and our nearby",
          "It has the Tetragrammaton on the building it is very inspiring to know there was a King who loved God\u2019s name it was nice to see the name of the true God. Beautiful history and architecture",
          "An easy walk up the tower - we were dreading more stairs, however it is a nice sloped internal walkway with just stairs at the top so not too hard on tired feet! Nice views from the top give you an appreciation and orientation for the layout of the city and how it has been",
          "Lovely design, especially the floor. Loved walking up the slope and enjoyed trying to spot different places using the plaques around the edge when we got to the top.",
          "It's an interesting round building, easily accessible to the roof where you can see the city from above. Observatory is open from 18.00 and it's defo worth a visit.",
          "Amazing experience, can't believe that they used to drive horse and carriages up the cobbled spiral tower.",
          "The price of the ticket is low, less than a bus ticket . The view is amazing, you can see all Copenhagen, and have an idea of it. Brace yourself to walk.",
          "It seemed like you were just going around in circles for a bit, but it's really a beautiful way to get up to the top. You have nice views when you finally get up there!",
          "Get your legs ready...quite a climb around the tower to get to the top! The stairs to the top were a bit narrow but well worth it! We heard this tower has some of the best views in the city and it didn\u2019t disappoint. Copenhagen doesn\u2019t really have a lot of tall buildings.",
          "The slope for going up is quite gentle and it does not require too much hard work to get up. Along the way, there is an art show and you can easily sit next to a window to rest and enjoy the view. Highly recommended.",
          "A unique experience - and a great view from the top. An easy walk. Wasn\u2019t at all busy when we visited",
          "This place is interesting as you make your way up to the top of the tower by walking in circles. and when you reach the top, it gives a nice picturesque view of the city.",
          "Having been to Copenhagen a number of times, we were looking for something different to do on this visit, and a trip up the Round Tower did the job. It is cheap, an easy walk up (except for the final few stairs) and some great views from the top. There are some other",
          "A quirky Seventeenth Century round tower with a hollow core and the equestrian staircase, it is well worth climbing to the top for the panoramic views over Copenhagen. A few more steps take you into the observatory at the top of the tower.",
          "Even though it is a very long way up, and the spiral just seems to keep going, it is a relatively easy incline. There is also a good number of windows to stop and take a break at if the need takes you. Wonderful view at the top and a toilet half way up! What more could you want?",
          "It only costs 25K, so very reasonable. the walk up is quite long so you need to be reasonably fit. There are stops on the way up and down with an interesting view of the original oak beams which was lovely",
          "Walking up the Round Tower isn't too difficult. The incline is gradual and wide. Except for the last bit where there are a few (maybe 20) narrow stairs with one way traffic. The views up top are great with 360 panoramas in all directions of Copenhagen. The only complaint is the",
          "Great views in this Tolkien-like round tower. Beware of the final stairs. Not for people with claustrofobia.",
          "The tower is in the city centre and it is possible to see a nice view of Copenhagen. The tower cost 25 DKK and it is easily accessible since there is a wide spiral without stairs until almost the rooftop. Only in the last part there are narrow stairs. When you are at the top,",
          "During a recent 4 day visit to Copenhagen with friends, my husband and I purchased the Copenhagen Card for the unlimited public transportation. We knew there were also a couple of sites we wanted to see that were included... but thanks to this Card, we got a chance to go into",
          "Modern cities could not build this today. Copenhagen have beautiful restored this historical treasure and opened up a very inexpensive way to look out over the city. Recommended",
          "Nice walk up to the top of this tower. The way up is formed as a path only at the very end there are a few stairs. The entrance fee is not expensive. Panoramic view on top. Was an unexpectedly nice surprise.",
          "This tower is attached to a church. The tower was built so that the king could ride in his carriage to the top. It does offer some views.",
          "I really enjoyed this site. The walk to the top was fun and views from top terrific. On the way to top they have arranged fun facts/stops along the way and intros of other ramp towers in Europe. Make time to see the church attached to the tower too.",
          "Interesting building with a unusual spiral ramp taking you up to a viewing platform and observatory. Sadly the observatory was closed but the view over the city was amazing. Well worth the trip up. At several points on the way up you an see into the church, the inner bell tower",
          "The interior is one big spiral ramp. At the very top are some stairs up to the telescope in the observatory. And the views from atop will reward your climb. Since it is do centrally located (Copenhagen center) it\u2019s worth the short visit. As an aside, it\u2019s along a quieter",
          "Worth a visit to get a good panorama of the city. Good signs at top to help orientate yourself. Definitely worth the effort",
          "It's not as hard as you may think, and its definitely worth it. Fantastic views at the top... Great to get an idea of your whereabouts in the city. You can see the Malmo bridge in the distance!",
          "Even though,reputedly,Norwegians have claimed tha<t they have towers much higher,and much rounder,back in Norway,this is still of interest.Supposedly,with the encircling sloping walk,you once could ride up to the vto on horseback.",
          "It is always one of those places that you almost have to tick off. It is very much worthwhile. It's not often you see a tower like this from the inside.. with the beautiful brickwork and slope that goes up to the top. It's rather enchanting. It does get rather busy with tourists",
          "Walked up the inside of this tower which is a ramp, rather than steps. Fabulous views all over Copenhagen from the viewing deck at the top. It\u2019s not too hard a walk up, and there are good clean toilets in there. Well worth a visit. Go into the attached church at ground level too",
          "Not only mounting this tour is a great experience, in the lower part no stairs and easy upward mounting, then at the top very narrow staircase opening up stunning views on the city. As Copenhagen is rather flat, you see a lot of the city.",
          "A really surreal place, your mind can\u2019t quick scope the way it\u2019s is made, would consider it a must visit. Also visit the church attached to it, it is beautiful",
          "This place is slap in the middle of the town centre, and you can find it easily, as it's the tallest building for miles. Interestingly, there are no stairs - it's one long spiral slope, all the way to the top. What's strange about this, is that it actually makes it easier to",
          "I went here using my Copenhagen card and was in and out within 30 mins. They have an art exhibition in there if you are into modern art. At the top is the observatory which you cannot enter (you view it from behind the bars).",
          "Quick and easy no fuss it's a slope from the bottom to the top apart from last steps which consists of only 20 to 30 steps to the open air outside. It's a wonderful view on Copenhagen centre.",
          "We new nothing of this very unusual tower until we saw it on the guide. There is a small charge but worth it. The gradual slopping floor surface is the only one of this type in the world! The construction is very unusual and free brochures to hand. Great alround views from the",
          "It is a great experience to walk up in this old tower. The view from the top is just great, The tower is situated in the old part of Copenhagen and it is a very interesting area and your can really feel the history!",
          "This is not stunning, and yet was one of our favorite adventures. It was fun to walk up the inclined interior brick road to the top. Again, the view is not breathtaking, but the history of the tower made up for it. Worth the small entry fee.",
          "Only 20 minutes to walk up a gradual large brick ramp. There is plenty of head space. Apparently, Peter The Great rode to the top on his horse! The viewing platform is spacious and has wonderful views of the city. There is even a fully functional toilet and sink part way up the",
          "Excellent value for money, quite a steep walk up to the very top but worth it if you are able to make it - lovely views over a beautiful city!",
          "You only need 20-30 mins for this, and it's pretty easy to climb as it's gentle slopes most of the way up. It's interesting to go to see, especially with its link to Brahe. The views at the top are worth it as well to get a good overview of the city.",
          "A tower with a difference. Theres some interesting history behind the towers development and reason behind its commission. It adds to what would otherwise be a labouring climb, worth it for the blustery views from the top!",
          "We enjoyed the walk up the spiral ramp to the top of this tower. The views of the city were beautiful. Highly recommended!!",
          "We hesitated walking up the tower but then decided to go for it. The ramp is a much better way to make your way up to the top and there were a few places to stop on the way up which made it even easier. The last bit up the narrow staircase is a bit of a pain as people are going",
          "Super cool tower in the centre, above a church. Amazing views, fun stuff inside and pretty cheap! Well worth a visit!",
          "Denmark is expensive so when you can get up the top of the tower for the same price as a Danish pastry it's a bargain! Definitely worth saving for a sunny day to get a great view of the city.",
          "This Round Tower was built by one of the Danish Kings so that he could ride his carriage up to the top and look out over Copenhagen. Worth the small admission price and the walk up. Great views of Copenhagen",
          "This is a must see and very close to the major shopping area in Copenhagen. For a small admission you can walk to the top of the tower on a circular carriage path until to reach the stairs. It is so unusual that it shout be seen. If you have walking difficulties at least see",
          "There are lots of stairs leading up to the observation area at the top. It is a little tiring but well worth the admission price for that view.",
          "Nothing special but when you reachthe top there is a stunning view.it might be difficult if there's too much people. But well worth visiting while in Copenhagen",
          "It's worth visiting the tower despite the expensive ticket and the uphill climb (no elevator or stairs, you just walk round and round inside the building). It's a nice experience though. The view on top is amazing.",
          "We used our Copenhagen cards to get into the Round Tower for free. It\u2019s certainly an interesting concept- having a tower that you can ride a horse up! The last tiny bit was steps, but literally only a few. I\u2019m relatively unfit and managed this- there are places to rest along the",
          "Unlike most towers, the Round Tower is a wide circular ramp leading to the viewing platform where one may get a complete view of the city. The entry is not expensive and is covered by one of those museum cards. One can go as fast or as slow as one wants to reach the top as",
          "It is a funny experience to walk in circles to come up to the tower. Rundetarn (Round Tower) doesnt have stairs. It has a nice view of Copenhagen from the top, There was also an art gallery. It definitely worth to visit.",
          "We visited the round tower as we thought it was a must do in Copenhagen and we were not disappointed. The walk up the ramp is easy until you get to a steep and narrow spiral staircase where people are coming up and down at the same time so it can get quite busy and you have to",
          "Good fun attraction for families. We arrived at opening time so had a clear run up to the top. Our two boys enjoyed following this unique spiral around, exploring the nooks and crannies, and of course the view from the top. Good for energetic little ones, and pretty manageable",
          "The tower is pretty nice in itself, but the best part is probably the view over the central Copenhagen. Inside the tower there are two floors of exhibisions, during our visit one was arcitecturral designs in circles.",
          "I only cost about 3 dollars American to enter this cool structure, or it is included with the Copenhagen card. The spiraling ramp takes you to the top for some great views of the city. There are a couple small museums on the way up as well. Its not far from Rosenborg Castle.",
          "After seeing this on a tv programme about Copenhagen, we added this to our must-visit list and we were not disappointed. We had Copenhagen cards so I'm not sure what the cost would normally be but I would recommend a visit regardless. The walk up the spiral ramp is easy and",
          "Sometimes when you visit a city you just need to say I did that. Felt this was one because of its historical significance and uniqueness. You can take your time as you go round and round the tower, and then at the top you are rewarded with a great view.",
          "After viewing photos of this I decided to see for myself and perhaps do some photography. It is an amazing structure and the photography is awesome, highly recommend even if not a photographer. We had a Copenhagen card so not sure how much it costs but worth it. There is a",
          "This is a unique experience going around and upwards on this spiral ramp seven and half times\u2014over 120 feet. The cylindrical tower has a walkway wide enough to fit a large horse carriage as intended. The walkway comes to an end where you have to climb up some very narrow",
          "Built by Christian IV, almost bankrupted Copenhagen, but Happy he went ahead. It was built as an Observatory in the 17th century. You should be in good shape, and have good knees, its a long way up, but worth the pain! Its on K\u00f8bmagergade , (Merchants street) ca 5-10 minute walk",
          "The easy walk up to the top of the tower is well worth the effort. Only at the top there are some narrow steps. On the top you can see most of the city with descriptions of what you see. Very good!",
          "Lovely place with a nice view. No steps \ud83d\ude42 good idea. The tower is really nice. On the top is a small shop for the turist where you can buy souveniers or something for drink.",
          "Nice easy smooth climb, interesting displays on the floors on the way up. Free with Copenhagen Card. On sunday until 4pm access to the observatory. The tower was part of the old University and the obsevatory was used for that purpose. The kind gentlemen will answer questions if",
          "This is unlike anything I've seen elsewhere, a spiral ramp winding to the top and a gorgeous 360 degree view. All kids love running up and down ramps, and there are little cubby holes to hide in along the way. It's not too strenuous to get to the top and the view is beautiful",
          "This is a pleasant enough tower to climb, and quite family friendly with not too many steps yet offering decent views. Worth a visit.",
          "Take a run up the round tower and enjoy the view from the top. Another of Christian the Fourth\u2019s buildings, this one was allegedly to impress the Russian tsar, as Chr. 4 could ride up to the top on his horse (though he would have benefited from the exercise by walking \ud83d\ude2c)",
          "Glad I was able to visit this tower. King Christian the 4th was a man ahead of his time and he knew who was behind all his great works.",
          "The unusual feature of the tower is it's broad helical walkway to the top (almost, as there are a few steps to complete the ascent). On the way up is a view into the church, an exhibition room (on my visit housing an impressive artwork), cafe and toilets. Exiting onto the",
          "Kids had fun walking to the top of the round tower in Copenhagen. Great view from the top, and some interesting information and displays within the tower.",
          "Just unusual structure inside. Easy to walk, even carriages could earlier make it. On the other hand nothing special.",
          "Loved it, except for the spiral staircase at the end that's a bit too tight for two opposing streams of people Great view from the top and easy on the knees whist climbing the ramp up, because of the low nature of Copenhagen the view from the top is special, would recommend",
          "This 17th century round tower is the oldest functioning observatory in Europe. We payed $25 Kroner (apparently free with a Copenhagen Card). The spiral walkway leads you up to the view (36 meters up). Not the best city for panoramics but at least you're not taking pics through",
          "Quite a climb, but worth it. Offers a viewing platform at the top with a sweeping view. The first part of the climb up is a unusually wide and easy ramp - it was built to accommodate horses to carry heavy loads up. Where visited on a Sunday in July, and got a change to take a",
          "It's a good climb up the tower, but well worth the view of Copenhagen! Walking up the tower it's an incline, and then there are very narrow stairs towards the top. There is an elevator for those with disabilities. There's a snack bar and small gift shop at the top , as well.",
          "Took a half hour excursion up the tower when my family members were busy shopping nearby. Kind on my knees (few stairs) and quite a bit of fun to go round and round and all the way up to the top where one could get a pretty decent view of the city. One of the cheaper",
          "Walking up Rundetaarn is a great way to spend half an hour if you\u2019ve got the time. It gives you great views of the city in all directions - on clear days the views are immense and you feel like you can see all of Copenhagen!! (But be warned there is a very tall fancy that kind",
          "If you wanna take whole entire city view the round tower is the best way. Might be a bit of walk to the observatory space from the ground but one your way you can also enjoy taking some photos at photo spot.",
          "Pretty cool to walk up there, entrance was like 5 euros per person. Then you climb the tower which is not that steap, which gives a nice view over the city",
          "This is well worth the walk up to see the amazing views arounf the city! Its flat surface you walk right until last part and there are some very narrow steps to climb - they say its 2 way but I would advise 1 way as they are very narrow at 1 side!",
          "The walk up Rundet\u00e5rn is quite easy, as it is a spiral ramp that is quite wide. Up on the viewing deck, you have nice views over the city. The telescope upstairs is in action on Sundays, when experts explain it. At the time of our visit, it was, however, only aimed at Our",
          "Inexpensive 30 minutes. Walk up to the top. No stairs but a cobblestone road all the way to the top. Great views of the city. The kids love it. A true cardiac event. Enjoy",
          "Rundetarn was built as an observatory and the story of the internal 'road' that climbs story by story varies, but both versions are viable. It was either to haul equipment to the top by horse, or, the person to built it needed to ascend by horse as he was not able to. Most",
          "It\u2019s a 30 minute stop. The tower has no stairs. You walk on a ramp all the way to the top. There\u2019s only a round staircase at the very top. A little tight if there are people going in both directions but is only a few steps (I\u2019d guess 20-30 steps). We did it on a Sunday",
          "At 30Dkr entrance I would say this is a must see. Walk up the tiled spiral walkway to the top of the tower. There\u2019s a stop on the way up where you can see exhibitions or use the toilets in the ticket price. A little further up theres a doorway in to the center hub of the tower.",
          "It's a six storey or so brick tower with an internal sloping walkway - imagine the NYC Guggenheim, only with no central void, no skylight and no art - so basically a folly. It's accessible and a bit odd, but that's about it. The view is unremarkable; there's nothing to spark",
          "Included in our Copenhagen card but not expensive if you buy a ticket once there. Great view of the city, and such an interesting building to walk up to the top!",
          "If you want to get the best view over Copenhagen Rundetaan is a must see on a clear day you can see far away",
          "For little money you get a great 360\u00b0 view of Copenhagen accompanied by history and art (there are exhibitions in the old library). The way up is nearly stairless (it is a foot path with 7 1/2 rotations) except for the last bit. To get to the outdoor viewing platform you have to",

          "The tower is in the very heart of Copenhagen, the ticket is quite cheap, especially if compared with the general prices in town. The view is quite nice, even if the tower is not too tall. It's worth a visit!",
          "Great view of the city ...a little bit of a climb. Well worth the effort. Little bits of information about the tower as you go up. Lots of history.",
          "The round tower is a good and cheep way to experience the whole city from a high level. It costs 25 Danish crowns and after a 5 minute walk you are in the top of the tower. From there you can see the whole Copenhagen and its beautiful architecture.",
          "This historic building has been a distinctive feature of Copenhagen's skyline since 1642. It has a lookout tower and observatory. There is a charge so I did not go up",
          "We followed the ascending slope all the way to the top, viewing the rooms en route. We then climbed the stairs ... quite narrow to the roof top and enjoyed the splendid views across Copenhagen. We could even see Sweden and the bridge.",
          "We got here right when it opened at 10AM and had a spectacular view of the city from the top of the tower. The tower also has a small art exhibit which is worth seeing as well. This a perfect way to start your day of sightseeing in Copenhagen.",
          "Set on a busy shopping route, this gem is has a spiral ramp which takes you to the top from where you get super views of the whole area. It costs just 25 DKK to enter (or around \u00a33).",
          "A steep but rewarding walk up the Rundetarn ... no steps but uneven cobbles (not ideal for elderly or disabled), it's fascinating to see how the tower is constructed (was an observatory originally) there is a viewing platform at the top which gives great views over Copenhagen",
          "Great viewing point and interesting art exhibit too. Walk up slope, then steps, then narrow steps so difficult for anyone with poor mobility. The view from the top is great, all round Copenhagen, so well worth the trek.",
          "In the middle of the city, hundred yards or so from famous Walking Street. Beautiful view of the city from the top.",
          "On the face of it this place doesn't seem that interesting. A tower with no steps so some rich guy could ride his horse to the top to look at the starts but we really enjoyed it!! The walk up was easy. Anybody can go at any pace they want and there are no steps so it's better",

I love to walk to the top. Yup it\u2019s ramped rather than stepped \ud83d\udd06 and just sit for a bit and",
          "It\u2019s worth reading about the history of this 17th Century Tower before you visit. Unlike most European towers that I have climbed, this one has a brick floored ramp almost as far as the top (wide enough for a horse and cart) But If you want to see the panoramic views of the",
          "It's a good walk to the top but we haven't seen another tower as well kept as this after 400 years. Walk steadily and the 9+ one stories go quickly. It is not stairs but a wide, curving walkway. The 360 degree view of Copenhagen was worth the walk, but the open arches were",

          "Definitely worth the walk up! The space is serene and welcoming. And the views from the top are amazing. So glad we added this to our Copenhagen bucket list.",
          "This is an easy climb because of the circular path rather than steps which provide the great reward on top. It\u2019s a bit tight on the narrow staircase leading to observatory as you take turns for traffic. Part way up was an art exhibition worth the visit and also another area",

          "The Round Tower is an absolutly easy and cheap (25 DKK) way to gain a wonderful view of the city. Except the very last bit, there are no stairs to be climbed. A king built this observatory and he made sure that a horse-drawn carriage could bring him up the tower. So the way up",
          "It was well worth going up the round tower, there are things to see on the way up, like the Old Privy and the central cavity. There is a great view from the top and the planetarium round the corner at the top which is worth a look.",
          "This was the first place we visited when we arrived in Copenhagen. My 4 year old had a blast going up the never-ending ramp and hiding from his mom in the many different alcoves. Wonderful views of the city from the top-- great way to start getting oriented with the city upon",

          "It is a historical landmark with a good story behind it. The exhibitions that are inside are better than structure. You will get a great view of the city from the top but you are going to have to walk up there.",
          "I really enjoyed the walk up the tower. It has a unique design, and there were points of interest along the way. There was also an art exhibition for us to walk around (and take a break from walking up!) The view was beautiful once we got to the top, and we stayed up for a while",
          "It\u00b4s rather easy to walk up, there are no steps but just gentle way up. Take your time and see all the fun little things on the way to the top. There are cool little info leaflets on the way, take them and read about. There is sightseeing plattform on the top giving 360 view of",
          "We were walking around town and came upon this fun find! No stairs--which is awesome--but rather a circular walkway/incline all the way to almost the top. Then there's about 20-30 steps? It doesn't matter because the view at the top is lovely. Has bathrooms, too!",
          "Definitely a worthwhile site to visit in Copenhagen. This is a tower climb unlike any other that I've tried - a unique circular walkway nearly all the way up rather than stairs, and relatively speaking much easier to tackle. The climb itself would be worth it for the visit, an",
          "The best view in the city! of Copenhagen Well worth the walk up, which is fun and easy, albeit a steady incline with stairs at the end. Take notice of the historical notations along the way and peek in the bell tower. A great way to orient yourself to the layout of the city",
          "Easy to visit, nice view all Copenhagen. Surprising to see strong relation with astronomy in these years (17th Century). Must take photos in helical corridor :-)",
          "From the top of the Round Tower, you get a Panoramic View of the City. The tower was built by King Christian the 4th. There is a path up to the top that was built so he could ride up in his horse and carriage. It is connected to the beautiful church next door where there are",
          "RundeT\u00e5rn was in the old days a observatorium for People to study the planets and the stars and Also to Keep a eye on town. The tower is located just by the local shopping street \"str\u00f8get\" It cost 25 dansish kr to get up in the tower for an adult, 5 kr for children. There is no",
          "It\u2019s an easy walk up a broad circular ramp until the last set of stairs one more level up. There are windows all the way up with seats so you can look out in all directions as you go. At the top you get a rooftop view of the city and can orient yourself to all the landmarks.",
          "This iconic building has few surprises. The way up is quite easy except for the last 20 - 30 very narrow steps. Half way up is the old library with seasonal exhibitions. Currently interesting tapestry. The core has been opened and you can see the foundations through see through",
          "A nice walk for a small fee to the top. Not strenuous for young and old. There are places to sit along the way up if you get tired. There\u2019s a fabric art display on the way up as well.",
          "The tower itself is somewhat interesting but the best part is the view from the top. The walk up is circular & steady. The information at the top let's you know what you are seeing.",
          "A hidden gem. Nice steady walk to the top for a great view even though it was freezing cold at the top. Good couple of exhibitions to see on the way up. Very good value for money",
          "Located near the university, the Round Tower is not exactly round, but the walkway up certainly is and it offers some interesting views over the city from the top. Personally, I preferred the views from the tower at Christiansborg. It opens at 10:00am, but there are numerous",
          "Centrally located and offers a good view in all directions. Map sketches put up on the viewing platform are helpful to know the names of the sights and orient oneself.",
          "The tower has no stairs, its a ramp that leads up to the top, the last bit though are stairs... There is no students discount... but the price is okay with 25Krones. There are also washrooms in the tower to use. There are art exhibisions you can take a look at as well.",
          "Easy walk up a winding hill instead of stairs. Great views of the city at the top for the low price of 25 DKK per person.",
          "The Round Tower is such a beautiful building with an even more beautiful lookout with great city views from the top. Even though it's just a simple \"round\" building where you basically walk in circles to get to the top (this is more fun than it sounds!), once you get to the top",
          "We really loved this-- its so interesting and unique! The spiralling ramp which takes you all the way to the top is a great experience. The views from the top are also lovely! Its very cheap and I would recommend.",
          "Unique and Instagram-worthy Easy to walk up even with a stroller My boy enjoyed running up and down.. Great views from the top. Very reasonable entry prices!",
          "Wow, what a joy. Wide accessible easy to walk up, and down, tower. It's fun, beautiful, historic and definitely worth visiting. We saw a temporary exhibition half way up, some walked right past which is a shame, it was great. Also don't miss the tiny glass 'hole, you can go in",
          "Stroll through the easy path going up. Also the children liked it. You can hide in the small caves and surprise your sister.",
          "Not expensive - 25DK pp to climb the 8 (i think!) rotations up to the viewing platform (outside, no cover). Most of the climb is flat, spiralling walkway but there are a couple of short stair climbs at the very top out on to the viewing platform. Cool on a breezy day. Fantastic",
          "This was fun and well priced.Toilets are available.Would be difficult for anyone with mobility issues.The view was amazing.",
          "The round tower was built in the early 17th century by King Christian IV and actually remains a functioning observatory - the observatory at the very top of the tower is not actually accessible most of the times. You walk to the top not by taking stairs, but up a 270 meter or so",
          "This is a must see. It is an easy walk up and only gets a bit challenging at the top with the narrow and steep stairs to get to the observatory. I am not a fit person, but this was not that hard to climb, so please don't let people deter you. For most of the walk up the tower",
          "We visited the tower around sunset and although it gets very windy (went in April) up there we enjoyed the amazing view. The climb may seem easy at first, but when you arrive at the narrow stairs it can be difficult as it is used both ways, up and down, at the same time.",
          "It was my second visit and I am sure that it was not the last one. Very centrical, few minute walk from N\u00f8rreport metro station and very nice view - Copenhagen in 360 degrees. Last time I was lucky that the astronomy observatory was open too but today it was closed. There is a",
          "This is by far the easiest tower to climb ever. The steady slope allows people with mobility issues access to the first viewpoint. The very top part, is a spiral and it says access up and down together, but no way my feet would fit on the narrowest part. I think that is quite",
          "If you are not physically fit, then this is a pass. Once inside the entrance way there is a spiral incline up to a narrow set of stairs which is extremely congested due to its limited space. If you make it, there is a nice view of Copehagen, however, I am not sure if it is",
          "Worth the walk up the spiral ramp for the views, and an interesting gallery on the way back down. Maybe they could introduce a traffic-light system on the little staircase at the top?",
          "This lovely building provides a panoramic view of the city even for those who don\u2019t like heights. The entrance fee is nominal and well worth the view from the top. There are no steps you simply brace yourself for the wide gradient and up you go. Along the way there are resting",
          "Came here as it was free on our Copenhagen card and we were passing. Definitely with the climb up to see the observatory at the top. To enter you climb a steady ramp. There are various stopping points on the way up, as well as a cafe and toilets. Great views from the top!",
          "Not the most enthralling if viewing decks, but nice in its own way. The views over Copenhagen are sort of boring compared to other cities, but nice nonetheless",
          "It's a tower that has almost no stairs at the beginning. It's something different. The views up are also cool!",
          "At only 25dkk to get in, this is a bargain. The tower is in the middle of the city and inside there is a long, wide spiral walkway that is very easy to walk up. At the top there is a short spiral staircase to reach the roof. Wonderful views fruition the roof of the city. I",
          "As with most areas of interest around Copenhagen, it\u2019s not exactly the best, tallest tower you\u2019ll climb in a city but it\u2019s certainly interesting. Most of the climb is done via a gradual sloping spiral, only towards the top will you encounter steps. The final few are quite",
          "The entrance is 25kr for adults and 5kr for kids - very cheap. The view from the top is always fantastic.",
          "My daughter and I went up to the tower and we enyoyed it. We we're also able to join the activity where we can build our own tower. The crews facilitating the \"build like a king\" activity we're all very nice and helpful. The only downside was the last stairs going up the actual",
          "I always try to find the views when visiting new cities/places. This was the one for Copenhagen and you can practically see the whole downtown, since there aren't that high buildings there. I always admire the workmanship put into building these kind of places - in this case it",
          "I guess this really is a gem in Kopenhagen and a must see! We found it only by mistake one night and sheduled it for our next day. Its pretty nice walking up and the view over the city is fantastiv from above!",
          "The Round Tower is a very interesting building in Copenhagen. Built originally as an astronomy tower the views from the top are really beautiful. The walk up isn't too demanding as you're walking up a constant slope. There are some stairs at the top, but again, not bad at all.",
          "This is a nice point of view only it\u2019s not that high compared to many other things around the world. But what it has going for it. Is the fact that it\u2019s authentic and was built by the king of Denmark, back in the days. So it\u2019s a tower with a lot of history. Also it\u2019s a Journey",
          "Rundet\u00e5rn is definitely worth a visit, when you get to Copenhagen. It's a lot of fun running up and down the spiral hall, and enjoying the view from the top! The reason it being a 4 star review, is because there is nothing more to see, than the actual view and the enjoyment from",
          "This place was awesome - loved the ramp to walk up to the top. Made the climb easy! Easily accessible right down town - don\u2019t miss this!",
          "One of the most enjoyable things we did in Copenhagen and a definite recommendation. The signage about opening times was a bit misleading as it said open From Thursday to Monday and we wanted to go in on Wednesday. But this could have been for the exhibition. This wasn\u2019t a",
          "Nice small experience. Very nice 360 degrees view from the top. Go especially if you have free entrance by Copenhagen card.",
          "A wide spiral ramp takes you up through the tower to beautiful views of Copenhagen. It's a simple pleasure but fun and is always a joy to visit.",
          "This tower it\u2019s located just in the middle of Copenhagen, just in the end of their famous shopping street. On the top it\u2019s old observatory and also nice view on the city. The best it\u2019s there are no stairs to get up, only uphill - if I remember correctly it\u2019s 7.5 times around to",
          "It worth visiting and the price just perfect to see from the top of the tower. I just love it the interior stairs corridor and will recommend to visit. Interesting also for the history of this tower.",
          "The Round Tower is a great sight to visit. Do not be intimidated by the crowd. You can still take great pictures and not feel overwhelmed. The way to the top is very easy and totally worth it once you are up. Along the way you can check various hidden rooms around the tower.",
          "Lovely walk/climb up the tower. Thankfully no steps, so anyone could manage the climb to the top. Toilets half way up. Copenhagen is great for facilities!! Lol View is stunning from the top.",
          "I really enjoyed climbing the Round Tower and the view that you were rewarded with! The journey to the top consists of a moderately steep spiral that probably takes less than 5 minutes with some stairs at the end. Suitable for children and parents with strollers/buggies. The",
          "Our children enjoyed the long winding road to the top of the tower. Getting to know the story behind the building was very interesting - obviously christian 4th didn\u2019t enjoy walking \ud83d\ude09",
          "Great vantage point if you're looking for some city pictures. The tower looks high but the walk up is not as gruelling as the church in Bruge. ! The way to the top is a spiral slope which makes climbing the tower much easier. Along the way you can stop and rest and visit some",
          "A fantastic tour with a fantastic exhibition in the middle on the way - we came only for the exhibition, but found it really easy to go all the way to the top :-) excellent",
          "Paid just under \u00a33 to see some great views across Copenhagen. Not as high as Saviours Church, but it has a proper viewing deck at the top.",
          "One gets a breathtaking view of the City atop the Tower. There are sitting areas at the top, around the observatory, but one wouldn't wish to sit as the excitement doesn't let one! One can spot some of the main attractions from the balcony. On the way to the top, there are no",
          "We visited the round tower on a Tuesday night (when the observatory is open) and we were lucky: there was a full moon! The view through the telescope was amazing, I can't even begin to describe the zoomed-in view. The round tower itself is very nice to visit no matter if the",
          "Situated amongst the shops of Copenhagen the Tower provides an opportunity to get a 360 view from above the rooftops, and is a good opportunity for those panoramic shots of the city skyline. It costs about \u00a33 to enter, and the walk up to the top is easy thanks to the not to",
          "I had left this tower till last. I used my COP card to get in so not sure how much it costed. Its a nice wide area to take your time walking up. Stopping to look out of the winds as you go. There is a couple of places you can stop off at. The bell tower with is above the church",
          "The entrance fee was very inexpensive and the building's architecture is wonderful. Other than the central column, the entire tower is one big spiral slope. There's a beautiful view into the attached church (Trinitatis Church) near the bottom of the slope. There's also access",
          "Lovely view of Copenhagen. Easy walk in historic area. This is something no tourist should miss in Copenhagen",
          "The Round Tower is a really interesting place to visit. It\u2019s one of Copenhagen\u2019s best known structures and it does get really busy at certain times. Admission is 25Kr (about \u00a32.80) and the opening times are 10am to 8pm daily 1st May to 30th Sept and 10am to 6pm 1st Oct to \u00a30th",
          "Pay a visit to the tower of Rundetaarn near the mall in Copenhagen. This old tower has access to a great view and as a newer thing an observatory that is open sometimes in the evening. It was built by king Christian the 4th. Go inside and take a look at the city on the way. A",
          "A great tower - the inside gently slopes upwards with some steps at the top. Very manageable and lovely views from the top.",
          "The Rundetarn is definitely worth a visit. The walk up to the top of the tower is fairly easy for most except a very narrow stairway towards the top. If you are tired during the walk up, there are many pockets of resting areas next to the windows.",
          "An excellent place to get a bird's eye view of the city. The interior is entirely sloped (apart from a short flight of stairs to the viewing platform) and it's organic form takes you up gently, passing windows out and features to see en route. These all have informative leaflets",
          "this is a slope rather than stairs until the very top there are a few so it is easy to get to the top.",
          "This is a wonderful historic tower. The circular walk to the top will definitely work your quads, so do be prepared for the climb. Our favourite part of this was actually the art gallery on the second \"level\" so don't forget to pop inside!",
          "We went to see this site even though it was pouring rain. Surprisingly this was a good activity in the wet & it was an easy walk to the top since there isn't many stairs. And you get a great view of Copenhagen CBD. If you have some spare time make the effort to visit.",
          "The architecture and history of the Round Tower make it a worthwhile stop when on a walking tour of Copenhagen. The tower is made of brick and spirals up around a hollow core. There are several interesting stops as you make seven and a half revolutions on the way to the top",
          "Great views of the city and cheap entry (25DKK or free with Copenhagen card) - what else do you need to know?",
          "Cant believe i did this. 36m high but spectacular views from the viewing ledge. Very popular attraction. 25Dkk per person. \u00a33 each. It's a novel way of getting up there round a spiral walkway....the only stairs are right at the top and not too many. Give it a go. Well worth",
          "The circular nature of this building is a novelty and it makes the climb to the top a gentle walk with nice views across the city on the way up. Just be careful as the last little bit is via a very narrow stair case and this can be difficult to navigate if you are prone to",
          "The round tower is in the middle of Copenhagen, not too expensive (25 dkk a person I believe) and you have an amazing view, as well as the fact that you get some insight in the danish history due to the exhibition area. In the top is a planetarium that is really cool as well.",
          "As expected, a great view from the top. On the way up you can stop off at an art exhibition and the obligatory shop (couldn\u2019t resist buying a pencil with a gold crown in the top). Fab little alcoves on the way up and at one stop you can look through a glass floor with a view",
          "In the tower there was a temporary exhibition of amazing pictures, the tower itself is not that spectacular but on a sunny day it can give you a nice view over the city. Relatively cheap to visit",
          "Soaring more than 110' above the streets of Copenhagen, the almost 400 years old Rundetarn is a fun way to learn about the city and see its sights from above. The angle of the ramp is not steep and rather easy to ascend. The numerous windows allow you to look over Copenhagen",
          "Entry isn\u2019t expensive and it only takes 10 mins to get to the top of the tower. There\u2019s an art gallery half way up if you need a break (and to warm up if you\u2019re visiting during a cold season). The views get better as you head up. The last part is quite a few steep stairs so",
          "Interesting design with superb gallery housed within the circular building. A need to visit venue to check out the way the structure was so well constructed.",
          "This towere is definitely worth a visit as it gives you great views over the city and the best part is there are no stairs in it, its just a ramp all the way to the top",
          "I somewhat knew what to expect and well, it was what I expected..The view is lovely from the top to but it isnt easy to get up and down the stairs when everyone else is trying to at the same time so if you plan to visit keep that in mind, also if like us you have had a busy day",
          "Beside the undisputable historic and architectural value of the Tower, I do value this place as a must see if there is time for it. It is a place that has a really great view from above of Copenhagen, it is an observatory place and it is used as astronomical observation place,",
          "The tower is looks really nice. The circular ramp goes up fully.. And after you reach the top the view is just mind-blowing.... It's free through Copenhagen card.. There is a hollow column inside.. You must stand on the glass of that hollow column...",
          "Nice little extra place to visit whilst in the city!..and not too expensive either like most other tourist attractions! Impressive views across Copenhagen when up at the top!",
          "This was a cheap and interesting way to look over Copenhagen. It was about \u00a33 and you walk around a spiral ramp before you get to the top where the old observatory is. Really worthwhile and an easy way to get to a high spot.",
          "Worth a visit! 25kr per person (adult). Easy to walk up due to no stairs! Views are great on a clear day!",
          "What a beautiful both inside and out. Entry 25 Krona for adult, 5 for child. There is a sloping ramp taking you 7 and a half times around the building to the stairs taking you to the top. There is a narrow spiral staircase (short) to take you to the viewing platform. En route",
          "Archimedes screw in the middle of Copenhagen . i had too see this one . a \"round \"tower that encompasses 7.5 turns ( like a cork screw ) straight to the top some plus some stairs to take you outside to the viewing gallery . easy walk and different Well worth it",
          "2nd visit and still fabulous. What an amazing site. Take a steady walk up the ramp to the top. There are no stairs until the top as horses were ridden up \ud83d\ude01. Just a great high rise view of Copenhagen from the top of an historic city observatory. Best of all it\u2019s surrounded by",
          "Beautifully maintained building, with great views of Copenhagen. Don't forget the little chamber (half-way up ((ish)) that allows you to see through a glass floor down the inside of the tower.",
          "Really worth walking up this tower. is 25DKK entry and altho a good few floors up, the sloped way makes it much easier. Fantastic views across the city, and the tower is so central you'd be foolish not to go up :)",
          "Walked passed it so many times, but went in this time. Kind of surpriced by the ticket price, 25dkk for adult, 5dkk (!) for the 15yr old - in a good way! Everything so \"clean\" and nice, the way up, the gallery midway - and then the view, even on the rainy day, beatiful!",
          "Without doubt this was my favourite place in all of Copenhagen. Absolutely stunning inside and a fantastic view from the top.",
          "The tower is a modest climb, but the 360 view at the top is worth it. You are well above most of old Copenhagen. We were there on a sunny day and could see Sweden across the water. There is plenty room at the top. The gallery on the way up was a worthy stop as well.",
          "You will have seen this in everybody's photos - and it's pretty much what you expect. Nice experience to walk up with some interesting information as you go. It was a cloudy day so our view wasn't amazing but I can imagine it being great on a nice day. The gallery half way up",
          "When the weather is good then it's will be a good time for a visit Rundet\u00e5rn a lot of history from this old tower, and the weiw from the top is great u can see most of Copenhagen.",
          "Good experience, the oldest Observatory that is still functional in Europe. This would probably not be for someone who has limited mobility (leg or back problems) but it is interesting and it's true- it's straight up to the top, no stairs- until you get to the top, to see the",
          "Enjoyed the walk to the top, took it slow though!! Interesting art exhibition on way up. Wonderful views of the city and great opportunity for some photos, recommended.",

          "We visited the round tower which is really quite cool and it is joined onto a church. Quite a hike to get to the top but it is a nice view once you are there.",
          "It's an interesting tower to climb as it has no steps. There is a room which hosts exhibitions. There are some information boards on the way up (or down). At the top, you get a good view on the city. It's totally worth the price!",
          "A nice place to visit with good views of Copenhagen. The glass floor in the middle of the tower is terrifying, but a good feature nonetheless.",
          "We entered with our Copenhagen cards. Very nice visit quick visit to the top of the tower. Not for the faint hearted as there is no lift! Lovely exhibition space which could easily be used for talks and parties. Would recommend not going on a windy day! Picture is view from top",
          "You don't need to worry about the endless stairs to climb up for a good view in this tower. There's no stairs. Just a smooth curved pathway to go up. Only a few stair steps on the very top end.",
          "Nice place to view city from the top and make some pictures. But better if you visit it in nice weather.",
          "We used our Copenhagen cards here, walk up the windy path to the top of the tower. You will then climb the steps to get a full panoramic view of the city.",
          "The spiraling climb upto the rooftop, the narrow stairs to reach the astronomical telescope, the city scape view from top, the gift shop & cafe... we loved it all.",
          "Bang in the city centre and only 2.50 Krona as far as I can remember to walk to the top of the tower for fantastic views over Copenhagen and beyond. Interesting building in it\u2019s own right. No steps but a winding ramp big enough to take a car....",
          "Follow the round walkway to the top for the beautiful scenery of the city. Many photo opportunities.Lots of history plus a gift shop",
          "All should visit this place you can understand how the government maintain the old structure which mingles with the new development.",
          "This was one of my favourite places in Copenhagen. It's beautiful, and walking up the spiral ramp was so much fun. It was very informative and loved to see everything they've preserved. Even the view from the top of the tower was fantastic.",
          "The building itself is really beautiful and the history interesting. An easy walk to the top, which is great for someone like me who doesn't like heights, but it felt like a stroll. What is best though is the surrounding area too, the shops and library all fantastic to look at",
          "Interesting Tower to climb with a spiral walkway all the way to the top which has great views over Copenhagen. There was a jewellery exhibition on half way up that had some lovely pieces on display. Small fee for entry but worth it to see the novel tower and views",
          "As someone with no head for heights and an aversion to spiral staircases this was something of a breeze. The spiral stairs have been replaced with a ramp making it easy peasy lemon squeezy! There are exhibition spaces on the way up as well as lavatories. The views from the",
          "This is a must do activity whether winter or summer - take time to read the history of this building, walk up to the top... you might need a wee break to catch your breath along the way, but the views from the top are beautiful you see Copenhagen spread out all below you, it",
          "Very inexpensive visit. Good to learn the history and great views over the city. Would highly recommend",
          "This round tour was a surprise as had expected hundreds of steps all the way up, but instead there was a moderate slope all the way to the top with little interesting side rooms all the way up - such as a glass floored observation room, the observatory right at the top.",
          "Defiantly worth a trip to the tower, entry is included in the Copenhagen card and the towers opens about 10am each day. The access is easy as the tower just spirals upwards with just a few steps at the very top to get to the viewing platform. The views over the city are",
          "A large round tower in Copenhagen city centre, small entry fee. Walk to the top the sloped floor takes you up a bit like walking up a helter skelter then a few steps takes you to the top for great views across the city. Worth a visit.",

          "Impressive tower! A long walk up, but worth it. The details are amazing, and the old carved signatures in the windows are interesting. Fun to imagine that people used to ride horses up the tower. The art exhibition was interesting.",
          "Amazing ascent - no stairs just walk round and round. Views for miles at the top and just breathtakingly pretty",
          "This is a tower to go up and see the view from the top but it does not have stairs you just walk up a gentle slope made from cobbles inside a tower there are also Loos and a museum inside the roof of the building it is joined to which happens to be a church. This is such great",

          "Yes, it is cheap and has good view once on top. But no information about the building, when built, what used for, why there is a ramp, etc. Had to look it all up on internet. So realize you are just paying to go up to top of tower.",
          "I don't have much to add to what people have already said, which is that it's an inexpensive and fun thing to do. Only a few steps to climb, but mostly a manageable and steady incline, with toilet halfway up, and a lovely view when you reach the peak.",
          "So this place is very well known to Danish people and build by Christian the 4th and is one of the highest buildings in Copenhagen. This gives a fantastic view of the City. Its spectacular because there is no stairs expect at the very top. The church Trinitatis is part of the",
          "I was here in August of 2006. The way to get to the top of the Round Tower is up a spiral set of stairs in this almost Medieval type building, which seem to go on forever. It's really nice once at the top, as the views are really good. Plus, it's good exercise.",

          "An icon at the city centre, this Round Tower (or Rundetaarn) stands gallantly at the city centre of Copenhagen. Start with a long history as an astronomical observatory, the oldest one in Europe, built in early 17th century by King Christian IV of Denmark, changed from scientist",

          "Arrive early in the day, as the queues are long & move quite slowly. Oddly, the view from the top is the same as the view from Magasin 5th floor bathroom! Still worth it.",
          "The old privy, the planetarium, the spiral staircase, the rooftop are just a few things one could see when visiting the Rundetaarn. There was a beautiful exhibition of jewelry artworks half way to the top, which was an even more important space than ever as you could warm up",
          "Very central to get to, it\u2019s an easy walk to the top, mostly up a graded ramp with steps near the top. Good views.",
          "We by chance decided to ascend up to the tower after a coffee in nearby Studenterhuset (which we recommend for a relaxed atmosphere). Certainly worth the 50kr for the views alone for the 2 of us, if you go on a Tuesday or Wednesday on evening we discovered you can also get in",

          "High-rise buildings are few and far between in Copenhagen, so the Rundetaarn gives you one of the few publicly available views over the city skyline. The history of the facility as an early astronomical observatory is also interesting to those with scientific curiosity.",

          "If you can manage 210 metres of continuously winding uphill ramp , this is worth the effort for the view you get from the top ( 35m above street level ) for DKR 25 ( around \u00a32.20 ). Keep to the outer edge of the spiral : the going is easier as the gradient is only 1 in 10 , but",

          "First, I loved that to get to the top it was a ramp instead of a tiny spiral staircase (though there is a tiny spiral staircase at the very top - only about 20 steps). The view from the windows going up were wonderful, and there were a few places to stop along the way. There was",
          "We visited this tower after visiting a few of the other key towers and this was the best of the lot. It's cheap to enter and offers a rather cool way up, instead of steps it is just a rounded slope. The view from the top was also surprisingly impressive, i could see over to the",
          "This tower I feel is under rated I was told to go on a clear day and they were right the view was amazing you can see Sweden and the bridge to join Copenhagen and Sweden. It was like being at the top of the Eifle Tower, lovely fresh crisp air, this is clarity to me!Totally",

          "I always love to get a good view of a city and this little tower certainly does this with little effort. While most towers require climbing an infinite number of steps this one is a spiralling ramp. Nice and wide, plenty of places to stop and rest if need be. Lots of room at top",
          "Of course it's a great visit in the daytime with a spectacular view of Copenhagen. But have you tried an evening visit with a date or family to see the stars and planets ? It's fantastic on a clear sky winter night ! We saw both Saturn and Venus when we were there. NOTE:",
          "80dkk (just over \u20ac10) for our family of 4 to check out the tower. It was unique because it wasn\u2019t a spiral staircase like most towers. Observation deck gave a 360 view of Copenhagen. Toilets available on two different levels (one with a great view). One room talks about the",

          "Very cheap entry, nice views and an ascent like no other tower I've ever visited.",
          "The view from the top is not that great. There are bars everywhere which ruins the view. For a much better view, go to Church of our Savior. Entry is cheap at 25 kr and it's a 5 min walk from N\u00f8rreport. The hotdog truck 100 m left of this place is good though.",
          "Great view and such a different monument also free with the copenhagen card!",

          "Nice view, great place to get out of the weather.",
          "Nice place with well-designed guide. There are several exhibitions in the tower, and visitors can overlook the scenery at the top. Entrance fee is 25 DKK.",
          "Fantastic Copenhagen viewpoint but be ready for a long and hard walk up the spiral route up to top of tower",
          "Cool landmark with great view of the city. There was an exhibit on quilted art that I found really neat. Nice side displays that were interesting and informative. Worth the price but was quite busy when I went.",
          "One of my favourite places to visit, really nice building, unusual, quirky and fun. Take it easy going up, it's not as far as you think and take in the lovely curves. Half way up connected to the tower is the attic of the adjoining church, \u2026",
          "The Round Tower is a cool little place to visit. The admission is cheap and there are a few exhibits and different facts on your way up that make the history of the Tower quite interesting!

          "If you're interested in history this place is one of the \"go to\" when in Copenhagen.",
          "So much to see and do.  Just the ramp walk to the top will be enough for some.  There is a lot to experience and explore here.  Best tourist value in the city. Bring a real camera.",
          "Great experience and not scary at all. You'll have the best view of Copenhagen on the top.",
          "Really good views of the city. There is no lift so you do have to walk all the way up yourself and it\u2019s quite a track but there are stops along the way; small rooms with museum like things inside. Mostly space themed.",
          "Beautiful and unique location. We get a really good view of Copenhagen when it's not cloudy :)",
          "Absolutely worth a visit, great view over Copenhagen",
          "It was really special since there were no stairs, I really liked the idea",
          "It's unique architecture makes it a worthwhile visit if you are talking a walk around the city - you'll also get a great view of the city itself from the roof area and there can be an art exhibition in one of the rooms also.",
          "Relatively cheap, great view from the top and a nice unexpected section in the middle",
          "Costs around 5 euros to visit. I would say the Towers ist just for people who Love to see arial view of old city.",

          "For 25 dkk this is a fantastic spot! Great views of the city, nice exhibit (I saw the moon one in Oct 19'), a bit of history. I wish the astronomy part was open when I was there, I imagine checking that telescope out should be fun. A must see!",
          "This was a great place to visit. Art galleries on various floors, a fun walk up a spiral ramp to stairs the last bit of the climb. The view was spectacular! We would totally recommend a visit to the Round Tower! Near the top is an opening \u2026",
          "Cheap entrance to an interesting historic tower. It's sloped, rather than stepped so carts could be used to bring books up to the library and astronomical equipment to the top. It also means you can take a buggy almost to the top!",
          "Very nice place to visit. Definitely worth to climb the top, view to whole city is amazing!",
          "An intresting tower.\nThe entry is 24 DKK for adults",
          "The Round Tower known locally as Rundetaarn dates all the way back to 1642 and is the oldest functioning observatory in Europe. You can find the tower is in the Latin Quarter and is a fascinating tower (due to its unique cobbled spiral walkway) with nice views from the top.",
          "It it one of those places, you need to go, just to tick it off your list, when you are in Copenhagen. The tower has an interesting story, and there is a good view over the city. It used to be free to visit the tower. However, now you have \u2026",
          "Interesting building with panoramic city views.",
          "Great view, especially during sunny day, however there should be some order between going up and going down the stairs at the top of the tower",

          "An awesome way to view the gorgeous Copenhagen skyline. It's not that expensive and is a must do if the weather is good especially since the tower has quite some history. Overall it's an amazing experience for all ages to enjoy.",
          "A really unique experience, though a little dizzying!!! With all the exhibits within the building, this is well worth the admission price.",
          "Excellent place to visit. Fun for kids and adults to run up the wide spiral walkway to the top. And the views at the top are great too. Often there are art exhibitions in the halls off the side of the main tower and also the telescope in the observatory is sometimes open to peek through. Best value entry in Copenhagen in my view.",
          "Good view from the top though not much else to do. Climb was easy enough although is at an incline as opposed to stairs.",
          "Round and round you go. All the way to the top and squeeze passed other tourists on the kissing stairs.getting to the top is no mean feat so be prepared for a trek! Great views from the top of the entire city.",
          "A great place to see the city from above, cheap entry and a long but fun swirly walk up",
          "Quier wierd tower, nice view. It is nice place ro visit.",

          "An historic building from where you see the top view of Copenhagen. Should visit if you are exploring Copenhagen. Worth to visit.",
          "The panorama on the rooftop is definitely worth climbing up a sloped ramp. Also, there are small museum about the library, observatory and the church here. The observatory where Tycho Brage worked is closed which is weird. However, entrance fee is a bit expensive taking into consideration it is just a rooftop and small museum.",
          "Visited with copenhagen card. View was nice and the interior of the tower is unique with its inclining slope instead of stairs. Would recommend.",
          "This is a fun place to visit. It is an easy time to the top with stops at a rotating exhibition and restroom breaks. Go at sunset to see a great view of the city.",
          "Hope you love walking up an incline!!! It's well worth it. The view is so nice with 360\u00b0 view of the city.",
          "Fantastic view on all of the Copenhagen. And cheap one as well. Totally worth the money and the climb.",

          "Nice place, I found it quite normal price for Danish standards",
          "It's not too hard to get to the top, but you pay 25DKK for the privilege of that exercise. The view from the top is  good at night, especially with Christmas decorations on in the city. But it won't take your breath away. You won't be able spend mor than 15 minutes at the top. F",
          "Very attractive tourist spots in Copenhagen.. Must visit",
          "Loved this place, definitely a must visit when in the area. The view from the top is spectacular! Entry fees are also very affordable.",

          "Fun place to take family. It is not that expensive especially if you are large group. They often have some exhibition. And there is always nice view from the top even if the weather is cloudy :-)",
          "I was in Copenhagen for a week and enjoyed everything- it\u2019s not the most amazing thing but if you have 20-30 minutes to kill it\u2019s worth a visit. There was an art exhibit when I had visited and it was fine. The \u2018climb\u2019 up is gentle- no steps, just a winding inclined ramp.",
          "Definitely worth a visit and the price was lower than expected compared to most things in Copenhagen. There was an interesting art exhibition half way up too. There's also an observatory at the top but it was closed when I was there.",

          "Cheap way to see the skyline of the city.",
          "Nice view over the city. it's a but windy",
          "As far as viewpoints go, not bad. Copenhagen doesn't have great skyline though. You can see the bridge to Malm\u00f6, factory and beach area and all parts of the city.  On the way up is cafe and gallery.",
          "Worth the visit! Great views of the city and the church attached is a cool sight",
          "Cute place for people who love astronomy. Great city view from the top of the Tower.",
          "Excellent location. You get a good view of the city given the weather is on your side. There is small entrance fee but definitely worth the visit. Walkable distance from the square centre.",
          "Great experience. Easy on the legs. Fully accessible slart from the last bit.",
          "25k for adults for a towering view over the city. It's sloped most of the way but beware some steep steps at the top, only a few but worth knowing!",
          "Excellent view from above the tower.",
          "Breathtaking views on Copenhagen, and very cool place + there is a toilet and little museum for very low price (25 krones)",
          "What sort of a person builds a ramp up a tower so he can ride his horse up to the top? Crazy Danish Kings had the best ideas. \n\nThis place has amazing views of Copenhagen. Not a hard climb. Worth it.",
          "The interior of the tower  has been turned into a wonderful space for people to enjoy. The views from the top need no further platitudes. It was fun to pick out \u00d8resund bridge while viewing Copenhagen and beyond.",
          "Great view over the city. Definitely a must visit although it\u2019s slightly overpriced.",
          "Eagle view of Copenhagen.. loved it",
          "Good view from upstairs, or should i say upramps, cause it's a bit of a climb. But that's pretty much it",
          "The Round Tower in the heart of Copenhagen is worth a visit.  Here you can see a 360 degree view of the beautiful Copenhagen.",
          "The 17th tower which is the oldest observatory in Europe. You can see the view of old part Copenhagen at the top after walking up the spiral walk. But not easy to take a good picture because it is surrounded by fence.",
          "Great view from the top. I liked to do something active during my trip to Denmark and walking all the way to the top was one of those things. Also there is a toilet halfway up.",
          "One of my favourite places to visit when in Copenhagen.. such a great view at the top!",
          "If you are in the city center you might as well drop by. You walk inside the tower via a slope and at the end a couple of steep stairs in order to enjoy the view from high up of Copenhagen.",

          "Really cool place and once you're at the top, you get a great panoramic view of Copenhagen.",

          "Nice touriste place. The climb is very slow and nice ! Great view from the top",
          "Enjoyed it even if the view was shrouded in torrential rain. The 50 year celebration of the moon landing halfway up was pretty unexpected but really.cool",
          "Worth seeking out, not just as an interesting building but the views from the top give a good perspective of Copenhagen. Watch the small, circular staircase at the top, it needs some sort of traffic light system. Other than that, the ascent is a relatively easy slope, not stairs.",
          "Really nice sight in Copenhagen - cheap, quick and you are not overloaded with information. It is very close to great shopping areas and has a stunning views of the city. Definitely worth a visit",
          "Always a fun destination for the family from Canada...",
          "Cheap tourist attraction to go into. Good if you want a nice panoramic view of the city.",
          "The tower is constructed with a spiral ascend and is unique in Denmark though it has its brothers and sisters all over Europe . The city of Copenhagen can be seen from here and it should be a must for every tourist. A highly recommended \u2026",
          "Such a great experience! It was a such a beautiful view from the top. Don\u2019t miss the Glass bottom enclave and the little rooms that offshoot the main tower, with informational guides and photos.",

          "Interesting architecture and nice panorama on the city and beyond.",

          "Initially we were not too sold on going all the way up this landmark, but I\u2019m glad we did! Very different since right smack in the middle of the city and doesn\u2019t have stairs but a ramp! But it is a lot of fun going up and coming down.\nThe views, I must say, are majestic and it is well worth the effort.\nRecommended.",
          "Great view of Copenhagen from roof top and good stop for people interested in history! Be prepared for a steep ascend to a windy outlook! Great for tourists as this attraction is included in Copenhagen Card and in middle of a mall.",
          "Very interesting tower. Complex architecture. Don't rush up and down the tower just for the view. Take your time. Enjoy the view of course, but also take a look at the exhibitions and the planetarium. there is also a glasswindow in the \u2026",
          "The views are worth it, however, it is better to visit this with day light.",
          "Very interesting round tower, that has no stairs but ramp inside of it. Part of it is used for art exhibit. From top you have great view   on Kopenhagen. On top there is a small shop where you can get ice cream, or juice etc...",
          "Remember to collect a sheet at the bottom so you can stamp it on the way up. Good fun information. The gallery space half way up is interesting too. Best seen at sunset for the viwes.",
          "Nice view from the roof in a Copenhagen streets and interesting building itself. They also had a small art exhibition inside last time I\u2019ve been there. \nThere is also an observatory on the top, but you need to check working hours in advance.",
          "Interesting story about a lazy King and a good view from the top. Worth a look.",
          "Must visit in Copenhagen. Firstly it's a great experience to walk up the round tower and enjoy the flair of it. Secondly, at the top you have one of the best views over the whole town. So it's all worth the price!",
          "Super nice tower with unexpected exhibition about the moon. Very nice view of the city on top. Cheap ticket, totally worth it, best value for money in Kopenhagen!",

          "It's really nice. It also has a good view on top.",
          "Great view of Copenhagen.  The walk spirals up. Not too bad if you stay close to the inside.  You get a 360 degree view.",
          "I really enjoyed the walk to the top, lot of history in this tower, I saw the sunrise and it was stunning.",

          "Tower with observation deck on the top (price is 25 DKK). It's not difficult to get to the top - no stairs inside the tower, just curved slope.\nViews of Copenhagen are very beautiful - old city center, towers, spires, sea and even \u00d8resund Bridge.",
          "25 Dkr. (3\u20104\u20ac) Entry for 1 person. Its ok",

          "Great view and not so expensive ! But not extraordinary",
          "Neat vantage point where instead of stairway you get to climb an inclined floor almost to the top of the tower. The tower can fit quite a lot of people at the same time so not much queueing is needed. Terrace at the top allows to take great photos of the Copenhagen city.",
          "Good place to get a view over the old part of town. Easy to get to the top even though there's no lift (elevator). On the way up (down) you may want to have a look in the gallery of color. Have a little break, have a coffee or top up your water bottle, read the pamphlet and let it all sink in.",

          "Great price. Awesome views. Unique building. Worth the visit",

          "\u00a32.85 to see this tower. Great views on a clear day",

          "Amazing views of the city (360) an easy climb",
          "A good historic feature in the Copenhagen city centre. The view at the top is worth the walk! You can also use a Copenhagen Card to get in if you're visiting.",
          "Definitely worth the visit. The tower itself is an outstanding monument but you will get as a bonus the exhibition floor and a fantastic panorama on the city. Note however that the ramp is not going up to the top. If you want to see the panorama you will have to climb stairs so this part cannot be achieved by disabled people.",

          "Unusual features.  minimal queue. Nice open climb but tiny enclosed staircase at top 20ft if one doesn't like enclosed space. Worthwhile views from top.",
          "The Round Tower is such a beautiful building with an even more beautiful lookout with great city views from the top. \nEven though it's just a simple \"round\" building where you basically walk in circles to get to the top (this is more fun \u2026",

          "I have been there several times and I always liked it. There was an art exhibition in the tower every time I was there, and the 360\u00b0 view point at the top is quite nice too!",
          "Recommended to visit this place when going to Kopenhagen. It's a combination of church, observatory and viewpoint. The tower also is stylish from the inside, so worth some pictures inside and also from the city. There is a changing \u2026",
          "Fun walk up and nice views.  A few exhibits on the way up too.",
          "Unusual entrance and way up to the tower. The view at the stop restricted by the bars",
          "A must see for the city",
          "It's a long walk to the top ! Good views over Copenhagen",
          "Very highly recommended. Worth every penny. Not visited anything quite like it and I've been up a lot of urban towers! Don't miss the hollow centre with glass floor. Scary!!!",
          "Beautiful tower worth a visit, as a tourist it\u2019s a great way to see the tower from a birds eye view super historical and some great picture places.",
          "Worth a visit simply for the unusual experience! Plenty of people old and young, all having fun.  \n\nInteresting history behind it, plus there were beautiful city views from the top. A modern art gallery also meets you halfway up, which I loved.",
          "This is a great place to visit, especially in the summertime. The church itself is very pretty and the architecture is historic. Inside, in the summertime, they often have music performance, which I got to experience I can say was pretty and moving.",
          "If it is raining or it has rained please avoid to go up, it is really sloppy even in the clear and sunny day we had. However, the views were worth it.",
          "Old astronomy tower. Great views of the city!",
          "Very particular to walk, nice view of the city!",
          "Fantastic views of Copenhagen. A must see to take Panoramic views of the city.",
          "Interesting architectural design, nice view over the city, an art gallery on top of the church and all this for a couple of crowns. Worth it.",
          "The Round Tower was build  in 1642 by king Christian 4th for his court astronomer Thyge Brahe. It has a unique spiral brick walk without steps leading to the top level.\nMany sign tells the story of the tower and the European context.\nThe top of the towers has a walk giving a beautiful 360 degree view of Copenhagen.",
          "Great View of copenhagen center.",
          "It is an interesting tower and one of the better priced things in Copenhagen. The tower is fairly easy to climb and is mostly a ramp with only a few stairs at the top. Once at the top it has great views over the city.",
          "This is a great place to get a view of the city. Not expensive.  The walk up the spiral ramp is not difficult and could be possible for a wheelchair with a helpful person.",
          "Really round. Take the inside track to get up faster.",
          "Top tier view. Awesome place! Not for the faint of heart because the climb is tough and there is a slightly claustrophobic part to the stairs but not too bad",
          "Must see in Copenhagen, great views from the top.",
          "So different and great views of city.",
          "Cool, historic building with great 360 views of Copenhagen.",
          "A round tower right in the city center of Copenhagen. The price to visit the tower is only 25 kr but it is free of you have the Copenhagen card. In order to arrive at the top there is a slope and just a few steps. Halfway during the climb there is a nice shop with souvenirs. Worth it",
          "Just to be able to say, I was there. Walk up then walk down. Have fun.",
          "Stunning views over Copenhagen \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddf0",
          "Cheap tour that gives you a full 360 degree view of Copenhagen.",
          "In circles we run and enjoy this awesome view!",
          "Funny tower, cool history \ud83d\udc9e",
          "The unique use of a circular ramp instead of stairs make this a nice climb to the top. There are some stairs on the final climb to the viewpoint, but they're short and doable. Views of Copenhagen are difintely worthwhile.",
          "We enjoyed a quick visit to the round tower, 25krone (approx \u00a33) for adults. There was a lovely big event space room that had a visiting exhibition when we visited (as per pics). There are a tiny set of stairs to get to the viewing platform \u2026",
          "Interesting piece of architecture in the centre of the city, would recommend it",
          "Good experience. The climb is not too bad",
          "This was something I wasn't sure about, but the information and the other exhibits made it worth the hike to the top. The view from there over the city was beautiful.",
          "Excellent viewpoint and interesting architecture for a very reasonable price .",
          "Perfect tower, not difficult to get up",
          "Great place to visit. The spiral staircase is amazing",
          "Very reasonable price for a spectacular view of Copenhagen. Approximately \u00a34 to climb the tower's spiral ramp to the seventh floor. Best climbed on a sunny day. Interesting art gallery halfway up the tower which has interesting exhibitions included in the price of the ticket. Ramp is fairly steep so not great for those less mobile.",
          "Nice view around the city. Getting up might get you a headache make you dizzy. There are no stairs.",
          "The best view in the city! Well worth the walk up, which is fun and easy, albeit a steady incline with stairs at the end.  Take notice of the historical notations along the way and peek in the bell tower.  A great way to orient yourself to the layout of the city once atop the tower.",
          "The entrance fee was very inexpensive and the building's architecture is wonderful. At the very top of the tower there's a small observatory dome with a telescope, accessible by some more steps, but this part is only open 2 days a week, so \u2026",
          "Beautiful views of the city from the top",
          "Some great Danish history, worth a visit.",
          "Affordable beautiful view of the city",
          "A quite unique experience! Firstly, not many know that it was an observatory and not a prison and secondly, that they could use hourses to deliver the goods and tools upstairs due to such a construction! It takes time to get up there but \u2026",
          "Good panorama view.Interesting place to visit and low price(25dkk)",
          "Breathtaking view from the round tower! Amazing",
          "Beautiful view of Copenhagen. Small entry fee and toilets.",
          "Nice view out there from the top...walking the way to top is enjoyable",
          "Very pretty but the fact that you had to pay was a huge bummer. I was in kind of a tight budget, and I should've expected it, but still.\nThe exterior is amazing and the gold plating is breathtaking. The surrounding buildings were a nice \u2026",
          "You can observe all Copenhagen from there.",
          "Super cheap and amazing views!! Public library and cute coffee shop are close by. If you have good weather in Copenhagen this is a must for the views! They also have rotating galleries. An art experience and views wrapped up in one for a small price. GO!!",
          "Highly unique place to visit with an interesting exhibit looking at the foundations of the tower. The views from the top are excellent.",
          "What a place, I really recommend this site for a visit if you like old buildings, astronomy and culture.  The building is fantastic with a slipped floor that spirals to the top.  On the day of our visit we met with two role play actors who \u2026",
          "Amazing views. Definitely not for disabled visitors though. A great place to see the city",
          "Nice view, easy to go to the top.",
          "Worth it to pay and climb up the slopes! There's a super narrow staircase at the very top though, which can be scary/ claustrophobic for some. On the bright side, there are only a few steps for that staircase :\")",
          "A nice view of Copenhagen and a few limited displays.",
          "As a fan of Tycho Brahe, the astronomer who collected the data proving the Sun is in the center of the solar system, I could not miss this place. Visiting during the winter spectacular. I recommend going on a Tuesday or Wednesday evening in \u2026",
          "Cute little museum/lookout tower and totally worth the low price of admission. Less fun on a rainy day. You walk up this amazing ramp to the top. Kids will live it. Stairs at the top so leave strollers behind. Yes, the tower has bathrooms, and a gift shop. Great views of the city skyline (such as it is) from the top.",
          "Magnificent view from the top of the tower! Must see place in Copenhagen!",
          "Most see this attraction when visit copenhagen",
          "Great for kids. Great history",
          "It's a tower and it's round.  You walk up an incline to the top. Them there is a flight of stairs, followed by a narrow flight of stairs that will get you to the observation deck.  There's another narrow flight of stairs that ends abruptly \u2026",
          "Walked to the top  great views on a sunny day.",
          "Well worth a visit. There's a ramp all the way to the top which is easy going if you walk round the outside. The stairs at the very top are a bit tight but not too much of a squeeze if someone is walking down at the same tine. Fantastic views!",
          "The round tower has a few surprises in its sleeve. Not only on the summit, but also along the walk: for example the Library Hall - astonishing in its beauty - is now a gallery and a concert venue. A peculiar WC is also on display. Just discover the rest by yourself!",
          "Definitely worth the 15 minutes to walk up and see the view. If you have kids, pick up the map and have the kids stamp it at stations all the way up.",
          "Great tower and very nice view of the whole and greater Copenhagen. It\u2019s even possible to sneak a peak at M\u00e4lmo, in Sweden. Just avoid peak hours and check google maps to see how busy it is. Once busy, it is too much of a hassle to get to the top and not much space there to see the view.",
          "Interesting building with a fantastic view over Copenhagen. A bit to walk to the top, but no problem for someone with normal capabilitys.",
          "Nice easy walk up. 25dk. Can Pay on card. Unfortunately the rain and wind came from nowhere at the top so didn't hang around",
          "Beautiful view of Copenhagen from the top of the tower, after you go 12 floors up & around. It's a joy going up.",
          "Nice view from the top. There is a space exhibition midway with a tiny cafe.",
          "Great view from the top",
          "A very interesting tower with an easy access almost to the top. At the very top there is a narrow spiral staircase. It is a great spot to have spectacular 360\u00b0 view of the city. There are also few exceptions in the rooms on your way up to the top.",
          "A magnificent place with a lot of history and great views across the city from the top! Well worth visiting for the architecture and the lovely climb to the top!",
          "The Round Tower, located in the middle of Copenhagen, was built in the 17th-century by King Christian IV. You can have see Copenhagen from above when standing and sitting at the top of the tower. I used to forget my bag after having an sightseeing on the top of this tower. Fortunately, I came back and my bag was still there :)",
          "A must see. The view from the top is stunning",
          "Great visit for astronomy fans. Proud to climb up the tower",
          "Is a good chirch,i accindentali stuck in a wedding of a completly difrent weding,and is still buetiful,you shuld chek it out.",
          "Great place to visit in a central location of the city.  Be sure to go all the way up.  Don't forget to stop and stand on the glass floor.",
          "Great City Views!\n\nA tower with a difference. Theres some interesting history behind the towers development and reason behind its commission. It adds to what would otherwise be a labouring climb, worth it for the blustery views from the top!",
          "This place is ideal for a superb view.",
          "Just do it. Essential. Go Early in summer to beat the smelling crowds and lines to get up top. Costs about 5 euro",
          "There is an annual unicycle race at the tower.  Amazing and unique event to watch in an interesting location.  Great location even without the race.  The view from the top would be more enjoyable when not raining.  For the race, search for: Royal Rundet\u00e5rn UniRacer Rally R\u00e6s",
          "The best view point in Copenhagen. Most fun access to the roof also! Only a few stairs near the top but the rest of it is all slope so gentle climb right to the top then a fun descent down which isn't too steep either way! Public restrooms if needed. And plenty of information in a variety of languages catering to tourists.",
          "Fantastic place to visit. Great views as  you go further up the Tower and don't miss the attached church.",
          "Yes it is a good one for history lovers\nDisopinting if you have no interest in history",
          "I don't really get the hype, it is cool to see once maybe but there is nothing that special about it. You want to see Copenhagen from sky? Go to tivoli the star ride.",
          "Great way to spend 30 mins.",
          "Nice tourist attraction with a beautiful view over Copenhagen. Easy to walk up as there are few stairs.",
          "Interesting tower, low price justified as you can finish tour in half hour. Top had nice views from center of city, 360 degrees view.",
          "Worth the price, not expensive (25 DKK for an adult), \u00e0 temporary exhibition for the 50th birthday of the first step on the moon. Nice view on top of the tower.",

          "Only takes 20 minutes. Nice bit of history",
          "Nice view from the top of the tower.",
          "Nicely restored historical building built as an astronomical observatory in 1642. It costs only 25 dkk to go up and you get a great view of the old town from the top.  Brochures with good information are provided in many languages.  A must \u2026",
          "It\u2019s was surprisingly quite large. First you see the church, followed by a museum and exhibits about the inside of the tower followed by unparalleled views of Copenhagen. Absolutely worth a stop and it\u2019s right smack in the middle of the city \ud83c\udf03",
          "Exceptional building, raised by the king of Denmark, Christian the Fourth, close to the Trinitatis Church, in the heart of Copenhagen. A spiral ramp winding  up to the old astronomical observatory and a platform with a formidable panorama \u2026",
          "Beautiful view from the top",
          "Fun place to visit with unique info. If you want to see the observatory, than you need to check the schedule and go in the night.",
          "Nice view from the rooftop over Copenhagen.",
          "Unique architecture where there are no stairs to reach the top\nHistoric place\nSituated at center of city",
          "I went to the tower today as it was included free in the Copenhagen pass. The view from the top is great, the climb is not strenuous unless you have a disability (in which case I would not recommend) but the exhibits were hardly enthralling. Nice for a quick look, better if you are keenly interested in astronomy.",
          "Amazing attraction! Friendly workers, super awesome views of the city! Highly reccomend!",
          "Nice views at a good price",
          "Interesting building construction, and a great view of the city during sunset. Surprisingly not over-crowded either. Worth a visit.",

          "Must visit place.. We get the entire city view from the top.",
          "Nice history to it and if it's in your Copenhagen card just walk up to have some nice views of the city.",
          "Spiral-shaped tower, it\u2019s not that difficult to go up! Very good view point of Copenhagen",
          "Lovely view, nice for kids. The fifth star depends on the temporary exhibit, sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it isn't.",
          "Historical monument and very well preserved. Don\u2019t miss the view from the top. You can see most of Copenhagen and on a clear day you can see the famous \u00d6resunds bridge connecting Swedish city of malm\u00f6 with Copenhagen. Going up to the top is a steep climb so be prepared. But you\u2019ll love the view once you\u2019re on the top.",
          "Great views from the top of the tower and interesting exhibition on the day visited. Something different to do in a capital city.",
          "What a view from the top. Worth of visiting. Also the art exhibition was very interesting and included to the entrance fee. \nNo stairs, excepect few at the end, very easy to reach.",
          "Very nice location with a great view over Copenhagen.\nThere are no stairs! Is a circle way upstairs.",
          "Our toddler proudly climbed the entire ramp to the top!  Great views and a fun trip up and down.",
          "The King would ride the Horse to the top of the Tower \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd38 & it was built to ascertain he did \ud83d\udcf8\ud83d\udcf8\ud83d\udcf8\u2665\ufe0f\ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddf0.

          "It is realy exciting to see.",
          "This has great views of Copenhagen. I would definitely reccommend going there.",
          "Beautiful building with an intriguing history. The museum/art part of the tower feels a bit snobby, but the rest is surely worth it!",
          "Very interesting. The view from the top is worth the climb.",
          "Spiral tower (there are not too many in the world!) that provides great views of Copenhagen",
          "Really good peice and a beautiful view from copenhague. It is also possible to enter with the copenhague card. I really recommend this visit!!!",
          "Get off at N\u00f8rreport station and this sight is just a short walk from there. Kids loved running up the tower, and halfway up was a magnificent exposition about the apollo moon landings. At the top of the tower is an extremely steep and \u2026",
          "If you are in Copenhagen you should definitely visit this tower. It is not very high and the price is affordable. You can admire the whole city from above, you can admire the exhibition that is displayed. You can read about the history of the place. A place you should definitely not miss!",
          "Quaint, historic and well worth the climb to the top... fabulous view of the city!!!",
          "It was an okay experience.  If not much else to do worth a visit to just walk up the tower and see the view from top.  Not sure if worth the proce ti just walk up a tower.  By the way you walk up a ramp bot stairs so accessability is easier.",
          "Haven't been to the top of this tall, round tower since I was a teen. The only things I really remembered was my height issues up there and the long climb up. Went up yesterday with no problems whatsoever. The climb was fine, barely winded \u2026",
          "Brilliant. Only a couple of pounds and has great views from the top. very informative going up with little info points.\n\nReally enjoyed going up the tower and would visit again.",
          "Rich with history. The exhibition hall is excellent and we were lucky to participate in the ongoing artistic photography. The Observatory is also a perfect place to enjoy Copenhagen skyline. Do not miss it.",
          "Nice also watching the sky with telescope was not very impressive",
          "Been there many times, one of the nicest view in the city, you\u2019re not to high but just above the city which i like the most. But, to he honest, they don\u2019t really check how many people in there and sometimes it\u2019s too hard to move up in the tower in narrow stairs.",
          "Very interesting and affordable attraction to visit.",
          "Interesting walk up a spiral ramp with some narrow stairs at top, but once reached had some good views over Copenhagen. It was very busy the time I went which detracted from the experience, but I shouldn't be selfish. All around well worth the entry and a good experience.",
          "Brilliant experience. Love that it has no stairs and it's a huge spiral that you walk up! At the very top, there is a small amount of steps to go up to the viewing platform and it is quite a narrow space, however, it's only for about 20-30 \u2026",
          "A place not to be missed, you get great views of Copenhagen from the top and in the middle there are art exhibitions. Would recommend 100%.",
          "One of the unique things to do in Copenhagen is to climb the round tower ....it gives brilliant views of the city and climbing is fun...you have to pay a small fee though .overall had a fun experience",
          "Couldn't believe in the past they use it for horse racing up to the top lol. 7 rounds to go top, and i suggest that you visit it during nice weather in early summer, since i went there in winter, it was super cold and windy at the top. Also \u2026",
          "It is not only impressive architecture as you keep going in circles on the rampart, not only historical landmark, but also offers a fantastic view all around the city. One of the tunnels leads above the church. Really good! No elevator but access with stroller is ok up to the the actual final stairwell.",
          "A fun experience going up the ramp to the tower for an excellent view.",
          "This place offers a fantastic view over Copenhagen. The entry price is also very reasonable.",
          "You walk to the top on a spiral ramp and there are lovely views over the top of Copenhagen. The man who worked there said I couldn't take my pram up so I had to carry our daughter all the way up and then on the way down I saw lots of other mums taking the prams up so just take the pram. It's also pretty steep and long",
          "Amazing view of town",
          "It\u2019s a round tower with 2000 people in line. Nothing very special to be honest. Lost 1 hours of my life.. Not recommended",
          "Beautiful view over Copenhagen",
          "It was ancient well kept  and easy to get to the top.it also preserves the creators name for all to see",
          "I can't believe we were about to leave this out from our itinerary. It's beautiful. The views from the windows is breathtaking, the architecture is magnificent. Go there when the the sun is out so you enjoy the view and the experience. We loved it.",
          "Amazing views of the city. A unique building, with very reasonable 25 DKK entrance fee. Great photo location.",
          "A must see in Copenhagen! Very interesting, very fun and a great view from the top! Must check out the hollow tower center and the funny toilet stuck onto the side of the tower. Those stairs up top are really steep!",
          "Incredibly good view of copenhagen!! Do not miss if you spend a day or two in copenhagen! Worth it even though you usually have to wait like half an hour because there are many people there.",
          "Fun place to visit when in Copenhagen. The tower has a very broad ramp going up and the view on the city from the top is stunning.",
          "Fine construction for the era",
          "Quite a climb up narrow and steep stairs, emerging to great views. The final climb is a corkscrew on the outside of the tower.  Breathtaking views rd right around the city",
          "Round Tower is a 17th century tower located in central Copenhagen. One of the many architectural projects of Cristiano IV of Denmark, was built as an astronomical observatory. It is best known for its 7.5-turn helical staircase leading to \u2026",
          "A long hike up for views between bars.  Also too many people try to get up and down at very top where stairs really only accommodate 1 person at a time.  To make it worse people with backpacks day packs made it even more difficult . They should be made to check them at the entrance .",
          "Great view of the city from the top. Definitely worth the price.",
          "Nice view from top of Copenhagen.",
          "Nice place but have to climb up the ramp on foot, no lift.. So don't go here if you have health issues",

          "Very cheap place to visit. \n\nThe view from the top is amazing and the spiral ramp to the top is interesting. There are restrooms and stop of information points along the way. \n\nIf you want to see a fantastic view of Copenhagen visit The Round Tower, it will not disappoint.",
          "Sublime view of Copenhagen! Make sure you don\u2019t miss it on a clear sky day. If your eyesight and the weather are good enough, you can see the \u00d8resunds bridge connecting Denmark and Sweden at the far end looking east. The top can get a bit crowded on weekends.",
          "The views from the top were nice, but maybe not in the ideal part if he city. It is a long walk up, just round and round, with a few tight steps at the top to navigate. The curves inside are quite friendly for Instagram if you like that sort of thing. There isn\u2019t really very much information about the history of the building though",
          "Worth to visit it..nice view of Copenhagen and the ticket is also cheap..near Str\u00f8get and Norreport station..",
          "The price to get in is 25DKK. It has always some exhibitions inside, in two different rooms that you'll pass by while you climb up. On top, you'll find one of the oldest observatories in the world, very impressive. You can visit it every \u2026",
          "Really nice place with nice city view, observatory and interesting exposition",
          "Great view.",
          "This tower is situated in the main city centre so it is easy to find. It is fine for a quick visit but it's not exceptional",
          "The tower is not especially worth a visit but the view from the top is nice",
          "Nice Copenhagen view",
          "Entry is free with Copenhagen card. Toilets facility is there. Few steps to climb up at the top rest all is sloppy pathway. Nice view of Copenhagen city from top of the tower. It's walking distance from Norreport station.",
          "Impressive Tower that allows Horsecaridge ride to the top.",
          "This historic tower is stunning. It\u2019s so simple yet something about it makes it my favourite attraction yet! Make sure to go into all the rooms and make your way to the top to see the massive telescope and gorgeous view.",

        "wiki": "Lund University (Swedish: Lunds universitet) is a prestigious university in Sweden and one of northern Europe\u2019s oldest universities. Lund University is consistently ranked among the world's top 100 universities. The university is located in the city of Lund in the province of Scania, Sweden. It arguably traces its roots back to 1425, when a Franciscan studium generale was founded in Lund next to the Lund Cathedral. After Sweden won Scania from Denmark in the 1658 Treaty of Roskilde, the university was officially founded in 1666 on the location of the old studium generale next to Lund Cathedral.\nLund University has eight faculties, with additional campuses in the cities of Malm\u00f6 and Helsingborg, with 40,000 students in 270 different programmes and 1,300 freestanding courses. The university has some 600 partner universities in nearly 70 countries and it belongs to the League of European Research Universities as well as the global Universitas 21 network.Two major facilities for materials research are in Lund University: MAX IV, a synchrotron radiation laboratory \u2013 inaugurated in June 2016, and European Spallation Source (ESS), a new European facility that will provide up to 100 times brighter neutron beams than existing facilities today, to be opened in 2023.The university centers on the Lundag\u00e5rd park adjacent to the Lund Cathedral, with various departments spread in different locations in town, but mostly concentrated in a belt stretching north from the park connecting to the university hospital area and continuing out to the northeastern periphery of the town, where one finds the large campus of the Faculty of Engineering.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval origins ===\nThe city of Lund has a long history as a center for learning and was the ecclesiastical centre and seat of the archbishop of Denmark. A cathedral school (the Katedralskolan) for the training of clergy was established in 1085 and is today Scandinavia's oldest school.\nThe university traces its roots back to 1425, when a Franciscan studium generale (a medieval university) was founded in Lund next to the Lund Cathedral (with baccalaureus degree started in 1438), making it the oldest institution of higher education in Scandinavia followed by studia generalia in Uppsala in 1477 and Copenhagen in 1479. After Sweden won Scania from Denmark in the 1658 Treaty of Roskilde, the university was founded in 1666 on the location of the old studium generale next to Lund Cathedral. The studium generale had not survived the Lutheran Reformation of 1536, which is why the university is considered a separate institution when founded in 1666.\n\n\n=== 17th\u201319th centuries ===\nAfter the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, the Scanian lands came under the possession of the Swedish Crown, which founded the University in 1666 as a means of making Scania Swedish by educating teachers in Swedish, and to culturally integrate the Scania region with Sweden. The university was named Academia Carolina after Charles X Gustav of Sweden until the late 19th century, when Lund University became the widespread denomination. It was the fifth university under the Swedish king, after Uppsala University (1477), the University of Tartu (1632, now in Estonia), the Academy of \u00c5bo (1640, now in Finland), and the University of Greifswald (founded 1456; Swedish 1648\u20131815, now in Germany).\nThe university was at its founding granted four faculties: Law, Theological, Medicine and Philosophy. They were the cornerstones, and for more than 200 years this system was in effect. Towards the end of the 17th century, the number of students hovered around 100. Some notable professors in the early days were Samuel Pufendorf, a juridical historian; and Canutus Hahn and Kristian Papke in philosophy.\nThe Scanian War in 1676 led to a shut-down, which lasted until 1682. The university was re-opened largely due to regional patriots, but the university was not to enjoy a high status until well into the 19th century. Lecturing rooms were few, and lectures were held in the Lund Cathedral and its adjacent chapel. The professors were underpaid.\n\nIn 1716, Charles XII of Sweden entered Lund. He stayed in Lund for two years, in between his warlike expeditions. Lund and the university attracted a temporary attention boost. The most notable lecturer during this time was Andreas Rydelius.\nPeace was finally restored with the death of Charles XII in 1718, and during the first half of the 18th century the university was granted added funds. The number of students was now well around 500. Despite not being on par with Uppsala University, it had still built a solid reputation and managed to attract prominent professors.\nAround 1760 the university reputation dropped as the number of students fell below 200, most of whom hailed from around the province. However, by 1780 its reputation was largely restored, and continued to rise through the 1820s. This was largely owing to popular and well-educated lecturers particularly in philology; the prominent professor Esaias Tegn\u00e9r was a particularly notable character with widespread authority. He, in turn, attracted others towards Lund. One of these was the young theological student C. G. Brunius, who studied ancient languages under Tegn\u00e9r and were later to become professor of Greek. With time he was to devote himself to architectures and he redesigned several of Lund's buildings, as well as churches of the province.\nIn 1845 and 1862 Lund co-hosted Nordic student meetings together with the University of Copenhagen.\nA student called Elsa Collin was the first woman in the whole of Sweden to take part in a spex.\n\n\n=== 20th century \u2013 present ===\n\nIn the early 20th century, the university had a student population as small as one thousand, consisting largely of upper-class pupils training to become civil servants, lawyers and doctors. In the coming decades it started to grow significantly, until it became one of the country's largest. In 1964 the social sciences were split from the Faculty of Humanities. Lund Institute of Technology was established in 1961 but was merged with Lund University eight years later.\nIn recent years, Lund University has been very popular among applicants to Swedish higher education institutions, both nationally and internationally. For studies starting in autumn 2012, Lund received 11,160 foreign master's applications from 152 countries, which was roughly one third of all international applications to Swedish universities.\n\n\n=== Women at the university ===\nThe first woman to study in Lund was Hildegard Bj\u00f6rck (spring of 1880) who had previously studied in Uppsala and had there been the first Swedish woman ever to get an academic degree. Her tenure in Lund was however very brief and the medical student Hedda Andersson who entered the university later in 1880 (two years before the next woman to do so) is usually mentioned as the first woman at Lund University. Hilma Borelius was the first woman who finished a doctorate in Lund, in 1910. The first woman to be appointed to a professor's chair was the historian Birgitta Od\u00e9n (1965). In 1992 Boel Flodgren, Professor of Business Law, was appointed rector magnificus (or, strictly speaking, rectrix magnifica) of Lund University. As such, she was the first woman to be the head of a European university.\n\n\n=== Campus ===\n\nThe university's facilities are mainly located in the small city of Lund in Scania, about 15 km away from central Malm\u00f6 and 50 km from Copenhagen. The large student- and staff population makes an impact on the city, effectively making it a university town. Over a hundred university buildings scatter around town, most of them in an area covering more than 1 km\u00b2, stretching towards the north-east from Lundag\u00e5rd park in the very centre of town. Buildings in and around Lundag\u00e5rd include the main building, Kungshuset, the Historical Museum and the Academic Society's headquarters. The main library building is located in a park 400 meters to the north, followed by the large hospital complex.\nLund University has a satellite campus in nearby Malm\u00f6, Sweden's third largest city. The Faculty of Fine and Performing Arts' three academies: Malm\u00f6 Art Academy, Malm\u00f6 Academy of Music and Malm\u00f6 Theatre Academy, are all located in Malm\u00f6. The city is also the location of Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, where Lund University performs a considerable amount of research and medical training.\nCampus Helsingborg is, as the name suggests, located in the city of Helsingborg, almost 50 km from Lund. Opened in 2000, it consists of a building in the city centre, right next to the central train station and the harbour. Nearly 3,000 students are based on the campus. The Department of Service Management and the Department of Communication and Media are among those located at the campus in Helsingborg.\nTeaching and training at the School of Aviation (LUSA) takes place at an airfield next to the town of Ljungbyhed, about 40 km away from Lund.\n\n\n=== Library ===\nLund University library was established in 1668 at the same time as the university and is one of Sweden's oldest and largest libraries. Since 1698 it has received legal deposit copies of everything printed in the country. Today six Swedish libraries receive legal deposit copies, but only Lund and the Royal Library in Stockholm are required to keep everything for posterity. Swedish imprints make up half of the collections, which amount to 170,000 linear metres of shelving (2006). The library serves 620,000 loans per year, the staff is 200 full-time equivalents, and the 33 branch libraries house 2600 reading room desks.\nThe current main building at Helgonabacken opened in 1907. Before that, the old building was Liberiet close to the city's cathedral. Liberiet was built as a library in the 15th century, but now serves as a cafe.\n\n\n=== Hospital ===\nEducation and research in the health sciences at the university is operated in cooperation with Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, located in both Lund and Malm\u00f6. Medical education takes place in the Biomedical Centre, next to the hospital in Lund. Nursing and occupational therapy are taught in the Health Sciences Centre nearby. The university also operates the Clinical Research Centre in Malm\u00f6, featuring many specialized laboratories. There are over 100 faculty.\n\n\n== Organisation ==\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\nThe University Board is the University's highest decision-making body. The Board comprises the Vice-Chancellor, representatives of the teaching staff and students, and representatives of the community and business sector. Chair of the board is Margot Wallstr\u00f6m. Executive power lies with the Vice-Chancellor and the University Management Group, to which most other administrative bodies are subordinate.\n\n\n=== Faculties ===\nLund University is divided into eight faculties:\nFaculties of Humanities and Theology\nFaculty of Engineering (LTH)\nFaculty of Fine & Performing Arts\nFaculty of Law\nFaculty of Medicine\nFaculty of Science\nFaculty of Social Sciences\nSchool of Economics and Management\n\n\n=== Research centres ===\nThe university is also organised into more than 20 institutes and research centres, such as:\n\nLund University Centre for Sustainability Studies (LUCSUS)\nBiomedical Centre\nCentre for Biomechanics\nCentre for Chemistry and Chemical Engineering - Kemicentrum\nCentre for East and South-East Asian Studies\nCentre for European Studies\nCentre for Geographical Information Systems (GIS Centrum)\nCentre for Innovation, Research and Competence in the Learning Economy (CIRCLE)\nCenter for Middle Eastern Studies at Lund University\nCentre for Molecular Protein Science\nCentre for Risk Analysis and Management (LUCRAM)\nInternational Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics at Lund University (IIIEE)\nLund Functional Food Science Centre\nLund University Diabetes Centre (LUDC)\nMAX lab - Accelerator physics, synchrotron radiation and nuclear physics research\nPufendorf Institute\nRaoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law\nSwedish South Asian Studies Network\n\n\n== Academics ==\n\n\n=== Education ===\nApproximately 42,000 students study within one of the 276 educational programs, the 100 international master's programmes or the 2,200 independent courses. Around five hundred courses are, or can be, held in English for the benefit of international exchange students. There are several programmes allowing foreign students to study abroad at the University. Notable exchangees include United States Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who spent time at Lund University in the 1960s conducting research. The university offers 9 out of the 20 most sought after programmes in Sweden. The master's programme in International Marketing is the most popular choice in the country, with almost a thousand applications yearly.\nStudents are awarded ECTS credits for all completed courses. Grading scales vary by programme and even course; \"Pass/Fail\" and \"Pass with distinction/Pass/Fail\" are most common, but ECTS grades are increasingly given as well. Engineering students generally receive grades as \"5/4/3/Fail\".\n\n\n=== Research ===\nLund University is well known as one of Scandinavia's largest research universities. It ranks among top performers in the European Union in terms of papers accepted for publication in scientific journals. It is one of Sweden's top receiver of research grants, most of which come from government-funded bodies. The EU is the university's second largest external research funder and Lund is the 23rd largest receiver of funding within the union's Seventh Framework Programme. The university is active in many internationally important research areas such as nanotechnology, climate change and stem cell biology.\n\n\n=== Innovation ===\nOne of the most famous innovations based on research from Lund University is diagnostic ultrasound, which is today a routine method of examination in hospitals around the world. Other\nexamples of pioneering innovations are the artificial kidney, which laid the foundations for the multinational company Gambro and which makes life easier for dialysis patients worldwide, and Bluetooth technology, which enables wireless communication over short distances. Here is a sample selection of discoveries from Lund through the ages.\n1813: Swedish Massage and gymnastics\n1847: Ice Age theory\n1887: Rydberg's constant\n1916: The M series and new methods of measurement\n1926: The first respirator\n1944: The Tetrahedron \u2013 milk packaging for the modern era\n1946: The artificial kidney\n1953: Medical ultrasound\n1956: Human chromosome number\n1957: Dopamine\n1962: The Falk-Hillarp method, Partial differential equations\n1963: Lactose intolerance\n1966: Asthma medicine\n1967: Nicorette\n1969: New x-ray contrast agent\n1972: The Inkjet printer\n1987: Inhalator for asthma medicine\n1991: Laser cancer treatment, Proviva\n1993: Qlik \u2013 data visualization software\n1994: Bluetooth\n1997: Precise biometrics \u2013 fingerprint reader\n1999: Digital diagnostic support\n2004: Facial recognition technology\n2008: Cancer diagnostics using MR technology\n2009: Treatment of pre-eclampsia\n2012: The world's most water-efficient shower\n2013: A unique new method for simpler and more accurate cancer diagnosis, Open and alternative map service\n2014: Proteins diagnose cancer\n\n\n=== Rankings ===\nLund University is among the most renowned institutions of higher learning in the Nordic countries and is commonly ranked within the top 100 in the world by the most influential ranking agencies. Lund was ranked 60th in the world in the 2014/15 QS World University Rankings. In 2015, it ranked  90th in the world by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, and in the Academic Ranking of World Universities, compiled by Shanghai Jiao Tong University, it was in the 101-150 category. \nIn the Leiden Ranking for 2019, Lund University is ranked 65th in the world.In 2014, the National Secretary of Higher Education, Science, Technology and Innovation, Ecuador (Senescyt), as a parameter for awarding scholarships, created a list of top Universities around the world placing Lund University in Top 1 in \"Natural Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics\" and Top 3 in both fields: \"Information Technology and Communication\" and \"Engineering, Manufacturing and Construction\".The 2013\u20132014 Times Higher Education World University Rankings' Engineering and Technology table placing Lund University 78 around the world., in \"Art and Humanities\" 74th, in \"Clinical, Pre-clinical and Health\" 77th, in \"Life Sciences\" 67th, and in \"Physical Sciences\" 57th.The 2015\u20132016 URAP (University Ranking by Academic Performance) placed to Lund University 87th in the world with qualification A++.\nThe 2015\u201316 Times Higher Education World University Rankings placed the university in 90th place worldwide.\n\n\n== Student life ==\n\nLund student life is based on three central structures: the student nations, the Academic Society (AF) and the student unions. Before July 1, 2010, students were required to enroll in a student union, nation and AF in order to receive grades at the university, but this is no longer compulsory. Students may still enroll in these organizations if they wish.\n\n\n=== Student nations ===\n\nThe nations in Lund are a central part of the university's history, initially serving as residential colleges for students, organized by geographic origin. \u00d6stg\u00f6ta Nation, the oldest nation, was established in 1668, two years after the university was founded. While the nations still offer limited housing, today they are best described as student societies.\nToday students may enroll in any nation, although the nations still preserve their geographic names. In most cases it does not matter what nation one enrolls in, but different nations offer different activities for interested students.\nEach nation has student housing, but the accommodations in no way meet demand, and they are usually appointed according to a queue system. Each nation has at least one pub evening per week, with a following night club. The solemn peak event in the course of an activity year is the organization of student balls once a year. Most well known of the nation balls (as opposed to balls organized by student unions) is the ball hosted by G\u00f6teborgs Nation - called the \"Gustaf II Adolf Ball\" (also known as the \"GA-Ball\"). Most nations also host at least one banquet per week, where a three course dinner is served. Each nation also has different activities for students interested in sports, arts, or partying. All activities within the nations are voluntary.\n\n\n=== The Academic Society ===\nIn 1830, Professor Carl Adolph Agardh formed Akademiska F\u00f6reningen (The Academic Society), commonly referred to as AF, with the goal of \"developing and cultivating the academic life\" by bringing students and faculty from all departments and student nations together in one organization. Prince Oscar, then Sweden's Chancellor of Education, donated 2000 Kronor to help found the society. In 1848, construction began on AF-borgen (the AF Fortress), which is located opposite the Main Building in Lundag\u00e5rd. To this day, AF is the center of student life in Lund, featuring many theater companies, a prize-winning student radio (Radio AF), and organizing the enormous Lundakarnevalen (the Lund Carnival) every four years. \"AF Bost\u00e4der\", an independent foundation with close ties to Akademiska F\u00f6reningen, maintains over 5,700 student residences in Lund.\n\n\n=== Student unions ===\n\nThe student unions represent students in various decision-making boards within the university and council students regarding their rights, housing and career options. There are nine student unions, one for each faculty and an additional union for doctoral students. Lund's Doctoral Student Union is further divided into councils, one for each faculty except for the faculties of engineering and fine and performing arts.The unions are incorporated into the Association of Lund University Student Unions (LUS). It has two full-time representatives who go to weekly meetings with the vice-chancellor and other organizational university bodies. The student union association runs services such as loan institute, a day-care centre and a website with housing information.

          "Even though curches kinda freaks me out, this one is pretty nice. There is a enormous astronomical clock that is kind of cool, don't miss that.",
          "We visited on a Sunday, starting the free tour at 14:30 at the Domkyrkoforum, with a short video about the history of the Cathedral. Then our guide took us in to see the Astronomical clock strike at 15:00. The tour continued for another 30mins at the alter and then in the crypt.",
          "The exterior view of the cathedral is wonderful. The interior is quite simple, but there is a very interesting astronomical clock and also very fascinating crypt. Well worth a visit.",
          "A beautiful centuries old Cathedral. You must see the huge Astronomical Clock in here. You can also go down into the Crypt. The Stained Glass windows are amazing. You can light candles - unlike some churches in Australia now, where the cost of insurance prohibits this.",
          "We happened to catch the Swedish speaking open tour of the cathedral. The guide was absolutely excellent and the tour very interesting. The crypt underneath the church is worth visiting! At 12 o'clock the astronomical clock chimes, which is also worth experiencing.",
          "I thought it was just a regular big church at first, but when i went in, i saw a simple yet beautiful church inside. It might not as impressive as any big church around Europe but still interesting to see. You should go to the basement where there is a dark and big room",
          "The best way to visit the cathedral is with a guided tour which the cathedral is doing on their own very often and it is in English. I suggest visiting this church as its history revolves around the story of the town and founding of its famous university.",
          "Beautiful Cathedral which is several hundred years old. It is an amazing structure with a lot of history attached to it. Well worth the visit if you are in the area.",
          "Free entrance to this beautiful cathedral, its atmospheric crypt and fascinating astronomical clock. If you have children or a childlike spirit, don't miss the chiming of the clock at midday or 3pm - it's quite delightful.",
          "It's a nice cathedral - not so impressive if you compare it with the big ones in Europe but in any case one of the top POI in Lund. The organ is one of the biggest in Sweden and the hole setting of the area with it's old University buildings beside and the old town area in the",
          "Very old church in the middle of Lund. Located next to Lundag\u00e5rd, a small garden where beautiful university's buildings are located. This is a must-see place when you visit Lund (along with the university's buildings and the botanic garden). They have organ (and occasionally,",
          "Probably the main sight in Lund, located by the pedestrian street. Seeing the crypt located under the dome and the \"astronomy clock\" was very interesting.",
          "This is very noticeable in Lund and what else you want to see in lund...except the walking street.? Yeah, and of course the University of Lund.",
          "A must when you visit Lund. It is situated near the center of Lund. Don't miss the mecanical clock to the left of the main entrance.",

          "Spenta few hours close to the church. What a sight. Whiteish stone and great architecture. Sat outside basking in the sun and admired it. Close to it the university with its sights. Recommended",
          "This is - I think - the oldest cathedral in Scandinavia. It's quite massive, and somewhat gloomy \u2013 which rather reflects elements of the Swedish mentality",
          "This is a nice cathedral with a couple of interesting points. The main drawcard is the 14th century clock, which is very interesting and novel. Don't miss the animation (3pm and also some other times) but remember this was state of the art in the 14th century not now. Also",
          "Don't miss the crypt and the clock striking (at 3 p.m.). You will seldom see a more perfect example of the romanesque style than in the lower levels of Lund Cathedral.",
          "This is the oldest cathedral in Scandinavia. It had a key role in the conversion of the Vikings to Christianity with a long and rich history. I particularly remember the gargoyles around the cathedral. Quite interesting. Well worth the visit.",
          "The astronomical clock works twice a day. It's quite amusing. This cathedral may not be as impressive as those in France, but it's clock is as interesting and well maintained as any I ever seen. The plaza next to the church is a great place to meet friends or just to watch the",
          "Be sure to see the solar clock and the mosaics. They still run services during the day and evening of the week so time your visit accordingly.",
          "What an amazing formerly Roman Catholic cathedral, now Lutheran! Our son who is completing his Master's at Lund took us through it. When worshipping at the 11:00 service on Sunday, we found that we could follow the order of worship only a little with our limited Swedish",
          "First and foremost be sure to take a tour. Otherwise it is just another nice looking church. But learning a bit of its journey through time and confessions makes it really interesting and sometimes a little spooky. At night time its illumination is one of the nicest displays",
          "This is an essential part of any visit to this region. The cathedral itself is beautiful, and it has a very particular atmosphere, with a feeling of calm and tranquility. If possible,try to visit when the astronomical clock is in action (12.00 and 15.00 on the day we were there,",
          "Did this for a day trip and included the university. Had a coffee and watched life go by as the students came and went. Very charming place with sense of history and academia. Great way to fill a day especially when the weather was lovely. We just spent the day on foot.",
          "A really interesting and beautiful church building, both on the inside and the outside. The astronomical clock is worth seeing and also don't forget to have a look down the crypt.",
          "We spent 2 hours to visit the city. We met a student in the street who took us around the city, the university and the church. There is not much activity in August, but what we saw was interesting. The Roman cathedral is worth a visit, with its beautiful astronomic clock, and",
          "Another interesting place to spend a few hours. Built during the time when this area was Denmark there are some cool historical perspectives.",
          "I like the price to visit the cathedral....its free! Donations are accepted. Photos were allowed inside. The choir was practicing while I was there which was awesome to hear. You can also tour the crypt which is really cool. But you only get to see the main level and the crypt.",
          "Better visit when you're in Lund. The astronomic 3 stories clock which tell the sun, moon, and star hand. Also with the underground tomb.",
          "The tranquility and ambience of this cathedral coupled with its fascinating celestial clock and the beautiful tone of its bells make this well worth visiting and taking a detour when in the vicinity of Malmo.",
          "The Lund catherdral is a mighty structure and also beautiful. The inside is even more spectacular. Learn the story about the giant named \"Finn\", who built the church, according to an old swedish folk tale.",
          "Visited Lund following some recommendations and was happy I did stop off for a whistle stop visit. The cathedral is the main point of interest and was certainly imposing & impressive.",
          "It was interesting to visit this place for historical purposes, aside from that I didn't have a particularly great experience. Bland is the better word here. Truth be told, there isn't much going on in Lund so visiting here is something you'll simply have to do to keep yourself",
          "Beautiful old cathedral with access to the crypts. The astronomical clock was amazing and the church was nice and warm on a cold and rainy day",
          "We visited Lund as part of our \"around the sound\" train/ferry ticket from Copenhagen (for more details, see reviews on the Oresund Bridge). Lund Cathedral is an impressive structure externally and makes a nice photograph.",
          "There is no excuse for not visiting this highlight of Lund. Its simple yet striking architecture makes an interesting contrast with British cathedrals and inside is a range of associated material culture such as the fascinating Horologium Mirabile Lundense, a late C14th clock.",
          "There's a nice English-Language Vespers service at 5:00 p.m. on Sundays held in a side chapel. This added to the artistic and architectural aspects of a Cathedral visit.",
          "Lund was founded by the Benedictinian monks and the Danish kings. They chose Lund for their Arch bishop church. In 1104 Lund became head of all Christians in Scandinavia. Today one can find the remains (some brickstones) of the Benedict Monastry north of the University Library",
          "A wonderful cathedral dating from the 12th century. The crypt was one of the spookiest (in a good way) I've ever seen. The astronomical clock which goes off at 12 and 3 is amazing.",
          "A beautiful and peaceful cathedral, nice to just go inside and sit down and have a quiet moment or light a candle for your loved ones.",
          "if you read the old tale, the cathedral was built about 900 years ago by giant Finn. the monk who ordered it should pay with his eyes when it was completed. but the monk found out the giants name and then the giant became stone and you coold today find him in the crypt as a",
          "The center of Lund is captured beautifully with its ancient cathedral. The architecture is exactly to be expected for its time and the acoustics are phenominal. It's worth a visit and if you are lucky enough to hear one of the many choirs for which Lund is famous, then the",

          "Lund Cathedral is a must see when visiting Lund. This Lutheran Cathedral (which holds services in English also), has an interesting history, as Lund was once an important religious center. This Cathedral has the famous Astronomical Clock. Visit the cathedral 10 minutes before",
          "A rewarding site to visit. The astrological clock is quite interesting - and large. It 'performs' a couple of times a day and it is worth checking the schedule and experiencing that. The crypt is also worth a quick walk-around. The Visitor's Center isn't far away and that is a",
          "The rugged, minimalist exterior foreshadows the interior quite well. The six centuries old horologium is a miracle indeed and the local student pastor happily doubles as an expert guide in the ten minutes before the knights strike and the three wise men do their procession.",
          "Every year more than 700,000 people visit Lund Cathedral. People of all ages and descriptions are attracted here for a variety of reasons. Besides those who attend services or seek spiritual renewal, there are many tourists groups from different countries, school classes as",
          "We arrived at the right time as the Asst. Pastor was starting a free tour of the Cathedral. It was an amazing 1 and half tour in which we learned the true history of the Cathedral, the legends and all the glory of the clock. If you wish Lund a time spent at the Cathedral is a",
          "A beautiful building in a beautiful town. Well worth a visit to see the fantastic roof painting at the altar end. Lots of coffee shops around to sit in afterwards and take in the sights.",

          "Do check on visiting hours as the cathedral holds various services during the week. Although there are guided tours, we chose to wander through this ancient building on our own. Do not miss the lower level where the crypts have remained untouched since the 10th century. Amazing",
          "Very interesting building reflecting the turbulent history of Lund. Needs a guided tour to get the best out of it. Astronomical clock one of the finest and pre-dates Tyco de Brahe's earl observatory along the coast.",
          "Don't forget to visit the cellar with the Giant Finn, time it with the free guided tour, The long history of the Cathedral is very interesting. Also time it to see the vintage clock play",
          "We visited the very grand and beautiful Lund Cathedral and missed the tour, unfortunately. We were left to wander around and enjoy the impressive structure dating to 1145 but with no information to help us understand what we were seeing and the history. For example, the",

          "The visit was especially nice as a pastor was giving a free tour of the catherdrlal. He knew the history and made the tour most enjoyable. The amazing astral logiical clock is a must to watch open and hear the music.",
          "A lovely cathedral, not at all crowded. Don't miss the crypt. The entrance is to the right of the altar. We watched the 12noon astro clock. It only takes a couple of minutes. There was an explanation in Swedish and English. Next to the cathedral is a modern structure called The",

          "If you are passing through Lund, you must see this 1145 architectural masterpiece. Just breathtaking!",
          "What attracted us to this cathedral was the 5:00pm service in english. When we travel we are always curious about other churches. Lund cathedral has been around for a long time and you can feel the sense of history inside. The chancel area was interesting as there were many",

          "The cathedral stands spendidly in the centre of a square so there's room to admire its size. The inside is welcoming, very high and simple. To the left as you enter is the astronomical clock with the glockenspiel. This is worth a trip all of itself, but do take note of the times",

        "wiki": "Copenhagen (Danish: K\u00f8benhavn [k\u02b0\u00f8pm\u0329\u02c8h\u0251w\u02c0n] (listen)) is the capital and most populous city of Denmark. As of 1 January 2020, the city had a population of 794,128 with 632,340 in Copenhagen Municipality, 104,305 in Frederiksberg Municipality, 42,989 in T\u00e5rnby Municipality, and 14,494 in Drag\u00f8r Municipality. It forms the core of the wider urban area of Copenhagen (population 1,330,993) and the Copenhagen metropolitan area (population 2,057,142). Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of Zealand; another small portion of the city is located on Amager, and it is separated from Malm\u00f6, Sweden, by the strait of \u00d8resund. The \u00d8resund Bridge connects the two cities by rail and road.\nOriginally a Viking fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now Gammel Strand, Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. Beginning in the 17th century, it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions, defences and armed forces. During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the Kalmar Union, governing the entire present day Nordic region in a personal union with Sweden and Norway ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state. The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of Scandinavia under the union for well over 120 years, starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion. After a plague outbreak and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. After further disasters in the early 19th century when Horatio Nelson attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the Second World War, the Finger Plan fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.\nSince the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the cultural, economic and governmental centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the service sector, especially through initiatives in information technology, pharmaceuticals and clean technology. Since the completion of the \u00d8resund Bridge, Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of Scania and its largest city, Malm\u00f6, forming the \u00d8resund Region. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens, The Little Mermaid statue, the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces, Rosenborg Castle Gardens, Frederik's Church, and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions. The largest lake of Denmark, Arres\u00f8, lies around 27 miles (43 kilometers) northwest of the City Hall Square.\nCopenhagen is home to the University of Copenhagen, the Technical University of Denmark, Copenhagen Business School and the IT University of Copenhagen. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the FC K\u00f8benhavn and Br\u00f8ndby football clubs. The annual Copenhagen Marathon was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world.\nThe Copenhagen Metro, launched in 2002, serves central Copenhagen. Additionally the Copenhagen S-train, the Lokaltog (private railway) and the Coast Line network serve and connect central Copenhagen to outlying boroughs. Serving roughly two million passengers a month, Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup, is the busiest airport in the Nordic countries.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nCopenhagen's name reflects its origin as a harbour and a place of commerce. The original designation in Old Norse, from which Danish descends, was Kaupmannah\u01ebfn [\u02e1kaupman\u02d0ah\u0252vn] (cf. modern Icelandic: Kaupmannah\u00f6fn [\u02e1k\u02b0\u00f8yhpman\u02d0ah\u0153pn], Faroese Keypmannahavn), meaning \"merchants' harbour\". By the time Old Danish was spoken, the capital was called K\u00f8pmann\u00e6hafn, with the current name deriving from centuries of subsequent regular sound change. An exact English equivalent would be \"chapman's haven\". However, the English term for the city was adapted from its Low German name, Kopenhagen.\n(English chapman, German Kaufmann, Dutch koopman, Swedish k\u00f6pman, Danish k\u00f8bmand, Icelandic kaupma\u00f0ur: in all these words, the first syllable comes ultimately from Latin caupo, \"tradesman\".) Copenhagen's Swedish name is K\u00f6penhamn, a direct translation of the mutually intelligible Danish name.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nAlthough the earliest historical records of Copenhagen are from the end of the 12th century, recent archaeological finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's Kongens Nytorv from c. 1020. Excavations in Pilestr\u00e6de have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the 11th century, have been unearthed near where Str\u00f8get meets R\u00e5dhuspladsen.\nThese finds indicate that Copenhagen's origins as a city go back at least to the 11th century. Substantial discoveries of flint tools in the area provide evidence of human settlements dating to the Stone Age. Many historians believe the town dates to the late Viking Age, and was possibly founded by Sweyn I Forkbeard. \nThe natural harbour and good herring stocks seem to have attracted fishermen and merchants to the area on a seasonal basis from the 11th century and more permanently in the 13th century. The first habitations were probably centred on Gammel Strand (literally \"old shore\") in the 11th century or even earlier.The earliest written mention of the town was in the 12th century when Saxo Grammaticus in Gesta Danorum referred to it as Portus Mercatorum, meaning Merchants' Harbour or, in the Danish of the time, K\u00f8bmannahavn. Traditionally, Copenhagen's founding has been dated to Bishop Absalon's construction of a modest fortress on the little island of Slotsholmen in 1167 where Christiansborg Palace stands today. The construction of the fortress was in response to attacks by Wendish pirates who plagued the coastline during the 12th century. Defensive ramparts and moats were completed and by 1177 St. Clemens Church had been built. Attacks by the Germans continued, and after the original fortress was eventually destroyed by the marauders, islanders replaced it with Copenhagen Castle.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nIn 1186, a letter from Pope Urban III states that the castle of Hafn (Copenhagen) and its surrounding lands, including the town of Hafn, were given to Absalon, Bishop of Roskilde 1158\u20131191 and Archbishop of Lund 1177\u20131201, by King Valdemar I. On Absalon's death, the property was to come into the ownership of the Bishopric of Roskilde. Around 1200, the Church of Our Lady was constructed on higher ground to the northeast of the town, which began to develop around it.As the town became more prominent, it was repeatedly attacked by the Hanseatic League, and in 1368 successfully invaded during the Second Danish-Hanseatic War. As the fishing industry thrived in Copenhagen, particularly in the trade of herring, the city began expanding to the north of Slotsholmen. In 1254, it received a charter as a city under Bishop Jakob Erlandsen who garnered support from the local fishing merchants against the king by granting them special privileges. In the mid 1330s, the first land assessment of the city was published.With the establishment of the Kalmar Union (1397\u20131523) between Denmark, Norway and Sweden, by about 1416 Copenhagen had emerged as the capital of Denmark when Eric of Pomerania moved his seat to Copenhagen Castle. The University of Copenhagen was inaugurated on 1 June 1479 by King Christian I, following approval from Pope Sixtus IV. This makes it the oldest university in Denmark and one of the oldest in Europe. Originally controlled by the Catholic Church, the university's role in society was forced to change during the Reformation in Denmark in the late 1530s.\n\n\n=== 16th and 17th centuries ===\n\nIn disputes prior to the Reformation of 1536, the city which had been faithful to Christian II, who was Catholic, was successfully besieged in 1523 by the forces of Frederik I, who supported Lutheranism. Copenhagen's defences were reinforced with a series of towers along the city wall. After an extended siege from July 1535 to July 1536, during which the city supported Christian II's alliance with Malm\u00f6 and L\u00fcbeck, it was finally forced to capitulate to Christian III. During the second half of the century, the city prospered from increased trade across the Baltic supported by Dutch shipping. Christoffer Valkendorff, a high-ranking statesman, defended the city's interests and contributed to its development. The Netherlands had also become primarily Protestant, as were northern German states.\nDuring the reign of Christian IV between 1588 and 1648, Copenhagen had dramatic growth as a city. On his initiative at the beginning of the 17th century, two important buildings were completed on Slotsholmen: the T\u00f8jhus Arsenal and B\u00f8rsen, the stock exchange. To foster international trade, the East India Company was founded in 1616. To the east of the city, inspired by Dutch planning, the king developed the district of Christianshavn with canals and ramparts. It was initially intended to be a fortified trading centre but ultimately became part of Copenhagen. Christian IV also sponsored an array of ambitious building projects including Rosenborg Slot and the Rundet\u00e5rn. In 1658\u201359, the city withstood a siege by the Swedes under Charles X and successfully repelled a major assault.By 1661, Copenhagen had asserted its position as capital of Denmark and Norway. All the major institutions were located there, as was the fleet and most of the army. The defences were further enhanced with the completion of the Citadel in 1664 and the extension of Christianshavns Vold with its bastions in 1692, leading to the creation of a new base for the fleet at Nyholm.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\n\nCopenhagen lost around 22,000 of its population of 65,000 to the plague in 1711. The city was also struck by two major fires which destroyed much of its infrastructure. The Copenhagen Fire of 1728 was the largest in the history of Copenhagen. It began on the evening of 20 October, and continued to burn until the morning of 23 October, destroying approximately 28% of the city, leaving some 20% of the population homeless. No less than 47% of the medieval section of the city was completely lost. Along with the 1795 fire, it is the main reason that few traces of the old town can be found in the modern city.A substantial amount of rebuilding followed. In 1733, work began on the royal residence of Christiansborg Palace which was completed in 1745. In 1749, development of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden was initiated. Designed by Nicolai Eigtved in the Rococo style, its centre contained the mansions which now form Amalienborg Palace. Major extensions to the naval base of Holmen were undertaken while the city's cultural importance was enhanced with the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts.In the second half of the 18th century, Copenhagen benefited from Denmark's neutrality during the wars between Europe's main powers, allowing it to play an important role in trade between the states around the Baltic Sea. After Christiansborg was destroyed by fire in 1794 and another fire caused serious damage to the city in 1795, work began on the classical Copenhagen landmark of H\u00f8jbro Plads while Nytorv and Gammel Torv were converged.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nOn 2 April 1801, a British fleet under the command of Admiral Sir Hyde Parker attacked and defeated the neutral Danish-Norwegian fleet anchored near Copenhagen. Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson led the main attack. He famously disobeyed Parker's order to withdraw, destroying many of the Dano-Norwegian ships before a truce was agreed. Copenhagen is often considered to be Nelson's hardest-fought battle, surpassing even the heavy fighting at Trafalgar. It was during this battle that Lord Nelson was said to have \"put the telescope to the blind eye\" in order not to see Admiral Parker's signal to cease fire.\n\nThe Second Battle of Copenhagen (or the Bombardment of Copenhagen) (16 August \u2013 5 September 1807) was from a British point of view a preemptive attack on Copenhagen, targeting the civilian population to yet again seize the Dano-Norwegian fleet. But from a Danish point of view the battle was a terror bombardment on their capital. Particularly notable was the use of incendiary Congreve rockets (containing phosphorus, which cannot be extinguished with water) that randomly hit the city. Few houses with straw roofs remained after the bombardment. The largest church, Vor frue kirke, was destroyed by the sea artillery. Several historians consider this battle the first terror attack against a major European city in modern times.\n\nThe British landed 30,000 men, they surrounded Copenhagen and the attack continued for the next three days, killing some 2,000 civilians and destroying most of the city. The devastation was so great because Copenhagen relied on an old defence-line whose limited range could not reach the British ships and their longer-range artillery.Despite the disasters of the early 19th century, Copenhagen experienced a period of intense cultural creativity known as the Danish Golden Age. Painting prospered under C.W. Eckersberg and his students while C.F. Hansen and Gottlieb Bindesb\u00f8ll brought a Neoclassical look to the city's architecture. In the early 1850s, the ramparts of the city were opened to allow new housing to be built around The Lakes (Danish: S\u00f8erne) that bordered the old defences to the west. By the 1880s, the districts of N\u00f8rrebro and Vesterbro developed to accommodate those who came from the provinces to participate in the city's industrialization. This dramatic increase of space was long overdue, as not only were the old ramparts out of date as a defence system but bad sanitation in the old city had to be overcome. From 1886, the west rampart (Vestvolden) was flattened, allowing major extensions to the harbour leading to the establishment of the Freeport of Copenhagen 1892\u201394. Electricity came in 1892 with electric trams in 1897. The spread of housing to areas outside the old ramparts brought about a huge increase in the population. In 1840, Copenhagen was inhabited by approximately 120,000 people. By 1901, it had some 400,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, Copenhagen had become a thriving industrial and administrative city. With its new city hall and railway station, its centre was drawn towards the west. New housing developments grew up in Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j and Valby while Frederiksberg became an enclave within the city of Copenhagen. The northern part of Amager and Valby were also incorporated into the City of Copenhagen in 1901\u201302.As a result of Denmark's neutrality in the First World War, Copenhagen prospered from trade with both Britain and Germany while the city's defences were kept fully manned by some 40,000 soldiers for the duration of the war.In the 1920s there were serious shortages of goods and housing. Plans were drawn up to demolish the old part of Christianshavn and to get rid of the worst of the city's slum areas. However, it was not until the 1930s that substantial housing developments ensued, with the demolition of one side of Christianhavn's Torvegade to build five large blocks of flats.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\n\nIn Denmark during World War II, Copenhagen was occupied by German troops along with the rest of the country from 9 April 1940 until 4 May 1945. German leader Adolf Hitler hoped that Denmark would be \"a model protectorate\" and initially the Nazi authorities sought to arrive at an understanding with the Danish government. The 1943 Danish parliamentary election was also allowed to take place, with only the Communist Party excluded. But in August 1943, after the government's collaboration with the occupation forces collapsed, several ships were sunk in Copenhagen Harbor by the Royal Danish Navy to prevent their use by the Germans. Around that time the Nazis started to arrest Jews, although most managed to escape to Sweden.In 1945 Ole Lippman, leader of the Danish section of the Special Operations Executive, invited the British Royal Air Force to assist their operations by attacking Nazi headquarters in Copenhagen. Accordingly, air vice-marshal Sir Basil Embry drew up plans for a spectacular precision attack on the Sicherheitsdienst and Gestapo building, the former offices of the Shell Oil Company. Political prisoners were kept in the attic to prevent an air raid, so the RAF had to bomb the lower levels of the building.The attack, known as \"Operation Carthage\", came on 22 March 1945, in three small waves. In the first wave, all six planes (carrying one bomb each) hit their target, but one of the aircraft crashed near Frederiksberg Girls School. Because of this crash, four of the planes in the two following waves assumed the school was the military target and aimed their bombs at the school, leading to the death of 123 civilians (of which 87 were schoolchildren). However, 18 of the 26 political prisoners in the Shell Building managed to escape while the Gestapo archives were completely destroyed.On 8 May 1945 Copenhagen was officially liberated by British troops commanded by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery who supervised the surrender of 30,000 Germans situated around the capital.\n\n\n==== Post-war decades ====\nShortly after the end of the war, an innovative urban development project known as the Finger Plan was introduced in 1947, encouraging the creation of new housing and businesses interspersed with large green areas along five \"fingers\" stretching out from the city centre along the S-train routes. With the expansion of the welfare state and women entering the work force, schools, nurseries, sports facilities and hospitals were established across the city. As a result of student unrest in the late 1960s, the former B\u00e5dsmandsstr\u00e6de Barracks in Christianshavn was occupied, leading to the establishment of Freetown Christiania in September 1971.Motor traffic in the city grew significantly and in 1972 the trams were replaced by buses. From the 1960s, on the initiative of the young architect Jan Gehl, pedestrian streets and cycle tracks were created in the city centre. Activity in the port of Copenhagen declined with the closure of the Holmen Naval Base. Copenhagen Airport underwent considerable expansion, becoming a hub for the Nordic countries. In the 1990s, large-scale housing developments were realized in the harbour area and in the west of Amager. The national library's Black Diamond building on the waterfront was completed in 1999.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nSince the summer of 2000, Copenhagen and the Swedish city of Malm\u00f6 have been connected by the \u00d8resund Bridge, which carries rail and road traffic. As a result, Copenhagen has become the centre of a larger metropolitan area spanning both nations. The bridge has brought about considerable changes in the public transport system and has led to the extensive redevelopment of Amager. The city's service and trade sectors have developed while a number of banking and financial institutions have been established. Educational institutions have also gained importance, especially the University of Copenhagen with its 35,000 students. Another important development for the city has been the Copenhagen Metro, the railway system which opened in 2002 with additions until 2007, transporting some 54 million passengers by 2011.On the cultural front, the Copenhagen Opera House, a gift to the city from the shipping magnate M\u00e6rsk Mc-Kinney M\u00f8ller on behalf of the A.P. M\u00f8ller foundation, was completed in 2004. In December 2009 Copenhagen gained international prominence when it hosted the worldwide climate meeting COP15.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nCopenhagen is part of the \u00d8resund Region, which consists of Zealand, Lolland-Falster and Bornholm in Denmark and Scania in Sweden. It is located on the eastern shore of the island of Zealand, partly on the island of Amager and on a number of natural and artificial islets between the two. Copenhagen faces the \u00d8resund to the east, the strait of water that separates Denmark from Sweden, and which connects the North Sea with the Baltic Sea. The Swedish towns of Malm\u00f6 and Landskrona lie on the Swedish side of the sound directly across from Copenhagen. By road, Copenhagen is 42 kilometres (26 mi) northwest of Malm\u00f6, Sweden, 85 kilometres (53 mi) northeast of N\u00e6stved, 164 kilometres (102 mi) northeast of Odense, 295 kilometres (183 mi) east of Esbjerg and 188 kilometres (117 mi) southeast of Aarhus by sea and road via Sj\u00e6llands Odde.The city centre lies in the area originally defined by the old ramparts, which are still referred to as the Fortification Ring (F\u00e6stningsringen) and kept as a partial green band around it. Then come the late-19th- and early-20th-century residential neighbourhoods of \u00d8sterbro, N\u00f8rrebro, Vesterbro and Amagerbro. The outlying areas of Kongens Enghave, Valby, Vigerslev, Vanl\u00f8se, Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j, Utterslev and Sundby followed from 1920 to 1960. They consist mainly of residential housing and apartments often enhanced with parks and greenery.\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nThe central area of the city consists of relatively low-lying flat ground formed by moraines from the last ice age while the hilly areas to the north and west frequently rise to 50 m (160 ft) above sea level. The slopes of Valby and Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j reach heights of over 30 m (98 ft), divided by valleys running from the northeast to the southwest. Close to the centre are the Copenhagen lakes of Sortedams S\u00f8, Peblinge S\u00f8 and Sankt J\u00f8rgens S\u00f8.Copenhagen rests on a subsoil of flint-layered limestone deposited in the Danian period some 60 to 66 million years ago. Some greensand from the Selandian is also present. There are a few faults in the area, the most important of which is the Carlsberg fault which runs northwest to southeast through the centre of the city. During the last ice age, glaciers eroded the surface leaving a layer of moraines up to 15 m (49 ft) thick.Geologically, Copenhagen lies in the northern part of Denmark where the land is rising because of post-glacial rebound.\n\n\n=== Beaches ===\n\nAmager Strandpark, which opened in 2005, is a 2 km (1 mi) long artificial island, with a total of 4.6 km (2.9 mi) of beaches. It is located just 15 minutes by bicycle or a few minutes by metro from the city centre. In Klampenborg, about 10 kilometers from downtown Copenhagen, is Bellevue Beach. It is 700 metres (2,300 ft) long and has both lifeguards and freshwater showers on the beach.The beaches are supplemented by a system of Harbour Baths along the Copenhagen waterfront. The first and most popular of these is located at Islands Brygge and has won international acclaim for its design.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nCopenhagen is in the oceanic climate zone (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb\u202f). Its weather is subject to low-pressure systems from the Atlantic which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Apart from slightly higher rainfall from July to September, precipitation is moderate. While snowfall occurs mainly from late December to early March, there can also be rain, with average temperatures around the freezing point.June is the sunniest month of the year with an average of about eight hours of sunshine a day. July is the warmest month with an average daytime high of 21 \u00b0C. By contrast, the average hours of sunshine are less than two per day in November and only one and a half per day from December to February. In the spring, it gets warmer again with four to six hours of sunshine per day from March to May. February is the driest month of the year. Exceptional weather conditions can bring as much as 50 cm of snow to Copenhagen in a 24-hour period during the winter months while summer temperatures have been known to rise to heights of 33 \u00b0C (91 \u00b0F).Because of Copenhagen's northern latitude, the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight. There is therefore a difference of 10 hours and 31 minutes in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nAccording to Statistics Denmark, the urban area of Copenhagen (Hovedstadsomr\u00e5det) consists of the municipalities of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Albertslund, Br\u00f8ndby, Gentofte, Gladsaxe, Glostrup, Herlev, Hvidovre, Lyngby-Taarb\u00e6k, R\u00f8dovre, T\u00e5rnby and Vallensb\u00e6k as well as parts of Ballerup, Rudersdal and Fures\u00f8 municipalities, along with the cities of Ish\u00f8j and Greve Strand. They are located in the Capital Region (Region Hovedstaden). Municipalities are responsible for a wide variety of public services, which include land-use planning, environmental planning, public housing, management and maintenance of local roads, and social security. Municipal administration is also conducted by a mayor, a council, and an executive.Copenhagen Municipality is by far the largest municipality, with the historic city at its core. The seat of Copenhagen's municipal council is the Copenhagen City Hall (R\u00e5dhus), which is situated on City Hall Square. The second largest municipality is Frederiksberg, an enclave within Copenhagen Municipality.\nCopenhagen Municipality is divided into ten districts (bydele): Indre By, \u00d8sterbro, N\u00f8rrebro, Vesterbro/Kongens Enghave, Valby, Vanl\u00f8se, Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j-Husum, Bispebjerg, Amager \u00d8st, and Amager Vest. Neighbourhoods of Copenhagen include Slotsholmen, Frederiksstaden, Islands Brygge, Holmen, Christiania, Carlsberg, Sluseholmen, Sydhavn, Amagerbro, \u00d8restad, Nordhavnen, Bellah\u00f8j, Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j, Ryparken, and Vigerslev.\n\n\n=== Law and order ===\nMost of Denmark's top legal courts and institutions are based in Copenhagen. A modern style court of justice, Hof- og Stadsretten, was introduced in Denmark, specifically for Copenhagen, by Johann Friedrich Struensee in 1771. Now known as the City Court of Copenhagen (K\u00f8benhavns Byret), it is the largest of the 24 city courts in Denmark with jurisdiction over the municipalities of Copenhagen, Drag\u00f8r and T\u00e5rnby. With its 42 judges, it has a Probate Division, an Enforcement Division and a Registration and Notorial Acts Division while bankruptcy is handled by the Maritime and Commercial Court of Copenhagen. Established in 1862, the Maritime and Commercial Court (S\u00f8- og Handelsretten) also hears commercial cases including those relating to trade marks, marketing practices and competition for the whole of Denmark. Denmark's Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret), located in Christiansborg Palace on Prins J\u00f8rgens G\u00e5rd in the centre of Copenhagen, is the country's final court of appeal. Handling civil and criminal cases from the subordinate courts, it has two chambers which each hear all types of cases.The Danish National Police and Copenhagen Police headquarters is situated in the Neoclassical-inspired Politig\u00e5rden building built in 1918\u201324 under architects Hack Kampmann and Holger Alfred Jacobsen. The building also contains administration, management, emergency department and radio service offices. In their efforts to deal with drugs, the police have noted considerable success in the two special drug consumption rooms opened by the city where addicts can use sterile needles and receive help from nurses if necessary. Use of these rooms does not lead to prosecution; the city treats drug use as a public health issue, not a criminal one.The Copenhagen Fire Department forms the largest municipal fire brigade in Denmark with some 500 fire and ambulance personnel, 150 administration and service workers, and 35 workers in prevention. The brigade began as the Copenhagen Royal Fire Brigade on 9 July 1687 under King Christian V. After the passing of the Copenhagen Fire Act on 18 May 1868, on 1 August 1870 the Copenhagen Fire Brigade became a municipal institution in its own right. The fire department has its headquarters in the Copenhagen Central Fire Station which was designed by Ludvig Fenger in the Historicist style and inaugurated in 1892.\n\n\n=== Environmental planning ===\n\nCopenhagen is recognized as one of the most environmentally friendly cities in the world. As a result of its commitment to high environmental standards, Copenhagen has been praised for its green economy, ranked as the top green city for the second time in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index (GGEI). In 2001 a large offshore wind farm was built just off the coast of Copenhagen at Middelgrunden. It produces about 4% of the city's energy. Years of substantial investment in sewage treatment have improved water quality in the harbour to an extent that the inner harbour can be used for swimming with facilities at a number of locations.\n\nCopenhagen aims to be carbon-neutral by 2025. Commercial and residential buildings are to reduce electricity consumption by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively, and total heat consumption is to fall by 20 percent by 2025. Renewable energy features such as solar panels are becoming increasingly common in the newest buildings in Copenhagen. District heating will be carbon-neutral by 2025, by waste incineration and biomass. New buildings must now be constructed according to Low Energy Class ratings and in 2020 near net-zero energy buildings. By 2025, 75% of trips should be made on foot, by bike, or by using public transit. The city plans that 20\u201330% of cars will run on electricity or biofuel by 2025. The investment is estimated at $472 million public funds and $4.78 billion private funds.The city's urban planning authorities continue to take full account of these priorities. Special attention is given both to climate issues and efforts to ensure maximum application of low-energy standards. Priorities include sustainable drainage systems, recycling rainwater, green roofs and efficient waste management solutions. In city planning, streets and squares are to be designed to encourage cycling and walking rather than driving. Further, the city administration is working with smart city initiatives to improve how data and technology can be used to implement new solutions that support the transition toward a carbon-neutral economy. These solutions support operations covered by the city administration to improve e.g. public health, district heating, urban mobility and waste management systems. Smart city operations in Copenhagen are maintained by Copenhagen Solutions Lab, the city's official smart-city development unit under the Technical and Environmental Administration.\n\n\n== Demographics and society ==\n\nCopenhagen is the most populous city in Denmark and one of the most populous in the Nordic countries. For statistical purposes, Statistics Denmark considers the City of Copenhagen (Byen K\u00f8benhavn) to consist of the Municipality of Copenhagen plus three adjacent municipalities: Drag\u00f8r, Frederiksberg, and T\u00e5rnby. Their combined population stands at 763,908 (as of December 2016).The Municipality of Copenhagen is by far the most populous in the country and one of the most populous Nordic municipalities with 601,448 inhabitants (as of December 2016). There was a demographic boom in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, largely due to immigration to Denmark. According to figures from the first quarter of 2016, approximately 76% of the municipality's population was of Danish descent, defined as having at least one parent who was born in Denmark and has Danish citizenship. Much of the remaining 24% were of a foreign background, defined as immigrants (18%) or descendants of recent immigrants (6%). There are no official statistics on ethnic groups. The adjacent table shows the most common countries of birth of Copenhagen residents.\nAccording to Statistics Denmark, Copenhagen's urban area has a larger population of 1,280,371 (as of 1 January 2016). The urban area consists of the municipalities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg plus 16 of the 20 municipalities of the former counties Copenhagen and Roskilde, though five of them only partially. Metropolitan Copenhagen has a total of 2,016,285 inhabitants (as of 2016). The area of Metropolitan Copenhagen is defined by the Finger Plan. Since the opening of the \u00d8resund Bridge in 2000, commuting between Zealand and Scania in Sweden has increased rapidly, leading to a wider, integrated area. Known as the \u00d8resund Region, it has 3.8 million inhabitants (of whom 2.5 million live in the Danish part of the region).\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nA majority (56.9%) of those living in Copenhagen are members of the Lutheran Church of Denmark which is 0.6% lower than one year earlier according to 2019 figures. The National Cathedral, the Church of Our Lady, is one of the dozens of churches in Copenhagen. There are also several other Christian communities in the city, of which the largest is Roman Catholic.Foreign migration to Copenhagen, rising over the last three decades, has contributed to increasing religious diversity; the Grand Mosque of Copenhagen, the first in Denmark, opened in 2014. Islam is the second largest religion in Copenhagen, accounting for approximately 10% of the population. While there are no official statistics, a significant portion of the estimated 175,000\u2013200,000 Muslims in the country live in the Copenhagen urban area, with the highest concentration in N\u00f8rrebro and the Vestegnen. There are also some 7,000 Jews in Denmark, most of them in the Copenhagen area where there are several synagogues. There is a long history of Jews in the city, and the first synagogue in Copenhagen was built in 1684. Today, the history of the Jews of Denmark can be explored at the Danish Jewish Museum in Copenhagen.\n\n\n=== Quality of living ===\nFor a number of years, Copenhagen has ranked high in international surveys for its quality of life. Its stable economy together with its education services and level of social safety make it attractive for locals and visitors alike. Although it is one of the world's most expensive cities, it is also one of the most liveable with its public transport, facilities for cyclists and its environmental policies. In elevating Copenhagen to \"most liveable city\" in 2013, Monocle pointed to its open spaces, increasing activity on the streets, city planning in favour of cyclists and pedestrians, and features to encourage inhabitants to enjoy city life with an emphasis on community, culture and cuisine. Other sources have ranked Copenhagen high for its business environment, accessibility, restaurants and environmental planning. However, Copenhagen ranks only 39th for student friendliness in 2012. Despite a top score for quality of living, its scores were low for employer activity and affordability.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nCopenhagen is the major economic and financial centre of Denmark. The city's economy is based largely on services and commerce. Statistics for 2010 show that the vast majority of the 350,000 workers in Copenhagen are employed in the service sector, especially transport and communications, trade, and finance, while less than 10,000 work in the manufacturing industries. The public sector workforce is around 110,000, including education and healthcare. From 2006 to 2011, the economy grew by 2.5% in Copenhagen, while it fell by some 4% in the rest of Denmark. In 2017, the wider Capital Region of Denmark had a gross domestic product (GDP) of \u20ac120 billion, and the 15th largest GDP per capita of regions in the European Union.\n\nSeveral financial institutions and banks have headquarters in Copenhagen, including Alm. Brand, Danske Bank, Nykredit and Nordea Bank Danmark. The Copenhagen Stock Exchange (CSE) was founded in 1620 and is now owned by Nasdaq, Inc.. Copenhagen is also home to a number of international companies including A.P. M\u00f8ller-M\u00e6rsk, Novo Nordisk, Carlsberg and Novozymes. City authorities have encouraged the development of business clusters in several innovative sectors, which include information technology, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, clean technology and smart city solutions.\n\nLife science is a key sector with extensive research and development activities. Medicon Valley is a leading bi-national life sciences cluster in Europe, spanning the \u00d8resund Region. Copenhagen is rich in companies and institutions with a focus on research and development within the field of biotechnology, and the Medicon Valley initiative aims to strengthen this position and to promote cooperation between companies and academia. Many major Danish companies like Novo Nordisk and Lundbeck, both of which are among the 50 largest pharmaceutical and biotech companies in the world, are located in this business cluster.Shipping is another import sector with Maersk, the world's largest shipping company, having their world headquarters in Copenhagen. The city has an industrial harbour, Copenhagen Port. Following decades of stagnation, it has experienced a resurgence since 1990 following a merger with Malm\u00f6 harbour. Both ports are operated by Copenhagen Malm\u00f6 Port (CMP). The central location in the \u00d8resund Region allows the ports to act as a hub for freight that is transported onward to the Baltic countries. CMP annually receives about 8,000 ships and handled some 148,000 TEU in 2012.Copenhagen has some of the highest gross wages in the world. High taxes mean that wages are reduced after mandatory deduction. A beneficial researcher scheme with low taxation of foreign specialists has made Denmark an attractive location for foreign labour. It is however also among the most expensive cities in Europe.Denmark's Flexicurity model features some of the most flexible hiring and firing legislation in Europe, providing attractive conditions for foreign investment and international companies looking to locate in Copenhagen. In Dansk Industri's 2013 survey of employment factors in the ninety-six municipalities of Denmark, Copenhagen came in first place for educational qualifications and for the development of private companies in recent years, but fell to 86th place in local companies' assessment of the employment climate. The survey revealed considerable dissatisfaction in the level of dialogue companies enjoyed with the municipal authorities.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism is a major contributor to Copenhagen's economy, attracting visitors due to the city's harbour, cultural attractions and award-winning restaurants. Since 2009, Copenhagen has been one of the fastest growing metropolitan destinations in Europe. Hotel capacity in the city is growing significantly. From 2009 to 2013, it experienced a 42% growth in international bed nights (total number of nights spent by tourists), tallying a rise of nearly 70% for Chinese visitors. The total number of bed nights in the Capital Region surpassed 9 million in 2013, while international bed nights reached 5 million.In 2010, it is estimated that city break tourism contributed to DKK 2 billion in turnover. However, 2010 was an exceptional year for city break tourism and turnover increased with 29% in that one year. 680,000 cruise passengers visited the port in 2015. In 2019 Copenhagen was ranked first among Lonely Planet's top ten cities to visit.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\nThe city's appearance today is shaped by the key role it has played as a regional centre for centuries. Copenhagen has a multitude of districts, each with its distinctive character and representing its own period. Other distinctive features of Copenhagen include the abundance of water, its many parks, and the bicycle paths that line most streets.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe oldest section of Copenhagen's inner city is often referred to as Middelalderbyen (the medieval city). However, the city's most distinctive district is Frederiksstaden, developed during the reign of Frederick V. It has the Amalienborg Palace at its centre and is dominated by the dome of Frederik's Church (or the Marble Church) and several elegant 18th-century Rococo mansions. The inner city includes Slotsholmen, a little island on which Christiansborg Palace stands and Christianshavn with its canals. B\u00f8rsen on Slotsholmen and Frederiksborg Palace in Hiller\u00f8d are prominent examples of the Dutch Renaissance style in Copenhagen. Around the historical city centre lies a band of congenial residential boroughs (Vesterbro, Inner N\u00f8rrebro, Inner \u00d8sterbro) dating mainly from late 19th century. They were built outside the old ramparts when the city was finally allowed to expand beyond its fortifications.Sometimes referred to as \"the City of Spires\", Copenhagen is known for its horizontal skyline, broken only by the spires and towers of its churches and castles. Most characteristic of all is the Baroque spire of the Church of Our Saviour with its narrowing external spiral stairway that visitors can climb to the top. Other important spires are those of Christiansborg Palace, the City Hall and the former Church of St. Nikolaj that now houses a modern art venue. Not quite so high are the Renaissance spires of Rosenborg Castle and the \"dragon spire\" of Christian IV's former stock exchange, so named because it resembles the intertwined tails of four dragons.Copenhagen is recognised globally as an exemplar of best practice urban planning. Its thriving mixed use city centre is defined by striking contemporary architecture, engaging public spaces and an abundance of human activity. These design outcomes have been deliberately achieved through careful replanning in the second half of the 20th century.\nRecent years have seen a boom in modern architecture in Copenhagen both for Danish architecture and for works by international architects. For a few hundred years, virtually no foreign architects had worked in Copenhagen, but since the turn of the millennium the city and its immediate surroundings have seen buildings and projects designed by top international architects. British design magazine Monocle named Copenhagen the World's best design city 2008.Copenhagen's urban development in the first half of the 20th century was heavily influenced by industrialisation. After World War II, Copenhagen Municipality adopted Fordism and repurposed its medieval centre to facilitate private automobile infrastructure in response to innovations in transport, trade and communication. Copenhagen's spatial planning in this time frame was characterised by the separation of land uses: an approach which requires residents to travel by car to access facilities of different uses.The boom in urban development and modern architecture has brought some changes to the city's skyline. A political majority has decided to keep the historical centre free of high-rise buildings, but several areas will see or have already seen massive urban development. \u00d8restad now has seen most of the recent development. Located near Copenhagen Airport, it currently boasts one of the largest malls in Scandinavia and a variety of office and residential buildings as well as the IT University and a high school.\n\n\n=== Parks, gardens and zoo ===\n\nCopenhagen is a green city with many parks, both large and small. King's Garden (Kongens Have), the garden of Rosenborg Castle, is the oldest and most frequented of them all. It was Christian IV who first developed its landscaping in 1606. Every year it sees more than 2.5 million visitors and in the summer months it is packed with sunbathers, picnickers and ballplayers. It serves as a sculpture garden with both a permanent display and temporary exhibits during the summer months. Also located in the city centre are the Botanical Gardens noted for their large complex of 19th-century greenhouses donated by Carlsberg founder J. C. Jacobsen. F\u00e6lledparken at 58 ha (140 acres) is the largest park in Copenhagen.It is popular for sports fixtures and hosts several annual events including a free opera concert at the opening of the opera season, other open-air concerts, carnival and Labour Day celebrations, and the Copenhagen Historic Grand Prix, a race for antique cars. A historical green space in the northeastern part of the city is Kastellet, a well-preserved Renaissance citadel that now serves mainly as a park. Another popular park is the Frederiksberg Gardens, a 32-hectare romantic landscape park. It houses a colony of tame grey herons and other waterfowl. The park offers views of the elephants and the elephant house designed by world-famous British architect Norman Foster of the adjacent Copenhagen Zoo. Langelinie, a park and promenade along the inner \u00d8resund coast, is home to one of Copenhagen's most-visited tourist attractions, the Little Mermaid statue.In Copenhagen, many cemeteries double as parks, though only for the more quiet activities such as sunbathing, reading and meditation. Assistens Cemetery, the burial place of Hans Christian Andersen, is an important green space for the district of Inner N\u00f8rrebro and a Copenhagen institution. The lesser known Vestre Kirkegaard is the largest cemetery in Denmark (54 ha (130 acres)) and offers a maze of dense groves, open lawns, winding paths, hedges, overgrown tombs, monuments, tree-lined avenues, lakes and other garden features.It is official municipal policy in Copenhagen that by 2015 all citizens must be able to reach a park or beach on foot in less than 15 minutes. In line with this policy, several new parks, including the innovative Superkilen in the N\u00f8rrebro district, have been completed or are under development in areas lacking green spaces.\n\n\n=== Landmarks by district ===\n\n\n==== Indre By ====\nThe historic centre of the city, Indre By or the Inner City, features many of Copenhagen's most popular monuments and attractions. The area known as Frederiksstaden, developed by Frederik V in the second half of the 18th century in the Rococo style, has the four mansions of Amalienborg, the royal residence, and the wide-domed Marble Church at its centre. Directly across the water from Amalienborg, the recently completed Copenhagen Opera stands on the island of Holmen. To the south of Frederiksstaden, the Nyhavn canal is lined with colourful houses from the 17th and 18th centuries, many now with lively restaurants and bars. The canal runs from the harbour front to the spacious square of Kongens Nytorv which was laid out by Christian V in 1670. Important buildings include Charlottenborg Palace, famous for its art exhibitions, the Thott Palace (now the French embassy), the Royal Danish Theatre and the Hotel D'Angleterre, dated to 1755. Other landmarks in Indre By include the parliament building of Christiansborg, the City Hall and Rundet\u00e5rn, originally an observatory. There are also several museums in the area including Thorvaldsen Museum dedicated to the 18th-century sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. Closed to traffic since 1964, Str\u00f8get, the world's oldest and longest pedestrian street, runs the 3.2 km (2.0 mi) from R\u00e5dhuspladsen to Kongens Nytorv. With its speciality shops, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, and buskers, it is always full of life and includes the old squares of Gammel Torv and Amagertorv, each with a fountain. Rosenborg Castle on \u00d8ster Voldgade was built by Christian IV in 1606 as a summer residence in the Renaissance style. It houses the Danish crown jewels and crown regalia, the coronation throne and tapestries illustrating Christian V's victories in the Scanian War.\n\n\n==== Christianshavn ====\n\nChristianshavn lies to the southeast of Indre By on the other side of the harbour. The area was developed by Christian IV in the early 17th century. Impressed by the city of Amsterdam, he employed Dutch architects to create canals within its ramparts which are still well preserved today. The canals themselves, branching off the central Christianshavn Canal and lined with house boats and pleasure craft are one of the area's attractions. Another interesting feature is Freetown Christiania, a fairly large area which was initially occupied by squatters during student unrest in 1971. Today it still maintains a measure of autonomy. The inhabitants openly sell drugs on \"Pusher Street\" as well as their arts and crafts. Other buildings of interest in Christianshavn include the Church of Our Saviour with its spiralling steeple and the magnificent Rococo Christian's Church. Once a warehouse, the North Atlantic House now displays culture from Iceland and Greenland and houses the Noma restaurant, known for its Nordic cuisine.\n\n\n==== Vesterbro ====\n\nVesterbro, to the southwest of Indre By, begins with the Tivoli Gardens, the city's top tourist attraction with its fairground atmosphere, its Pantomime Theatre, its Concert Hall and its many rides and restaurants. The Carlsberg neighbourhood has some interesting vestiges of the old brewery of the same name including the Elephant Gate and the Ny Carlsberg Brewhouse. The Tycho Brahe Planetarium is located on the edge of Skt. J\u00f8rgens S\u00f8, one of the Copenhagen lakes. Halmtorvet, the old haymarket behind the Central Station, is an increasingly popular area with its caf\u00e9s and restaurants. The former cattle market \u00d8ksnehallen has been converted into a modern exhibition centre for art and photography. Radisson Blu Royal Hotel, built by Danish architect and designer Arne Jacobsen for the airline Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) between 1956 and 1960 was once the tallest hotel in Denmark with a height of 69.60 m (228.3 ft) and the city's only skyscraper until 1969. Completed in 1908, Det Ny Teater (the New Theatre) located in a passage between Vesterbrogade and Gammel Kongevej has become a popular venue for musicals since its reopening in 1994, attracting the largest audiences in the country.\n\n\n==== N\u00f8rrebro ====\n\nN\u00f8rrebro to the northwest of the city centre has recently developed from a working-class district into a colourful cosmopolitan area with antique shops, non-Danish food stores and restaurants. Much of the activity is centred on Sankt Hans Torv and around Rantzausgade. Copenhagen's historic cemetery, Assistens Kirkeg\u00e5rd halfway up N\u00f8rrebrogade, is the resting place of many famous figures including S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Niels Bohr, and Hans Christian Andersen but is also used by locals as a park and recreation area.\n\n\n==== \u00d8sterbro ====\n\nJust north of the city centre, \u00d8sterbro is an upper middle-class district with a number of fine mansions, some now serving as embassies. The district stretches from N\u00f8rrebro to the waterfront where The Little Mermaid statue can be seen from the promenade known as Langelinie. Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, it was created by Edvard Eriksen and unveiled in 1913. Not far from the Little Mermaid, the old Citadel (Kastellet) can be seen. Built by Christian IV, it is one of northern Europe's best preserved fortifications. There is also a windmill in the area. The large Gefion Fountain (Gefionspringvandet) designed by Anders Bundgaard and completed in 1908 stands close to the southeast corner of Kastellet. Its figures illustrate a Nordic legend.\n\n\n==== Frederiksberg ====\n\nFrederiksberg, a separate municipality within the urban area of Copenhagen, lies to the west of N\u00f8rrebro and Indre By and north of Vesterbro. Its landmarks include Copenhagen Zoo founded in 1869 with over 250 species from all over the world and Frederiksberg Palace built as a summer residence by Frederick IV who was inspired by Italian architecture. Now a military academy, it overlooks the extensive landscaped Frederiksberg Gardens with its follies, waterfalls, lakes and decorative buildings. The wide tree-lined avenue of Frederiksberg All\u00e9 connecting Vesterbrogade with the Frederiksberg Gardens has long been associated with theatres and entertainment. While a number of the earlier theatres are now closed, the Betty Nansen Theatre and Aveny-T are still active.\n\n\n==== Amagerbro ====\nAmagerbro (also known as S\u00f8nderbro) is the district located immediately south-east of Christianshavn at northernmost Amager. The old city moats and their surrounding parks constitute a clear border between these districts. The main street is Amagerbrogade which after the harbour bridge Langebro, is an extension of H. C. Andersens Boulevard and has a number of various stores and shops as well as restaurants and pubs. Amagerbro was built up during the two first decades of the twentieth century and is the city's northernmost block built area with typically 4\u20137 floors. Further south follows the Sundby\u00f8ster and Sundbyvester districts.\n\n\n==== Hellerup ====\n\nHellerup is the city's northernmost district with a central city feeling. It's located north of \u00d8sterbro and is known to be the perhaps most fashionable part of Copenhagen. Along Strandvejen (a street and further north a road leading to Elsinore) various shops, stores and restaurants are located. And by its crossing streets plenty of large villas are found. Hellerup is not a part of Copenhagen municipality, but constitutes the eastern parts of Gentofte. Hellerup is nevertheless a typical city environment without any notable bound towards the south.\n\n\n==== Other districts ====\nNot far from Copenhagen Airport on the Kastrup coast, The Blue Planet completed in March 2013 now houses the national aquarium. With its 53 aquariums, it is the largest facility of its kind in Scandinavia. Grundtvig's Church, located in the northern suburb of Bispebjerg, was designed by P.V. Jensen Klint and completed in 1940. A rare example of Expressionist church architecture, its striking west fa\u00e7ade is reminiscent of a church organ.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nApart from being the national capital, Copenhagen also serves as the cultural hub of Denmark and wider Scandinavia. Since the late 1990s, it has undergone a transformation from a modest Scandinavian capital into a metropolitan city of international appeal in the same league as Barcelona and Amsterdam. This is a result of huge investments in infrastructure and culture as well as the work of successful new Danish architects, designers and chefs. Copenhagen Fashion Week, the largest fashion event in Northern Europe, takes place every year in February and August.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nCopenhagen has a wide array of museums of international standing. The National Museum, Nationalmuseet, is Denmark's largest museum of archaeology and cultural history, comprising the histories of Danish and foreign cultures alike. Denmark's National Gallery (Statens Museum for Kunst) is the national art museum with collections dating from the 12th century to the present. In addition to Danish painters, artists represented in the collections include Rubens, Rembrandt, Picasso, Braque, L\u00e9ger, Matisse, Emil Nolde, Olafur Eliasson, Elmgreen and Dragset, Superflex and Jens Haaning.\n\nAnother important Copenhagen art museum is the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek founded by second generation Carlsberg philanthropist Carl Jacobsen and built around his personal collections. Its main focus is classical Egyptian, Roman and Greek sculptures and antiquities and a collection of Rodin sculptures, the largest outside France. Besides its sculpture collections, the museum also holds a comprehensive collection of paintings of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painters such as Monet, Renoir, C\u00e9zanne, van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec as well as works by the Danish Golden Age painters.Louisiana is a Museum of Modern Art situated on the coast just north of Copenhagen. It is located in the middle of a sculpture garden on a cliff overlooking \u00d8resund. Its collection of over 3,000 items includes works by Picasso, Giacometti and Dubuffet. The Danish Design Museum is housed in the 18th-century former Frederiks Hospital and displays Danish design as well as international design and crafts.Other museums include: the Thorvaldsens Museum, dedicated to the oeuvre of romantic Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen who lived and worked in Rome; the Cisternerne museum, an exhibition space for contemporary art, located in former cisterns that come complete with stalactites formed by the changing water levels; and the Ordrupgaard Museum, located just north of Copenhagen, which features 19th-century French and Danish art and is noted for its works by Paul Gauguin.\n\n\n=== Entertainment and performing arts ===\n\nThe new Copenhagen Concert Hall opened in January 2009. Designed by Jean Nouvel, it has four halls with the main auditorium seating 1,800 people. It serves as the home of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra and along with the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles is the most expensive concert hall ever built. Another important venue for classical music is the Tivoli Concert Hall located in the Tivoli Gardens. Designed by Henning Larsen, the Copenhagen Opera House (Operaen) opened in 2005. It is among the most modern opera houses in the world. The Royal Danish Theatre also stages opera in addition to its drama productions. It is also home to the Royal Danish Ballet. Founded in 1748 along with the theatre, it is one of the oldest ballet troupes in Europe, and is noted for its Bournonville style of ballet.\n\nCopenhagen has a significant jazz scene that has existed for many years. It developed when a number of American jazz musicians such as Ben Webster, Thad Jones, Richard Boone, Ernie Wilkins, Kenny Drew, Ed Thigpen, Bob Rockwell, Dexter Gordon, and others such as rock guitarist Link Wray came to live in Copenhagen during the 1960s. Every year in early July, Copenhagen's streets, squares, parks as well as caf\u00e9s and concert halls fill up with big and small jazz concerts during the Copenhagen Jazz Festival. One of Europe's top jazz festivals, the annual event features around 900 concerts at 100 venues with over 200,000 guests from Denmark and around the world.The largest venue for popular music in Copenhagen is Vega in the Vesterbro district. It was chosen as \"best concert venue in Europe\" by international music magazine Live. The venue has three concert halls: the great hall, Store Vega, accommodates audiences of 1,550, the middle hall, Lille Vega, has space for 500 and Ideal Bar Live has a capacity of 250. Every September since 2006, the Festival of Endless Gratitude (FOEG) has taken place in Copenhagen. This festival focuses on indie counterculture, experimental pop music and left field music combined with visual arts exhibitions.Copenhagen is home to the \"K-Town\" punk and hardcore music community. This community developed around the underground scene venue Ungdomshuset in the late 1990s punk scene, with punk- and hardcore acts such as Snipers, Amdi Petersens Arm\u00e9, Gorilla Angreb, Young Wasteners, and No Hope for the Kids emerging as significant bands. The term \"K-town\" got international recognition within the punk-scene with the emergence of \"K-Town\" festivals. In 2001, the first of these was held in Ungdomshuset, on Jagtvej 69, N\u00f8rrebro, Copenhagen. The festival temporarily moved to Freetown Christiania after Ungdomshuset was evicted from its original location until a new Ungdomshuset location was opened on Dortheavej 61.For free entertainment one can stroll along Str\u00f8get, especially between Nytorv and H\u00f8jbro Plads, which in the late afternoon and evening is a bit like an impromptu three-ring circus with musicians, magicians, jugglers and other street performers.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nMost of Denmarks's major publishing houses are based in Copenhagen. These include the book publishers Gyldendal and Akademisk Forlag and newspaper publishers Berlingske and Politiken (the latter also publishing books). Many of the most important contributors to Danish literature such as Hans Christian Andersen (1805\u20131875) with his fairy tales, the philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813\u20131855) and playwright Ludvig Holberg (1684\u20131754) spent much of their lives in Copenhagen. Novels set in Copenhagen include Baby (1973) by Kirsten Thorup, The Copenhagen Connection (1982) by Barbara Mertz, Number the Stars (1989) by Lois Lowry, Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow (1992) and Borderliners (1993) by Peter H\u00f8eg, Music and Silence (1999) by Rose Tremain, The Danish Girl (2000) by David Ebershoff, and Sharpe's Prey (2001) by Bernard Cornwell. Michael Frayn's 1998 play Copenhagen about the meeting between the physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in 1941 is also set in the city. On 15\u201318 August 1973, an oral literature conference took place in Copenhagen as part of the 9th International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences.The Royal Library, belonging to the University of Copenhagen, is the largest library in the Nordic countries with an almost complete collection of all printed Danish books since 1482. Founded in 1648, the Royal Library is located at four sites in the city, the main one being on the Slotsholmen waterfront. Copenhagen's public library network has over 20 outlets, the largest being the Central Library (K\u00f8benhavns Hovedbibliotek) on Krystalgade in the inner city.\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nCopenhagen has a wide selection of art museums and galleries displaying both historic works and more modern contributions. They include Statens Museum for Kunst, i.e. the Danish national art gallery, in the \u00d8stre Anl\u00e6g park, and the adjacent Hirschsprung Collection specialising in the 19th and early 20th century. Kunsthal Charlottenborg in the city centre exhibits national and international contemporary art. Den Frie Udstilling near the \u00d8sterport Station exhibits paintings created and selected by contemporary artists themselves rather than by the official authorities. The Arken Museum of Modern Art is located in southwestern Ish\u00f8j. Among artists who have painted scenes of Copenhagen are Martinus R\u00f8rbye (1803\u20131848), Christen K\u00f8bke (1810\u20131848) and the prolific Paul Gustav Fischer (1860\u20131934).A number of notable sculptures can be seen in the city. In addition to The Little Mermaid on the waterfront, there are two historic equestrian statues in the city centre: Jacques Saly's Frederik V on Horseback (1771) in Amalienborg Square and the statue of Christian V on Kongens Nytorv created by Abraham-C\u00e9sar Lamoureux in 1688 who was inspired by the statue of Louis XIII in Paris. Rosenborg Castle Gardens contains several sculptures and monuments including August Saabye's Hans Christian Andersen, Aksel Hansen's Echo, and Vilhelm Bissen's Dowager Queen Caroline Amalie.Copenhagen is believed to have invented the photomarathon photography competition, which has been held in the City each year since 1989.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nAs of 2014, Copenhagen has 15 Michelin-starred restaurants, the most of any Scandinavian city. The city is increasingly recognized internationally as a gourmet destination. These include Den R\u00f8de Cottage, Formel B Restaurant, Gr\u00f8nbech & Churchill, S\u00f8ller\u00f8d Kro, Kadeau, Kiin Kiin (Denmark's first Michelin-starred Asian gourmet restaurant), the French restaurant Kong Hans K\u00e6lder, Rel\u00e6, Restaurant AOC, Noma (short for Danish: nordisk mad, English: Nordic food) with two Stars and Geranium with three. Noma, was ranked as the Best Restaurant in the World by Restaurant in 2010, 2011, 2012, and again in 2014, sparking interest in the New Nordic Cuisine.Apart from the selection of upmarket restaurants, Copenhagen offers a great variety of Danish, ethnic and experimental restaurants. It is possible to find modest eateries serving open sandwiches, known as sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d \u2013 a traditional, Danish lunch dish; however, most restaurants serve international dishes. Danish pastry can be sampled from any of numerous bakeries found in all parts of the city. The Copenhagen Baker's Association dates back to the 1290s and Denmark's oldest confectioner's shop still operating, Conditori La Glace, was founded in 1870 in Skoubogade by Nicolaus Henningsen, a trained master baker from Flensburg.Copenhagen has long been associated with beer. Carlsberg beer has been brewed at the brewery's premises on the border between the Vesterbro and Valby districts since 1847 and has long been almost synonymous with Danish beer production. However, recent years have seen an explosive growth in the number of microbreweries so that Denmark today has more than 100 breweries, many of which are located in Copenhagen. Some like N\u00f8rrebro Bryghus also act as brewpubs where it is also possible to eat on the premises.\n\n\n=== Nightlife and festivals ===\n\nCopenhagen has one of the highest number of restaurants and bars per capita in the world. The nightclubs and bars stay open until 5 or 6 in the morning, some even longer. Denmark has a very liberal alcohol culture and a strong tradition for beer breweries, although binge drinking is frowned upon and the Danish Police take driving under the influence very seriously. Inner city areas such as Istedgade and Enghave Plads in Vesterbro, Sankt Hans Torv in N\u00f8rrebro and certain places in Frederiksberg are especially noted for their nightlife. Notable nightclubs include Bakken Kbh, ARCH (previously ZEN), Jolene, The Jane, Chateau Motel, KB3, At Dolores (previously Sunday Club), Rust, Vega Nightclub, Culture Box and Gef\u00e4hrlich, which also serves as a bar, caf\u00e9, restaurant, and art gallery.Copenhagen has several recurring community festivals, mainly in the summer. Copenhagen Carnival has taken place every year since 1982 during the Whitsun Holiday in F\u00e6lledparken and around the city with the participation of 120 bands, 2,000 dancers and 100,000 spectators. Since 2010, the old B&W Shipyard at Refshale\u00f8en in the harbour has been the location for Copenhell, a heavy metal rock music festival. Copenhagen Pride is a gay pride festival taking place every year in August. The Pride has a series of different activities all over Copenhagen, but it is at the City Hall Square that most of the celebration takes place. During the Pride the square is renamed Pride Square. Copenhagen Distortion has emerged to be one of the biggest street festivals in Europe with 100,000 people joining to parties in the beginning of June every year.\n\n\n=== Amusement parks ===\n\nCopenhagen has the two oldest amusement parks in the world.Dyrehavsbakken, a fair-ground and pleasure-park established in 1583, is located in Klampenborg just north of Copenhagen in a forested area known as Dyrehaven. Created as an amusement park complete with rides, games and restaurants by Christian IV, it is the oldest surviving amusement park in the world. Pierrot (Danish: Pjerrot), a nitwit dressed in white with a scarlet grin wearing a boat-like hat while entertaining children, remains one of the park's key attractions. In Danish, Dyrehavsbakken is often abbreviated as Bakken. There is no entrance fee to pay and Klampenborg Station on the C-line, is situated nearby.The Tivoli Gardens is an amusement park and pleasure garden located in central Copenhagen between the City Hall Square and the Central Station. It opened in 1843, making it the second oldest amusement park in the world. Among its rides are the oldest still operating rollercoaster Rutschebanen from 1915 and the oldest ferris wheel still in use, opened in 1943. Tivoli Gardens also serves as a venue for various performing arts and as an active part of the cultural scene in Copenhagen.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nCopenhagen has over 94,000 students enrolled in its largest universities and institutions: University of Copenhagen (38,867 students), Copenhagen Business School (19,999 students), Metropolitan University College and University College Capital (10,000 students each), Technical University of Denmark (7,000 students), KEA (c. 4,500 students), IT University of Copenhagen (2,000 students) and Aalborg University \u2013 Copenhagen (2,300 students).The University of Copenhagen is Denmark's oldest university founded in 1479.

It includes the historic School of Visual Arts, and has in later years come to include a School of Architecture, a School of Design and a School of Conservation. Copenhagen Business School (CBS) is an EQUIS-accredited business school located in Frederiksberg.\nThere are also branches of both University College Capital and Metropolitan University College inside and outside Copenhagen.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nThe city has a variety of sporting teams. The major football teams are the historically successful FC K\u00f8benhavn and Br\u00f8ndby. FC K\u00f8benhavn plays at Parken in \u00d8sterbro. Formed in 1992, it is a merger of two older Copenhagen clubs, B 1903 (from the inner suburb Gentofte) and KB (from Frederiksberg). Br\u00f8ndby plays at Br\u00f8ndby Stadion in the inner suburb of Br\u00f8ndbyvester. BK Frem is based in the southern part of Copenhagen (Sydhavnen, Valby). Other teams are FC Nordsj\u00e6lland (from suburban Farum), Fremad Amager, B93, AB, Lyngby and Hvidovre IF.\n\nCopenhagen has several handball teams\u2014a sport which is particularly popular in Denmark. Of clubs playing in the \"highest\" leagues, there are Ajax, Ydun, and HIK (Hellerup). The K\u00f8benhavn H\u00e5ndbold women's club has recently been established. Copenhagen also has ice hockey teams, of which three play in the top league, R\u00f8dovre Mighty Bulls, Herlev Eagles and Hvidovre Ligahockey all inner suburban clubs. Copenhagen Ice Skating Club founded in 1869 is the oldest ice hockey team in Denmark but is no longer in the top league.Rugby union is also played in the Danish capital with teams such as CSR-Nanok, Copenhagen Business School Sport Rugby, Frederiksberg RK, Exiles RUFC and Rugbyklubben Speed. Rugby league is now played in Copenhagen, with the national team playing out of Gentofte Stadion. The Danish Australian Football League, based in Copenhagen is the largest Australian rules football competition outside of the English-speaking world.Copenhagen Marathon, Copenhagen's annual marathon event, was established in 1980.Round Christiansborg Open Water Swim Race is a 2-kilometre (1.2-mile) open water swimming competition taking place each year in late August. This amateur event is combined with a 10-kilometre (6-mile) Danish championship. In 2009 the event included a 10-kilometre (6-mile) FINA World Cup competition in the morning. Copenhagen hosted the 2011 UCI Road World Championships in September 2011, taking advantage of its bicycle-friendly infrastructure. It was the first time that Denmark had hosted the event since 1956, when it was also held in Copenhagen.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nThe greater Copenhagen area has a very well established transportation infrastructure making it a hub in Northern Europe. Copenhagen Airport, opened in 1925, is Scandinavia's largest airport, located in Kastrup on the island of Amager. It is connected to the city centre by metro and main line railway services. October 2013 was a record month with 2.2 million passengers, and November 2013 figures reveal that the number of passengers is increasing by some 3% annually, about 50% more than the European average.\n\n\n=== Road, rail and ferry ===\nCopenhagen has an extensive road network including motorways connecting the city to other parts of Denmark and to Sweden over the \u00d8resund Bridge. The car is still the most popular form of transport within the city itself, representing two-thirds of all distances travelled. This can however lead to serious congestion in rush hour traffic. The \u00d8resund train links Copenhagen with Malm\u00f6  24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \nCopenhagen is also served by a daily ferry connection to Oslo in Norway. In 2012, Copenhagen Harbour handled 372 cruise ships and 840,000 passengers.The Copenhagen S-Train, Copenhagen Metro and the regional train networks are used by about half of the city's passengers, the remainder using bus services. N\u00f8rreport Station near the city centre serves passengers travelling by main-line rail, S-train, regional train, metro and bus. Some 750,000 passengers make use of public transport facilities every day. Copenhagen Central Station is the hub of the DSB railway network serving Denmark and international destinations.The Copenhagen Metro expanded radically with the opening of the City Circle Line (M3) on September 29, 2019. The new line connects all inner boroughs of the city by metro, including the Central Station, and opens up 17 new stations for Copenhageners. On March 28, 2020, the 2.2 km (1.4 mi) Nordhavn extension of the Harbour Line (M4) opened. Running from Copenhagen Central Station, the new extension is a branch line of M3 Cityring to Osterport. The M4 Sydhavn branch is expected to open in 2024. The new metro lines are part of the city's strategy to transform mobility towards sustainable modes of transport such as public transport and cycling as opposed to automobility.Copenhagen is cited by urban planners for its exemplary integration of public transport and urban development. In implementing its Finger Plan, Copenhagen is considered the world's first example of a transit metropolis, and areas around S-Train stations like Ballerup and Br\u00f8ndby Strand are among the earliest examples of transit-oriented development.\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\n\nCopenhaden has been rated as the most bicycle-friendly city in the world since 2015, with bicycles outnumbering its inhabitants. In 2012 some 36% of all working or studying city-dwellers cycled to work, school, or university. With 1.27 million km covered every working day by Copenhagen's cyclists (including both residents and commuters), and 75% of Copenhageners cycling throughout the year. The city's bicycle paths are extensive and well used, boasting 400 kilometres (250 miles) of cycle lanes not shared with cars or pedestrians, and sometimes have their own signal systems \u2013 giving the cyclists a lead of a couple of seconds to accelerate.\n\n\n== Healthcare ==\n\nPromoting health is an important issue for Copenhagen's municipal authorities. Central to its sustainability mission is its \"Long Live Copenhagen\" (L\u00e6nge Leve K\u00f8benhavn) scheme in which it has the goal of increasing the life expectancy of citizens, improving quality of life through better standards of health, and encouraging more productive lives and equal opportunities. The city has targets to encourage people to exercise regularly and to reduce the number who smoke and consume alcohol.Copenhagen University Hospital forms a conglomerate of several hospitals in Region Hovedstaden and Region Sj\u00e6lland, together with the faculty of health sciences at the University of Copenhagen; Rigshospitalet and Bispebjerg Hospital in Copenhagen belong to this group of university hospitals. Rigshospitalet began operating in March 1757 as Frederiks Hospital, and became state-owned in 1903. With 1,120 beds, Rigshospitalet has responsibility for 65,000 inpatients and approximately 420,000 outpatients annually. It seeks to be the number one specialist hospital in the country, with an extensive team of researchers into cancer treatment, surgery and radiotherapy. In addition to its 8,000 personnel, the hospital has training and hosting functions. It benefits from the presence of in-service students of medicine and other healthcare sciences, as well as scientists working under a variety of research grants. The hospital became internationally famous as the location of Lars von Trier's television horror mini-series The Kingdom. Bispebjerg Hospital was built in 1913, and serves about 400,000 people in the Greater Copenhagen area, with some 3,000 employees. Other large hospitals in the city include Amager Hospital (1997), Herlev Hospital (1976), Hvidovre Hospital (1970), and Gentofte Hospital (1927).\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nMany Danish media corporations are located in Copenhagen.

          "Great place. Animals live in good living conditions.",
          "Well layed out zoo with a good restaurant. The polar bear enclosure is excellent.",
          "It's a very nice zoo. Lots of different animals and their babies and you can be kinda close to them too. They brought two giant pandas recently which is a big attraction. Very fun place for the whole family.",
          "Amazing place to spend some time, especially with the kids. You will see a lot of different exotic animals there, such as flamingos(saw for the first time in my life, so beautiful creatures), baboon, lions, panda and many others. \u2026",
          "It's a nice zoo with beautiful scenery and some lively animals which look happy and well taken care for. If you do not have the Copenhagen pass the ticket itself is quite expensive but as is everything else in the city. Overall a good and enjoyable experience 7,61/10",
          "Beautiful place with animals in modern,  specifically designed enclosures. Many areas for taking a break, if only for a sit-down, lots of information in Danish and English, and lots of space for children. Also an area with a petting zoo.",
          "Really nice zoo. It takes around 3 hours, most of the animal enclosures are modern and as comfortable for the animals as possible. And.. Pandas \ud83d\ude42",
          "Sweet animals \nToo tight cage for pandas\nRained a lot when I was there but still nice experience",
          "This is properly the nicest zoo I ever have been in. The suroundings for the animals are good and everything seems very new. It is not cheap to get in but quality costs. Better to pay a bit more and give the animals a better life. \u2026",
          "Fantastic zoo, good space for the animals. Its clean i side the zoo and its just a overall good experience.",
          "A great zoo, which does a lot for the animals and also educate people in the environment and what you as an individual can do. Great enclosures for the animals, with activities for them. They also do a lot to educate people about the \u2026",
          "A great zoo with lots to see. Easy to spend a whole day there. Some of the enclosures appear a bit small for the animals, such as the bears. The staff were lovely there.",
          "Good place for the kids and they have a big playground and a small child zoo. Was there for the Christmas lights, an that is just amazing and beautiful.",
          "They do not take responsibility to ensure well-being of the animals. The giraffe story was really outrageous!",
          "Copenhagen Zoo is something special. Its mission is preservation, education and research. It makes money from entertainment and merchandise but when you are in there you can feel the difference. If you like zoos or got kids this is a must when you are visiting Copenhagen.",
          "Always worth a visit. We come here multiple times every year, and each visit is a unique experience. Come in autumn or spring on a not too hot day, and most animals will be super active. Come in winter to get full value at the different \u2026",
          "Great place for all ages also great food and not too expensive.",
          "It's a very lovely Zoo. You can see all kinds of animals and birds there. \ud83d\udc26\ud83d\udc30\ud83e\udd81\ud83e\udd8a\ud83d\udc05\ud83e\udd92 I enjoyed a lot there!!",
          "Well this the best zoo I had ever visited . Very very well maintained and well best attractions were polar bear , tiger and lion. I had never seen them safely at such close distance . Cheer to the zoo and its staff .",
          "Great place. Animals looks well looked after.",
          "One of the best Zoos I visited ever! Great balance between the animal places size and the amout of walking required to visit all the animals. The variety of their animal collection is amazing. Also, restaurants, cafes and bathroom services were excellent",
          "Very nice as always, but it would be nicer if there were more explanations about what is going on and who is who. For example we didn't know who the elephants were, what are their names, how old are they etc.  What is the new paved area near the kangaroos for..",
          "One of best Zoo\u2019s ever I have seen around the world . \nBest experience..\nHealthy animals...\nGood and pleasant atmosphere...\nKids friendly...\nAnd many more..",
          "Used to have an all year pass for this place. it was always fun to visit.",
          "This zoo is made very well. A lot of animals' spots are situated very compactly in a rather small area. So you will not get tired at the end of your adventure here. Paths are made very smart, so if you're not so interested in some animals \u2026",
          "I love zoos and Copenhagen zoo is the best zoo ever I visited. Go in summer guys",
          "We spent a nice afternoon visiting Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark. The zoo was only a tube and a bus ride away from the centre of Copenhagen. The zoo had a vast amount of animals, including lions, pandas and polar bears. We found the Copenhagen \u2026",
          "Great park, lots of animals in nice enclosures. Staff are willing to answer questions about the animals and to give facts. Food venues are great. Lots of toilets,  but they are not the cleanest..",
          "Nicely kept animals, the tropical section is especially impressive",
          "What seemed to be distinctive is that all animals look happy.\nClean, nice, taken care of. Focused on animals most people would like to see.\nVery good overall experience.\nNot sure if would visit again as have a feeling of seeing all. But maybe...",
          "The zoo it self is very interesting and the staff are helpful.",
          "Nice place to spend some time with kids outdoors. It's not very big but it's ideal to move around within a few hours. They borrow you kid's carts towards move them easily.",
          "Never seen so many of the more popular animals so clearly. Within an hour we had seen the polar bear and cub, leopard and cub, lioness and a Tiger and cubs. WOW.   And the sparrows are pretty brazen too!",
          "This is perhaps one of the most impressive zoological gardens we have seen. The number of animals and more importantly the comfort most seem to be given is very significant. Small ecosystems are created to offer animals varied conditions. \u2026",
          "Amazing place for family walking!Awesome atmosphere and good conditions for animals.",
          "pretty great zoo, there are a lot of restaurant choices around for family time after. the tiger pen with the carcass hung up was quite the sight to see.",
          "Loved it! Would be full stars for e.g. some animal shows or talks, and more info on what the zoo does for animal rights and how they care for and support this, etc. I would like to see those animals and leave that zoo with a feeling of \u2026",
          "I really enjoyed Copenhagen zoo. It had 2 animals I had never seen before, polar bears and pandas which I found an incredible experience to be able to see. You really felt like you were close to the animals but all the while they had plenty \u2026",
          "Ok, it\u2019s in the top 20 best zoos in the Europe. I do feel most animals are quite happy here, but not all of them. I didn\u2019t like the water color here I don\u2019t think you should be able to see only 6cm into the water when looking through the \u2026",
          "It was nice but we expected much bigger",
          "Such a niiiice zoo. The animals have big habitats to live in. You can walk among the kangaroos :) pandas are so cute. I really like that you can completely see the elephants and their whole area from the park next to. You don't even need to buy a ticket to the zoo to see them.",
          "A lovely zoo, and a wonderful day out with kids. Compared to England it's not that expensive either. Fun playground and goat pen you can go into to stroke the goats which the kids love.",
          "Perfect place to spend a couple of hours. Great variety of animals, most of them in pretty large enclosures (at least in comparison to some other zoos). \nAlso a lot of trees which makes your stay enjoyable on hot days during summer.",
          "Great zoo. You can easily spend a good day there. The new attractions are the pandas - which are extremely cute. Good variety of animals.",
          "Very good learning experience and a lot of cute animals",
          "Amazing place! Such a wide variety of animals. One can easily spend a day here and still have a few things left to see. Not to mention it's a great destination for families with kids. The little ones are going to love it here. The animals \u2026",
          "Great zoo got to see Polar bears",
          "The zoo was nicely built. The design and layout have been given much thought. There's a variety of animals in the zoo. The highlight of the zoo, the pandas were a big disappointment. They looked miserable and dirty. The saving grace was the \u2026",
          "It was interesting but when we visited it so was there some problems with water filetrs and we could not see hippos and all water was dark. They wrote that the animals did not mind it but still it was not a nice experience. The are is huge \u2026",
          "I have visited many zoos but this particular zoo was one of the best.",
          "Since Sweden doesn't have any pandas, we have to drive all the way to Copenhagen to see the lovely pandas. They are intensively adorable !!!!!! \nThe zoo is arranged in a very nice way so we can see lots of animals and birds. \nThe tropical \u2026",
          "Lots of space for the animals, very clean and exiting zoo, recommended for everybody who visit Copenhagen. Very nice place",
          "The wildest place in town! Got a season pass and is a frequent user. I very much like the place and will highly recommend it! Bring food though, as the prices for food and drinks are a bit high.",
          "Spent there almost 5 hours of delight. Really liked petting space with goats,rabbits and other small animals. It was great experience to walk under polar bear enclosure and see them playing in water, mesmerising. \nAltho i give them only 2 \u2026",
          "Absolutely Amazing Zoo. One of the best. \n\nIf you\u2019re visiting Copenhagen with your kids, or you love visiting Zoos then you should plan a visit. \nI liked that you can view the animals from different viewing points, clear views with minimum \u2026",
          "This is a wonderful zoo, really but it will be a must if the life place of some animals were better cleaned and maintained! (I think for example about the lions, the polar bear or the otters, the water is gross, for the lemur there's a toy-car in their pens, and they eat it..)",
          "Panda is very active eating bamboo shoots in front of everyone. Very special, HK pandas always sleeping behind rocks. Tokyo pandas rarely appear in public. Other animals are very happy in this zoo, lions, otters, polar bears always be seen happy around.",
          "I usually don't like zoos. But this one seems to treat the animals good. Lots of space for them. Worth going to see.",
          "The Copenhagen Zoo is one of the finest zoo's I have ever visited. The variety of animals, walking paths and viewing areas make it unique. Easy to get to from center city. Oh did I mention the new Panda exhibit? Yeah, very impressive. If you are visiting Copenhagen, add this to your mist see list.",
          "Luv this zoo soooo much! There are three eye-catching polar bears. You can see them at open-air environment and in underwater tunnel. I also saw three lionets  which fully grabbed my attention.",
          "Keep at least half a day aside for this humongous place! Great place for family outings.",
          "Very good place to educate kids and have fun with. Its not something you would want to cover in a day since its a lot of walking.",
          "Best zoo I've ever been to. Animals looked clean and were never alone. Amazing experience. Big thumbs up to all involved with the running of this fabulous place.",
          "Active and healthy looking animals, would definitely recommend, can get discount if you buy the tickets online before entering.",
          "Quite good in general, enjoyed being there with my 2 yo, but few things could've kept cleaner. For ex. We couldn't see polar bear since the water was very muddy with almost no visibility. Otherwise all in all a good experience.",
          "Great place to look at and enjoy not too common animals. The food at Pan Pan was great. I can really recommend the pork and the poke bowl.",
          "Has gotten so much better over the last five years.\nThe new elephant enclosure, the polar bear habitat, the flamingos and ibises, and of course the (don't mention the human rights violations) Chinese panda diplomacy pandas.\nAs something new, there's all manners of street food and drink in good quality to be had.",
          "Nice. Not a big zoo but the space is well organized. Can be pretty close to animals. One place to enhance is that the tank for polar bear should be well brushed.",
          "Great zoo. Animals have a lot of space and look healthy. Was worried they might be crammed in everything looked happy apart from the polar bears which were looking a bit stir crazy stuck on small loops.",
          "Great Panda worth seeing.",
          "Nice ZOO to spend a day. And if you have the energy for more, you can go for a walk in the nice parks surrounding the ZOO. The new big attraction is the pandas. However, you cannot really get close to the pandas - probably not to disturb \u2026",
          "Copenhagen Zoo is smaller in size,spread out in 2 wings across the road. Exotic animals not to be seen in Asian zoos,are Polar Bear,Penguins.Also Malaya Tapiirs are    big but cute,docile four legged creatures. A small aviary also have variety of birds.",
          "Cool place to enjoy and explore.",
          "I really like this zoo. Animal welfare there seems very good for a zoo. And there are many animals to see, also some more exotic ones you don't see at just any zoo. The enclosures are rather new and they renew them on a regular basis. I \u2026",
          "Really sad situation, I visited last year too and the habitat/enclosure for the hippos was so ridiculously small for so many big creatures. They were living on top of each other and only had a tiny island to get themselves out of the water. \u2026",
          "Very lovely zoo with a lot of animals nice treadet and feed.",
          "I have been here four times and each visit is different and entertaining. They have a great animals and are modern and nice.",
          "City Zoo - with lots of interesting animals and events! Surely Worth a visit or 10 \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude01",
          "Couldn't see any meerkats. The frogs were nice.",
          "Good well laid out zoo but not exciting at all. Nice range of animals but awfully expensive if you are not Danish",
          "Enjoyed being there. Well maintained zoo!",
          "Expensive but good.",
          "In all honsty after reading the raving reviews i was hoping to see a zoo were i don't feel sorry for the animals. But i still think a pacing polar bear doesn't belong on a fake rock in the middle of humans watching it all the time.\nThat being said its probably a fun day the kids with play grounds all over.",
          "Really nice zoo!! Loved it",
          "VERY FUN although they used to keep humans",
          "I enjoyed my visit to the zoo, but I thought some of the enclosures seemed a little small for what was in them (that could just be my conceptions from previous zoo's I've been to though). Would be a nice place to take kids, but as an adult \u2026",
          "Copenhagen Zoo is always a treat. The animals are treated well and the petting zoo with accompanying playground and farm animals is an instant success with the kids. The new restaurants and street food stands lifts the options above the \u2026",
          "So many animals in amazing kennels. The pandas were amazing and the resturant inside the panda exhibition was very pleasant with tasty food and good prices. Thank you for this amazing day :)",
          "I appreciate that the animals enclosures are spacious and generous. They take good care of their animals, and that's the highest praise I can give.",

          "Beautiful zoo! Very nice layout, easy to find everything, lots of cool animals.\nYou should definitely try the Panpan restaurant.\nThey also have a petting zoo :-)",
          "Seldom would I recommend visiting a zoo to go to a restaurant however this is the exception. The food was presented immaculately attractively on the plate and the taste matched it  . There is clearly a talented chef at work here! Very much worth the visit whilst you are spending a day at the zoo.",
          "A perfect place to visit especially with the kids. Zoo has very big numbers of animals from all around the world. There are lots of food places and playgrounds for children",
          "The copenhagen zoo is an average zoo. The place has several nordic animals which are only attraction in this place. I was happy to see polar bear, panda, penguin for the first time. \nThe zoo is small. The enclosed places are smelly. The \u2026",
          "Good place to spend a few hours.",
          "Really enjoyed the visit with my family tho not a big zoo but really good place to see once.",
          "Worth visiting! Amazing experience",
          "Fun day trip for the kids. Its a pretty contained area so you can easily cover it in a day. We usually don\u2019t go to zoos because my kids worry about how the animals are treated or confined in places where they are not meant to be. But this \u2026",
          "Great little zoo. It has lions, polar bears, elephants, monkeys and more. Food is also great!",
          "Very well laid out zoo. Some construction happening right now, though.",

          "Awesome zoo. Really nice to see animals treated well. Has a children area with playground and animals you can interact with.",
          "One of the few zoos I've visited and left satisfied! You can clearly see that the animals are being well taken care of.",
          "Amazing zoo, getting better every time we go. Went early and could see all the animals without waiting. Like that there is fewer but bigger enclosures than earlier.",
          "You will find most of the variety of endangered species. Loved the place. A must visit for tourist with family who is visiting Copenhagen.",
          "Clean and beautiful. Kids and adults both can spend hours here, so much to see and learn.",
          "Very nice place.... Totally worth visiting when in Copenhagen :)",
          "Seen better ZOOS, way overprices.",
          "Over the last couple of years this place has really improved with a lot of new facilities for the animals a lot of it at the same time quite interesting architecture. Like the elephant house designed by Sir Norman Foster. \nThis year the \u2026",
          "We love the local zoo and enjoy visiting the pandas",

          "An amazing zoo the animals are well cared for with enclosures that feel more open and free for the animals and guests to enjoy. Would highly reccomend people coming here when in Copenhagen.",
          "Still \"the wildest place in town\" - and we're big fans of Imaq (polar bear cup) - well be back \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Super nice, pretty big with a huge variety of different animal, all of them have a fair amount of space and they don't seem to distress, definitely a nice way to spend half a day",
          "It is an excellent outing for the whole family. Kids loved it and the best part is the Arctic ring with polar bears, seals etc. Recently a great addition of pandas. Basically i can't think of any popular animal that you can't find here. The \u2026",
          "Amazing zoo. Got to see a polar bear cub and his mother. Enjoyed the day. Would recommend.",
          "An amazing zoo where you can see a lot of different kind of animals from all around the world. There are also some very aggressive birds that sometimes try to steel your food! Nevermind, it's a very interesting place and its symbol are nice Pandas. There is also a small souvenirs shop that offer a huge variety of things for all ages.",
          "Lot to see in small place.  lot of places to rest, eat, drink. good washrooms.  good play area for kids.",
          "The zoo quite well facilitated and is one of the main attractions of the city. One would find almost all the animals. Special attraction includes polar bear, Kangaroo, giraffe and tiger.  It was most spectacular to see polar bear swimming \u2026",
          "I love going to the Zoo in CPH, they have done so many new things over the last couple of years, and it is absolutely amazing to see how many of the animals that have kids, so they must do something. As I believe they are known to bee great breeders too. It also seems like they take great care the animals.",
          "Copenhagen Zoo is really a wonderful place to spend your day. You can see that the animals are well taken care of and their habitats are large and not overcrowded. We a very good time and my 20 mont year old daughter loved every minute. \u2026",
          "Nice and tidy. Lots of space and good playgrounds for the kids",
          "The zoo was aggressively promoting that it has big panda, however, after waiting long queue we saw only an empty pen. The workers said it's sleeping somewhere. So, if you go there mostly to see the panda - consider this possibility. \u2026",
          "Spring season is interesting - there's a few cubs, pups and calves around; 2 giant lazy pandas you can watch while having a (I suspect gourmet) bite to eat. Nice place :)",

          "Love it \nHad experience of a lifetime watching the polar bears",
          "Great for kids. If you plan to stay long,it will be advisable to come with own food water and comfortable shoes.",
          "The zoo is spacious and well attended. There are a lot of a animals divided into zones of habitats. There are many places for drinks and street food, ice cream, cotton candy etc. The entrance fee is 200kr which is not cheap, but in my opinion it is worth the price.",
          "One of the best zoo i ever visit and i would love to visit again and again. Decent environment. Huge number of different kind of species. Friendly workers. Must recommend!",
          "Great place, bigger than I actually anticipated, it will take more than 2 and half hours to went through it. Disappointed with Tropical house, there isn't enough diversity there.",
          "I am amazed by this zoo which locates in the very central of Copenhagen. Since this is the central location, the size of the zoo is not very big.But it is good enough for half day visit with kids. Only one thing I would like mention is the \u2026",
          "Pretty great zoo with lots of animals to see. The sea lions' and the otters' feedings were fun to watch.",

          "Great Zoo! As most zoo's in northern Europe, just better and cleaner.. and has a great street food area.. quite expensive but very good imo!",
          "As far as a zoo can be ethically acceptable, this is a rather fine structure. Most of the animals seem to have enough space and a 'reasonable' treatment. Surely conceived for children and families",
          "That was amazing\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc!!! My family really enjoyed the zoo and had a good experience.   But I also can not stop thinking that these animals should be in the wild free instead\ud83d\ude41.",

          "Loving the zoo. No stress. Just chill.",
          "Nice zoo. It has most of the polar animals which my daughter never saw before. All the cages had information in English which made us more comfortable.",
          "Very well maintained and nicely managed zoo. For kids it is an interesting and informative place to visit. Adults will also enjoy. There are number of animals, you get to learn about so many different species. It is a kid friendly zoo. If \u2026",
          "Really good with lots of different animals and nice enclosures for them. Food is a bit pricey but it's not too bad depending on where you get it in the park. Can recommend though :)",

          "Excellent selection of animals. Some small cages",
          "Worth a visit with a copenhagen card, otherwise it is overpriced! The polar bear is worth it, though! :) Nicely decorated and good care of the animals.",
          "Perfect place to visit!",
          "Went late on a Thursday afternoon in January. Very cold but very few other people there allowing us to spend some time waiting for the animals to appear. Bit of a building site currently but high quality enclosures for many of the animals.",
          "Amazing zoo, so many different animals and lots of babies",
          "Average zoo. Went mainly to see the bears.",
          "Very well kept zoo, wide range of animals to see and staff are friendly.",
          "Nice place for family fun.",
          "We had a lovely time at the zoo in beautiful warm spring weather. The new panda enclosure was lovely, and as always the playground was a hit with kids. Only slight disappointment was the visit to the restaurant, which we felt was a bit overpriced",
          "The zoo is so beautiful and big! I expected the zoo to smell, but actually its so clean! Its also wheelchair accessible. You have to come early to spend the whole day because the zoo needs a lot of time. Also, try to visit it in a sunny day \u2026",

          "Probably the most well put together Zoo we have visited. The animals appear to be thriving and the interaction with them is quite unique. The division between animal and visitor is often only a short low hanging rope! Great options for \u2026",

          "Copenhagen zoo was amazing it had all the animals you\u2019d expect to see at a zoo and more. It was a very relaxed vibe which I think is down to Denmark\u2019s nature. The only key point would be that if your going on a weekend get their early as \u2026",

          "Nice zoo and easy to get to using local transportation",
          "The park outside of the zoo is splendid and full of green. About the zoo- well, I have seen better zoos in Europe. In some cages there are not any animels or you can not see any. I guess it's a good place if you come with small kids, otherwise it is just a waiste of time...",

          "Wild place all the time.\nAlways something new to see",

          "Very well maintained. Variety of animals to see",
          "A lot of empty cages and construction sites.\nThe overall experience was positive.\n\nPS: A peace of advice, don't bother going up the tower, it's a long way up, lots of stairs, and very limited payoff! The view is good but it's blocked by the net surrounding the tower.",

          "Possibly my 2nd favourite zoo in Europe after that one in Vienna... This place is amazing, dannes have thought about everything, literally! Full of places for lunch, picnic, ice cream, crepes, you name it. Great service, a lot facilities, superb variety of any animals! Totally worth visiting",
          "I've been to a few zoos and I think this one is my favourite. The animals can mingle with other species like they might in the wild... not that the lions and tigers mingle with the antelope or zebra... We got so close to the elephants and \u2026",
          "One of the best zoo experiences that I've had. There were probably less than 50 people in the zoo when I was there. It was great. There was a good variety too.\nSome of the animals seemed a little sad.",
          "Very nice place to eat, if you come to visit zoo you should definitely try the fish and chips",
          "HORRIBLE ! It's a nightmare for\nanimals : they are caged in little spaces. They are considered as objects to divert tourists, it's a deeply cruelty. You just have to imagine it would be humans......",

          "Very nice and clean place to go, highly recommend when visiting Copenhagen",
          "Pretty good zoo as far as zoos go. It isn\u2019t particularly large but you can make a day out of it. The goat petting area and the walkthrough reptile house are the highlights. Food and drink is even more expensive than average, even for copenhagen. I did not understand the hype over the new pandas, they were not particularly amazing.",
          "I adored this zoo. Having been to many zoo's in my life i have never experienced polar bears feeding in the water, it was a beautiful experience and one i would like to see again. Nicely laid out and plenty to see. I also enjoyed watching 2 \u2026",
          "This zoo is amazing. Lots of unique animals I've not seen in other zoos. Most of the animals were very active so they were easy to spot. Check it out if you're in Copenhagen. It's walking distance from the city (2-3 miles).",

          "Good for a family visit. Not many animals on display. Tried it as part of Copenhagen card",
          "Copenhagen Zoo has a large variety of animals from tiny bush babies to giant elephants. The zoo itself is fairly large and takes a good few hours to see everything if you're taking your time to have a good look in to each of the enclosures. \u2026",
          "Ok, but hard to orientate yourself and a feeling that there are more restaurants/kiosks, etc selling things than animals. Also some parking arrangement (free or discount) could be made for people who have to come by car.",

          "Great place to bring your kids or your date.",
          "We had a great time at this zoo. I think it would be better during the day so you can see the surroundings. Many of the animals were inside so we still got to see them.",
          "Great zoo. The panda is a big plus.",
          "The whole place felt a little less tidy than other zoos I've been to.. The animal enclosures had garbage in them from idiot guests who don't know how trash cans work, and there was barely any staff anywhere to be found.",
          "This place is a fine example of how a zoo should be managed..the wild animals and birds look healthy and well taken care of...a very high benchmark",
          "It's a wonderful and cosy zoo. The restaurant by the pandas is highly suggested for an early dinner.",
          "Perfect day with my favourite girl \u2764\ufe0f",

          "Great for kids, Good service and value for money.",
          "Nice zoo with charming atmosphere. Many options to visit different animals. You can bring your own food for a nice picnic (there are many tables around the full park) or take it in the differences food trucks: bao, durum, hot dog, \u2026",
          "Nice place for kids and family to attend the day in. Plenty of food varieties Available inside.",
          "Great visit to the Copenhagen zoo. Not too far outside the city and public transport stops right outside. Had to reduce 1 star as a lot of building work going on for the new panda enclosure. In sure it will be awesome once done though. The \u2026",

          "The zoo is nice and so, but at some points it seemed to have a bit of animal cruel, as the Polar Bear running back and forth desperate to get some fresh, and the grounds of tourists just looking at the animal seemingly desperate. (It was \u2026",
          "It is good to visit again and again.",
          "Actually a bit disappointing. Fairly small place for \"the Capital Zoo\". Knuthenborg in the South or Givskud in the West are vastly bettter places IMO.",
          "Im a huge fan of Zoo. The animals are obviously wonderful but the physical setting in zoo is what really counts for me. It seems the animals have what they need plus more. That they thrive and are taken care of. The walkways and places for \u2026",

          "Wonderful zoo, just go there.",

          "Too much rebuilding going on and alot of empty cages both indoor and outdoor. Hard to find the way around the construction site. However the staff was very helpful. Will come back when it is warmer..",
          "Realy nice park. Many fine strolls where you can be near the animals. The animals seem to have good space. \nAt the time for my visit the construction of the new panda area took a lot of space. \nAlso the food options for vegans was poor (to say it nice)",
          "Wonderful zoo. The African savanna enclosure is a highlight, as is the petting zoo.",

          "I think some animals suffer due to a limited space and they deserve larger living areas. You can find several animals like bear, rhinoceros,  leopard, lions, crocodile,monkeys and even tasmanian devil. Also there are playgrounds for your \u2026",
          "Copenhagen Zoo is a really great zoo.  They have all kinds of awesome animals and they also had a sand sculpture competition going on while we were there which was really cool, they looked incredible.  Overall I would definitely go there again.  Also if you have a copenhagen card (which I highly recommend) you can get in for free.",
          "Maybe it was the time i got there, but it realy stunk and the animal where caged so the employes could feed them. But im sure it would be a good experiance for the kids.",

          "Excellent zoo, looks like the animals are well taken care off and they have enough space to roam around. \nKids (and adults) will have a great time since everyone should see their favorite animal. \nWe bought the Copenhagen city card so it was included.",

Place is easy enough to navigate. It is not located centrally but not too far out that it is inconvenient. Go if you've the time!",
          "Absolutely adore this zoo. They focus on the well-being of all the animals, so each has a large enough enclosure with an additional space to escape the crowds, if they don't wish to be seen. 10/10 will visit again.",
          "It nice my family loves it",

          "The variety of animals is pretty good at this zoo, you see many animals that aren't so usual in other zoo's (like penguins, rhino, hippo, elephants, giraffes, lot of different species of chimps and monkeys) - this variety is the reason for \u2026",

          "Pandas, what to say more",
          "We had an absolutely wonderful day at the Copenhagen Zoo with our one and a half year son. He was stunned and amazed at the exhibitions. The zoo is very large and requires the whole day for you to see all the different areas. A must if you are visiting Copenhagen, specially for families with small children.",
          "Visited here on my first day in Copenhagen, it\u2019s free entry with the Copenhagen Card. \nThe way the exhibits are laid out is a bit odd but it\u2019s easy enough to find your way around so you don\u2019t miss any of the animals. \nSome of the animals \u2026",

          "Unfortunately a lot of construction work for panda house at the centre of the zoo at the time (autumn 2018). Should be fine after it has finished if quality is going to be as beautiful as elephant house.",
          "Great fun! Lots of cool animals",
          "Very good zoo. It was a shame that it was under construction when we went so no pandas! A MASSIVE problem in the zoo is that there are no signs in English! Even the menus in the restaurants, we could only find one restaurant with a menu in \u2026",
          "Nice place. Fine Panda Bears \ud83d\udc3c",

          "Lovely zoo",
          "Wonderfully laid out, large, engaging, inspiring, with a great range of wildlife. The habitats are designed to benefit the gorgeous animals but also help people have breathtaking close-ups. Can't wait to return to see the finished panda exhibit when it's done! :)",

          "Great place to spend a family day!",
          "Excellent zoo with a large variety of animals. Also didn't tend to be too packed if you go on the right day. It's not particularly close to any train station so it's best to get there by car or bus if you don't want a long walk.",
          "I had a positive experience overall. There were numerous animals that you could visit and see (even though quite a few were hidden inside their cages due to hot sunny weather).

          "Copenhagen ZOO is among the finest i the World!",

          "One of our favorite zoos. A bit messy and chaotic this year though due to all the construction going on for the coming pandas. Overall the animals seem to be well cared for, though some of them could use more space. Glad to see that the polar bear had more space now than on our previous visit.",
          "Panda mania is in Copenhagen. Great zoo experience",

          "One of the best zoo in world. Though a huge part is under construction and that might spoil your experience if you go in recent future but I am sure polar bear and girrafe would make up for it. You get to see animals from as close as \u2026",

          "I\u2019m usually against zoo\u2019s but the copenhagen zoo is probably one of the best there is. \n\nThe animals gets well taken care of and they reinvest a lot of money into their animals welfare, breeding programmes and park infrastructure. \n\nTheir petting zoo is fun for kids (and playful adults) and they got a vast amount of species.",
          "Very nice place",
          "Lovely and beautiful zoo.",
          "Great zoo with a lot of animals and a nice environment for the animals, it was under construction but it was amazing. The best is the polar bear.",

          "It's awesome",
          "Family friendly city zoo. You can get to see the animals really close! Great place for children. The tropical climate area is really great for some extremely close-up butterfly and insect photography.",
          "Phenomenal zoo. The fact you can get so up close to some of the deadliest and most unusual animals on the planet is a great tick in the box for this place. The only zoo I've been to I could say it lacks behind is Berlin. But still a 10/10 place. Good price too",
          "Got a really weird vibe from the zoo, the ponds often look dirty, most animals seemed distressed. It's the worst zoo I've been to so far.",
          "Love the integrated areas where several species live together. Well done Zoo. Mikkel who presented at the flamingos was very eloquent and knowledgeable.",
          "Amazing!",
          "A nice park where you get very close to the animals. The counter \"reception\" , very rude service and can kill the customer experience before it even started, but once you are in it is better. \nThe surroundings inside are nice though \u2026",

          "So much to see in one day, especially with a toddler in tow. Many exhibits were immersive beyond any other zoo experience I've had. Plus, the view of Copenhagen from the zoo tower is spectacular.",
          "The best zoo in Copenhagen",

          "Going in winter to the zoo isn't very exciting as it was quite cold and many animals are inside. The zoo has been renovating for a new panda attraction so that will be exciting. We watched the primates being fed. The have animals from Asia, \u2026",
          "We went here wen it was renowaiting so one part of the zoo was off limits but everything else was really intresting we spend the whole day there",
          "My heart broke at the tiny hippo enclosure. There are 3 fully sized hippos (5 total) and they are all stepping on each other. Hippos walk for long distances at night and the enclosure didn't have any room for them to do so. Heartbroken.",

          "Copenhagen Zoo gets better and better and it is amazing to see how animal welfare is a top priority in this Zoo. The African savanna is a great example of giving the animals a replica of their natural habitat. Soon construction work will \u2026"

        "wiki": "Malm\u00f6 (; Swedish: [\u02c8m\u00e2lm\u00f8\u02d0] (listen); Danish: Malm\u00f8 [\u02c8m\u00e6lm\u02cc\u00f8\u02c0]) is the largest city in the Swedish county (l\u00e4n) of Sk\u00e5ne (Scania). It is the third-largest city in Sweden, after Stockholm and Gothenburg, and the sixth-largest city in Scandinavia, with a population of 316,588 (municipal total 338,230 in 2018). The Malm\u00f6 Metropolitan Region is home to over 700,000 people, and the \u00d8resund Region, which includes Malm\u00f6, is home to 4 million people.Malm\u00f6 was one of the earliest and most industrialized towns in Scandinavia, but it struggled to adapt to post-industrialism. Since the construction of the \u00d6resund Bridge, Malm\u00f6 has undergone a major transformation, producing new architectural developments, supporting new biotech and IT companies, and attracting students through Malm\u00f6 University and other higher education facilities. The city contains many historic buildings and parks, and is also a commercial center for the western part of Scania.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest written mention of Malm\u00f6 as a city dates from 1275. It is thought to have been founded shortly before that date, as a fortified quay or ferry berth of the Archbishop of Lund, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) to the north-east. Malm\u00f6 was for centuries Denmark's second-biggest city. Its original name was Malmhaug (with alternate spellings), meaning \"Gravel pile\" or \"Ore Hill\".\nIn the 15th century, Malm\u00f6 became one of Denmark's largest and most visited cities, reaching a population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. It became the most important city around the \u00d8resund, with the German Hanseatic League frequenting it as a marketplace, and was notable for its flourishing herring fishery. In 1437, King Eric of Pomerania (King of Denmark from 1396 to 1439) granted the city's arms: argent with a griffin gules, based on Eric's arms from Pomerania. The griffin's head as a symbol of Malm\u00f6 extended to the entire province of Scania from 1660.\nIn 1434, a new citadel was constructed at the beach south of the town. This fortress, known today as Malm\u00f6hus, did not take its current form until the mid-16th century. Several other fortifications were constructed, making Malm\u00f6 Sweden's most fortified city, but only Malm\u00f6hus remains.\n\nLutheran teachings spread during the 16th century Protestant Reformation, and Malm\u00f6 became one of the first cities in Scandinavia to fully convert (1527\u20131529) to this Protestant denomination.\nIn the 17th century, Malm\u00f6 and the Scanian region (Sk\u00e5neland) came under control of Sweden following the Treaty of Roskilde with Denmark, signed in 1658. Fighting continued, however; in June 1677, 14,000 Danish troops laid siege to Malm\u00f6 for a month, but were unable to defeat the Swedish troops holding it.\nBy the dawn of the 18th century, Malm\u00f6 had about 2,300 inhabitants. However, owing to the wars of Charles XII of Sweden (reigned 1697\u20131718) and to bubonic plague epidemics, the population dropped to 1,500 by 1727. The population did not grow much until the modern harbor was constructed in 1775. The city started to expand and the population in 1800 was 4,000. 15 years later, it had increased to 6,000.\n\nIn 1840, Frans Henrik Kockum founded the workshop from which the Kockums shipyard eventually developed as one of the largest shipyards in the world. The Southern Main Line was built between 1856 and 1864; this enabled Malm\u00f6 to become a center of manufacture, with major textile and mechanical industries. In 1870, Malm\u00f6 overtook Norrk\u00f6ping to become Sweden's third-most populous city, and by 1900 Malm\u00f6 had strengthened this position with 60,000 inhabitants. Malm\u00f6 continued to grow through the first half of the 20th century. The population had swiftly increased to 100,000 by 1915 and to 200,000 by 1952.\n\n\n=== 1900\u20131969 ===\n\nIn 1914 (15 May to 4 October) Malm\u00f6 hosted the Baltic Exhibition. The large park Pildammsparken was arranged and planted for this large event. The Russian part of the exhibition was never taken down, owing to the outbreak of World War I.\nOn 18 and 19 December 1914, the Three Kings Meeting was held in Malm\u00f6. After a somewhat infected period (1905\u20131914), which included the dissolution of the Swedish-Norwegian Union, King Oscar II was replaced with King H\u00e5kon VII in Norway, who was the younger brother of the Danish King Christian X. As Oscar died in 1907, and his son Gustav V became the new King of Sweden, the tensions within Scandinavia were still unclear, but during this historical meeting, the Scandinavian Kings found internal understanding, as well as a common line about remaining neutral in the ongoing war.\nWithin sports, Malm\u00f6 has mostly been associated with football. IFK Malm\u00f6 participated in the first ever edition of Allsvenskan 1924/25, but from the mid-1940s Malm\u00f6 FF started to rise, and ever since it has been one of the most prominent clubs within Swedish football. They have won Allsvenskan 23 times in all (as of February 2018) between 1943/44 and 2017.\n\n\n=== 1970s and later ===\nBy 1971, Malm\u00f6 reached 265,000 inhabitants, but this was the peak which would stand for more than 30 years. (Svedala was, for a few years in the early 1970s, a part of Malm\u00f6 municipality.)\nBy the mid-1970s Sweden experienced a recession that hit the industrial sector especially hard; shipyards and manufacturing industries suffered, which led to high unemployment in many cities of Scania. Kockums shipyard had become a symbol of Malm\u00f6 as its largest employer and, when shipbuilding ceased in 1986, confidence in the future of Malm\u00f6 plummeted among politicians and the public. In addition, many middle-class families moved into one-family houses in surrounding municipalities such as Vellinge Municipality, Lomma Municipality and Staffanstorp Municipality, which profiled themselves as the suburbs of the upper-middle class. By 1985, Malm\u00f6 had lost 35,000 inhabitants and was down to 229,000.The Swedish financial crises of the early 1990s exacerbated Malm\u00f6's decline as an industrial city; between 1990 and 1995 Malm\u00f6 lost about 27,000 jobs and its economy was seriously strained. However, from 1994 under the leadership of the then mayor Ilmar Reepalu, the city of Malm\u00f6 started to create a new economy as a center of culture and knowledge. Malm\u00f6 reached bottom in 1995, but that same year marked the commencement of the massive \u00d6resund Bridge road, railway and tunnel project, connecting it to Copenhagen and to the rail lines of Europe. The new Malm\u00f6 University opened in 1998 on Kockums' former dockside. Further redevelopment of the now disused south-western harbor followed; a city architecture exposition (Bo01) was held in the area in 2001, and its buildings and villas form the core of a new city district. Designed with attractive waterfront vistas, it was intended to be and has been successful in attracting the urban middle-class.\nSince 1974, the Kockums Crane had been a landmark in Malm\u00f6 and a symbol of the city's manufacturing industry, but in 2002 it was disassembled and moved to South Korea. In 2005, Malm\u00f6 gained a new landmark with completion of Turning Torso, the tallest skyscraper in Scandinavia. Although the transformation from a city with its economic base in manufacturing has returned growth to Malm\u00f6, the new types of jobs have largely benefited the middle and upper classes.\nIn its 2015 and 2017 reports, Police in Sweden placed the Roseng\u00e5rd and the S\u00f6dra Sofielund/Seved district in the most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nMalm\u00f6 is located at 13\u00b000' east and 55\u00b035' north, near the southwestern tip of Sweden, in the province of Scania.\nThe city is part of the transnational \u00d6resund Region and, since 2000, has been linked by the \u00d6resund Bridge across the \u00d6resund to Copenhagen, Denmark. The bridge opened on 1 July 2000, and measures 8 kilometres (5 miles) (the whole link totalling 16 km), with pylons reaching 204.5 metres (670.9 feet) vertically. Apart from the Helsingborg-Helsing\u00f8r ferry links further north, most ferry connections have been discontinued.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nMalm\u00f6, like the rest of southern Sweden, has an oceanic climate. Despite its northern location, the climate is mild compared to other locations at similar latitudes, mainly because of the influence of the Gulf Stream and also its westerly position on the Eurasian landmass. Owing to its northern latitude, daylight lasts 17 hours in midsummer, but only around seven hours in midwinter. According to data from 2002\u20132014 Falsterbo, to the south of the city, received an annual average of 1,895 hours of sunshine while Lund, to the north, received 1,803 hours. The sunshine data in the weather box is based on the data for Falsterbo.Summers are mild with average high temperatures of 20 to 23 \u00b0C (68 to 73 \u00b0F) and lows of around 11 to 13 \u00b0C (52 to 55 \u00b0F). Heat waves during the summer arise occasionally. Winters are fairly cold and windy, with temperatures steady between \u22123 to 4 \u00b0C (27 to 39 \u00b0F), but it rarely drops below \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F).\nRainfall is light to moderate throughout the year with 169 wet days. Snowfall occurs mainly in December through March, but snow covers do not remain for a long time, and some winters are virtually free of snow.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\u00d6resund Line trains cross the \u00d6resund Bridge every 20 minutes (hourly late night) connecting Malm\u00f6 to Copenhagen, and the Copenhagen Airport. The trip takes around 35\u201340 minutes. Additionally, some of the X 2000 and Intercity trains to Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Kalmar cross the bridge, stopping at Copenhagen Airport. In March 2005, excavation began on a new railway connection called the City Tunnel, which opened for traffic on 4 December 2010. The tunnel runs south from Malm\u00f6 Central Station through an underground station at the Triangeln railway station to Hylliev\u00e5ng (Hyllie Meadow). Then, the line comes to the surface to enter Hyllie Station, also created as part of the tunnel project. From Hyllie Station, the line connects to the existing \u00d6resund line in either direction, with the \u00d6resund Bridge lying due west.\nBesides the Copenhagen Airport, Malm\u00f6 has an airport of its own, Malm\u00f6 Airport, today chiefly used for domestic Swedish destinations, charter flights and low-cost carriers.\nThe motorway system has been incorporated with the \u00d6resund Bridge; the European route E20 goes over the bridge and then, together with the European route E6 follows the Swedish west coast from Malm\u00f6\u2013Helsingborg to Gothenburg. E6 goes further north along the west coast and through Norway to the Norwegian town Kirkenes at Barents Sea. The European route to J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping\u2013Stockholm (E4) starts at Helsingborg. Main roads in the directions of V\u00e4xj\u00f6\u2013Kalmar, Kristianstad\u2013Karlskrona, Ystad (E65), and Trelleborg start as freeways.\nMalm\u00f6 has 410 kilometres (250 mi) of bike paths; approximately 40% of all commuting is done by bicycle.\n\n\n=== Ports ===\nThe city has two industrial harbors; one is still in active use and is the largest Nordic port for car importation. It also has two marinas: the publicly owned Limhamn Marina (55\u00b035\u2032N 12\u00b055\u2032E) and the private Lagunen (55\u00b035\u2032N 12\u00b056\u2032E), both offering a limited number of guest docks.\nPublic transport consisted of a tram network from 1887 until 1973. Afterwards, it was replaced by a bus network.\n\n\n=== Malm\u00f6 S-Train ===\nA local train line with circular traffic at seven stations was opened in December 2018. The stations are Malm\u00f6 Central Station (underground platforms) \u2013 Triangeln station \u2013 Hyllie station \u2013 Malm\u00f6 South/Sv\u00e5gertorp \u2013 Persborg \u2013 Roseng\u00e5rd \u2013 \u00d6sterv\u00e4rn \u2013 Malm\u00f6 Central Station (main overground terminus). Some trains arrive from Kristianstad and finish with a lap around Malm\u00f6, whilst other trains at this circular line, never drive outside the city limits. There is at least a 30 minutes service between each departure, but far more between the Central Station and Hyllie. Extension plans of a minor network system exists.\n\n\n=== Proposed metro ===\nThe \u00d6resundsmetro is a proposed rapid transit network linking Malm\u00f6 with the existing Copenhagen Metro through a 22 km tunnel under the \u00d6resund.\n\n\n== Municipality ==\n\nMalm\u00f6 Municipality is an administrative unit defined by geographical borders, consisting of the City of Malm\u00f6 and its immediate surroundings.\nMalm\u00f6 (Malm\u00f6 t\u00e4tort) consists of the urban part of the municipality together with the small town of Arl\u00f6v in the Burl\u00f6v Municipality. Both municipalities also include smaller urban areas and rural areas, such as the suburbs of Oxie and \u00c5karp. Malm\u00f6 t\u00e4tort is to be distinguished from Malm\u00f6 stad (the city of Malm\u00f6), which is a semi-official name of Malm\u00f6 Municipality.\nThe leaders in Malm\u00f6 created a commission for a socially sustainable Malm\u00f6 in November 2010. The commissions were tasked with providing evidence-based strategies for reducing health inequalities and improve living conditions for all citizens of Malm\u00f6, especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged and issued its final report in December 2013.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nMalm\u00f6 has a young population by Swedish standards, with almost half of the population under the age of 35 (48.2%).After 1971, Malm\u00f6 had 265,000 inhabitants, but the population then dropped to 229,000 by 1985. The total population of the urban area was 280,415 in December 2010. It then began to rise again, and had passed the previous record by the 1 January 2003 census, when it had 265,481 inhabitants. On 27 April 2011, the population of Malm\u00f6 reached the 300,000 mark. In 2017 the total population of the city was 316,588 inhabitants out of a municipal total of 338,230.In 2019, approximately 55.5% of the population of Malm\u00f6 municipality (190,849 residents) had at least one parent born abroad. The Middle East, Horn of Africa, former Yugoslavia and Denmark are the main sources of immigration. In addition, 14.8% (50 999 residents) of the population in 2019 were foreign nationals.Foreign-born population by country, 31 December 2018:\n\nGreater Malm\u00f6 is one of Sweden's three officially recognized metropolitan areas (storstadsomr\u00e5den) and since 2005 is defined as the municipality of Malm\u00f6 and 11 other municipalities in the southwestern corner of Scania. As of 2019, its population was recorded as 740,840. The region covers an area of 2,522 square kilometres (974 sq mi). The municipalities included, apart from Malm\u00f6, are Burl\u00f6v, Esl\u00f6v, H\u00f6\u00f6r, K\u00e4vlinge, Lomma, Lund, Skurup, Staffanstorp, Svedala, Trelleborg and Vellinge. Together with Lund, Malm\u00f6 is the region's economic and education hub.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Malm\u00f6 was traditionally based on shipbuilding (Kockums) and construction-related industries, such as concrete factories. The region's leading university, along with its associated hi-tech and pharmaceutical industries, is located in Lund about 16 kilometres (10 miles) to the north-east. As a result, Malm\u00f6 had a troubled economic situation following the mid-1970s. Between 1990\u20131995, 27,000 jobs were lost, and the budget deficit was more than one billion Swedish krona (SEK). In 1995, Malm\u00f6 had Sweden's highest unemployment rate.However, during the last two decades, there has been a revival. One contributing factor has been the economic integration with Denmark brought about by the \u00d6resund Bridge, which opened in July 2000. Also the university founded in 1998 and the effects of integration into the European Union have contributed. In 2017 the unemployment rate is still high but Malm\u00f6 has, in the last 20 years, had one of the strongest employment growth rates in Sweden. But a lot of those jobs are taken by workers outside the neighboring municipalities.As of 2016, the largest companies were:\nSkanska \u2013 heavy construction\nNobina \u2013 transport\nPostNord \u2013 postal services\nP\u00e5gen \u2013 bakery\nIKEA \u2013 furnitureAlmost 30 companies have moved their headquarters to Malm\u00f6 during the last seven years, generating around 2,300 jobs. Among them are IKEA who has most of its headquarter functions based in Malm\u00f6.The number of start-up companies is high in Malm\u00f6. Around 7 new companies are started every day in Malm\u00f6. In 2010, the renewal of the number of companies amounted to 13.9%, which exceeds both Stockholm and Gothenburg. Especially strong growth is in the gaming area with Massive entertainment and King being the flagship companies for the industry. Among the industries that continue to increase their share of companies in Malm\u00f6 are transport, financial and business services, entertainment, leisure and construction.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMalm\u00f6 has the country's ninth-largest school of higher education, Malm\u00f6 University, established in 1998. It has 1,600 employees and 24,000 students (2014).\nIn addition nearby Lund University (established in 1666) has some education located in Malm\u00f6:\n\nMalm\u00f6 Art Academy (Konsth\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nMalm\u00f6 Academy of Music (Musikh\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nMalm\u00f6 Theatre Academy (Teaterh\u00f6gskolan i Malm\u00f6)\nThe Faculty of Medicine, which is located in both Malm\u00f6 and Lund.The United Nations World Maritime University is also located in Malm\u00f6. The World Maritime University (WMU) operates under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized agency of the United Nations. WMU thus enjoys the status, privileges and immunities of a UN institution in Sweden.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Film and television ===\nA striking depiction of Malm\u00f6 (in the 1930s) was made by Bo Widerberg in his debut film Kvarteret Korpen (Raven's End) (1963), largely shot in the shabby Korpen working-class district in Malm\u00f6. With humour and tenderness, it depicts the tensions between classes and generations.  The movie was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1965. In 2017, the film Medan Vi Lever (While We Live) was awarded the prize for best film by an African living abroad at the Africa Movie Academy Awards. It was filmed in Malm\u00f6 and Gambia, and deals with identity, integration and everyday racism.The cities of Malm\u00f6 and Copenhagen are, with the \u00d6resund Bridge, the main locations in the television series The Bridge (Bron/Broen).\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\nIn 1944, Malm\u00f6 Stadsteater (Malm\u00f6 Municipal Theatre) was established with a repertoire comprising stage theatre, opera, musical, ballet, musical recitals and experimental theatre. In 1993 it was split into three units, Dramatiska Teater (Dramatical Theatre), Malm\u00f6 Musikteater (Music Theatre) and Sk\u00e5nes Dansteater (Scanian Dance Theatre) and the name was abandoned. The ownership of the last two were transferred to Region Sk\u00e5ne in 2006 Dramatiska Teatern regained its old name. In the 1950s Ingmar Bergman was the Director and Chief Stage Director of Malm\u00f6 Stadsteater and many of his actors, like Max von Sydow and Ingrid Thulin became known through his films. Later stage directors include Staffan Valdemar Holm and G\u00f6ran Stangertz. Malm\u00f6 Musikteater were renamed Malm\u00f6 Operan and plays operas and musicals, classics as newly composed, on one of Scandinavia's large opera scenes with 1,511 seats. Sk\u00e5nes dansteater is active and plays contemporary dance repertory and present works by Swedish and international choreographers in their house in Malm\u00f6 harbor.Since the 1970s the city has also been home to independent theatre groups and show/musical companies. It also hosts a rock/dance/dub culture; in the 1960s The Rolling Stones played the Klubb Bongo, and in recent years stars like Morrissey, Nick Cave, B.B. King and Pat Metheny have made repeated visits.\nThe Cardigans debuted in Malm\u00f6 and recorded their albums there. On 7 January 2009 CNN Travel broadcast a segment called \"MyCity_MyLife\" featuring Nina Persson taking the camera to some of the sites in Malm\u00f6 that she enjoys.\nThe Rooseum Center for Contemporary Art, founded in 1988 by the Swedish art collector and financier Fredrik Roos and housed in a former power station which had been built in 1900, was one of the foremost centers for contemporary art in Europe during the 1980s and 1990s. By 2006, most of the collection had been sold off and the museum was on a time-out; by 2010 Rooseum had been dismantled and a subsidiary of the National Museum of Modern Art inaugurated in its place.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nIn 1992 and in 2013 Malm\u00f6 was the host of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nModerna Museet Malm\u00f6 was opened in December 2009  in the old Rooseum building. It is a part of the Moderna Museet, with independent exhibitions of modern and contemporary art. The collection of Moderna Museet holds key pieces of, among others, Marcel Duchamp, Louise Bourgeois, Pablo Picasso, Niki de Saint Phalle, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Carolee Schneemann, Henri Matisse and Robert RauschenbergMalm\u00f6 Museum (Malm\u00f6 Museer) is a municipal and regional museum. The museum features exhibitions on technology, shipping, natural history and history. Malm\u00f6 Museum has an aquarium and an art museum. Malm\u00f6hus Castle is also operated as a part of the museum.\nExhibitions are primarily shown at Slottsholmen and at the Technology and Maritime Museum (Teknikens och sj\u00f6fartens hus).Malm\u00f6 Konsthall is one of the largest exhibition halls in Europe for contemporary art, opened in 1975.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMalm\u00f6's oldest building is St. Peter's Church (Swedish: Sankt Petri). It was built in the early 14th century in Baltic Brick Gothic probably after St Mary's Church in L\u00fcbeck. The church is built with a nave, two aisles, a transept and a tower. Its exterior is characterized above all by the flying buttresses spanning its airy arches over the aisles and ambulatory. The tower, which fell down twice during the 15th century, got its current look in 1890. Another major church of significance is the Church of Our Saviour, Malm\u00f6, which was founded in 1870.\nAnother old building is Tunneln, 300 metres (1,000 ft) to the west of Sankt Petri Church, which also dates back to around 1300.\nThe oldest parts of Malm\u00f6 were built between 1300\u20131600 during its first major period of expansion. The central city's layout, as well as some of its oldest buildings, are from this time. Many of the smaller buildings from this time are typical Scanian: two-story urban houses that show a strong Danish influence.Recession followed in the ensuing centuries. The next expansion period was in the mid 19th century and led to the modern stone and brick city. This expansion lasted into the 20th century and can be seen by a number of Art Nouveau buildings, among those in the Malm\u00f6 synagogue. Malm\u00f6 was relatively late to be influenced by modern ideas of functionalist tenement architecture in the 1930s.\nAround 1965, the government initiated the so-called Million Programme, intending to offer affordable apartments in the outskirts of major Swedish cities. But this period also saw the reconstruction (and razing) of much of the historical city center.Since the late 1990s, Malm\u00f6 has seen a more cosmopolitan architecture. V\u00e4stra Hamnen (The Western Harbor), like most of the harbor to the north of the city center, was industrial. In 2001 its reconstruction began as an urban residential neighbourhood, with 500 residential units, most were part of the exhibition Bo01. The exhibition had two main objectives: develop self-sufficient housing units in terms of energy and greatly diminish phosphorus emissions. Among the new building's towers were the Turning Torso, a skyscraper with a twisting design, 190 metres (620 ft) tall, the majority of which is residential. It became Malm\u00f6's new landmark. The most recent addition (2015) is the new development of Malm\u00f6 Live. This new building features a hotel, a concert hall, congress hall and a sky bar in the center of Malm\u00f6. Point Hyllie is a new 110 m commercial tower that is under construction as of 2018.\n\n\n=== Other sights ===\n\nThe beach Ribersborg, by locals usually called Ribban, south-west of the harbor area, is a man-made shallow beach, stretching along Malm\u00f6's coastline. Despite Malm\u00f6's chilly climate, it is sometimes referred to as the \"Copacabana of Malm\u00f6\". It is the site of Ribersborgs open-air bath, opened in the 1890s.\nThe long boardwalk at The Western Harbor, Scaniaparken and Daniaparken, has become a favorite summer hang-out for the people of Malm\u00f6 and is a popular place for bathing. The harbor is particularly popular with Malm\u00f6's vibrant student community and has been the scene of several impromptu outdoor parties and gatherings.\n\n\n=== Annual events ===\n\nIn the third week of August each year a festival, Malm\u00f6festivalen, fills the streets of Malm\u00f6 with different kinds of cuisines and events.\nBUFF International Film Festival, an international children and young people's film festival, is held in Malm\u00f6 every year in March.\nNordisk Panorama \u2013 Nordic Short & Doc Film Festival, a film festival for short and documentary films by filmmakers from the Nordic countries, is held every year in September.\nMalm\u00f6 Arab Film Festival (MAFF), the largest Arabic film festival in Europe, is held in Malm\u00f6.\nThe Nordic Game conference takes place in Malm\u00f6 every April/May. The event consists of conference itself, recruitment expo and game expo and attracts hundreds of gamedev professionals every year.\nMalm\u00f6 also hosts other 3rd party events that cater to all communities that reside in Malm\u00f6, including religious and political celebrations.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nSydsvenskan, founded in 1870, is Malm\u00f6's largest daily newspaper. It has an average circulation of 130,000. Its main competitor is the regional daily Sk\u00e5nska Dagbladet, which has a circulation of 34,000. The tabloid Kv\u00e4llsposten still has a minimal editorial staff but is today just a version of a Stockholm tabloid. The Social Democratic Arbetet was edited and printed at Malm\u00f6 between 1887 and 2000.In addition to these, a number of free-of-charge papers, generally dealing with entertainment, music and fashion have local editions (for instance City, Rodeo, Metro and N\u00f6jesguiden). Malm\u00f6 is also home to the Egmont Group's Swedish magazine operations. A number of local and regional radio and TV broadcasters are based in the Greater Malm\u00f6 area.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\n\n==== Football ====\n\nSports in southern Sweden are dominated by football. Over the years the city's best football teams have been Malm\u00f6 FF who play in the top-level Allsvenskan Malm\u00f6 FF had their most successful periods in the 1970s and 1980s when they won the league several times. In 1979, they advanced to the final of the European Cup defeating AS Monaco, Dynamo Kiew, Wisla Krakow and Austria Wien (Vienna) but lost in the final at the Munich Olympic Stadium against Nottingham Forest by a single goal just before half time scored by Trevor Francis. To date, they are the only Swedish football club to have reached the final of the competition. Malm\u00f6 FF is the club where for instance, Bosse Larsson and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 began their football careers.  A second football team, IFK Malm\u00f6 played in Sweden's top flight for about 20 years and the club's quarterfinal in the European Cup is the club's greatest achievement in its history. Today, the club resides in the sixth tier of the Swedish league system.\nFC Roseng\u00e5rd (former LdB Malm\u00f6) are playing in the top level in Damallsvenskan, women's football league. FC Roseng\u00e5rd girls have won the league 10 times and the national cup title 5 times. In 2014, they reached the semi-final in Champions League, which they ultimately went on to lose to the German side 1. FFC Frankfurt. Brazilian football player Marta, widely regarded the best female football player of all time, played in FC Roseng\u00e5rd between 2014 and 2017.\nAt the 1958 FIFA World Cup Malm\u00f6 Stadion was inaugurated in combination with the opening match of the cup, as World Champions West Germany defeated Argentina 3\u20131, in front of 31,156, a record attendance for Malm\u00f6 in general. Another two games were decided at the stadium.\n\n\n==== Other sports ====\nMalm\u00f6 has athletes competing in a variety of sport.\n\n\n===== Ice hockey =====\nThe most notable other sports team is the ice hockey team Malm\u00f6 Redhawks. They were the creation of millionaire Percy Nilsson and quickly rose to the highest rank in the early to mid-1990s and won two Swedish championships, but for a number of years have found themselves residing outside of the top flight. \n\n\n===== Handball =====\nA first division handball team, HK Malm\u00f6, attracts a fair amount of attendance. \n\n\n===== Rugby =====\nRugby union team, Malm\u00f6 RC, founded in 1954, have won 6 national championships. The club has teams for men, women and juniors.\n\n\n===== Gaelic football =====\nGaelic football has also been introduced to Malm\u00f6. The men of Malm\u00f6 G.A.A. have won the Scandinavian Championships twice and the women once.\n\n\n===== Additional Team and Individual Sport =====\nOther notable team a sports are baseball, American football and Australian football.\nAmong non-team sports, badminton and athletics are the most popular, together with east Asian martial arts and boxing.

          "Two years ago during our first stay in Copenhagen, we had walked through this large city square on several occasions. At that time it was disappointing to find that it was a major construction site connected with the expansion of the underground railway system. When we stayed in",
          "I came across this Square when I was walking toward Nyhavn. The area was nice but there were construction materials in the middle. It was unattractive and hopefully won\u2019t last longer. There were many restaurants nearby and it was only a short walk to Stroget shopping area.",

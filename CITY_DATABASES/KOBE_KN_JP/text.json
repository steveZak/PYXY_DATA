        "wiki": "Kobe ( KOH-bee, -\u2060bay; Japanese: [ko\ua71c\u02d0be]; officially \u795e\u6238\u5e02, K\u014dbe-shi) is the seventh-largest city in Japan and the capital city of Hy\u014dgo Prefecture. It is located on the southern side of the main island of Honsh\u016b, on the north shore of Osaka Bay and about 30 km (19 mi) west of Osaka. With a population around 1.5 million, the city is part of the Keihanshin metropolitan area along with Osaka and Kyoto.The earliest written records regarding the region come from the Nihon Shoki, which describes the founding of the Ikuta Shrine by Empress Jing\u016b in AD 201. For most of its history, the area was never a single political entity, even during the Tokugawa period, when the port was controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate. Kobe did not exist in its current form until its founding in 1889. Its name comes from Kanbe (\u795e\u6238, an archaic title for supporters of the city's Ikuta Shrine).  Kobe became one of Japan's designated cities in 1956.\nKobe was one of the cities to open for trade with the West following the 1853 end of the policy of seclusion and has since been known as a cosmopolitan and nuclear-free zone port city. While the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake diminished much of Kobe's prominence as a port city, it remains Japan's fourth-busiest container port.  Companies headquartered in Kobe include ASICS, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and Kobe Steel, as well as over 100 international corporations with Asian or Japanese headquarters in the city, such as Eli Lilly and Company, Procter & Gamble, Boehringer Ingelheim, and Nestl\u00e9. The city is the point of origin and namesake of Kobe beef, as well as the site of one of Japan's most famous hot spring resorts, Arima Onsen.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n Media related to History of Kobe at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n=== Origins to the Meiji era ===\nTools found in western Kobe demonstrate the area was populated at least from the J\u014dmon period. The natural geography of the area, particularly of Wada Cape in Hy\u014dgo-ku, led to the development of a port, which would remain the economic center of the city. Some of the earliest written documents mentioning the region include the Nihon Shoki, which describes the founding of the Ikuta Shrine by Empress Jing\u016b in AD 201.During the Nara and Heian periods, the port was known by the name \u014cwada Anchorage (\u014cwada-no-tomari) and was one of the ports from which imperial embassies to China were dispatched.  The city was briefly the capital of Japan in 1180, when Taira no Kiyomori moved his grandson Emperor Antoku to Fukuhara in present-day Hy\u014dgo-ku. The Emperor returned to Kyoto after about five months. Shortly thereafter in 1184, the Taira fortress in Hy\u014dgo-ku and the nearby Ikuta Shrine became the sites of the Genpei War battle of Ichi-no-Tani between the Taira and Minamoto clans. The Minamoto prevailed, pushing the Taira further.\nAs the port grew during the Kamakura period, it became an important hub for trade with China and other countries. In the 13th century, the city came to be known by the name Hy\u014dgo Port (\u5175\u5eab\u6d25, Hy\u014dgo-tsu). During this time, Hy\u014dgo Port, along with northern Osaka, composed the province of Settsu (most of today's Kobe belonged to Settsu except Nishi Ward and Tarumi Ward, which belonged to Harima).\nLater, during the Edo period, the eastern parts of present-day Kobe came under the jurisdiction of the Amagasaki Domain and the western parts under that of the Akashi Domain, while the center was controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate. It was not until the abolition of the han system in 1871 and the establishment of the current prefecture system that the area became politically distinct.\nHy\u014dgo Port was opened to foreign trade by the Shogunal government at the same time as Osaka on January 1, 1868, just before the advent of the Boshin War and the Meiji Restoration. The region has since been identified with the West and many foreign residences from the period remain in Kobe's Kitano area.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nKobe, as it is known today, was founded on April 1, 1889, and was designated on September 1, 1956 by government ordinance. The history of the city is closely tied to that of the Ikuta Shrine, and the name \"Kobe\" derives from kamube (\u795e\u6238, later kanbe), an archaic name for those who supported the shrine.During World War II, Kobe was bombed in the Doolittle Raid on April 18, 1942, along with Tokyo and a few other cities. Eventually, it was bombed again with incendiary bombs by B-29 bombers on March 17, 1945, causing the death of 8,841 residents and destroying 21% of Kobe's urban area. This incident inspired the well-known Studio Ghibli film Grave of the Fireflies and the book by Akiyuki Nosaka on which the film was based. It also features in the motion picture A Boy Called H.\nFollowing continuous pressure from citizens, on March 18, 1975, the Kobe City Council passed an ordinance banning vessels carrying nuclear weapons from Kobe Port. This effectively prevented any U.S. warships from entering the port, policy being not to disclose whether any warship is carrying nuclear weapons. This nonproliferation policy has been termed the \"Kobe formula\".On January 17, 1995, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake occurred at 5:46 am JST near the city. About 6,434 people in the city were killed, 212,443 were made homeless, and large parts of the port facilities and other parts of the city were destroyed. The earthquake destroyed portions of the Hanshin Expressway, an elevated freeway that dramatically toppled over. In Japan, the earthquake is known as the Great Hanshin earthquake (or the Hanshin-Awaji earthquake). To commemorate Kobe's recovery from the 1995 quake, the city holds an event every December called the Luminarie, where the city center is decorated with illuminated metal archways.\nThe Port of Kobe was Japan's busiest port and one of Asia's top ports until the Great Hanshin earthquake. Kobe has since dropped to fourth in Japan and 49th-busiest container port worldwide (as of 2012).\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nWedged between the coast and the mountains, the city of Kobe is long and narrow. To the east is the city of Ashiya, while the city of Akashi lies to its west. Other adjacent cities include Takarazuka and Nishinomiya to the east and Sanda and Miki to the north.\nThe landmark of the port area is the red steel Port Tower. A Ferris wheel sits in nearby Harborland, a notable tourist promenade. Two artificial islands, Port Island and Rokk\u014d Island, have been constructed to give the city room to expand.\nAway from the seaside at the heart of Kobe lie the Motomachi and Sannomiya districts, as well as Kobe's Chinatown, Nankinmachi, all well-known retail areas. A multitude of train lines cross the city from east to west. The main transport hub is Sannomiya Station, with the eponymous Kobe Station located to the west and the Shinkansen Shin-Kobe Station to the north.\nMount Rokk\u014d overlooks Kobe at an elevation of 931 meters. During the autumn season, it is famous for the rich change in colors of its forests.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\nKobe has nine wards (ku):\n\nNishi-ku: The westernmost area of Kobe, Nishi-ku overlooks the city of Akashi and is the site of Kobe Gakuin University. This ward has the largest population, with 247,000 residents.\nKita-ku: Kita-ku is the largest ward by area and contains the Rokko Mountain Range, including Mount Rokk\u014d and Mount Maya. The area is well known for its rugged landscape and hiking trails. The onsen resort town of Arima also lies within Kita-ku.\nTarumi-ku: Tarumi-ku is a mostly residential area. The longest suspension bridge in the world, the Akashi Kaiky\u014d Bridge, extends from Maiko in Tarumi-ku to Awaji Island to the south. A relatively new addition to Kobe, Tarumi-ku was not a part of the city until 1946.\nSuma-ku: Suma-ku is the site of Suma beach, attracting visitors during the summer months.\nNagata-ku: Nagata-ku is the site of Nagata Shrine, one of the three \"Great Shrines\" in Kobe.\nHy\u014dgo-ku: At various times known as \u014cwada Anchorage or Hy\u014dgo Port, this area is the historical heart of the city. Shinkaichi in Hyogo-ku was once the commercial center of Kobe, but was heavily damaged during World War II, and since, Hyogo-ku has lost much of its former prominence.\nCh\u016b\u014d-ku: Ch\u016b\u014d (\u4e2d\u592e) literally means \"center\" and, as such, Ch\u016b\u014d-ku is the commercial and entertainment center of Kobe. Sannomiya, Motomachi and Harborland make up the main entertainment areas in Kobe. Ch\u016b\u014d-ku includes the city hall and Hy\u014dgo prefectural government offices. Port Island and Kobe Airport lie in the southern part of this ward.\nNada-ku: The site of Oji Zoo and Kobe University, Nada is known for its sake. Along with Fushimi in Kyoto, it accounts for 45% of Japan's sake production.\nHigashinada-ku: The easternmost area of Kobe, Higashinada-ku borders the city of Ashiya. The man-made island of Rokko makes up the southern part of this ward.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Climate ==\nKobe has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa) with hot summers and cool to cold winters.

          "Beautiful tower and great way to see the city - make sure you visit the revolving moving bar on the 11th floor for a sake tasting experience - it is absolutely incredible!",
          "The Kobe Port Tower is interesting. When I saw it from a distance I thought it might be like the Tokyo Tower since it was red but the shape was quite different. Completed in 1963, the Kobe Port Tower was designed by the Nikken Sekkei Company, the famous Japanese architecture",
          "It was an amazing view on top, really liked it. I might go next time at day time. They don't accept credit cards though, there is also a package that includes entrance to the museum, however since we came late we only had a chance to go to the tower.",
          "Worth visiting, on day trips from Osaka or Hiroshima.. U can visit the Port first or do the visit after visiting the Kobe Motomachi shopping street (sheltered) and Chinatown. Nearby Starbucks and also the ferries wheel",

          "The view from the tower is beautiful but I wouldn't recommend going up unless you have a lot of time without much else to do or simply enjoy towers. I took several pictures of the city from the top but in retrospect I feel I couldve taken them from anywhere else.",
          "This is a nice area to walk around, I like it more by night. There is a group of buldings and a light eye fully colourated. The Kobe Tower has a very nice view at the top, and you can take pictures and have ones taken by a team from there.",
          "You can gauge your location in Kobe by focusing on this tower which can be seen from almost any area in Kobe. It's red colour stands out. It's not necessary to go up in the tower to admire it as it's one of several attractions down on Meriken Park and worth spending a couple of",
          "Getting there from Sannomiya was a bit difficult as there's no clear English sign where to transfer to Hanshin line. And using Google for land navigation was as useless as usual. Once you board the Hanshin line and stop at the Motomachi station, there's a 1KM walk down to the",

          "Kobe Port Tower is a landmark and famous port icon of Kobe.The 108 m tall tower is shaped like a typical Japanese percussion with a pipe-shaped outer frame and a red led light mounted so the night view looks more beautiful.I arrived at noon so I could not see the beauty of the",

          "The cost of visiting the tower is 700 yen, but if you visit the Maritime museum then the cost of going up the tower is just 400 yen. So I spent 1,000 yen to visit both attractions. The tower is very impressive form a distance, standing out bright red with it's unique shape.",
          "Pay 700 yen and you are allowed to ride a lift to the (not so high) 360 degree observatory on the top floor. Good commanding views of Kobe and its port but, for me, savagely overpriced. There is a revolving restaurant on one of the lower floors which, although cannot be cheap",

          "There used to be a rule in place that no building in Kobe should be higher than the the Port tower. However this was taken out of place when the Okura Hotel next door was build. Never the less it is still a nice monument in Merican Park with its unique hourglass shape.",
          "It costs 700 yen to get to the top! It is not that crowded as Tokyo tower of Skytree ! Less people here which makes it even more romantic ! The view here is stunning ! Totally worth it ! Bring your lover here for a romantic moment ! Fell in love with this place ! The places",
          "It's elegantly located on the waterfront, in Kobe Harbourland. Great spot to view Kobe both day and night, with shopping centers, parks, and restaurants nearby. Easily accessible by buses.",
          "Very beautiful tower from which you can see the whole harbor and Kobe city. You can walk from Kobe station, it's about 15minutes and easy to find, because the tower is high enough to see it from the distance. We visited the tower as a stopover on our way to Himeji. There are",
          "We took a stroll in the evening. It was a very relaxing place to feel a bit of sea breeze and a magnificent view. There are lots of restaurant nearby, high end dining and also coffee shops.",
          "The Kobe Harbour Tower is a good experience. You can enjoy a cup of coffee or a cold drink while the tower slowly turns, and you get to see the whole harbour area from above. Very nice",
          "Kobe Port Tower is located very near to the harbour front. It is a good place to view the harbour, one of the oldest harbour opened to foreigners in 19th century. There are not too many facilities or exhibitions in the tower, there is a small cafe on 2/F but we did not visit. I",
          "Good landmark to orientate yourself if you stay at Okura Kobe. Lots of drug stores and shopping opportunities near by.",
          "Went up, got a Birdseye view of Kobe, thought that it gave me excellent perspective of how the city is laid out, and then I got lost returning to my hotel.",
          "We only looked at it from the outside. To be honest, we must have visited more than 15 towers around the world. Kobe Port Tower looked very good among the best.",
          "Close to our hotel and just a short walk. We saved this for the evening for the greatest effect. Nothing worth shouting about, but for pictures it's a must. Close to the park, and dock area, it makes a romantic evening. You can In The daytime take a boat for a tour. The one",
          "One of the highest peak in Kobe where you can see the stunning view of Kobe port and the mountainous part of Kobe. We enjoy our sumptuous cheese cake at the rotating restaurant. The rotation is bit slow compared to the other rotating tower/restaurant I have visited.",
          "Years have passed since I visited the tower last time. The years have witnessed a great change of the port. The port has become more a tourist attraction than an industrial port. The tower was standing in the middle of a pier, whereas it stands in the midst of a tourist park.",
          "A really great place to see all over Kobe. Getting a little in need of a facelift as many areas look worn down but it is still a cool place to visit. Sitting with a beer/coffee at the rotating restaurant is nice.",

          "I have been here with my friends in a summer evening. It was really hot up there, and there was not enough room for everyone - it was narrow. From the tower you can see Kobe city, but it was not really high so the view was not really impressive. And the most disappointing thing",
          "if wou like towers like japanese do...try the Kobe Port Tower. It isn t tall like Tokyo tower but the place where is located is better. The view from the top is amazing. the ticket price is cheap. the staff is friendly. do not miss this place if you arrive in Kobe.",
          "They have a package where you can go up the tower and go on a ferry ride. The tower tour itself is mildly interesting and it does offer a 360 degree view of the bay and the city. Inside the observation deck they will offer to take your picture and you can choose to buy it when",
          "Tokyo TV Tower is a must see when you visit Tokyo. It's a magnificent tower of steel and painted in red colour.",
          "This tower function is for watching the traffic of the harbor. The place was clean and many educational we have including the story of the earthquake.",
          "Everything has been rebuilt after the earthquake, apart from as small piece which has been left so that we can realize how it was at that time.. difficult not to feel very sad ...",
          "There are several levels of stunning views, from this beautiful striking red structure as you travel to the top of Kobe Tower by lift. At the top you can get beautiful views of the mountains and the harbour, sunset is a popular time to go up and get some amazing shots, there are",
          "Climb the tower to get great views over the harbour & city. Has restaurant & souvenir shops - upper level has section of glass floor - not for those who dont like heights.",
          "It isn't the highest tower in Japan but is worth popping up if you are in the port area. The 360 degree views are excellent. We felt a little movement so if you suffer badly with vertigo or are nervous of feeling movement in tall buildings this might not be for you. There is one",
          "Located in the Harborland area, Kobe Port Tower is a landmark in Kobe. Although the tower is not very tall (108 meters ) compared to many other such towers, it provides a good view of Kobe, especially the harbor area. Good photo opportunity as well. What the tower lacks in",
          "The tower can be easily accessible by City Loop bus. There are bundled tickets of tower together with maritime museum just a street cross over. 360 degree of Kobe view can be observed. A nice short trip to spend while in Kobe.",
          "Great views from the top of this tower in all directions over Kobe. It was quiet when we visited and we didn't have to queue.",
          "I took a train from osaka station to kobe then took a green bus going to the tower. There was a festival that time so bus was not on schedule, we have to wait for a little longer. The tower has 5 floors, have to pay about 700jpy to go up, theres a coffee shop at 5th floor,",
          "Though it was quite windy and cold I took the chance to revisit Kobe Port. It's good for dating as I've heard from my Japanese friend that this place is famous for couples. Too bad I'm single but I still enjoyed the place.",
          "360 degree views of Kobe and surrounds. It costs JPY 700, approx AU$8.75 to go up to the viewing areas, and you can stay up as long as you want. There are binoculars for close ups, which cost JPY200 per 2 minutes. There's also a nice gift shop that sells souvenirs and a",
          "Lovely view especialy while you sit on the moving table,so you just sit down drink coffee or beer,relax and enjoy the view of the city,great experience",
          "Ok night view of the city. The base of the tower doesn't offer much as far as attraction. But the tower is convient to get to.",
          "Not much to say, small metal structure that transmit TV waves.... this TripAdvisor 100 letter thing bores .\u00e9 sometimes. What is to be expected here?",
          "Headed up here with a joint-ticket for the port tower and boat cruise. it's a little old-feeling, but has gorgeous views from the top, especially as the sun sets and the surrounding harbour etc starts to light up. a little disappointed that the glass floors on the 1st floor are",
          "I went to the tower after buying a combo ticket which gave discount on the tower and a cruise of the bay area. The tower itself offers great views above the city, seeing all around the city, the mountains and the sea. There is a cafe as well, but I didn't stop to see what that",
          "The tower features in most pictures of Kobe and certainly the waterfront. It looked great from the outside and stood out, especially in its red paint.",
          "Every Japanese city seems to have its viewing tower, and this was a good one. The view of the hills behind were good, but the best views were of the huge port and the new islands on reclaimed land. No crowds and good value at Y700.",
          "It is one of the most famous spots of Kobe and we enjoyed the view very much! The walk around the harborland is also highly recommend!",
          "While the admission price is one of the least expensive city towers I've ever experienced, when you're on a budget, every bit counts. Our friends wanted to do this and the views were admittedly cool. The \"sky walk\" is not impressive, but it's interesting to see the man made",
          "There is nothing special about this tower FROM THE INSIDE. it's rather small tower. The view from inside the tower was blocked by the tower outer ornament. So its imposible to get a clean birdeye view from this tower. There are some shops inside the tower. The price is",
          "This is the best place you can visit in Kobe , a really nice traditional market which leads to the port and ship cruises for evening time . I really never forget this one . You can enjoy every single moment in this area . It is a combination of modern things with traditional",
          "Decent well kept attraction, good value. Great view, but it is a tower after all. There was a cruise ship in port at the time and other activity in the port, so it was more than just looking at the surrounding buildings.",
          "Port Tower is a landmark in Kobe thus a place we like to go when we are there. Entry fee is required and paid at the ticket dispenser. There are 3 floors where which offers a 360 view of Kobe and is accessible via a lift. The self-guided tour is very organized as there are staff",
          "Not a very high tower but it's high enough place to see the sea and around the city. I went with family. Everybody enjoyed especially the kids who could see the harbor by a camera on the top of the tower.",
          "Something to do on a fine day...not the worlds highest tower,but you get a good view of Kobe city and the mountains behind. On a clear day you can see all the way to Osaka and appreciate the size of the Osaka Bay and the industry around the bay..",
          "Very nice Port Tower with a Red color and full of light at the night . Winter and night prefer ........",
          "The view across the harbour is spectacular with the Kawasaki/museum building adjacent. If the sky is blue, it forms a nice backdrop. Its close or adjacent to Merikien park. If one is taking the cityloop, one can get down at the Merikien park. And just a 2 minute walk to reach",
          "This is not a very high tower. It would have been better if it was higher with probably more views of Kobe city. However, when we were going down the stairs, we realised the lower levels give clearer pictures of the buildings and features near the tower. After this tower, we",
          "The red tower is claimed to be the first constructed with pipes. Although it is not a really tall tower it does provide views of the city and the airport.",
          "We stayed at a hotel nearby and wandered down to the Kobe Port Tower. The view of the water is beautiful. The tower at night is very photogenic.",
          "Like most towers overlooking the Harbour, sea or the city, this one is located just near the Harbour so you get to see the views. It's not really that high a tower but high enough for an overview of the place. Next to great shopping and food areas. Glass walkway might be a",
          "Nice view on Kobe city, Completely different at daytime and night, recommend both but if I have to choose I recommend to go at night.",
          "An icon of Kobe city. However, better watch it from the harbour or simply dine in a restaurant over there to watch it instead of going there, the same as La Tour Eiffel. Differently, this tower is more modern but you will be well assured that the whole scene is perfect when you",
          "This is not the best view on the harbor. The restaurant is quite useless, and the rotation is so slow you barely feel it. Therefore it is definitely not a must do, I would say just a must see as the tower in beautiful at night..... From outside ! ....",
          "I was there last week end with my Chinese friend, we had a walk round Harborland after lunch, then we decided to go to the top of the Tower to enjoy the sea side view to it`s best. We had to wait on the line for a while but it was worth it. We enjoyed Kobe from the top. It was a",
          "I went up to the top of Kobe Port Tower and enjoyed the perfect view over the whole city from there. It is wearth the money to get the view.",
          "The Kobe Port Tower is very beautiful at night! I loved walking around the area, near the waters and with lots of restaurants and shops to go to!",
          "Had an enjoyable walk alongside this beautiful place. Best to go at night. There is a big shopping centre just across the bridge which sells all kind of stuff; and a food paradise too.",
          "We didn't go up the tower...looked a bit worn....and wasn't that high, but it was a nice sight to see in the harbour.",
          "This tower provides 360 degrees view of Kobe but the tower itself is not as tall. Admission fee is Yen700 but definitly not worth the time and money to go there. The interior of the building is quite dated. The place is small and what makes it worse is that the lights in the",
          "My husband and I loved the Kobe Tower. It was simple with a great view. The view opened up the ocean view I had been longing to see. It is a pretty area that provides a break from the congestion so prominent in Japan. The view from the tower enabled us to point out some",
          "The Kobe Port Tower is only about a 15 minute walk from Kobe Station. The views from within the tower are good but I feel that there are more interesting things to see as you walk around the area. I saw a statue of Elvis (!) and Anpanman as I walked to the Tower. A little bit",
          "If you are in the area anyway, you should definitely take the opportunity to visit the tower and enjoy the view from above. I would not go out of my way to make it there, but very nice if you are already in the area.",
          "We have visited this area several times and took pictures from the surroundings of the Tower. It was particularly impressive at night time with all the lights on. Should you have time, you could climb up the tower with a fee and have panoramic views from the top and may have",
          "The scenery around Kobe port is beautiful and much more better when in the night. Highly recommend to take a photo from the opposite site of Kobe port tower. No needs to go to the obervation deck. It's not worth for entrance fee.",
          "One of the iconic places in Kobe. Awesome place with a perfect view of Kobe city and the port. You must visit the floating restaurant where you can enjoy your meal while having a panoramic view.",
          "Kobe harbour is definitely worth a visit. Kobe tower forms a significant part of the area but it's really old and creaky. The views are decent but Kobe isn't as picturesque as Tokyo or Yokohama from up high for example. It didn't cost much to go up here but, even so, it wasn't",
          "If one wants to have a panoramic view of the Kobe city, then the Kobe Port Tower provides the best possible option. A good quality camera is advisable for capturing breathtaking views.",
          "It's nice ot visit to enjoy the view of port of Kobe. There is a roating resturant where you can enjoy the food and coffee by looking down the port. Enjoy!",
          "Great to go up the tower to have a look . The scenery was fantastic on a clear sunny day . We saw a wedding being held from up high . Got view of the port area and beyond with the red bridge in view . Go during the week less crowds",
          "the tower offers great views all around from the top deck, and you can admire the beautiful port of Kobe",
          "The tower is with red colour and easy to see from far away, and good for pictures. When hungry, could have some meals in the restaurant inside the tower. Since the tower not so tall, I did not go to the observation deck",
          "Well there is not too much to say about this tower, it certainly adds to the harbour area, but on its only it's simply something to spend a few minutes at and take some photos.",
          "The Kobe Port Tower survived the earthquake of 1995 but it now appears pretty tired and in need of maintenance. A bit expensive to go up and the souvinir shops around the base are tacky and not too inviting. Perhaps it is one of those attractions that is best visted at night.",
          "notting spesial just to have the photo because feel not right if you go to Kobe but dont have the picture with bacground of Kobe Port Tower.",
          "Having visited a few towers around Japan, this tower was one of the least crowded. No lines, no wait mid-week, mid-day. The view of the harbor and mountains surrounding Kobe makes for good Instagram shots.",
          "Probably the tackiest place I have visited in Japan so far. For 700 yen you get the delightful view of a motorway and a Ferris wheel from a rusty and paint-deprived viewing deck with some printed-at-home hello kitty stickers all over it. We went in the evening, and half of the",
          "Easy to find and not too far to walk if u are looking for the exercise. We were staying at the Diawa hotel near the min JR station.",
          "The Kobe Tower provides a good view of the harbor and the city. Kobe city spreads up from the flat cost up the mountains which are right next to the water. It's really a nice view of the city. There are many nearby attractions (Kobe Earth Quake Memorial, Meriken park,",
          "Not much to say after you've seen towers all over the world It's pretty at night when lit up and the wedding venue nearby has a cool water fountain show hourly at night so worth a trip there",
          "Port towers give you nice views of Kobe. It has, however, seen better days. There is not much to do when you are up the top. Kids like it.",
          "This uniquely shaped orange-red tower structure is located in Meriken Park. The tower is only 108 metres high. We went up to the second floor. A small souvenir shop and the ticket office is there if we want to go up to the observation deck. We didn\u2019t bother, because we can see",
          "A must go to see the ships near the port. lots of things to do. must pay to go to the top though. weekdays its pretty not busy.weekends is a diff story",
          "bought this as part of a package. took a lift to the top. nice view of the whole kobe. the mountain nearby and the sea view",
          "It is nice but crowded with tourist. There are a lot of shops around the area and party cruises are available if anybody is interested.",
          "We visited a few towers in our last trip to Japan and this one was our favourite. It's probably not the newest inside as some of the others but it has a revolving bar where you can sit and have a drink whilst the sun goes down. We went in winter and there were hardly any people",
          "A nice tower located near to the port of the city. It is of easy Access and as much things in Japan, it is good if you can see it in the night so you can see it lighted up.",
          "We chose not to go to the top of the tower (having already visited SkyTree and some similar buildings), but the architecture of the tower is pretty unusual and it's nice to see it lit up at night. I'd recommend having dinner on the waterfront and enjoying the view instead.",
          "It's only 700yen to be at the top of Port Tower! The tower was very well kept, and you can see all of City of Kobe from the top. It was very nice sunny day when we visited, so the view from the top was very clear and beautiful. But quite frankly, that's it. You see the view and",
          "This is a Kobe icon, and a fun photo opp, particularly at night. Take a walk through Meriken Park, and check out nice visuals.",
          "It's not too interesting or even tall compared to the other towers in Japan, but it is a good view of Kobe at the harbour. There's even a cafe two floors from the main observation deck that spins slowly as you have a leisurely coffee or small bite to eat, with a higher than",
          "Kobe Port Tower survived the 1995 earthquake & has become an icon of the cities resilience. Conveniently situated on Meriken Park & near waterfront & the ferry terminals, it is well worth a visit if you are in Kobe. You can take in Kobe Maritime Museum & the Earthquake Memorial",
          "Walking through on Sunday, I did not have a chance to go to the top. but was impressed by everything around it!",
          "We enjoyed going up the tower on a sunny day, but wouldn't rush to do it again. We actually enjoyed photographing it from the outside more than the views from the inside.",
          "This tower is amazing architecture monument. We had beautiful weather so we really enjoyed this atraction.",
          "Had some time and wanted to check out the view. As others have said you get a similar view for free from City Hall. The fee was fair and it was not crowded on a Sat morning. Would not make a special trip for it though.",
          "Reasonable cost to access. Great view of Kobe City, the mountains and the sea. Well worth taking the time to visit when in Kobe.",
          "Amazing view from the Kobe Port Tower. My boyfriend and I went there in the evening and we were able to enjoy the beautiful sunset and the amazing night view at the Kobe Port Tower. The Kobe Port Tower is one the stops with the City-loop bus. The bus stop is just right",
          "We visited from our cruise ship in port using the loop bus. The day was overcast with showers but the tower was worth the Y700 admittance. We were assisted at every turn by the tower team who offered by 84 year old mother assistance and respect. The view was excellent and",
          "We bought a day pass for the Loop Bus taking us around Kobe and there is a stop right underneath the Kobe Tower.",
          "I have been to see the tower several times during my travels to Kobe and just love the structure, colors and position right on the waterfront. The tower can be seen from many locations across the city as well.",
          "Do not enter in tower. It does not worth it because content was nothing. Even though there is no content excpet nice view, you should pay \u00a5700. What I felt is the shape when I was looking it in outaide is the mosy beautiful. So trust me, do not enter in tower...",
          "The picture post-card opportunity. Lately they have modified it to LED lights to save energy. Hence looks less brighter.",
          "Obviously the highlight of the tower is the view from the top. The price to enter was reasonable and there is an elevator to take you right up to the highest point that is opened to visitors. As many have stated, the view at night is probably the best, especially with the",
          "excellent place... especially the nearby attractions. Very interesting events take place nearby on weekends.",
          "Make sure you come in the evening or after dark for a stunning night shot of the minimalist Kobe Tower and the adjacent Kobe Harborland (Mosaic). Not many activities nearby, but its walking distance from Kobe Chinatown and Sannomiya Shopping Street.",
          "The tower offers great views of Kobe, parts of Osaka, Maiko Beach, and south to KIX airport. Try to time your visit for the spectacular sunset over the mountains. They offer a special discounted price if you purchase tickets to the Tower and the Kawasaki Fun Times Museum. I",
          "I loved this attraction. It will give you an idea of how big amd beautiful the city of Kobe is. Price is unexpensive but just a tip: if you buy the daily tourist tram ticket you get a discount on this attraction. In the area there are lots of other things to do...",
          "It was almost deserted when I arrived. The staf were very friendly. The views from the top were very good, I got some good photos of reflections in several glass buildings! The cafe has a revolving platform so we had coffee and cakes whilst enjoying a 360o view over Kobe. There",
          "Kobe port tower is the only tower and a landmark in Kobe. Not too tall but it is still neat to visit briefly",
          "Loved the view, loved the revolving cafe, on a clear day gives a great perspective of Kobe and the port and how it is expanding into the bay over time.",
          "This is one of the most popular attractions in Kobe, I would say, because of the unique design of its structure and the way it looks at night. The tower itself is not very tall, and it can easily be scaled through an elevator inside. As I visited through a packaged tour, I don't",

          "Pretty good view from the Port tower even though it's not that tall, even for Kobe's buildings. Since Kobe is such a narrow town bounded by the mountains to the sea, the tower is in the right position to admire this perspective. The tower is quite a legacy in Kobe as it's been"

        "wiki": "Kobe ( KOH-bee, -\u2060bay; Japanese: [ko\ua71c\u02d0be]; officially \u795e\u6238\u5e02, K\u014dbe-shi) is the seventh-largest city in Japan and the capital city of Hy\u014dgo Prefecture. It is located on the southern side of the main island of Honsh\u016b, on the north shore of Osaka Bay and about 30 km (19 mi) west of Osaka. With a population around 1.5 million, the city is part of the Keihanshin metropolitan area along with Osaka and Kyoto.The earliest written records regarding the region come from the Nihon Shoki, which describes the founding of the Ikuta Shrine by Empress Jing\u016b in AD 201. For most of its history, the area was never a single political entity, even during the Tokugawa period, when the port was controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate. Kobe did not exist in its current form until its founding in 1889. Its name comes from Kanbe (\u795e\u6238, an archaic title for supporters of the city's Ikuta Shrine).  Kobe became one of Japan's designated cities in 1956.\nKobe was one of the cities to open for trade with the West following the 1853 end of the policy of seclusion and has since been known as a cosmopolitan and nuclear-free zone port city. While the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake diminished much of Kobe's prominence as a port city, it remains Japan's fourth-busiest container port.  Companies headquartered in Kobe include ASICS, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and Kobe Steel, as well as over 100 international corporations with Asian or Japanese headquarters in the city, such as Eli Lilly and Company, Procter & Gamble, Boehringer Ingelheim, and Nestl\u00e9. The city is the point of origin and namesake of Kobe beef, as well as the site of one of Japan's most famous hot spring resorts, Arima Onsen.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n Media related to History of Kobe at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n=== Origins to the Meiji era ===\nTools found in western Kobe demonstrate the area was populated at least from the J\u014dmon period. The natural geography of the area, particularly of Wada Cape in Hy\u014dgo-ku, led to the development of a port, which would remain the economic center of the city. Some of the earliest written documents mentioning the region include the Nihon Shoki, which describes the founding of the Ikuta Shrine by Empress Jing\u016b in AD 201.During the Nara and Heian periods, the port was known by the name \u014cwada Anchorage (\u014cwada-no-tomari) and was one of the ports from which imperial embassies to China were dispatched.  The city was briefly the capital of Japan in 1180, when Taira no Kiyomori moved his grandson Emperor Antoku to Fukuhara in present-day Hy\u014dgo-ku. The Emperor returned to Kyoto after about five months. Shortly thereafter in 1184, the Taira fortress in Hy\u014dgo-ku and the nearby Ikuta Shrine became the sites of the Genpei War battle of Ichi-no-Tani between the Taira and Minamoto clans. The Minamoto prevailed, pushing the Taira further.\nAs the port grew during the Kamakura period, it became an important hub for trade with China and other countries. In the 13th century, the city came to be known by the name Hy\u014dgo Port (\u5175\u5eab\u6d25, Hy\u014dgo-tsu). During this time, Hy\u014dgo Port, along with northern Osaka, composed the province of Settsu (most of today's Kobe belonged to Settsu except Nishi Ward and Tarumi Ward, which belonged to Harima).\nLater, during the Edo period, the eastern parts of present-day Kobe came under the jurisdiction of the Amagasaki Domain and the western parts under that of the Akashi Domain, while the center was controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate. It was not until the abolition of the han system in 1871 and the establishment of the current prefecture system that the area became politically distinct.\nHy\u014dgo Port was opened to foreign trade by the Shogunal government at the same time as Osaka on January 1, 1868, just before the advent of the Boshin War and the Meiji Restoration. The region has since been identified with the West and many foreign residences from the period remain in Kobe's Kitano area.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nKobe, as it is known today, was founded on April 1, 1889, and was designated on September 1, 1956 by government ordinance. The history of the city is closely tied to that of the Ikuta Shrine, and the name \"Kobe\" derives from kamube (\u795e\u6238, later kanbe), an archaic name for those who supported the shrine.During World War II, Kobe was bombed in the Doolittle Raid on April 18, 1942, along with Tokyo and a few other cities. Eventually, it was bombed again with incendiary bombs by B-29 bombers on March 17, 1945, causing the death of 8,841 residents and destroying 21% of Kobe's urban area. This incident inspired the well-known Studio Ghibli film Grave of the Fireflies and the book by Akiyuki Nosaka on which the film was based. It also features in the motion picture A Boy Called H.\nFollowing continuous pressure from citizens, on March 18, 1975, the Kobe City Council passed an ordinance banning vessels carrying nuclear weapons from Kobe Port. This effectively prevented any U.S. warships from entering the port, policy being not to disclose whether any warship is carrying nuclear weapons. This nonproliferation policy has been termed the \"Kobe formula\".On January 17, 1995, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake occurred at 5:46 am JST near the city. About 6,434 people in the city were killed, 212,443 were made homeless, and large parts of the port facilities and other parts of the city were destroyed. The earthquake destroyed portions of the Hanshin Expressway, an elevated freeway that dramatically toppled over. In Japan, the earthquake is known as the Great Hanshin earthquake (or the Hanshin-Awaji earthquake). To commemorate Kobe's recovery from the 1995 quake, the city holds an event every December called the Luminarie, where the city center is decorated with illuminated metal archways.\nThe Port of Kobe was Japan's busiest port and one of Asia's top ports until the Great Hanshin earthquake. Kobe has since dropped to fourth in Japan and 49th-busiest container port worldwide (as of 2012).\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nWedged between the coast and the mountains, the city of Kobe is long and narrow. To the east is the city of Ashiya, while the city of Akashi lies to its west. Other adjacent cities include Takarazuka and Nishinomiya to the east and Sanda and Miki to the north.\nThe landmark of the port area is the red steel Port Tower. A Ferris wheel sits in nearby Harborland, a notable tourist promenade. Two artificial islands, Port Island and Rokk\u014d Island, have been constructed to give the city room to expand.\nAway from the seaside at the heart of Kobe lie the Motomachi and Sannomiya districts, as well as Kobe's Chinatown, Nankinmachi, all well-known retail areas. A multitude of train lines cross the city from east to west. The main transport hub is Sannomiya Station, with the eponymous Kobe Station located to the west and the Shinkansen Shin-Kobe Station to the north.\nMount Rokk\u014d overlooks Kobe at an elevation of 931 meters. During the autumn season, it is famous for the rich change in colors of its forests.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\nKobe has nine wards (ku):\n\nNishi-ku: The westernmost area of Kobe, Nishi-ku overlooks the city of Akashi and is the site of Kobe Gakuin University. This ward has the largest population, with 247,000 residents.\nKita-ku: Kita-ku is the largest ward by area and contains the Rokko Mountain Range, including Mount Rokk\u014d and Mount Maya. The area is well known for its rugged landscape and hiking trails. The onsen resort town of Arima also lies within Kita-ku.\nTarumi-ku: Tarumi-ku is a mostly residential area. The longest suspension bridge in the world, the Akashi Kaiky\u014d Bridge, extends from Maiko in Tarumi-ku to Awaji Island to the south. A relatively new addition to Kobe, Tarumi-ku was not a part of the city until 1946.\nSuma-ku: Suma-ku is the site of Suma beach, attracting visitors during the summer months.\nNagata-ku: Nagata-ku is the site of Nagata Shrine, one of the three \"Great Shrines\" in Kobe.\nHy\u014dgo-ku: At various times known as \u014cwada Anchorage or Hy\u014dgo Port, this area is the historical heart of the city. Shinkaichi in Hyogo-ku was once the commercial center of Kobe, but was heavily damaged during World War II, and since, Hyogo-ku has lost much of its former prominence.\nCh\u016b\u014d-ku: Ch\u016b\u014d (\u4e2d\u592e) literally means \"center\" and, as such, Ch\u016b\u014d-ku is the commercial and entertainment center of Kobe. Sannomiya, Motomachi and Harborland make up the main entertainment areas in Kobe. Ch\u016b\u014d-ku includes the city hall and Hy\u014dgo prefectural government offices. Port Island and Kobe Airport lie in the southern part of this ward.\nNada-ku: The site of Oji Zoo and Kobe University, Nada is known for its sake. Along with Fushimi in Kyoto, it accounts for 45% of Japan's sake production.\nHigashinada-ku: The easternmost area of Kobe, Higashinada-ku borders the city of Ashiya. The man-made island of Rokko makes up the southern part of this ward.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Climate ==\nKobe has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa) with hot summers and cool to cold winters.

          "We entered the gardens by ropeway, and felt immediately like we left Japan. The architecture of the buildings on the top is very inspired by Germany, and there are lots of small shops for food and drinks. The gardens themselves are very nice and well kept. For a city like Kobe",
          "This is a great trip to see fabulous gardens, with amazing views from the cable car and the various terraces. The gardens are delightful, and you can walk back down through the gardens to the half way station. It would be spectacular later in the season when the tulips and the",

          "Enjoyed this place immensely, The gondola ride up offered stunning views of Kobe.The gardens were in full spring bloom with cherry blossoms, tulips, hyacinths and many more flowers. Just beautiful. The scent of herbs, especially rosemary, was everywhere. It's a little out of the",

          "I think not worth a visit as there\u2019s really nothing much to see .. limited herd garden to know about herb, limited flower display and probably a great view to Kobe town as you take a ropeway to the mountain. Nice area to sit and relax but nothing spectacular.. I am surprised why",
          "We took the cable car up and then walked down which was lovely as we meandered through some lovely gardens and got to visit the beautiful greenhouses which had lovely plants, flowers and trees in them. Would imagine that in summer it would be fantastic as there are hammocks that",

          "Initially wanted to hike up, but it's not very convenient and the cablecar is probably the better choice. Up there it's beautiful with nice botanical arrangements and food stalls on the very top. From here you can see the Kobe bay and parts of Osaka. When the weather is good",

          "This garden offers fantastic view not only of the colorful flowers in the area, but it also gives you scenic view of Kobe port and Osaka area. Going there is equally fun as you will take a cable ride of about 20 minutes to the top, offering scenic views as well of the mountains",

          "This is one activity to do if time is a constraint. We bought a 1 way ticket for the ropeway (cablecar) & walk down to the middle station as there are many plants to view from the top down. Due to the many open places, there are picnickers all around. Best to go in Spring.",
          "Sitting in hammocks and arriving in style in a cable car was a great day out. The fragrance museum, although small, was also fascinating. Lunches were limited to an outdoor burger cafe (good burgers though!) or a posher upstairs restaurant which was only serving sandwiches - not",
          "I was really bored and did not find it engaging. Its probably good for some people but not for me. There's really not much to see or do, they please is rather small and the herb gardens were quite sparse and limited. Certainly I felt it was not worth going all the way there and",
          "Definitely, a place to visit! My friend went there and you can see different plants and flowers. The relaxing ambiance is awesome. This is also perfect for couples. The cable car ride was nice too as you can see the trees and the whole garden as you go up and down.",
          "We took the gondola to the top, skipped all the touristy things there, and had a lovely walk down to the mid-station. Even though it was mid-March, there were plenty of flowers in bloom, and plenty of lovely perennials. The sights from the gondola alone are worth the price, but",

          "A ropeway to the top is located near the train station. Using the ropeway you can have a wonderful experience, weather dependent of course. To start, you get a reasonably priced, nicely long, and very scenic ride to the top where the upper portions of the garden are located.",
          "Great view of Kobe from the top of the mountain. Highly recommend taking the ropeway up and then walking down and exploring the rest of the mountain and its hidden lakes and waterfalls. Go earlier so you can take your time to walk down and stop to smell the roses (and herbs)!",
          "We came to Kobe after Himeji and found this place very nice. But we arrived at 415pm but the wiser choice was to go after 5pm if you can\u2019t reach earlier. The green house closed at 5pm so we didnt make it and the admission for round trip cable car if you go after 5pm is 900yen,",
          "On the way up the mountain, you can stop off at the Kobe Nunobiki Herb Garden. It has some lovely flower and herb gardens and a nicely designed tourist area. On a German theme with German craft beer on sale. Reasonably priced and a good place to spend a couple of hours.",
          "We came on a weekday, wasn\u2019t crowded. The visitors are mainly Japanese with a couple of foreigners. The entrance fee for a round trip ropeway for adult costs 1500 yen. Unless you are there for hiking, it is advisable to take the ropeway up and down! We thoroughly enjoyed the",
          "The climb up via ropeway offered a great view. The garden itself was also nice. It was giving that \"European vibe\". The colognes and perfumes that you could buy there were also nice.",
          "Nice view of the city. Relax yourself with an ice cream cone or a beer. Or grab some gifts if you like.",
          "Ropeway and the view of the whole of Kobe to the sea from the top was well worth the money, but there was more! Delicious sweet scent of Snapdragons reached the height of the ropeway, even from the ground, which partially counteracted the disappointment of missing the cherry",
          "...then you must put this \"so much more than just a herb garden\" at the very top of your list when you are in kobe. as the website says: \"Kobe Nunobiki Herb Gardens are Japan\u2019s largest herb gardens with about 75,000 herbs and flowers of about 200 kinds blooming throughout the",
          "Yes a really good place to visit, well worth the 1500\u5186, nice to walk around with lots of interesting smells to smell. Walked back down to the glass house, then caught lift back down. For the energetic there is also a decent hiking trail. You can spend 2-3 hours here, good place",

          "We had a morning to spare in Kobe so we went on the ropeway up the Herb Garden. Lovely view of Kobe. It was a pleasant walk amongst the plants but to be honest nothing extraordinary. The highlight was the beautiful terrace overlooking the city and harbour. Here we enjoyed a",
          "It is definitely worth a visit. The rope way up and the views are stunning. The flowers are everywhere and it is just so beautiful and relaxing. Stroll through the Gardens and check out the large variety of herbs. Tulips in plenty all over and the restaurant and store are very",

          "This garden on the mountainside is ideal for lovers of plants and flowers. It is best in the spring or the fall, in my opinion. It has easy walking paths between a large variety of plants and flowers. There is a \"ropeway\" cable car that is available to ride up the mountain,",
          "Plants, Ropeway, easy walk and food, all here. If you want a short hike then there is a steep walk either up or down (both if keen). The hike is supposed to be about 1 & 1/2 hours and would require suitable footwear. We took the ropeway return. It takes you to the top point and",

          "Situated behind Shin-Kobe station, the Nunobiki Herb Garden and ropeway is a great place to visit for leisurely hour or two to escape the hustle of the city. The view of Kobe and its surrounds on the top station of the ropeway is one of the best, day or evening. There are many",
          "This is a great site for a view of Kobe. Having travelled in winter it was freezing cold and gardens were not in the best condition. I could imagine that it would be great in spring time. Little tip. Go to tourist information centre at train station and you get a booklet with",

          "Visited Kobe Herb Garden and it's restaurant in August. The place is magical for those who want to switch from a vibrant, busy city to a calming quiet place for a few hours. The buffet is cozy with a panoramic view window. Nice for tea time (with a wide variety of tea types",

          "This was a lovely garden to wander around. It reminded me of a mix of Longwood Gardens in Pennsylvania and Lombard St in San Francisco. It's a windy & hilly garden with all different herbs and flowers, with a great view of the whole city. We took the cable car up and then walked",

          "A wonderful serene place, if visited during a nice sunny day (which we did). I must admit that I expected some huge artistic display of various herbs in a Japanese style garden. Be warned that this is not completely accurate and that you get to see various small gardens when",

          "Herbs are herbs, not much special.(It is just my opinion) However the view from this the top of mountain is great. If you have time, try their cable car in the air for time saving. Otherwise you also can walk up and down a nature trail in this mountain.",

          "I grew up in Kobe and we used to go to the Kobe Herb Gardens as children. As an adult it's just as fun! You take the ropeway up the mountain and get to a beautiful garden (it would be fun to go in all 4 seasons; in Spring it would be full of sakura and blooming flowers and in",

          "The cable car ride to the top is definitely a must for those who loves nice garden and nice view of the city. It is worth the price for me. Try to go before the 1st stop herb garden closes. The herb garden walk is simply relaxing especially if you are up there with your loved",
          "The cable car up is a bit pricey, but worth it. Peacefull area with beautifull views over the city and harbour. It is a great & easy walk from the top station to the halfway station via the green houses, after which you can take the cable car down for the rest of the way.",
          "We decided to do this on a whim and in an attempt to avoid the tourist trail in Kyoto on a Sunday and we were not disappointed! The cable car ride was very peaceful with an amazing view and the herb garden at the top very beautiful. We walked down to the glasshouse and had lunch",
          "Kobe may lack the rich cultural heritage of nearby cities such as Kyoto and Nara, but it partly makes up for this with its extraordinary setting between the mountains and the sea. Probably the best way to appreciate this setting is to go up the cableway onto Mount Rokko and walk",
          "The ropeway is only 5 mins walk from Shin-Kobe (ask in tourist info because the route really isn't obvious but it's quick if you find it). The ropeway return ticket is well worth it because it's a fair way up to the top, nice views all of the way and a really pleasant garden on",

          "We thought the walk from Sannomiya to Shin Kobe station would be filled with shops and restaurants. So we chose to walk instead of taking the subway. But we were wrong and it was a boring 20 minute walk. We chose the \u00a51400 ropeway round trip option. But in reality one needs to",
          "It is supposed to be a herb garden but the only herbs we saw was the shop selling herbal stuffs. We saw some domestic vegetables and a small enclosed tropical garden on the way down to the mid ropeway station. Other than that there is nothing interesting for any Asian to visit",
          "Recommend for a visit even on a drizzling rainy day. Smells wonderful, beautiful views. That said, it's not the most easy to navigate, many signs are not in English and the tea cafe can be very crowded. Go during the week. Avoid the weekends.",
          "The garden offers different sights that will make you relax and appreciate mother nature more. Love the plants especially those with flowers and the cable ride allows you to have a 360-degree view. I went there during summer and is really humid, maybe better to visit during",

          "Took the tram up to the top of the mountain over Kobe. It was after 5pm so we were too late for the herb garden tour. The good news is that it was half price. Tram was very nice but the view was nice but not breathtaking. If you have time do it, not at the top of my list.",
          "We discovered the Herb Garden by accident when we approached the information desk at Shin Kobe station and had some time to pass. Our lovely desk assistant suggested it might be a nice thing to see and pointed us in the direction of the ropeway. She really undersold it - the",

          "This herb garden is more than the name of the place suggests. Great for a 4 hour or so visit depending on whether you picnic or have lunch at the cafe or restaurant. While food and drinks are a little more expensive than outside the gardens in the surrounding area of Kobe City",
          "At first I just wanted to go up the ropeway so I could walk down to the nunobiki waterfalls. But actually there are so many cool things to do and experience in the herb Garden. Take some time to smell all the different herbs and flowers, especially the lavender !!",

          "We enjoyed the beautiful views of Kobe from the rope way today. It was not crowded at all (even though today is a national holiday). The flowers and views were lovely but it was very hot even at the top of the mountain. It was tough to find a place with any shade. We were",
          "Good fun, even on a hot day like this. The herb gardens themselves aren't particularly amazing, but the whole trip is worth it. Take a one-way trip up with the ropeway (not return), but walk down. You have to do this anyway to see the herb gardens. When you reach the half-way",
          "The day we visited was extremely wet, hot and humid. Used the rope way which was great with some awesome views of the city on the way up. But because it was raining there was a heavy mist from about half way up the rope way so we had no view from the top. We walked through the",

          "The cable car ride up is amazing, views over the city and out to sea. Worth the price alone. Id buy one trip up and walk down. Wear good shoes! Even the gardens can be steep at times. There's nice shops and food up and at the greenhouse. I think there was a strings concert on",
          "The gondolas which travelled from one station to 2 stations up in the mountain, are all very new, big and can carry many passengers. The breathtaking view on the way up is well worth the trip. We saw two beautiful waterfalls, the view of the whole city of Kobe and many more",
          "This is a must go place in Kobe. Walk from Shinkobe station to the Herb garden entrance. Using your Kansai Thru Pass, there is a 10% discount of the 1260 Yen adult ticket. This ticket includes the return cable car ride fare, for about 15 mins one way. It is very nice for photos",
          "We spent the day in kobe when we visited Osaka in March. Truly enjoyed the gardens. Very manicured. My kids truly enjoyed the gondola ride and then walking down the hill the top all the way at the bottom. The views of the harbor were very neat. If u r in kobe, I highly",

          "This place is definetely A MUST to visit while you are in Kobe. It is best to take the cable car for the way up. It offers AMAZING views on a pristine canopy and city and harbor. It avoids you to arrive completely sweaty after a very demanding hike up. If you take the cable",

          "Great ride on a clear day. Very smooth cable car system. I am somewhat afraid of heights but still enjoyed the ride and short visit. The optional walk down is very steep.",
          "It's difficult for me to decide what I think about this attraction. On the one hand the cable car up the hill is fun and provides great views of Kobe. On the other, once at the top there is little to do besides look at a few gardens and enjoy a snack. And, of course, the gift",
          "The trip on the Ropeway up gives you a fantastic view of Kobe city, you will also see the Nunobiki waterfall from high up. For tourist, the suggested way will to take the ropeway up to the top station and then walk down to enjoy the beautifully landscaped gardens. You can choose",

          "One of the absolute highlights for my parents in Japan (and for us in 2019 and 5 years earlier). For people with a preference for gardening, this place is paradise. Never seen so many so beautiful roses in one spot. Absolute must see. And easy to reach using the cable car.",
          "Easily accessable, be mindful of the last cable car that's leaving. Went there before Valentine's Day so they were starting to decorate for the romantic weekend. The village gives off a very European feel and they've clear put efforts into \u2026",

But I realized ONLY the upper viewpoint is open until late while the rest of herb garden gets closed by 4:30 PM. So I couldn't get in to the main attraction area. They should precisely inform of its opening hours to visitors.",

          "Love the place! I tried soft ice cream lavender, it was good!",
          "I think not worth a visit as there\u2019s really nothing much to see .. limited herd garden to know about herb, limited flower display and probably a great view to Kobe town as you take a ropeway to the mountain. Nice area to sit and relax but nothing spectacular.. I am surprised why they build a ropeway just to see this herb garden?",
          "Wow it was so relaxing and beautiful.",
          "Although I lack interest in gardens in general, this is a good spot to visit. It has a few places to eat and some interesting shops. \n\nThe best part for me was the spectacular view over the city of Kobe. Well worth the trip up the cable car alone.",
          "Beautiful views from the top. I went during golden week and despite being a busy season it still felt peaceful and relaxing up there. The ropeway  was a lot of fun! Nice flower gardens and some nice cafes. You MUST eat the ice cream up there! It\u2019s literally the nicest ice cream I have ever had!",

          "Great place to visit. The gardens are quite nice, especially the rose garden. In addition there are a few places for food and snacks on the top where you can enjoy a great view over Kobe. I would recommend to walk down the mountain, as you \u2026",

          "If you like nature and architecture, this place is a must! Awesome experience. \n\nThis place is just like another country. The style is more like western country architecture. I am amazed to the flower field, glass house and park. Very nice \u2026",

Friendly people too. Only nega-side, almost all is in Japanese. Very limited english translation, bummer. Otherwise, very worth it.",

If you a hiking lover you can buy a one way ticket.The rest either  going up or down along the hiking path.The spectacles along the route were fantastic and worthy take a try.",
          "We made a last minute decision to visit the herb garden and we intended to spend 1hr but stayed 4 hrs - it was magnificent! \n\nIt really is worth the visit and allow plenty of time to take in the tranquil settings and enjoy it all.",

          "Nice view from the top.",
          "The ropeway was enjoyable and simple enough. The real pleasure for me was the adventure of walking back down.\n\nThe ropeway can be paid for as a single trip or two-way, but for the less able-bodied or elderly, the two-way is the only option. \u2026",

        "wiki": "Kobe ( KOH-bee, -\u2060bay; Japanese: [ko\ua71c\u02d0be]; officially \u795e\u6238\u5e02, K\u014dbe-shi) is the seventh-largest city in Japan and the capital city of Hy\u014dgo Prefecture. It is located on the southern side of the main island of Honsh\u016b, on the north shore of Osaka Bay and about 30 km (19 mi) west of Osaka. With a population around 1.5 million, the city is part of the Keihanshin metropolitan area along with Osaka and Kyoto.The earliest written records regarding the region come from the Nihon Shoki, which describes the founding of the Ikuta Shrine by Empress Jing\u016b in AD 201. For most of its history, the area was never a single political entity, even during the Tokugawa period, when the port was controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate. Kobe did not exist in its current form until its founding in 1889. Its name comes from Kanbe (\u795e\u6238, an archaic title for supporters of the city's Ikuta Shrine).  Kobe became one of Japan's designated cities in 1956.\nKobe was one of the cities to open for trade with the West following the 1853 end of the policy of seclusion and has since been known as a cosmopolitan and nuclear-free zone port city. While the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake diminished much of Kobe's prominence as a port city, it remains Japan's fourth-busiest container port.  Companies headquartered in Kobe include ASICS, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and Kobe Steel, as well as over 100 international corporations with Asian or Japanese headquarters in the city, such as Eli Lilly and Company, Procter & Gamble, Boehringer Ingelheim, and Nestl\u00e9. The city is the point of origin and namesake of Kobe beef, as well as the site of one of Japan's most famous hot spring resorts, Arima Onsen.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n Media related to History of Kobe at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n=== Origins to the Meiji era ===\nTools found in western Kobe demonstrate the area was populated at least from the J\u014dmon period. The natural geography of the area, particularly of Wada Cape in Hy\u014dgo-ku, led to the development of a port, which would remain the economic center of the city. Some of the earliest written documents mentioning the region include the Nihon Shoki, which describes the founding of the Ikuta Shrine by Empress Jing\u016b in AD 201.During the Nara and Heian periods, the port was known by the name \u014cwada Anchorage (\u014cwada-no-tomari) and was one of the ports from which imperial embassies to China were dispatched.  The city was briefly the capital of Japan in 1180, when Taira no Kiyomori moved his grandson Emperor Antoku to Fukuhara in present-day Hy\u014dgo-ku. The Emperor returned to Kyoto after about five months. Shortly thereafter in 1184, the Taira fortress in Hy\u014dgo-ku and the nearby Ikuta Shrine became the sites of the Genpei War battle of Ichi-no-Tani between the Taira and Minamoto clans. The Minamoto prevailed, pushing the Taira further.\nAs the port grew during the Kamakura period, it became an important hub for trade with China and other countries. In the 13th century, the city came to be known by the name Hy\u014dgo Port (\u5175\u5eab\u6d25, Hy\u014dgo-tsu). During this time, Hy\u014dgo Port, along with northern Osaka, composed the province of Settsu (most of today's Kobe belonged to Settsu except Nishi Ward and Tarumi Ward, which belonged to Harima).\nLater, during the Edo period, the eastern parts of present-day Kobe came under the jurisdiction of the Amagasaki Domain and the western parts under that of the Akashi Domain, while the center was controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate. It was not until the abolition of the han system in 1871 and the establishment of the current prefecture system that the area became politically distinct.\nHy\u014dgo Port was opened to foreign trade by the Shogunal government at the same time as Osaka on January 1, 1868, just before the advent of the Boshin War and the Meiji Restoration. The region has since been identified with the West and many foreign residences from the period remain in Kobe's Kitano area.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nKobe, as it is known today, was founded on April 1, 1889, and was designated on September 1, 1956 by government ordinance. The history of the city is closely tied to that of the Ikuta Shrine, and the name \"Kobe\" derives from kamube (\u795e\u6238, later kanbe), an archaic name for those who supported the shrine.During World War II, Kobe was bombed in the Doolittle Raid on April 18, 1942, along with Tokyo and a few other cities. Eventually, it was bombed again with incendiary bombs by B-29 bombers on March 17, 1945, causing the death of 8,841 residents and destroying 21% of Kobe's urban area. This incident inspired the well-known Studio Ghibli film Grave of the Fireflies and the book by Akiyuki Nosaka on which the film was based. It also features in the motion picture A Boy Called H.\nFollowing continuous pressure from citizens, on March 18, 1975, the Kobe City Council passed an ordinance banning vessels carrying nuclear weapons from Kobe Port. This effectively prevented any U.S. warships from entering the port, policy being not to disclose whether any warship is carrying nuclear weapons. This nonproliferation policy has been termed the \"Kobe formula\".On January 17, 1995, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake occurred at 5:46 am JST near the city. About 6,434 people in the city were killed, 212,443 were made homeless, and large parts of the port facilities and other parts of the city were destroyed. The earthquake destroyed portions of the Hanshin Expressway, an elevated freeway that dramatically toppled over. In Japan, the earthquake is known as the Great Hanshin earthquake (or the Hanshin-Awaji earthquake). To commemorate Kobe's recovery from the 1995 quake, the city holds an event every December called the Luminarie, where the city center is decorated with illuminated metal archways.\nThe Port of Kobe was Japan's busiest port and one of Asia's top ports until the Great Hanshin earthquake. Kobe has since dropped to fourth in Japan and 49th-busiest container port worldwide (as of 2012).\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nWedged between the coast and the mountains, the city of Kobe is long and narrow. To the east is the city of Ashiya, while the city of Akashi lies to its west. Other adjacent cities include Takarazuka and Nishinomiya to the east and Sanda and Miki to the north.\nThe landmark of the port area is the red steel Port Tower. A Ferris wheel sits in nearby Harborland, a notable tourist promenade. Two artificial islands, Port Island and Rokk\u014d Island, have been constructed to give the city room to expand.\nAway from the seaside at the heart of Kobe lie the Motomachi and Sannomiya districts, as well as Kobe's Chinatown, Nankinmachi, all well-known retail areas. A multitude of train lines cross the city from east to west. The main transport hub is Sannomiya Station, with the eponymous Kobe Station located to the west and the Shinkansen Shin-Kobe Station to the north.\nMount Rokk\u014d overlooks Kobe at an elevation of 931 meters. During the autumn season, it is famous for the rich change in colors of its forests.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\nKobe has nine wards (ku):\n\nNishi-ku: The westernmost area of Kobe, Nishi-ku overlooks the city of Akashi and is the site of Kobe Gakuin University. This ward has the largest population, with 247,000 residents.\nKita-ku: Kita-ku is the largest ward by area and contains the Rokko Mountain Range, including Mount Rokk\u014d and Mount Maya. The area is well known for its rugged landscape and hiking trails. The onsen resort town of Arima also lies within Kita-ku.\nTarumi-ku: Tarumi-ku is a mostly residential area. The longest suspension bridge in the world, the Akashi Kaiky\u014d Bridge, extends from Maiko in Tarumi-ku to Awaji Island to the south. A relatively new addition to Kobe, Tarumi-ku was not a part of the city until 1946.\nSuma-ku: Suma-ku is the site of Suma beach, attracting visitors during the summer months.\nNagata-ku: Nagata-ku is the site of Nagata Shrine, one of the three \"Great Shrines\" in Kobe.\nHy\u014dgo-ku: At various times known as \u014cwada Anchorage or Hy\u014dgo Port, this area is the historical heart of the city. Shinkaichi in Hyogo-ku was once the commercial center of Kobe, but was heavily damaged during World War II, and since, Hyogo-ku has lost much of its former prominence.\nCh\u016b\u014d-ku: Ch\u016b\u014d (\u4e2d\u592e) literally means \"center\" and, as such, Ch\u016b\u014d-ku is the commercial and entertainment center of Kobe. Sannomiya, Motomachi and Harborland make up the main entertainment areas in Kobe. Ch\u016b\u014d-ku includes the city hall and Hy\u014dgo prefectural government offices. Port Island and Kobe Airport lie in the southern part of this ward.\nNada-ku: The site of Oji Zoo and Kobe University, Nada is known for its sake. Along with Fushimi in Kyoto, it accounts for 45% of Japan's sake production.\nHigashinada-ku: The easternmost area of Kobe, Higashinada-ku borders the city of Ashiya. The man-made island of Rokko makes up the southern part of this ward.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Climate ==\nKobe has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa) with hot summers and cool to cold winters.

Considered as Kobe's Chinatown, the area has over a hundred Chinese restaurants, shops, and a Chinese temple dedicated to Guan Yu (\u95a2\u5e1d\u5edf, Kanteiby\u014d).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNankin-machi originated in 1868, when Kobe's port was opened to foreigners including Chinese immigrants from Guangdong and Fujian. The newcomers settled in the western end of Kobe's foreign district, which soon became the focal point for subsequent Chinese migrants. During that time, the Chinese people were referred to as \"people from Nanking\" by the Japanese, hence the name \"Nankinmachi\" (Nanking Town). By the early 1920s, Nankinmachi was a vibrant area bustling with businesses, restaurants, and homes. That all changed, however, during the next two decades when many Chinese returned to China in response to Japan's expansion of Northeastern China, the Second Sino-Japanese War, and World War II. Destroyed during the allied bombings of Kobe, Nankinmachi was re-built after the war by the remaining Chinese community that stayed behind. In 1995, it was severely damaged during the Great Hanshin earthquake. It was quickly rebuilt, and once again thrives as a center of Chinese culture and activity throughout the Kansai region. There are currently 10,000 people residing in Nankin-machi.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nNankinmachi is considered a tourist attraction for the important role it plays in Kobe's cultural landscape was demonstrated in 1985 by the erection of an archway, Chang'an Gate (\u9577\u5b89\u9580). Subsequent projects include the addition of a pair of lions, granite floors, and other initiatives. Three archways demarcate Nankinmachi proper: Chang'an Gate in the east, Xi'an Gate (\u897f\u5b89\u9580) to the west, and Nanlou Gate (\u5357\u6a13\u9580) from the south. There is no archway at the northern entrance, which is guarded by a pair of lions. A pavilion with stone carvings of the 12 Chinese zodiac signs marks the intersecting point of the north\u2013south/east\u2013west axis of Nankinmachi. This is a popular resting place for visitors, as well as a favorite spot for taking photographs.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n \nMany establishments such as mahjong clubs and souvenir shops abound throughout Nankinmachi, but none are as prevalent as food businesses. Along the streets of Nankinmachi are restaurants and stalls that serve both Chinese Japanese food, Western steak houses as well.\nMost shops show off their cuisine on display stands for potential customers. Some examples include dim sum, dumplings, buns, and Chinese pastries. During the Lunar New Year and the Mid Autumn season, two major festivals celebrated by Chinese people worldwide, New Year's delicacies and Moon Cakes appear.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nMotomachi train station is 3 min from Sannomiya Station, 25 min from Osaka Station on the JR Kobe Line, and 30 min from Umeda Station on the Hanshin Main Line.\nOn the Hanshin Expressway: 3 Kobe Route, Kyobashi Exit and on the 5 Wangan Route, Rokko Island Exit\n\n\n== See also ==\nChinatowns in Asia\nYokohama Chinatown\nNagasaki Shinchi Chinatown\nChinese in Japan\nChina\nMotomachi (Hyogo)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNankin Machi Official Website (in Japanese)\nKobe Overseas Chinese History Museum (in Japanese)\n Geographic data related to Nankin-machi at OpenStreetMap",

          "Second best Chinatown in Japan, right behind Yokohama for many. It\u2019s not a super big area which is nice, and you can walk around pretty easily!",
          "Very near to our hotel, this part of kobe town was quaint with excellent Chinese New year performances throughout the day and evening. The variety of food there was also great and the people spoke excellent mandarin which made it easy for overseas Chinese to communicate. Overall",
          "Worth visiting when you are in Kobe area or the shopping street or the Port. So many food choices. Worth your time..",
          "Kobe\u2019s Chinatown is among the major Chinatowns in Japan, and definitely an interesting sight to have Chinese shops and architecture in the middle of Japan. It definitely creates a very beautiful hybrid. Here you can also see roadside stalls which is very uncommon in Japan",
          "Short but interesting Chinatown. As usual in Chinatown\u2018s, plenty of Chinese restaurants. However all the way also booths in front of the restaurants offering finger food. If you have time down there certainly worth for a stroll",
          "If I am not mistaken, there are 3 Chinatowns in Japan, one in Yokohama, one in Nagasaki and the other is this one and among the 3, in my view, this is the smallest, in terms of size. After visiting Harborland, we came by to Motomachi for a visit. It was a rainy day and closed",
          "Tons of eatery littered along the whole stretch of street. Popular ones are the beef shops, dozens of these shops as you walk down the street.",
          "Great place to visit in the heart of downtown. Has its own little vibe here and transportation abounds.",
          "We wondered into this area looking for coffee and after 5 minutes we vacated the area. The mainlanders turned this quiet place into a 'fish market'.",
          "A convenient stop where the complimentary shuttles drop off and pick up point was from the cruise terminal. One of the cleaner Chinatown with colorful buildings and shops. We did not buy or eat there but enjoyed the festive atmosphere with many visitors from all over the world.",
          "Located in downtown Kobe, very vibrant lunch time experience. Tons of food fresh prepared and lively. Some shopping too. Smiling locals.",
          "Come here if you want some chinese food, the vendors here stand infront and promote their restaurant, they have many dish to select for, good for street food and dine in, find long queue and you know its good food there",
          "Went there to experience the Chinatown street. A lot of street food and restaurants. The grocery shop have a good spread of Chinese ingredients you can get from there . Even the Taiwan ingredients, you can get. Bubble tea are also mushrooming around this area . Take the",
          "Not my best experience with 'china town' settings, by far. All places copy each other in terms of food. We had a duck roll and were not impressed and decided to go elsewhere for actual lunch.",
          "A good place to visit. Lots of glittering light and lots of people in a good mood. It is also in a good position and acceptable from the metro.",
          "They call it Chinatown. What they sell on display are almost the same everywhere. Pork bun, duck, dumplings, etc. Prices are quite expensive given the portion size and choices. Spent about 1000yen ++ and to be honest, nothing special. Buildings are quite bright and colorful",
          "Nice place to walk around. Even the tourist-trap-type restaurants with people outside beckoning you in are charming.",
          "Nothing much, some chinese noodles and dishes, lotsa shops selling dumplings. LOL. Feels like the only chinese thing is dumplings and nothing else. Stroll for 10mins and left.",
          "One of the great historic places as a result Japan opening up to the world. Kobe chinatown is not huge but it packs a lot in. During the day, the street is lined with so many different food stalls to choose from. There is are pork belly bao, peeking duck wraps and so many other",
          "Didn\u2019t get to try a lot of the most recommended restaurants/street vendors because they close at 6:30pm on a Sunday... those left open were average but very cheap at least.",
          "But it has shops, so wife had to explore:(, lots of activity though, cafes, bars, restaurants and food is great in all of them",
          "We wandered through mid afternoon thinking we may eat there that evening, decided to try elsewhere. Lots of stalls all seeking basically the same snacks. All a bit samey and disappointing really. The Shanghai dumplings stall off the central square was busy with a fair queue but",
          "It was more a long alleyway with a few street vendors, rather than a true Chinatown that bustles with Chinese restaurants. Maybe still worth a visit on your way to the Kobe Port as it won\u2019t take you long to walk around it.",
          "Nice little area to visit with excellent street foods, and other souvenir type shopping. There are multiple food vendors available. I highly suggest the shaved ice fruit. It was so delicious and refreshing on a hot day!",
          "I walked here from my hotel one afternoon and noticed that many of the vendors had cooked and raw meet offerings outside and uncovered. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to buy any but certainly it\u2019s a place to spend an hour or so wandering. We tried to find a restaurant with a menu",
          "This Chinatown must be one of the least interesting ones across the world. Absolutely nothing to see except displays of plastic-looking dishes set next to empty Tsingtao beer bottles. Even the Disney Corp. and its goons could come up with a more genuine \"Chinese\" atmosphere.",
          "This Chinatown in Kobe is unashamedly touristy but it's fun to walk through. At night it's especially nice with all the lanterns lit and the neon flashing everywhere. Only the Japanese really know how to use neon! Loads and loads of eateries and souvenir stalls. If you like",
          "Kobe Chinatown or Nankin-Machi is one of the three Chinatown areas in Japan besides Nagasaki and Yokohama as Japan's largest chinatown.The location is in front of Daimaru Departmen Store and not far from Kobe Port Tower,just a three block walk to get to the port of Kobe. So",
          "One of the most beautiful China town you could find, very clean, well decorated and foods is everywhere you look, either a snack or sit down proper meal. If you are visiting Kobe for their Kobe beef, highly recommend you swing by as well.",
          "Located near the Sannomiya Station area, this small Chinatown consists of a few main streets and is also very close to a shopping street/arcade. You will find many Chinese street food stalls, boba teas/drinks & even Kobe Beef restaurants (signs advertised very cheap prices, so",
          "Nice place to visit. Enjoy one of the famous pan fried dumpling there. But. Make sure if you want to try the \u548c\ud83d\udc02\u725b better look for one can trust . My suggest not to go this shop waste money. Warning. Don\u2019t go to this lousy Kobe beef restaurant even he keep saying sorry sorry",
          "Good thing is you can get here by the Kobe loop bus. But there is nothing much to see here, just a long row of eateries and stalls selling similar food.",
          "One of the stops on the City Loop Bus. Personally disappointing. Just one lane with some side tracks of Chinese restaurants and outside street food sellers. Prices questionable and aimed more at tourist wallets than locals. If you need a Chinese fix, go to China, it's as",
          "If you need a bit of Chinese street food in Kobe, this is the place. Mostly food stalls but some stores as well.",
          "Loaded with Chinese shops and restaurants, with some of the latter also offering Japan\u2019s famous Kobe beef. Also typical of a Chinatown, there are lots of street food, and of a high quality. This is one of the world\u2019s more exciting Chinatowns.",
          "This is another popular tourist attraction in Kobe. Even better if you are hungry as there are many restaurants selling all sorts of Chinese food.",
          "A large area with sit down restaurants and food stalls. Lots to choose from. China theme stores. Fun area to visit.",
          "Its sort of the commercial hub of this laid back town. So one can start at one end and keep on walking while browsing through the titbits to buy. And there are some decent restaurants too. The square has a nice charm in the evening!",
          "Lots of restaurants, good food and some what cheap (compare to other similar places in Kobe). There are several souvenir stores that sells some Chinese/Japanese items. The center square has little statures of the 12 Chinese Zodiacs, good place to take some cute pictures. Nice",
          "One of cleanest China town experience. They all seem to sell same kinds of Chinese foods on each food stall. All good. Must visit",
          "Nice place to spent a couple of hours enjoying the street food. But avoid the \u201cKobe beef\u201d in the middle of the junction. It\u2019s rip-off (photo).",
          "Everything you need and a lot you don't need can be found here. You could spend days just roaming around the market.",
          "So many delicious food to eat and it is a great place to just walk around while snacking. So many cute and unique shops too",
          "Although it is small China town area, It is really clean and Nice place. It is good for Chinese delicious food where we can enjoy different type of Chinese food.",
          "We wandered through looking for a meal, had dinner wanted to retuyfor a snack after but by 8pm most places were closing or already closed.",
          "Chinatown goes down one main street. Very vibrate and colourful. Lots wonderful street food and characters.",
          "Called one of the three biggest China Town in Japan, but smaller than that of Yokohama only with one main street along. The street has many shops, mainly restaurants or stalls.Access is OK, as Motomachi Station of JR and Hanshin can be available. Sannomiya Station is also",
          "We mostly just walked around and tooled at everything. Chinese food in Japan is very good! It was crowded even in February.",
          "This was ok to pass some time and I might have liked it better if I had not already spent 10 days in China. Had some great Kobe beef, but overall I found this place a bit overrated. Might be good if in Japan and not getting a chance to go to China... We did as a way of",
          "One of the few Chinatowns in Japan. Reasonable variety of shops and lot of food stalls, Chinese food with a slight Japanese bent (Peking duck at a food stall?). Worth a quick visit.",
          "Plenty of people just busy busy, few minutes from sogo and JR Kobe station. If shopping and eating is your thing then it\u2019s worthwhile going.",
          "Check out this Chinatown at Kobe, the streets are narrow yet busy... Come hungry and work your way through the food stalls, variety of tasty and affordable Chinese cuisine that will make you drool!",
          "If you have been to China Towns in New York or elswhere forget about this one! \u2013 First of all it is very small - just a fews streets. Second it looks more like a China Town Theme Park, nothing authentic! Just a lot of Japanes Teenagers that enjoy somehting like Chinese-Japanes",
          "Having visited many Chinatowns around the world, this one is less impressive than most of the others. When compared to the one in Yokohama the Kobe Chinatown is really tiny and basically consists of one long street with a square in the middle. Mostly there are restaurants with",
          "If you happen to be in Kobe, it's a good stopover just to get some interesting eats. Don't expect much cause it's a really small area, so don't purposely make a trip there unless you already are in Kobe and are looking for something decent to do while in Kobe.",
          "I visit China town in Kobe every time I am in Kobe. It is a busy and exciting place, a kind of mini-China. A lot of food stands are selling snacks for eating while walking around. It is maybe not the most delicious food, but it is a fun place to visit.",
          "A small area with Chines souvenirs och food. Decorated with Chinese lamps, went there during daylight , returned in evening but that was a disapointment, the decorating lamps where not lightning the place up.",
          "I was in Kobe on the evening of mid-November. I wanted to have dinner at Kobe's Chinatown, so I went there. I thought it was bigger but it's quite small. I saw pictures of it full of people, but when I was there, I saw almost no one, and it was 7-8pm. It was a bit deserted, I",
          "Lots of restaurants, and quaint and interesting alleys and shops as well. Lots of fusions Chinese, Japanese and some European",
          "Compared to the one in Yokohama, this is a small Chinatown: looked like few streets. When you alight at the JR Motomachi station and walk towards Meriken park you will cross China Town with lots of eateries. You will find tourists hanging around. There are gates at roads leading",
          "Quite a small Chinatown but good enough with many Chinese restaurants. Surprise to see many Japanese came to this place for Chinese food.",
          "It's pretty much one street with restaurants and stalls lined on both sides of the street selling the same fare (dumplings, Peking duck, pork buns etc). Hardly anyone around even at dinner time on a Thursday when I visited.",
          "You'll find mainly food, not so many gifts or other items, anyway is a nice place to go and is between other Japanese restaurants and the harbor.",
          "This looked to be a popular market just off the main shopping area, and worth a walk through to look at all the different varieties of foods on offer. Obviously Kobe beef is very popular here, and surprised to see this steak selling at realistic prices in many venues having seen",
          "As with any other Chinatowns elsewhere, the Kobe Chinatown is characterized by narrow alleys, imposing Chinatown gates, vibrant businesses, exotic food selection and overcrowdedness. A good place for a reasonable eat and decent stroll through from the Motomachi Station to the",
          "This isn\u2019t the best china town I have seen and while it\u2019s very clean it is mostly low cost street food with some ordinary restaurants. It\u2019s aimed at tourists and apart from the colourful photos and displays the one meal I had there was very ordinary. Nice for a walk through and",
          "Its easy to get to and there are a lot of shops for options. For me however, I found the experience a waste of time. I was excited to try the Butaman, the dan dan from Yun Yun and dumplings from Ro Sho Ki as I read in blogs. Unfortunately, I found nothing extraordinary here.",
          "Chinatown was cool -great for street food nibbles. (Make sure you have cash; Japan is a huge cash society and many places don't take cards.) If you have some time, stroll through this part of town and take it all in.",
          "We enjoyed strolling down the main street of Chinatown, looking at all the colorful souvenirs and the great variety of Japanese food displayed. We found a stand offering Kobe beef grilled right there while you watched. For about $15 US we got a small plate of grilled strips",
          "Nice area to spend a couple hours, there are a lot of places to eat, and buy Chinese items. We went just one evening",
          "Quite a small Chinatown compared to the others like in Yokohama but still having enough stalls for one to accept and appreciate that they are in Chinatown. While in Kansai, I do recommend a visit to here",
          "The hype about Chinatown makes me wonder why so. 3 interesting facts that I discovered on Kobe\u2019s Chinatown: (i) It is so small that I can walk from one end to the other end less than 5 mins, (ii) There are numerous food vendors selling identical items, (iii) It is one place in",
          "This is quite a compact area easily reached from a stop on the city sightseeing bus and close to a big shopping mall. There were plenty of street food vendors and typical Chinatown outlets. Not crowded when we visited on a rainy day..",
          "Interesting place, crowded on a week day, lots of people, saw a few food stalls, selling cheap kobe beef, didn't try them, as we weren't sure of the quality. Had a nice, roasted ice cream, not sure how they cook it. Not many variety of item to shop. Will recommend",
          "China town is a nice and vibrant area, lots of character. Plenty of street food some of it mediocre but if you luck in some of it superb. If there is a lineup of locals then try it.",
          "One of the smallest Chinatown I have seen, if you do not stop for street food or dine at one of the numerous restaurants that dotted along the street and the adjacent alleys, you can finish the visit in 10 minutes. It gets very quite after 7:00 PM with only a handful of",
          "Kobe Chinatown or Nankin Machi is fairly small but there are a wide range of shops crammed into the area. It is divided into different Chinese areas such as \"Shanghai\" or Hong Kong\" It appears to be pretty crowded most of the time..Nankin Machi is fairly easy to navigate with",
          "located next to Motomachi shopping street (3-5 mins walk). You can see a lot of street food right outside restaurants. A lot of street food such as Xiao Long Pau, fried chicken, etc (mostly similar for all). Well, you too can eat at restaurants which I saw some queue for",
          "We stopped off here for something to eat as it was a stop on the city loop bus. It\u2019s a small typical china town area with a lot of places to eat. You can easily leave this out and spend more time at the herb gardens or the marina area.",
          "Nankinmachi makes for an interesting experience when visiting Japan. Visit during Chinese New Year and you get a lion dance as part of the experience. Extremely popular with the locals on a weekend, people come for the food, it is mostly food stalls. Add it to your Kobe visit",
          "A bit disappointed with what was on offer. 90% food stalls so there was no reason to stay within the area once you found something to eat.",
          "We returned to Kobe\u2019s port from a tour late and took the port shuttle to Chinatown at7pm most of the shops were closed except the restaurants we enjoyed a good meal",
          "We came here by chance so decided to walk through from one Chinese gate to the other. It had a buzzy feel to it with food stalls and interesting snacks to try. It was bbuzzing with people local and tourist and we really enjoyed people watching. I had a Turkish ice cream from a",
          "Chinatown is a little too touristy. Not sure if food is any good. Fun to walk around just to get a feel of it. I hear it gets lively and busy during Chinese New Year.",
          "We were looking forward to visiting. Every stall sold the same food and the buns were tasteless and the duck wrap were horrible and cold. Someone needs to help these people on the food quality.",
          "Interesting to visit but nothing much to buy . Chinese restaurants selling dumpling , duck and pork but nothing outstanding Very small as it only spread over few alley way",
          "This is the first Chinatown I've been to in Japan and I was surprised with all the traditional chinese products and food they were selling. There are lots of restaurants, food stalls and places that sell traditional chinese crockery too.",
          "Soo crowded on Chinese New Year-which I expect. Love the food, get to see the \"barongsai\"-lion dance and artist singing. The place is non smoking all over Kobe but there are some restaurants that allow smoking. Worth the trip for CNY.",
          "It's quite clean and nice. But to me, it's just like other China Towns in Japan. However, if you have free time, it's good to have a look & walk around.",
          "Disappointed to go and walked around Chinatown in Kobe. Seeing much bigger ones in Yokohama, Japan or other parts of world. If you have not been any China town before, you may get some idea but not really impressed one in Kobe.",
          "Having lived in San Francisco....and really missing good Chinese food.....I was really disappointed with my food experience here. I went to one restaurant that was recommended by my hotel It was attractive.....the staff was attentive.....but the food left a lot to be desired. It",
          "China men everywhere and china women everywhere. Ideal place if you have not experienced chinese markets before. Food, suvenirs, whatever chinese make etc etc",
          "We enjoyed our walks in Chinatown. We met a lot of japanese tourists. The storeowners we noth extremely helpful and nice. We had some great food, and did a lot of shopping there.",
          "As with other reviews, it is not overly large and some places are overpriced. However, try the bakery on the south side of the main street. Absolutely superb cakes.",
          "It's the famous Chinatown street in Kobe. There are many shops and restaurant selling Chinese food. It doesn't worth the long queue as you can find many nice Chinese restaurants in kobe. The visit was not that enjoyable as we couldn't really walk as it was very crowded on",
          "It didnt seem any different from the usual cookie cutter Chinatowns. Lotsa of food joints but we found the food too oily and there was also \"mystery meat\" that looked way too dark (old?)in one or two places. We opted to eat elsewhere. Food was so so.",
          "Are you Chinese? If so, this is no great place for Chinese who would have been to better and larger Chinatown in your home country. It is a very small area and if you are not stopping to eat, you can stroll pass in less than 20 minutes.",
          "Don\u2019t expect the Chinatown in Kobe to impress. It\u2019s a single street that goes for about 2 blocks or so, and is tailored to the Japanese palate. We enjoyed the street food, but it cannot compare to Taiwan or Hong Kong, naturally. If you don\u2019t have high expectations, it\u2019s a fun",
          "This is the right place if you feel like Chinese food. Price is very accessible, but all the shops food looks the same. Experience was ok if you miss Chinese food, because this is not authentic.",
          "Small part of Kobe, but with really nice food. Lots of stalls outside, but also many small restaurants, busy and a good ambience. Culture wise nothing, but a very welcoming change from the Japanese cuisine.",
          "Just one street but very colorful and with lots of options for snacks and eat. We walk also through the tiny streets that flows from the main where you also can find nice restaurants. Try some of the street food like the bao bread or the skewers",
          "Chinese street food of Japanese quality. It\u2019s the Perfect food for a cold winters day. Can\u2019t go wrong here!",
          "This area is basically selling many chinese food and snacks with some japanese twists. You can either queue and eat at one of the eateries of you can buy the one at the roadside and eat it. Make sure you bring a trash bag with you because very few rubbish bins. The food are just",
          "A lot of stalls selling Jap and Chinese food. Many youngsters and tourists. Be prepared to eat here else not much things to do. A few small boutiques selling winter clothing. There is a Daimaru mall opposite it.",
          "A small Chinatown area that is really only one main street and a small square. There are doze4ns of food stalls that are continually trying to get you to buy - I soon learned the Japanese for 'no thank you' which went down well with the locals. A fun place but not somewhere i'd",
          "I was in Kobe for a day sightseeing with my wife. We took the Nanshin train from Namba to Osaka. The Chinatown is not far from the Sannomiya station but we only came to the Chinatown after exploring the northern area so by the time we reached Nankinmachi it was already late",
          "Went at around 6pm on a weekday and it was really small and quiet. There seems to be a queue for a popular meat bun. There are many restaurants but it was quite disappointing.",
          "It was the October 10, and Nankinmachi was very crowded. There were Chinese Lion Dances, many restaurants sold street-side food, and all the shops were busy which added to the festivities. You can find relatively inexpensive kobe beef at the many restaurants here along with",
          "A small area in Kobe about 10 minutes away from Sannomiya station. It\u2019s not the best Chinatown but it\u2019ll satisfy your hunger for Chinese food especially if you want a break from Japanese food. Stalls upon stalls of siopao, dumplings, duck, and yes, kobe beef. Tip: find a",
          "Great walk, but if you want to try some of the restaurants, come early, Long Qs expected. Come evening as well, 2x as good",
          "A small but a clean and quiet China town. The food is OK but all the restaurants looked more or less the same. The food offerings and the prices was almost the at every restaurant.",
          "If you've ever been to a Chinatown, any Chinatown, then you can skip this one. Lots of eateries, not much else.",
          "Not really special Chinatown. It is purely touristic and nothing authentic. Lots of restaurants of course, but they also are not really special, but just rather expensive, Still, nice to walk through, but that is it.",
          "We visited on sunday. The place was too much crowded even to walk. All the restaurants were full and every restaurants' staffs were pulling to their shop...Foods aere not so impressive...",

          "Kobe's Chinatown is a compact area of a few blocks. Those few blocks are crazy busy. There are shops selling all kinds of cheap items, restaurants and street food to suit all tastes - as long as your taste is for Chinese. Noisy, colourful, crowded.",

          "I have been here for three or four times with my friends. Actually it was my first Chinese town I have been to, so I don't really have any thing to compare. The street was quite nice at night with red lanterns, but there was not many things to see. The street food is all the",
          "Lots of interesting shops, restaurants and sculptures. I enjoyed the one that showed the animals of the Chinese zodiac. Some street stalls served Kobe beef. It was quite good and I heard this option is not bad and much less than the price you would pay for at a restaurant.",
          "We went in the day time but was still buzzing duribg the day. There are so many tourists there and so many food stalls. You must try the Kobe Beef it is delicious. I loved it. There are other chinese stalls with so many different foods there you can try all if you want. It is",

          "There were many food carts and shops selling Chinese food. Prices for food were not cheap, as like other food options in Japan. I read in other reviews that the kobe beef sold in this area is relatively cheap due to different cuts and grades of the beef. Indeed, we did come",

          "This place is packed all the time with tourists and locals. We found though if you reach the end the prices tend to be more expensive so if you want to eat something stick to the middle where the food was often cheaper. there are good bargains to be had but you have to cruise or",

          "It is a bit strange to visit a chinatown in Japan but it is located in the central of Kobe, so we decided to try our chance and we were quite glad in the end. The prices are a bith high than average and it is always crowded, however there are many differents tastes that you can",
          "Not very impressed with the china town itself but the area is quite accessible with other shopping malls and restaurants. This is quite a typical type of china town in Japan. Most stuff are pricey too and always crowded with tourist.",
          "Visited this place multiple times. They do have tasty Chinese food, but all popular spots are way too crowded to enjoy. As always, it's very safe and no problems even at night. The best way to go is to look around, read few reviews and target less crowded places. Awesome",
          "Great experience to see how is an Asian Chinatown. It is probably the most typical I have visited. Lots of amazing little shops, statues and crowded like you expect a true Chinatown to be. Worth the visit!",
          "The are itself is two main streets intersecting each other, in the centre is a large open plaza with a small pagoda. The place is really busy, lots of people around, and there's a great atmosphere with all the streets lined with various food vendors. Most of the shops, seemed",
          "Although a much smaller Chinatown than the one in Yokohama this one is not as expensive and I fancy it contains more stuff you can find in the latter. Good place for some chinese food if you want an alternative to the Japanese fare but then again it is pretty adapted for local",
          "Eating on the street isn't really au fait in Japan, but this is one place that is. I had a piece of the widely feted Kobe beef, which really did melt in the mouth, and a Chinese duck roll which was very nice, but don't eat the paper it's wrapped in like I did. A nice",
          "Just visit as it is very busy with many people and many shops. Great place to soak in the culture and people watch! Reasonable Kobe beef restaurant in the area.",

          "Chinatown in Kobe is a good place for people Om a limited budget in Kobe to eat inexpensively ,the majority of the street food in Kobe can be found around sannomiya station but this Chinatown is very clean as is the majority of thing in japan",
          "Amazing to see a Chinatown in Japan! The street is lined up with stalls and restaurants that serve some decent Chinese snacks and even cuisines.",
          "Small short area and didn't look interesting at all. Prices also don't look cheap. Frankly I think we finished walking the street in 15 minutes.",
          "Great place to get some \"roadside\" food to try and taste , especially for tourist. Kobe beef steak is sold there. nice though expensive But do not try the kobe beef burger, disgusting and bad taste.",
          "Kobe Chinatown is comparably small. This is an old part of town. Walking through the main area .... there are lots food stalls on both sides of the way. Traditional Chinese lanterns beautifully lighted up this place. There were a number of small and medium sized restaurants",
          "Take the JR train from Sanomiya Station to Motomachi Station and head south; Nankinmachi is about 250 meters away. The collection of eating outlets serving Chinese and Japanese cuisines, the various others selling small bites that you can take with you as you walk along",

          "Really characteristic and interesting neighbor in Kobe. One of the only three Chinatown in Japan, and the smallest compared to the one in Yokohama and Nagasaki, but really enjoyable to visit. Recommended.",

          "Can't recommend any restaurant or street vendor-but this street/area has plenty of street stalls and restaurants with steamed dumplings,Peking duck wraps and all sorts of other unidentifiable foods ( for a westerner). If you see something that catches your eye-go for it..",
          "It was very crowded on January 2nd. It is more or less like a food street. There are several shops offer a wide varieties of food. It is another attractive place for tourists. We enjoyed walking around, even with a very cold weather .",
          "I expected well orientated Chinese town, but I feel like I am in Japan anyway. I ate Japanese food in Chinese town :D",
          "A great area to visit and have fun. Many, many street vendors so lots of people eating on the street. Peking Duck very popular with everyone eating small packets of this delight whilst walking and taking in the street. Very nice Jazz Bar around the corner too. More of this later!",
          "This place was very nice. It was a good size, you could walk everywhere in about 30 minutes. It is probably the size of one city block, and the pedestrian walkway takes the shape of a \"t\" and one of the exits/entrances leads to a shopping street. I was there during the night and",
          "the streets are very crowded and full with people. there're always having some kind of show, at least every time I go. the food are not Chinese, much more like faked-Japanese-flavored Chinese, through those were not expensive.",

Lots of tourists stop by for a quick snack or fast meal before moving out to the next attraction. Being the Chinatown in Kobe, most of the stores here sell Chinese style snack/foods",
          "This one is a neat little area covering a few blocks with the usual shops, restaurants and food stalls. Some of the street food is quite good. Didn't get to try the restaurants this trip. The slightly annoying part of the experience is the continual come-ons to go into a",
          "It's a short walk, with a lot of shopkeepers touting their wares, Chinese delicacies and a bit of fusion foods. The interior of the shops reminds one of the generic contemporary Chinese taverns one can see in places like China or Taiwan, which are infused with some sense of",
          "It is a right place to find chinese cuisine in Kobe. This is the only chinatown in Japan beside in Yokohama. So, its a must visit place when you are in Kobe",
          "Must drop by to eat the kobe beef! and have a pint of beer! There are lots of street food, Ramen , Dumplings , Kobe beef , fried food and many more. However , not much place for you to sit to enjoy the food. There is also few Chinese restaurant in here .",

          "Nothing special except for lots of Chinese restaurants. Additionally, you can do some shopping too. Restaurants are of a wide variety and lots of food to choose from. However, this is a popular area among lots of people and a good experience to visit at least ones.",
          "Lot of Chinese street food. It's like any other China Town. The food varied and some places was really good. Try Kobe beef burger and steak a must!!",
          "Kobe Chinatown was next to the hotel where we were staying one of the best places to visit see learn and eat great types of Chinese and Japanese cuisine, visit during the day or night great place to do small type shopping etc",
          "Was a bit disappointed visiting the place. The food stalls were repetitive and certainly did not look appealing. Didn't really eat much during my visit there, headed back to Osaka for food instead. But again a visit to Kobe without visit Chinatown is bit funny.",
          "China town is a buzzing area in Kobe. Yet full of food stores and tiny restaurants. I didn't like it as much as the china towns in other cities or countries but it is worth visiting. I was not expecting so many food parlours. The smell can be overwhelming.",
          "If you like getting lost in crowds and looking at products that you usually throw out after a year - this is the place for you. Colourful, loud, and very busy. Visit in the morning to avoid being overwhelmed. Endless shops and amusing displays of \"one man's junk\".",
          "We went in the evening, so the lanterns were on and the whole area looked very festive. Many of the vendors were closing up at around 7pm. Plus lets of hawkers for restaurants etc. which we did not like.",
          "Small, not authentic, and the worst food you'll find in japan. This area basically consists of some overpriced 'chinese' restaurants, and souvenir shops. Not worth visiting.",
          "Kobe Chinatown is a street that is small, touristy but is quaint and delightful, however it is an area that restauranteur's beckon every visitor to come into their establishment. Painful at times but it's not threatening. Not worth the overall hassle though as there's not much",
          "On a quiet Sunday afternoon, this area was crowded with students, local Japanese and tourists. The area spans a four way intersection. Local street vendors hawking their wares, mostly food. I was drawn to a long line of people waiting to eat or order steamed Chinese dumplings",
          "I did not believe all the negative reviews I had read abiut china town in Kobe and had to see for myself. Since I lived close by I just had to take a look. It is located one street down from Motomachi station and can be entered through Motomachi shopping street. It is just like",
          "This is a tad overhyped as it is nothing more than a street selling Chinese food in Kobe. It is also very small and does not give me the kind of feeling that I was in Chinatown.",
          "Looks like a Hollywood version of China. Shanghai is only two hours away, if you want a taste, take a plane. Here everything is a bit too new, too clean, too sanitized, too \"Japanese\" to look like China for real. But if you want to take picture like in an Hollywood made up",
          "Arrived in Kobe and went down at sunnomiya station. Great covered walk which we took to go to Chinatown which was a bit disappointing as being small area with restaurants with limited choices. I think you can have more fun around the station",

          "A neat area tucked away in Kobe. A few stores to shop for trinkets and different types of Chinese and Kobe beef restaurants. The owl Cafe \"BiBi & GeorGe\" in this area was a fun and unique experience.",
          "Not the biggest China town we've visited. Full of restaurants selling there stuff on stalls outside in the street all selling much the same kind of food. Not too many souvenir shops. Didn't spend too much time here.",

          "We have visited this China Town early in the morning on 30 May and found that most of the shops there were not yet opened for business. Anyway, most of the shops there were eating houses selling Chinese food and Kobe Beef. The place was clean and decorations in typical Chinese",
          "China town in Kobe is quite small. But you still get some unique food or snack, or experience you don't usually get in Japan.",
          "A change from the Japanese scene. Lots of hawkers food sold on roadside. We bought a few tempting snacks on the way but were disappointed as we are Malaysian chinese we found the taste very different. Anyway its a good tourist spot. The Loop bus will take you there.",
          "Great atmosphere and colours but far too busy. Absolutely full of school-children. Prices were expensive so bargains were few. The architecture and details were worth the visit.",
          "It is unlikely you will miss this place, as you will be greeted with a large Chinese gate at the entrance. Like any typical Chinatown in a modern city, there are the familiar Chinese architecture, temple, buildings along the street. Chinatown is all about food, food and food.",
          "This area is full of delicious Chinese food like various kinds of dumplings, grilled Beijing duck, steamed yeast buns with minced pork filling, and Chinese sweets. I liked fried sesami dango with bean paste. You can enjoy getting them from the stalls and eating them on the",

          "For the harborland, walk quite a bit to this little chinatown of Kobe. As it suggested, you can see the place sells all kind of China's stuff such us Panda doll, foods and any other oriental things. There is a small place like those you can found in Chinese imperial park, a",
          "It is about maybe less than 10 mins walk from the Motomachi station. When we arrived at 6pm, the place very crowded. If you want delicious food, follow the mass of people and they are definitely willing to queue for good food.",
          "On the Saturday of Golden week, we made the poor decision to visit Kobe's Chinatown. The streets around Chinatown were quite quiet but when we got to the centre, there were so many people all lining up for street food or entrance to a restaurant that we did not know where the",

          "Lots of vendors hawking their goods. But it felt like my old Chinatown in Hawaii. I liked the stone statues of the zodiac though. It was a fast visit.",
          "We had arrived earlier in the day but thought we would visit Chinatown at night as we imagined the atmosphere would be nice. It was only around 7:30pm but almost everything was closed and there were no people around at all. Disappointed as we had been recommended to visit here",
          "Kobe's Chinatown main attraction is definitely street food, quite a few tasty options are available (including my favorite dumplings). Apart from food, there are some temples and Chinese architecture style buildings including large gate. It may not be the most interesting place",
          "As other reviewers have noted, it seems strange to visit Chinatown while in Japan, but it is well worth your time. It covers quite a few blocks, most of which are closed to vehicles. The area is colorful and clean and bustling with activity. At times, there are long lines of",

          "It is fun to walk and enjoy some snacks, not because of the quality of the Chinese food, which is, at best, just acceptable, but because the atmosphere does have a chinese hint to it. Most Chinatowns do not, this one is large enough to give you a bit of a change of everyday in",

          "It's a fun not to big area with lots of little food stands.",
          "This is considered china town in Osaka. I went to try seventh son Cantonese restaurant here and also Kobe beef but it was disappointed the Kobe beef is not as good as show from picture even he trying to said many times sorry sorry to me I \u2026",
          "It's nice and the food is good. However, go when you have spare time (unless you really want to see China town). If you are exploring Japan on a tight schedule, leave this one last or for next time. In my opinion, the experience does not \u2026",
          "Exciting chinatown in the middle of a tranquil Kobe.  Suddenly, you felt like you're in the middle of a bustling street in Beijing.  Plenty of good chinese delicacies at your liking.",
          "While visiting Kobe traveling with my family, I was pleasantly surprised there was another China Town in Japan other than Yokohama. While not as large as the one in Yokohama, the Kobe China Town has all that is required (good Chinese food and street vendors).",
          "Alot of chinese food, street food and restaurant, near shopping center, easy to access and found from JR station",
          "Good to have a look and check some food. My opinion better can be got elsewhere.",
          "China Town - delicious food here! Great graphics on the drain covers",
          "This small little street is simply awesome where you can feel the Chinese cultures with a wide varieties of Chinese eateries as well.",
          "A great tourist attraction to visit while in Kobe is Chinatown. You can get there by taking the train to JR Motomachi Station and walking about 150 metres south of the station. The area is alive with Chinese restaurants and street stalls. It's a pleasant contrast from Japanese cuisine.",
          "Cleanest China Town I have ever seen. Even when compared to the one in Yokohama.",
          "Recommended for people that like chinese food",
          "Nothing much, some chinese noodles and dishes, lotsa shops selling dumplings. LOL. Feels like the only chinese thing is dumplings and nothing else. Stroll for 10mins and left.",
          "One of the most beautiful China town you could find, very clean, well decorated and foods is everywhere you look, either a snack or sit down proper meal. If you are visiting Kobe for their Kobe beef, highly recommend you swing by as well.",
          "Busy spot with a variety of restaurants. \nSome expensive and remember they do not display tax inclusive prices so always expect your bill to be a bit more",
          "Nothing much other than restaurants selling mostly same type of food. That 1000 yen Kobe beef stall to get a taste of Kobe beef is really not worth as you end up have bits with tendon and makes it a chewy experience. Go for a proper meal of Kobe steak instead of wasting your 1000 yen on that.",
          "The place to go to if you want to eat authentic Kobe beef in Kobe nonetheless! Prepare to splurge in commensurate amount the more you desire premium steak. I tried 80g of tender red meat for something like 4,000 plus yen and it was a really \u2026",
          "Best Beef available try it if  you all loves BEEF.",
          "Lots of street food shops, friendly atmosphere.",
          "Kobe China Town is little China within Japan. It's located at walking distance from the Kobe port area. The place usually becomes very busy during evening time. But, as a tourist, I enjoyed walking through the charming area. A lots of food items. Famous Kobe beef can also be found here. But, one must check the price before ordering!!",
          "Wonderful street to go along and see lots of different Chinese treats and goodies in the stores. Really enjoyed the Kara-age and sweet bao buns. Lots of people along the street and a bit crowded, but not all the time. Bring a bag with you, no trash cans.",
          "A beautiful slice of the exotic in the centre of the city. Beautiful sights, amazing food and everyone was smiling.",
          "Boring place. If want to taste china food please go china instead.",
          "Good place for a stroll during non-peak seasons. Most shops and stalls seem to be run by Chinese so you get a taste of Chinese food. However, the target market is Japanese hence taste has been somewhat localized. Food stalls are located on \u2026",
          "Very nice city. Relaxed and beautiful. Just sit and watch",
          "Don't arrive at 9am for breakfast.... The stalls don't open until 10am and the better stalls only open at 11am.\nThis chinatown alone wouldn't warrant a day trip from osaka to kobe. Fortunately, we had a good kobe beef experience at Mouriya (casual) restaurant (ask for the online prices)",
          "Full of tourist from China.. if you are coming here for food, you should consider the street food.. Restaurants are usually crowded.",
          "Great street food and very affordable people very friendly not trying to hustle you to buy.great for free shuttle bus going from and returning to port.best place in japan yet",
          "We did a day trip to Kobe on Chinese new year day and it was very bustling and great fun.  For those of you going other times it's quite a few streets of restaurants. I tried speaking Chinese to a few of the market stall owners but alot are \u2026",
          "Nice, it's okay if you never been in China before otherwise you notice things are expensive and repetitive...",
          "Small, yet decent China Town. Not as big as the one in Yokohama or the big ones on the west coast of North America.",
          "Fun, and lots of good, cheap food. There are lots of signs saying \"kobe beef here\". I dont know if they were all real, but the beef was delicious and reasonably priced st all of the places I tried.",
          "Many chinese food around here. Chinatown of Kobe.",
          "Absolutely wonderful to visit during night time",
          "The food around the area is great.",
          "So many visitor comes here to taste the chinese cuisine in Japan",
          "Careful, not all dishes are great. I tried one kobe beef that priced \u00a52000. Taste bad",
          "You really wouldn't even tell you're in Chinatown at this particular Marketplace. The only indication that I was able to find was that there was a Chinese flag who hanging over one of the stores. Otherwise there's no difference in these stores or prices in compared to the rest of the Plaza.",
          "Good Chinese food that is even authentic (according to my friend). Has a good atmosphere and not really that expensive. Close to shopping centers and the shore.",
          "Kobe Chinatown has a lot of street food. Nice place to walk around and decent open areas.",
          "Vibrant street. Had lovely but highly expensive kobe beef here on the first floor of a restaurant. First floor is more expensive than the ground floor. And the second floor is even more expensive, haha.",
          "If you love going on food adventure,you should go here",
          "The Chinese atmosphere is stronger  than most China Town neighborhoods you'll find. Mostly because all chinese tourists in the area actually stop there, and make it feel like real traditional china! The downside is that it focuses too much \u2026",
          "If you are in Kobe, then a visit to the Chinese district is a necessity. Great atmosphere, lots of colors and above all excellent choice of delicious, and cheap food. It's an ideal place for lunch, in a break of sightseeing.",
          "Nice place at Kobe\ud83d\udc95\n\u2714I ordered some siomay and bun, the taste was average, but best for the place\ud83d\udc4c\n\u2714The atmosphere was nice... many statue of shio, and there's a beautiful garden at the middle place.\n\u2714The service was average, but ist okay\ud83d\udc4c",
          "Exotic place. Chinatown in Japan.",
          "So... Chinatown ... Small, mostly Chinese food shops. There are way better things to see in Kobe",
          "It is famous for a reason. Definately need atleast a few hours to stroll and eat. There is even a Starbucks if your one of those!",
          "A lot of shops selling Chinese food for sure and also some restaurant selling the so called Kobe Beef, but beware of the quality, they might offer you different thing from what they shown you earlier.",
          "Nice place to get some food! The food is kind of the same from stand to stand but it is still very fun!",
          "Leave this place for lunch time or dinner time visit however I suggest in the evening as the lights would have been a beautiful sight (I was there late afternoon). Very much a place for food and souvenirs. Street food is abundance but after \u2026",
          "Was looking for an authentic Chinese food but ended up on a so-so restaurant. The food was like bought from a supermarket then preheated.\nBe careful in choosing a place to dine in\ud83d\ude09",
          "This Chinatown is not as big as the one in Yokohama. However, there are a lot of Chinese restaurants and street food stands. I tried one of their pork manjus and it was quite delicious. There are also a lot of stands that sell Kobe beef. Never tried any of them, but some can be quite steep.",
          "As someone of Chinese heritage, I felt very uncomfortable with how the area is still named literally \"people from Nanking\". The area itself is a \"nice\" tourist stop if you ignore the historical inappropriateness of the name and if you just \u2026",
          "Like a usual China town, so don't expect you will get a polite Japanese services. Because They are Chinese.",
          "If you like Chinese food, crowds of eager visitors to the Chinese atmosphere, you will absolutely love this area and all its attractions.",
          "we had a wonderful experience!",
          "The meat just literally melted in my mouth. Definitely a must try experience for steak lovers and those who don't mind forking out the money. Very pricey but worthwhile. Most of the premium grade Kobe start from 13000 yen to give you guys an idea of the price range.",
          "Kobe\u2019s Nankinmachi is a much smaller Chinatown in comparison to the one in Yokohama. You can walk through the entire area in approximately 30 minutes. The food offered by the small shops are relatively similar. But the pricing is affordable. Fun to pass through from Sannomiya to Harborland area.",
          "Great place to have a walk around and browse.",
          "It's OK here, but very touristy. Some nice street food, but almost every stall sells pretty much the same thing at the same price.",
          "walked around, good for tourists and dinning(I think).  not interested as I m a hongkongese",
          "Staff/service were nice but the food was mediocre....especially the shaolongbao that they claim to be \u2018specialists\u2019\ud83d\ude25",

          "A good place to get local Chinese food. Soms od its flavors have a little Japanese twist but over all still a good Chinese eats with nice feel at home ambiance",
          "One of the cleanest Chinatowns I've ever visited. Most of the restaurants seem to be purely aimed at tourists.",
          "It is nice size china town in Kobe !\nGood food and atmosphere all around",
          "Definetely worth a visit when you are in Kobe. There are many restaurants",
          "Lots of different foods to try. The streets divide giving a to wander. Leads on to a shopping centre selling all sorts of Japanese products",
          "For chinese food or stuff in kobe, pretty decent street to walk through.",
          "Every booth sells the exact same things at almost exactly the same quality, flavor, and price. Fun to look at for the first few minutes, then gets pretty repetitive. The shop people are nice only until you hand them your money. After that, they won't give you a second glance.",
          "All the stalls are much of a muchness. Unfortunately most close at 6:30 on a Sunday night so we didn\u2019t get the full experience.",
          "Tasty bits and bytes! Lots of delicious street food, or sit-down places as well. Worth a visit if you are in Kobe Motomachi.",
          "Just ok, markets are ok not that good. Thought I gave 3 star as Peking duck is close to what I had in China Beijing",
          "one of the most beautiful Chinatowns in the world",
          "Street food lined alley. Relatively less crowded.",
          "Fun to visit for the atmosphere and authentic Chinese foods and goods, but can be very crowded. Nankinmachi is also known as \u201cChinatown\u201d, but should really be called \u201cChina Street\u201d, because it basically is just one street.",
          "Nice kobe beef noodle",
          "Not much thing to visit.",
          "Didn't drop by here for long. Foods look nice but I think it's suitable for other foreigners than Chinese.",
          "A lot of good little food stalls and restaurants to eat at.  Like \"Chinatowns\" everywhere, this is not the best Chinese food in the city, but it's a fun and lively space.  I would recommend avoiding it on weekends and especially Chinese New Year because it's so crowded you can't move.",
          "Anything you wanted to buy you could get from here. Much cheaper than the shops.",
          "Smaller than The China Town in Yokohama, but Nice place",
          "Great place to enjoy Chinese cuisines.",
          "nice place along the Kobe's coast.",
          "Major tourist trap here. Yes, you may want to visit because it is a Chinatown which I love to visit any Chinatown everywhere I visit. Try to not go crazy buying everything you see. I have learned that lines at stalls are there for a reason \u2026",
          "A long street with lots of Chinese food. There are also some nice spots to take pictures at. I especially liked the ramen with Kobe beef. And all the cute street food.",
          "More popular among the Japanese locals looking for relatively affordable Chinese streetfood....not many foreign tourists here..",
          "Great food, great atmosphere.",
          "Lots of food stall around,quite cheap, tourist attraction",
          "Full of decent Chinese food. Everything is good except Beijing duck. As a Chinese, I would say those foods are pretty good.",
          "In our time in Japan, the only place that someone tried to rip is off was here.  The vendors are pushy, and the place we stopped for lunch gave us the worst service we have had in weeks.",
          "All the stores are opened at 11:00 a.m. and closeded around 5 pm.  The China Towm is small. I don ' t find anything that is interesting.",
          "Went to Nankinmachi to try kobe beef and will definitely go back if ever i'll be in Osaka again. I forgot the name of the stall where we've tried just few bite sizes of the kobe beef as it is indeed pricey! The stall has this spiderman \u2026",
          "It's a little overrated and feels more like a tourist trap than a true immigrant Chinese heritage district.",
          "Loved this area. Such a cool small city to visit. \n\nIf you want to see more of our journey check out @wanderlust.lovers on Instagram \ud83e\udd17",
          "There was plenty of people here during Saturday. I guess it was because China town was celebrating its 150 anniversary.  People came here to enjoy the cheap Dim Sum that the restaurants were offering.",
          "Really cool place to go to and see! Loved it. Make sure to get some pork buns while there, they're absolutely amazing.",
          "They serve a lot of delicious and cheap Chinese food.",
          "there's a lot of food and stuff you can get here. it so much fun walking around you can try authentic Kobe beef and other more.",
          "Not the most overwhelming China town in the world. Not a must to see in my opinion.",
          "A simple medium sized hotel located near the nagoya station. Its best to know the underground route that you can take from nagoya station. It will make your life easier especially if you are draging your luggages. Just one intersection away \u2026",
          "Good food and easy access",
          "Love this place and the food. Goma dango is a must have!",
          "Lots of chinese food stall but its japanized chinese food",
          "Long covered walkway with hundreds of shops. Great to go early as it is not so crowded. There are many shops with reasonably priced souvenirs. Attached is also a walkway to Chinatown.  There are connections to transport. Very few public seating. There is a \u00a5100 shop and several cheap chemist shops.",
          "Variety of Chinese foods to choose, and there is a covered, modern shopping street nearby.",
          "Lots of Chinese street food. Pretty crowded for a Monday afternoon",
          "A wide variety of options to eat during a stroll through this area. Great photo opportunities as well.",

          "Street Food and Kobe Beef to the max!",
          "A very interesting place to take a walk and eat cheap, you can not miss it!",
          "Fun, international street. Street filled with Japanese style Chinese cuisine-street food stall. Dynamic, active, crowd area. This area is Honchome. Honchome means downtown or main street. Near this street there are luxury shop street, and number one premium department store - Daimaru.",
          "Lots of Japanese and Chinese food. KOBE BEEF IS EXCELLENT.",
          "Fun place. Lots of street food. Bring cash. Many people too",
          "Lots of Japanese Chinese fusion snacks for purchase over here. The must try is the dumpling and beef croquettes.",
          "Good for exploring the place. Its just food to fill up your stomach if you are hungry. Not authentic chinese nor japanese food.",
          "Disappointing, especially the food, overpriced and not as advertised (pictures were misleading as to size and appearance)",
          "It is a different kind of china town that I am used to in London, because it was super busy but at the same time it seems the entire street of restaurants are all selling the same type of food and dishes, so it was slightly disappointing.",
          "you can have a instagramable photoshot in here",
          "Nice place! Famous pork bun shops that don't disappoint!",
          "Nice Chinese area in Kobe. Mostly food and drinks but also some Chinese merchandise",
          "The street is short and lots of snacks to grab.",
          "Bustling area with lots of street food. However if you don't eat meat you won't find anything to eat so be aware and either eat beforehand or plan somewhere else to eat. Great vibw",

          "They basically selling the same thing.",
          "Really fun time",

          "Great place if you want to take a break from the rest of the city. Great vibe & some nice Chinese food",
          "You have to go there and try some food !",
          "I visit every Chinatown I pass by. Chinese food is good there and the choices are enormous, if you eat in small restaurant during low business hours you will be able to talk to the owner / staff. That's what I did and I learned a lot on Japanese society from a Chinese immigrant point of view",
          "Decent Chinese food",
          "Two small streets. Not really a town.",
          "One of the best \u201cChina Towns\u201d in all of Japan. Go there for the intrigue, come back because of the delicious food. Seriously, try the dumplings there. I can recommend YunYun.",

          "Great for quick bites while walking around. Can't wrong with any flavor.",
          "A few hidden gems of authentic Chinese resraurants scattered throught the corridors in Chinatown, it is quite similar to other Chinatowns and ironically but unsurprisingly, contained a number of esteemed Kobe beef restaurants.",
          "Pretty underwhelming. Spent 15mins here.",
          "Great place to go",
          "This is an interesting Chinatown with mainly restaurants and other food related businesses. It is good for an afternoon or evening stroll with plenty of interesting things to look at. In the center is a nice square with a small your and statues of the different Chinese zodiacs.",

          "Food is delicious also cheaper",
          "Fairly large China Town, integrated with of the main shopping area. Good food choices if you eat pork and beef. Else duck is the only choice.",

          "Try to go in a week day.. i went in the weekend and it was crazy crowded.\nAnd don't try the pekin duck..its just not close to the original taste but the dim sum and the bao are great",

          "Not as big as other China Towns,  good place if you are hungry",
          "Nothing much to see there. Every other shop sells just about the same stuffs. Pigeons flying everywhere as well. Really won't recommend there unless ure really desperate to kill some time. Even so I'd say you'll probably be done in 30mins.",

          "Very interesting area with a lot of good food.",
          "Lots of eateries and shops for window shopping however this place can be rather dead after 8pm.",
          "Greatly Street food and cool shops",

          "Ok",
          "Absolutely excellent, the beef was perfectly cooked. Just a little n\u00e9gative point for the japanese wine which was not strong enough for this plate",
          "Nothing really special here. But if you like food stamps they have a decent amount of them here. There seems to be a couple where it's jam packed and popular. I assume thosr are the goos ones to try so I recommend going in during non rush hour times if you want to sample the best",

          "Everything looks soooo delicious but the foods are quite disappointing.",
          "Went there at night and it was pretty crowded.  There were a bunch of stalls outside each restaurant, which for some reason all sold pretty much the same stuff.  We tried a few items but nothing great.  TIP: the stalls in the less busy areas are cheaper.",
          "This is not much of a Chinatown. Many food stalls selling the same food types. Not very exciting. An enterprising stall will think of something different.",
          "Nice area, with a lot to eat!",
          "Save yourself for a great selection of Street food...be sure to try the dumplings at yunyun \ud83d\ude0b",

          "a lot of kobe steak kiosks.",

It was one of three shrines established at this time; the others are Hirota Shrine, dedicated to Amaterasu, and Nagata Shrine, dedicated to Kotoshiro-nushi (also known as Ebisu).\nDuring the Genpei War, parts of the Battle of Ichi-no-Tani took place in and around this shrine, and are commemorated by markers in the Ikuta forest behind the shrine. The shrine's land was much larger back then, before the city of Kobe was built around it. Thus, the precise locations of skirmishes or events can no longer be commemorated on shrine land.\n\n\n== Festivals and events ==\nToday, two Noh plays, Ebira and Ikuta Atsumori, which retell aspects of the Genpei War, are performed near the Ikuta Shrine on a regular basis. They are performed every year at Ikuta's Autumn Festival (\u79cb\u796d\u308a, Akimatsuri).\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Shinto shrines\nTwenty-Two Shrines\nModern system of ranked Shinto Shrines\n\n\n== References ==\n\u751f\u7530\u795e\u793e, (Japanese)\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Japanese)",

Most of the former residence was destroyed in the Pacific War; the stables of 1907 survived and have been designated an Important Cultural Property.It is one of the few historical Japanese gardens that exists within Kobe city.  It adopts a \"chisen kaiyu shiki (\u6c60\u6cc9\u56de\u904a\u5f0f)\u201d, style which is a style of garden that features a path around a pond. The giant camphor tree standing inside the garden is considered one of the most iconic elements of the site. This tree is known to have been there before the original residence of Kodera Yasujir\u014d was built.In the gardens are the former Hassam Residence, built by the English architect Alexander Nelson Hansell in 1902 and relocated to its current site in 1963 (ICP); an Edo-period building shaped like a boathouse, dating from 1682-1704 (ICP); a tea house; and a stroll garden.In 2006 S\u014draku-en was registered as a Place of Scenic Beauty.

        "wiki": "The Kobe foreign settlement (\u795e\u6238\u5916\u56fd\u4eba\u5c45\u7559\u5730, K\u014dbe gaikokujin kyory\u016bchi), also known as the Kobe foreign concession, was a foreign settlement located about 3.5 kilometers east of the Port of Kobe, in the future Ch\u016b\u014d-ku of Kobe, Japan. Established based on the Ansei Treaties, it existed from January 1, 1868, to July 16, 1899.\nThe site was located between the Ikuta River to the east, the Koi River (\u9bc9\u5ddd) (site of a future thoroughfare) to the west, the sea to the south, and the Saigoku Kaid\u014d (\u897f\u56fd\u8857\u9053) highway to the north. It had an area of 78,000 tsubo (about 25.8 hectares), and was developed based on a logical urban plan. For these reasons, it has been praised as the \"best-planned foreign settlement in the Orient\". Its extraterritoriality was acknowledged in some of its administrative and financial affairs, and it was managed by an autonomous organization structured with foreign residents (most of whom had interests in east-India company and/or associates) at its center. Its operation was smooth, and relations between the Japanese and foreign sides were generally favorable. The settlement prospered as a gateway to Western culture and base of trade, spreading its economic and cultural influence to the surrounding areas as well.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Opening the Port of Hy\u014dgo ===\n\nOn July 29, 1858, the Tokugawa shogunate entered into the Treaty of Amity and Commerce with the United States. In Article 6 of that treaty, the shogunate acknowledged the consular jurisdiction of the U.S. in Japan. In Article 3 it opened Hy\u014dgo port as a treaty port from January 1, 1863, agreeing to establish a fixed area (foreign settlement) to be loaned to foreigners to reside and conduct economic activity in. Before long, the shogunate signed similar treaties known as the Ansei Treaties with the Netherlands, Russia, the United Kingdom, and France. However, these treaties were unable to gain the approval of an imperial edict, and after negotiations with the foreign powers the opening of the port was delayed for five years, until January 1, 1868. The court expressed disapproval for the opening of a port so close to the imperial palace in Kyoto, and even after the Ansei Treaties were approved by imperial edict on December 22, 1865, approval for the port was still not granted. On June 26, 1867, when the treaty port's scheduled opening was six months away, an imperial edict finally acknowledged its establishment.Even before the issuance of this sanction, the shogunate had been conducting negotiations with the various foreign powers on the topic of the treaty port, and on May 16, 1867, it concluded an agreement for the establishment of foreign settlements in Hy\u014dgo and Osaka with Britain, the U.S., and France. Article 1 of this agreement established that \"a foreign settlement will be established in Hy\u014dgo, between K\u014dbe-machi (K\u014dbe-mura) and the Ikuta River, for residents of those countries which have such treaties with the Japanese government ...\" Thus, the foreign settlement was created at K\u014dbe-mura (\u795e\u6238\u6751), about 3.5 km east of the Port of Hy\u014dgo. In accordance with this, a new harbor was constructed on the coast at K\u014dbe-mura and opened to the foreign powers. In 1892, an imperial edict named this harbor the Port of Kobe (\u795e\u6238\u6e2f, K\u014dbe-k\u014d).Existing documents do not record the reason or chain of events surrounding the opening of the Port of Kobe instead of the Port of Hy\u014dgo. Still, there are a number of theories. In Kokusai Toshi K\u014dbe no Keifu, Toshio Kusumoto guesses that the shogunate, mindful of the population's preference to keep foreigners at a distance and wishing to avoid conflict, wanted to avoid opening the already bustling and prosperous port of Hy\u014dgo. Meanwhile, Shinsh\u016b K\u014dbe Shishi: Rekishi-hen 3 and Kokusai Toshi K\u014dbe no Keifu both conjecture that it was easier to secure a site in the less densely populated area around K\u014dbe-mura, and this site also allowed the reappropriation of the Kobe Naval Training Center, which had shut down in 1865. A November 1865 survey of the surrounding ocean by an attendant of the British envoy Harry Smith Parkes indicated that the area intended for the foreign settlement, somewhat removed from the old Hy\u014dgo town center, looked out on a small bay that was sufficiently deep and provided an anchorage abundant in nature. Kokusai Toshi K\u014dbe no Keifu posits from this that this site was K\u014dbe-mura, and that the foreign powers also found this location more suitable than the existing port of Hy\u014dgo. In any case, in 1892, the port of Kobe was expanded to incorporate the old port of Hy\u014dgo.The final site of the foreign settlement was located within K\u014dbe-mura and framed by the Ikuta River to the east, Koi River to the west, and Pacific Ocean to the south, with the Saigoku Kaid\u014d highway to the north. It had an area of 78,000 tsubo (about 0.26 km2). Shinsh\u016b K\u014dbe Shishi describes this selection as suggestive of the shogunate's consideration in minimizing contact between foreigners and Japanese to its utmost ability.\n\n\n=== Construction and administration ===\n\nThe Tokugawa shogunate dispatched Shibata Takenaka as magistrate of Hy\u014dgo, putting him in charge of the creation of port and foreign settlement. Shibata immediately took over this task on his arrival in K\u014dbe-mura, but by January 1, 1868, when the port was to open, all that was complete was the customs office, three wharfs, and three storehouses. This was also the period during which the government transitioned from the shogunate to the Meiji government, and on November 9, 1867, Sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu officially tendered his resignation to the emperor. At first, business related to the port was left to the shogunate government, but on January 3, two days after the port opened, the shogunate was completely abolished and power returned to the emperor. After the shogunate forces lost the Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi at the end of that January, Yoshinobu retreated from Osaka Castle to Edo, and with Shibata recalled to Edo as well, the construction had to be suspended. The remainder of the construction was carried out under the Meiji government, and around 1872 the building of roads and drains was finished, completing the 8-by-5 grid of streets that defined the area of the settlement.The Meiji government, which was unwilling to allow foreigners to own land, classified the area instead as under perpetual lease, and the leaseholders were decided by auction. The perpetual lease continued even after the return of the settlement to Japan, until 1942 (see below). About half of the profits from the auction were absorbed by the government, while the remainder was accumulated for operating expenses by the Municipal Council (\u5c45\u7559\u5730\u4f1a\u8b70, Kyory\u016bchi Kaigi), which the government acknowledged as the highest deciding body in the settlement's government. The self-government of the settlement by its residents continued  until the foreign settlement was abolished. The settlement enjoyed 30 years of smooth operation, and relations were generally good between the foreign and Japanese sides. However, it was forbidden for Japanese to live within the foreign settlement, and their entrance to it was also restricted.In response to the delay in the settlement's construction, the Meiji government allowed foreigners to live outside of the settlement in the area between the Ikuta River to the east, the Uji River to the west, the southern shore of the foreign settlement to the south, and the mountains to the north. This area was referred to as the mixed residential zone (\u96d1\u5c45\u5730, zakkyochi), and also existed until the abolishment of the settlement (see below).\n\n\n=== Development of the settlement and it surroundings ===\nAfter the opening of the port, the settlement was outfitted according to a logical urban plan, with the roads and drains complete around 1872, and bidding on the land lease over by February 7, 1873. The settlement's urban planning led to its evaluation as the \"best-planned foreign settlement in the Orient\" (by an April 17, 1871 article in the English-language newspaper The Far East). Even so, its surroundings were by no means the object of planned development. The foreign settlement sprouted factories run by foreigners to its northeast, companies and banks to its west, and a Chinatown to its northwest, but as the population in the area near the foreign settlement increased in proportion to its development, a disorderly jumble emerged around it. The scale of the town area increased until in 1890 it connected with the town around the Port of Hy\u014dgo. At the time of the foreign settlement's establishment, the population of K\u014dbe-mura had been around 3,600 people, but in 1889, when K\u014dbe-mura was merged with its surroundings to become K\u014dbe-shi (Kobe City), the new municipality had a population of about 134,700 people. Furthermore, the population of the foreign settlement itself had increased from around 400 English, Germans, French, Dutch, and Ming citizens in 1871 to more than 2,000 in 1890 (see below).\nThe port possessed meager facilities at first, resembling a natural coastline, but its outfitting continued as well. From April to July 1868, four new wharfs were built between the Ikuta and Uji rivers, and construction was carried out between 1871 and 1872 on breakwaters and expanding the wharves. From April 29 to July 26, 1871, further construction redirected the Ikuta River\u2014not only to prevent the flooding of the settlement, but also to stop the flow of sediment into the middle of the harbor. These actions laid the foundations for the Port of Kobe's later reputation as a good natural harbor. The first round of major restorations that led to its position as Japan's foremost international trade port were decided in 1907, after the foreign settlement's return, and work began in 1908.\n\n\n=== Return ===\nAiming to amend the terms of the unequal Ansei Treaties formed by the shogunate, the Meiji government embarked on a plan of Westernization. One part of this plan involved holding balls at the Rokumeikan in Tokyo, and Kobe also held its own. In 1887, a ball organized by the governors of Osaka and Hy\u014dgo prefecture, and called \"Kobe's Biggest Evening Party Ever\" (\u795e\u6238\u672a\u66fe\u6709\u306e\u5927\u591c\u4f1a), took place in a gymnasium owned by the Kobe Regatta & Athletic Club (KRAC).In 1894, the Meiji government concluded the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with the United Kingdom, realizing its goal of repealing consular jurisdiction and reclaiming the foreign settlements. The government proceeded to conclude treaties to the same effect with 14 more countries, including the U.S. and France. These treaties took effect on July 17, 1899, and on this date the Kobe foreign settlement was returned to Japanese hands. The settlement was incorporated into Kobe City, and its administrative and financial autonomy was canceled. Japanese were allowed to enter freely and to reside within the area. The settlement's internal police force, which had been organized by the Municipal Council, was abolished, and its fire brigade, which had been organized directly be residents, was transferred to the control of the city as a regular fire brigade. The government of the settlement was transferred from the highest office within the Municipal Council, the head of the Executive Committee (\u884c\u4e8b\u5c40, gy\u014dji-kyoku) (see below), to commissioned members of the prefectural and city governments. On the old site of the office, a local police station was built, and a committee called the Consultation Committee (\u76f8\u8ac7\u59d4\u54e1\u4f1a) (later the Kobe International Committee (\u795e\u6238\u56fd\u969b\u59d4\u54e1\u4f1a\u3068\u6539\u79f0)) was allowed to be established by the foreigners to help prevent disputes arising from the loss of extraterritoriality. In these ways, the government showed some consideration for the foreigners as well.\n\n\n=== Disputes over the perpetual lease ===\nAs discussed above, the Meiji government was unwilling to allow foreigners to own land, and instead lent it to them on a perpetual lease. These leases continued even after the return of the settlement to Japan, but Japan began a policy of taxing the buildings on the land. The foreigners were opposed to this on the grounds that they were already being taxed on the land itself, and so were being subjected to double taxation, and in 1902 the Japanese government presented the case to the Permanent Court of Arbitration. In 1905, Japan's plea was discarded, and Japan was disallowed from levying any taxes on buildings on the land under perpetual lease.With taxation impossible, the Kobe city government moved beginning in 1933 to repeal the perpetual leases. In September 1936, it began conferencing with Yokohama and Nagasaki, which faced similar issues, and the three cities negotiated together with the foreign countries. In March 1937, an agreement was reached to exchange the leases on April 1, 1942, for the rights to the land, in exchange for which the land would be exempt from taxation for five years after the exchange.Though the settlement was officially returned to Japan by treaty on July 17, 1899, the settlement's history is considered to have continued until its full annulment on April 1, 1942.\n\n\n=== After the return ===\n\nFrom the Taish\u014d era until the early Sh\u014dwa era, many Japanese firms and banks advanced into the former foreign settlement, which developed as a business district. Meanwhile, foreign trading companies declined around the time of the First World War. Real estate owned by Germans in particular, whose country opposed Japan in the war, was forcibly sold to Japanese, and German firms within the former settlement were succeeded by Japanese ones. By 1931, only 47 of 126 lots in the former foreign settlement were still under perpetual lease to foreigners.The Bombing of Kobe in World War II resulted in the destruction of 70% of the lots by June 1945, and their restoration did not progress well even after the war ended. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, many companies moved their bases to Tokyo, and the city center of Kobe moved east, deteriorating the former settlement's economic position. But in the late 1970s, the modern Western style architecture and historical scenery of the area led to its reappraisal. New shops opened that incorporated these factors, and the former foreign settlement became active once more as both a business and shopping district.\n\n\n== Autonomy and extraterritoriality ==\n\nOn August 7, 1868, the Meiji government concluded the Arrangement Relative to the Foreign Settlement at the Port of Hiogo and at Osaka (\u5927\u962a\u5175\u5eab\u5916\u56fd\u4eba\u5c45\u7559\u5730\u7d04\u5b9a\u66f8), in which it acknowledged certain executive and financial rights of foreigners within the settlement. Specifically, the Municipal Council (\u5c45\u7559\u5730\u4f1a\u8b70, Kyory\u016bchi Kaigi) was created as the highest legislative organ in charge of the improvement of infrastructure and public order within the settlement. The Municipal Council was funded in part by a portion of the profits from the auctions of the perpetual leases, and was also allowed to collect land and police taxes. This self-government by the residents of the settlement continued until the abolishment of the settlement\u2014unlike that in Nagasaki and Yokohama, which began with rights to self-government but lost them after a time. Meanwhile, the various foreign powers placed consulates around the settlement in order to safeguard their financial interests and citizens and exercise their consular jurisdiction.The Municipal Council's members consisted of consuls from the various foreign powers and the governor of Hy\u014dgo prefecture, along with three elected representatives of the settlement's residents, who formed the Council's Executive Committee (\u884c\u4e8b\u5c40, gy\u014dji-kyoku). The chairman of the Municipal Council was typically a representative of the consulates. The Council's meetings were conducted in English, and the minutes of these meetings were printed in the newspaper. The executive committee was the primary executive organ of the Council. The executive committee consisted of three committee members led by a committee head. The first executive committee head was one Charles Henry Cobden, who was succeeded by Hermann Trotzig from 1872 until the return of the settlement to Japan. When the settlement's police station was established in April 1874, Trotzig also took over as its chief. Important matters were analyzed by committees under the Municipal Council, and their reports formed the basis for the Council's decisions.In order to respect the foreigners' self-government, there were limits on the abilities of Japanese to enter the settlement and of Japan to exercise police power in the area. Due to the extraterritoriality enforced by unequal treaties, legal disputes involving Westerners were subject to judgment by their consulates. The right to self-government was tied to the land of the settlement, and thus did not apply outside its boundaries, but the right to consular jurisdiction was tied to the people it applied to, and thus extended even to disputes that occurred outside the settlement. In practice, foreigners claimed the same extraterritoriality outside the settlement that they did inside, which sometimes developed into trouble with the Japanese side.\n\n\n=== Problems around self-governance and extraterritoriality ===\n\n\n==== Residence and entrance by Japanese people ====\nJapanese were forbidden to reside within the settlement, and at first after the opening of the port were unable to enter it at all, but after 1869 permit-holders were allowed inside. The settlement's internal police force also had a few Japanese police officers.\n\n\n==== Problems around police power ====\nAs the Arrangement Relative to the Foreign Settlement at the Port of Hiogo and at Osaka allowed it to levy taxes for policing purposes, the Municipal Council felt that it held the power to police the settlement. However, Hy\u014dgo Prefecture was of the view that the policing of the settlement fell under the jurisdiction of its prefectural police force. This difference in opinion led to a dispute on July 2, 1871, called the Queen vs. Walters Case (\u5973\u738b\u5bfe\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b9\u4e8b\u4ef6).\nOn July 2, 1871, a Hy\u014dgo prefectural police officer brought a woman suspected of prostitution in to the station from within the foreign settlement. Once the investigation determined that she was a servant of the Englishman Mr. Walters, who lived within the settlement, she was released. However, Walters was angry over the affair, and on the next day, July 3, he trapped two police officers he believed to have been involved in her arrest within his estate. The case fell under consular jurisdiction and was judged by the English consul Abel Gower, who judged that the Japanese officers were unable to exercise police power in the settlement\u2014not even to patrol it, let alone arrest anyone. Thus, Walters was not found guilty of obstruction of justice against the officers, but only of false imprisonment. This judgment clarified that only the settlement police, under the authority of the executive committee, was allowed to undertake police action in the settlement. Hy\u014dgo Prefecture remained unable to exercise these powers in the settlement until its return in 1899.\n\n\n==== Inquiry and preliminary hearings on the Normanton Incident ====\nThe initial inquiry and preliminary hearings on the 1886 Normanton Incident fell under the consular jurisdiction of the Kobe foreign settlement. On October 24, the cargo ship Normanton, belonging to a steamboat company at the Yokohama settlement, sank in the waters off the coast of Wakayama Prefecture. The boat's 25 Japanese passengers, who were riding along with the cargo, all died. Although 11 British crewmen boarded lifeboats and survived, not a single Japanese passenger made it out alive, and so suspicion emerged that the captain and crew had been negligent in saving the passengers. Under the consular jurisdiction guaranteed by the Ansei Treaties, the hearings for the case were heard over five days beginning on November 1 in the Kobe foreign settlement, but the British consul James Troup found the crew innocent. The governor of Hy\u014dgo Prefecture, Utsumi Tadakatsu, was dissatisfied with the verdict and accused the captain of murder. On November 20, preliminary hearings were held on this charge in the foreign settlement, and on December 8 public hearings were held in Yokohama; both of these found the captain guilty. As the initial inquiry over the incident had found the crew blameless, doubts and criticism of the right to consular jurisdiction arose domestically in Japan, along with a wave of anti-British sentiment. This initial inquiry is a black spot in the otherwise positive history of foreign\u2013Japanese relations in the Kobe foreign settlement.\n\n\n== Townscape ==\n\nBecause the Port of Hy\u014dgo opened about nine years after those of Yokohama and Nagasaki, the Kobe foreign settlement was built on a logical urban plan that leveraged the construction and design experiences of those earlier settlements. On April 17, 1871, the English-language journal The Far East described Kobe as the \"best-planned foreign settlement in the Orient\".The completed townscape of the settlement possessed the following characteristics:\n\nWith the Ikuta River to the east, Uji River to the west, and sea to the south, the settlement was surrounded by rivers and the ocean on three sides. However, the rivers to the east and west were subjected in the 1870s to redirection and conversion into culverts.\n8 roads running north to south and 5 running east to west split the settlement into 22 blocks, which were further subdivided into a total of 126 lots. Each lot had an area of between 200 and 300 tsubo (about 660 to 990 m2), and the total buildable area of the settlement, subtracting the roads, amounted to 49,645 tsubo (about 16.4 hectares) as of 1885.\nThe roads were split into roadways and sidewalks.\nDrainage pipes were laid underground along the roads, running north to south and into the sea. The pipes were made of wedge-shaped bricks, packed together with mortar into a cylindrical shape.\nThe roads were lined with trees and streetlights. The electrical lines were run underground, meaning that there was no need for utility poles to be raised.\nThe seaside road on the south of the settlement, Kaigan-d\u014dri, was outfitted as a promenade: lined with pine trees and a lawn.\n\n\n=== Gas lamps ===\n\nIn November 1874, Brown and Co.\u2014a predecessor of Osaka Gas, established with the investment of many of the firms in the settlement\u2014began supplying gas to the settlement, the first area in Hy\u014dgo to receive it. Gas lamps were set up inside the settlement to replace the previous oil lamps. Of the 94 gas lamps from the period, two are in front of the former Hassam residence, while another is at the Meiji-mura museum and theme park. Reconstructions are also placed around the Kobe City Museum and the Kobe branch of the Daimaru department store chain.Electricity became available in Kobe from November 1888, and electric lamps were put up around the city, but there was opposition within the foreign settlement, mainly from Brown and Co. This delayed the introduction of both electricity supply and electric lamps to the settlement. Additionally, the foreign residents insisted that elevated power cables would ruin the beauty of the town, and had the lines in the settlement laid underground. Even after the return of the settlement to Japan, these wires remained underground, and utility poles were never erected in the area.\n\n\n=== Architectural style ===\n\nThe first buildings erected in the settlement were tinged with the classical style. The former American consulate in Kobe at No. 15 was an exemplar of this style, with two floors and a veranda adorned with columns on the second floor. Until the mid-19th century, the classical style was overwhelmingly predominant in the foreign settlements of East Asia.In the 1890s, the English architect Alexander Nelson Hansell's activity brought change to the current fad. Hansell, influenced by Gothic Revival architecture, favored designs that featured exposed brick. Beginning with the rebuilding of the Kobe Club in the foreign settlement, Hansell worked on the designs of a great number of buildings, including branches of HSBC and Jardine Matheson, as well as the German consulate.Unlike the Yokohama settlement, which was populated by many examples of faux-Western Giy\u014df\u016b architecture, all of the buildings in the Kobe settlement were constructed under the direction of Western architects, and most of the clients who ordered construction were foreign-owned enterprises. Meanwhile, from the early 1900s on, many of the architects employed by Japanese government administrations and business in Kobe were Japanese. These included graduates of the Imperial College of Engineering, like Tatsuno Kingo, Sone Tatsuz\u014d, and Kawai K\u014dz\u014d, as well as Yamaguchi Hanroku, who studied architecture abroad in France at the \u00c9cole Centrale Paris. Architects like these, who studied under the Englishman Josiah Conder at the Imperial College like Tatsuno, or overseas like Yamaguchi, laid the development for the advancement of architecture in Japan during the Meiji period. However, these Japanese architects employed in Kobe at large and the foreign ones employed in the foreign settlement were clearly demarcated by their different client groups, and interaction between them was sparse.\n\n\n=== Lodging ===\n \nThe first hospitality facility in the Kobe foreign settlement was the Global Hotel, which opened in 1868, though its location and the date of its closure are unknown. Various other facilities followed. The most famous among these was the Oriental Hotel, which opened sometime before August 3, 1870, in Lot 79. The Oriental Hotel was home to the office of the social Union Club from 1870 until around 1881, when Club Concordia took over the space, and on September 23, 1870, the KRAC's founding meeting was held there. The Oriental Hotel purchased Lot 80 in 1888 and moved its main building there, and at this time enjoyed critical acclaim for the culinary efforts of its French chef Louis Begeux. After the settlement's return, the Oriental Hotel's operation continued unbroken despite its relocation. It was destroyed by the Great Hanshin earthquake in 1995 but reopened in 2010.\n\n\n=== Construction on the neighboring rivers ===\n\nThe two rivers that bordered the settlement on its initial construction were both problematic. The Ikuta River to the east had low banks and frequently flooded the settlement, while the Koi River to the west was hated as an obstruction to traffic.The Meiji government conducted construction on the Ikuta River from April 9 to July 26, 1871, to redirect the flow of the river eastward, creating a straight new Ikuta River that flowed directly south from the Nunobiki Falls upstream to Onohama-ch\u014d in Kobe. The old riverbed was built over and the street called Flower Road was built atop it, alongside a park shared by foreigners and Japanese that later became Higashi Y\u016benchi park. Some of the bank was left as hill, on which Kobe City Hall was later built. One portion of the reclaimed land was called Kan\u014d-ch\u014d, in honor of the late Edo and Meiji-period merchant Kan\u014d S\u014dshichi. The British engineer and architect John William Hart, who had been involved with the construction of the settlement, was also involved with the remodeling of the river.In the case of the Koi River, the settlement's foreign residents appealed to Hy\u014dgo prefecture and the central government to cover the river, offering to pay half of the construction costs involved. The construction was carried out from October 1874 to January 1875. In 1909, the river was completely covered with concrete, becoming a culvert. Later, a road called Koikawa-suji was laid atop it.\n\n\n== Foreigners outside the settlement ==\nThe Kobe foreign settlement's residents were allowed to live and operate in a certain area outside of its bounds.\n\n\n=== Mixed residential zone ===\n\nThe initial opening of the port on January 1, 1868, only established a tiny area of land and facilities. The Meiji government had publicly inherited the treaties and agreements concluded by the shogunate, but in the May 16, 1867 agreement, the shogunate had agreed that in the event that the settlement became too cramped, it would either expand the area of the settlement or allow Japanese people to rent residences to foreigners. Therefore, the Meiji government from March 30, 1868, allowed foreigners to reside in the area between the Ikuta River to the east, the Uji river to the west, the coast to the south, and the mountains to the north. Within this area, foreigners could lease land and lease or purchase houses. This area was known as the mixed residential zone (\u96d1\u5c45\u5730, zakkyochi). After the very early days of the zone's existence, it was not allowed to grant perpetual leases on land within this zone to foreigners. Leases were limited initially to five-year intervals, which was later expanded to 25 years. The mixed residential zone was set up on a temporary basis to compensate for the late opening of the settlement, but even after the settlement's completion, its foreign residents soon overwhelmed its internal capacity. Fearing that it would be asked to expand the settlement if the mixed residential zone were removed, the Meiji government left the zone intact until the abolishment of the settlement. As of the end of 1885, the mixed residential zone had an area of 26,756 tsubo (about 8.8 hectares).As Qing China had no treaty with Japan at the time of the port's opening, its citizens were unable to reside within the settlement and were limited to the mixed residential zone. This led to the development of a Chinatown to the west of the foreign settlement. After the signing of the Sino-Japanese Friendship and Trade Treaty on September 13, 1871, they were able to reside within the settlement, and the number of Chinese residents in both the mixed zone and the settlement itself increased. These Chinese acted as neutral parties called baiben (\u8cb7\u5f01) in trade conducted by the settlement's foreign firms. They also used their channels to China to play a major role in the export of matches to both countries.Many old foreign residences, called ijinkan, remain as popular tourist attractions in the old mixed residential zone. The existing Kobe Chinatown, Nankinmachi, is in the area west of the foreign settlement where the Qing Chinatown first developed. In the mixed residential zone, foreigners and Japanese lived side by side, producing international exchange on the level of daily life. Kobe's current status as a city where multiple ethnicities and cultures coexist arose from this relationship.\n\n\n=== Treaty limits ===\n\nThe Ansei Treaties included stipulations restricting the area of activity open to foreign residents, and in Kobe this consisted of an area of ten ri (about 40 km) around the Hy\u014dgo prefectural office. In 1869, the prefecture released regulations concretely defining this 10-ri area in terms of actual travel distance, bounded by the sea to the south and by villages on all sides: to the east by \u014cbe, Sakane, Hirai, and Nakashima in Kawabe District, the west by Sone and Amida in Innami District, and the north by \u014charano-mura in Kawabe District, Kawahara, Yado, Yakamishimo, and Inugai in Taki District, and Tak\u014d, My\u014drakuji, and Yok\u014d in Taka District. However, the foreign countries instead interpreted the ten ri as a radius of direct distance, expanding the treaty limits to encompass the entirety of Innami to the west and Kawabe, Taki, and Taka districts to the north. The space beyond this area was accessible to foreigners only for recreation and scholarship, and when foreigners did enter it they were obligated to carry a travel license from the prefectural office. In actuality, though, foreigners often left the treaty area without permission on excursions, which frequently caused trouble for the prefecture. When the settlement was returned in 1899, foreigners were permitted to reside and travel freely within Japan.\n\n\n== Trade ==\n\nThe port prospered with trade from immediately after its opening. The initial trade consisted of exports supplied by Japanese merchants to foreign ones, and imports sold from foreign merchants to Japanese ones. This was because foreigners were not allowed to buy export goods or sell their own imports outside the settlement, while Japanese merchants lacked the know-how to conduct business directly with businessmen overseas. Japanese merchants trying to sell goods to foreigners or buy goods from them carried out their negotiations through intermediaries, either Japanese clerks or Chinese baiben. As many of the foreign merchants were high-handed and forceful in their negotiations, and the Japanese were unaccustomed to trading with foreign countries and unfamiliar with the state of the world outside Japan, Japanese merchants were frequently manipulated into buying and selling goods at disadvantageous prices.Over time, as Japanese merchants and firms began to conduct their transactions directly with their counterparts, the power of the foreign merchants declined. At first, foreign merchants were involved in a full 100% of the foreign trade at the Port of Kobe, but in 1897, immediately before the settlement's return, they were only involved in 65% of transactions, and by 1907, after the return, their involvement had dropped to 50%, and 40% in 1911. Foreign merchants withdrew from the settlement after its return and were replaced by the Japanese firms that were now allowed to open offices within its old borders. In 1931, foreigners held leases on only 47 of the former settlement's 126 lots.The principal export goods were tea, rice, and matches. At first, the export tea came from Kyoto, but tea produced in western Japan was gradually promoted, and structures for its export came into place. Rice was exported from Kobe in sufficient quantity to become the standard rice in London's grain market. Full-scale match manufacturing in Kobe began in the late 1870s, at which point those matches also started being exported. The value of match exports from the Port of Kobe increased rapidly beginning in the late 1880s, increasing until they comprised more than nine-tenths of Japan's total match exports. These exports were directed primarily at China at first, but over time expanded to reach Australia, Europe, and America.The principal imports were cotton and woolen textiles like calico and cotton velvet. In 1896, the Kobe resident Takahashi Shinji imported a Kinetoscope through Rynel and Co., which occupied Lot 14, and held Japan's first public showings of moving pictures. From 1894 until the end of the Meiji period, Kobe hosted the highest level of imports of all Japan's ports.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Food ===\n\n\n==== Ramune ====\n\nThe Kobe foreign settlement is said to be the birthplace of the popular Japanese drink Ramune. Sim and Co., managed by Alexander Cameron Sim, began to produce and distribute Ramune under the name J\u016bhachi-ban (18\u756a), which was based on the company's location in Lot 18 of the foreign settlement. When Sim began selling Ramune, cholera was prevalent in Japan, and demand increased in 1886 when the Yokohama Mainichi Shinbun reported that \"beverages containing gas prevent infection\". A contemporary report by the Osaka Nipp\u014d stated that Sim's Ramune had \"sold out completely\".\n\n\n==== Beef ====\n\nBefore the opening of the port, beef produced in Tanba, Tango, and Tajima and purchased by merchants at the Yokohama foreign settlement was highly valued among foreigners. After the port opened, its foreign residents enthusiastically sought out this beef, but as beef was not customarily consumed in Japan at the time, no systems existed to provide enough supply. Therefore, the foreigners themselves opened slaughterhouses and butchers. The first of these was opened by the British businessman Edward Charles Kirby, who at some point rented a slaughterhouse to the east of the Ikuta River, opened a butcher along the coastal road Kaigan-d\u014dri, and began to sell beef.  Other records state that in 1868, an Englishman by the name of Teboul (\u30c6\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb) opened a slaughter house beside the Ikuta River. In 1871, Japanese people began supplying beef, and after 1875 its provision was mostly monopolized by Japanese. In 1894 foreigners withdrew completely from the local beef industry.Beginning immediately after the port's opening, Japanese in the areas around the settlement began handling beef for business and consuming it as food. The beef hotpot (sukiyaki) restaurant Kanmon Gekka-tei (\u95a2\u9580\u6708\u4e0b\u4ead), which opened in 1869 in the Motomachi area within the mixed residential zone, is thought to have been the first Japanese-managed beef restaurant in Kobe. The oldest beef shops were \u014ci Nikuten and Moritani Sh\u014dten, which opened in 1871. The founder of \u014ci Nikuten, Kishida Inosuke, invented beef cooking techniques unique from those of the West, preserving beef in miso, or in soy as a tsukudani dish. In the late 1870s the businessman Suzuki Kiyoshi developed canned beef flavored with soy sauce and sugar, which became a nationwide hit product.\n\n\n==== Western confectionery ====\nWestern confectionery was produced after the opening of the port to cater to foreign residents and travelers. In 1882, in Motomachi 3-ch\u014dme within the mixed residential zone, Ninomiya Seijin-d\u014d was founded as the first Western confectionery shop in Kobe. In G\u014dsh\u014d shinpei minato no sakigake (\u8c6a\u5546\u795e\u5175\u6e4a\u306e\u9b41), published the same year, introduced a Western confectionery shop called Sangoku-d\u014d near the Aioi Bridge. In 1897, a man named Yoshikawa Ichiz\u014d opened a branch of the Tokyo confectionery F\u016bgetsu-d\u014d in Motomachi, the first full-scale Western confectionery in Kobe, which sold castella, waffle, profiterole, candy, and chocolate.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\n\nThe Meiji government continued the shogunate's prohibition on Christianity until February 24, 1873. However, the Ansei Treaties guaranteed freedom of religion for foreigners, and religious activity by missionaries within the foreign settlement was energetic from its inception.On August 9, 1868, the missionary Pierre Mounicou of the Paris Foreign Missions Society began holding weekly Catholic services every Sunday at a temporary place of worship on the Saigoku Kaid\u014d. In March of the next year he built a rectory on Lot 37 and moved the services there. However, as many of foreign residents were Protestant, attendance was not remarkably high. Mounicou continued on, building a chapel on Lot 37, and the church was consecrated on April 17, 1870. In 1923, the church was relocated to Nakayamate-d\u014dri 1-ch\u014dme, becoming one of the roots of the Kobe Central Catholic Church.On May 22, 1870, Daniel Crosby Greene of the American Board began holding Protestant services on Lot 18. Greene constructed a church on Lot 48, which was completed in 1872 and named the Union Church. In 1928, the church moved to Fukiai-ku Ikuta-ch\u014d 4-ch\u014dme, and then to Nada-Ku, Kobe Nagaminedai 2-ch\u014dme in 1992The first Anglican services in the settlement were held in 1873. From 1876 to 1898, the Protestant Union Church also hosted Anglican services. In 1898, All Saints Church completed construction at Shitayamate-d\u014dri 3-ch\u014dme, and Anglican services were conducted there from then on. All Saints Church burned down during the Second World War and was never rebuilt.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nA variety of musical activities took place on the street by the sea, in Naigaijin Park, the Kobe Regatta & Athletic Club gymnasium, and in Nishimachi Park. Most of these activities were concerts, dances, and performances at sporting events. They were held by military bands from the various countries, as well as by private bands and professional or amateur musicians. KRAC held between one and three performances per year, featuring both concerts and theatrical plays, in order to cover its management expenses.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\n\n==== Sports organizations ====\n\n\n===== Hiogo and Osaka Race Club =====\n\nThe Hiogo Race Club (HRC), was launched as the Kobe foreign settlement's first sports organization on March 1, 1869, and afterwards expanded in scope to become the Hiogo and Osaka Race Club (HORC). The HORC built a permanent horse-racing course between Ikuta Shrine and the contemporary course of the Ikuta River and periodically hosted races. The HORC was quite active and exchanged horses and riders with the Nippon Race Club, but its financial situation worsened. The club became unable to pay rent on its land and lost the racecourse, dissolving in November 1877.\n\n\n===== Kobe (Hyogo) Cricket Club =====\nThe foreign settlement at Kobe quickly became home to many British residents, including many lovers of their country's national sport. The Hy\u014dgo Cricket Club was founded on January 19, 1870, around the main members of a team of foreign residents that had played a game on October 16 of the previous year against a British army team. The club changed its name in 1871 to the Kobe Cricket Club (KCC). For a long time, the KCC was unable to secure enough members or playing ground to undertake any conspicuous activity, but after May 1877, when the future Higashi Y\u016benchi park was completed, the club became quite active, playing games in the park seemingly every week. Beginning in 1893, the club also played games of baseball. The KCC continued to operate until World War II.\n\n\n===== Kobe Regatta & Athletic Club =====\n\nThe Kobe Regatta & Athletic Club (KRAC) was a sports club founded on September 23, 1870, by the proposal of Alexander Cameron Sim. KRAC was able to secure land on the eastern side of the foreign settlement immediately, and by December 1870, just three months after its founding, had completed a boathouse and gymnasium, and a pool by June 1871, launching its activities at a favorable pace. KRAC members competed in a wide variety of sports including regatta, track and field, rugby, tennis, swimming, water polo, and rifle shooting. In 1871, KRAC competed at the Yokohama foreign settlement against the Yokohama Boat Club and the Nippon Rowing Club in a regatta event. After this, the sports clubs of Kobe and Yokohama periodically competed at events including regatta, track and field, cricket, and football. These matches continued even after the return of the settlement, with the exception of a period during the Second World War.The KRAC gymnasium was open to non-members as well, and was used not only as KRAC's clubhouse but also as a town hall for the foreign settlement. It was also used as a theater, and was nicknamed the Gymnasium Theater (\u4f53\u80b2\u9928\u5287\u5834, taiikukan gekiba) or settlement theater (\u5c45\u7559\u5730\u5287\u5834, kyory\u016bchi gekiba). More than just a simple sports organization, KRAC deepened friendships among the settlement's foreign residents and engaged in social activities in the community as well.\n\n\n==== Naigaijin Park ====\n\nOn Christmas of 1868, shortly after the opening of the port, a horse race was held at the riding ground in the northeastern portion of the settlement, where the town plan had been delayed. This race set a precedent, and cricket and track-and-field events came to be held in the same spot. Even so, this was to the foreign residents only a temporary opportunity until the town plan was completed, and demand rose for an area to be officially allocated for sports. The residents recalled that the Japanese government had promised the establishment of such a sports ground, so when a large plot of land appeared to the east of the settlement during the reconstruction of the Ikuta River between April 29 and July 26, 1871, a rumor spread among them that this was to become the sports ground.In February 1872, a group of foreign residents staked off a portion of this land in order to claim it. The Japanese government was displeased, but after negotiations, it approved the establishment of a sports ground in November 1874, in the form of a park to be shared by both the settlement's foreign residents and the local Japanese. The costs of its construction and maintenance became the responsibilities of the foreigners themselves, and in this way they were able to obtain a sports area about ten years after the port's opening. The park was completed in May 1877 and named Native\u2013Foreigner Park (\u5185\u5916\u4eba\u516c\u5712, Naigaijin K\u014den).The park's grounds took the form of a lawn. The sight of the foreigners merrily engaged in sports like rugby and tennis likely contributed to the spread of these sports to the surrounding areas. Naigaijin Park was returned to the Japanese government along with the rest of the settlement in 1899, and transferred to the management of the city administration. It was renamed to Kano-ch\u014d Y\u016benchi (\u52a0\u7d0d\u753a\u904a\u5712\u5730), and in 1922 to Higashi Y\u016benchi (\u6771\u904a\u5712\u5730). The park was used for sports games for about 90 years, until 1962, when that function was transferred to the nearby Isogami Park.\n\n\n=== Foreign newspapers ===\n\nThe first foreign-language newspaper published in the Kobe foreign settlement was the Hiogo and Osaka Herald, launched by A. T. Watkins, which released its first issue on January 4, 1868. On April 23 of that year the Herald's typesetter Filomena Braga left the paper to start his own paper, the Hiogo News. After a few years the Herald, undercut by the News's lower subscription price, discontinued its publication.In 1888 A. W. Quinton established the Kobe Herald, and on October 2, 1891, Robert Young started the Kobe Chronicle. The Chronicle occasionally ran editorials by Lafcadio Hearn. After the return of the settlement in 1899, the Kobe Chronicle purchased the Hiogo News (which had been renamed to the Hiogo Evening News), changed its company name to the Japan Chronicle, and expanded beyond Kobe, growing until it recorded the largest number of copies printed of any foreign-language newspaper in the country.The Kobe Herald changed its name in 1926 to the Kobe Herald and Osaka Gazette, but ceased publication shortly thereafter. The Japan Chronicle ceased publication in January 1942.\n\n\n=== Social clubs ===\n\nThere were two social clubs within the Kobe foreign settlement. The first, Club Concordia, was founded by resident Germans in 1868. The club only intended to admit Germans, but in order to cover the costs of their clubhouse on the eastern end of the settlement they began to accept others as well, including Dutch, Norwegians, and Swedes. The Union Club, also called the International Club and later the Kobe Club, was founded in 1869 by British and Americans, but also accepted others including French and Italians. The club moved its base repeatedly between various buildings within the foreign settlement, from Lot 31 to Lot 32 and then to the basement of the Oriental Hotel in Lot 79. After the establishment of the German Empire, Club Concordia's German and non-German members became antagonistic, and many of the non-German members left. Troubled for funds, Club Concordia sold its facilities to the Union Club, and around 1881 moved into the Union Club's previous space in the basement of the Oriental Hotel on Lot 79. The two clubs were friendly until the outbreak of the First World War, and when the Oriental Hotel burned down in 1890 the Union Club allowed Club Concordia to share their facilities. The Union Club (Kobe Club) continued to be active even after the return of the settlement.\n\n\n=== Kantei-by\u014d ===\n\nTo ethnic Chinese, Kantei-by\u014d represented a place to pray for prosperity both in business and in the household, and was a place of spiritual support. Qing Chinese immigrants built two Kantei-by\u014d temples in the mixed residential zone. One was built at Nakayamate-d\u014dri 7-ch\u014dme in 1888 by the powerful local Chinese L\u00e1n Zhu\u014df\u0113ng, Zh\u00e8ng W\u00e0ng\u0101o, and M\u00e0i Sh\u01ceop\u00e9ng, under the auspices of relocating the derelict Jigan-san Ch\u014draku-ji temple from Fuse-mura, Kawachi-gun, Osaka. Ch\u014draku-ji had originally been dedicated to the worship of Eleven-Faced Kannon, but primarily Chinese objects of worship like Guan Di and Tianhou Shengmu were also added along with the move. This Kantei-by\u014d was destroyed in June 1945 by Allied bombs, but was rebuilt in 1947 and equipped with a statue of Guan Di imported from Taiwan. The other Kantei-by\u014d  was likewise built in 1888, in Kano-ch\u014d 2-ch\u014dme, and likewise destroyed in the June 1945 bombing, but unlike the first it was never rebuilt. The Zhonghua Huiguan located in Nakatamate-d\u014dri 6-ch\u014dme also enshrined a statue of Guan Di, and was therefore also referred to as Kantei-by\u014d.The rebuilt Kantei-by\u014d holds an event (suiriku fudo sh\u014de (\u6c34\u9678\u666e\u5ea6\u52dd\u4f1a)) during the Ghost Festival from the 14th to the 16th day of the 7th month of the lunar calendar each year. In October 1997, this festival was designated Municipal Intangible Folk Cultural Property No. 1 of Kobe City.\n\n\n== Medicine ==\nThe resident foreigners viewed the bad condition of their settlement's sanitation as a serious problem from the start. Typhus infections were common, and it was feared that smallpox or cholera might spread as well. In May 1869, the prefecture established a hospital in Ujino-mura (\u5b87\u6cbb\u91ce\u6751) that accepted foreigners in addition to Japanese patients, called Kobe Hospital (\u795e\u6238\u75c5\u9662). But after a little over a year the foreigners, disappointed with the low level of treatment available there, began to feel the need to establish their own self-managed hospital facilities.The foreign residents investigated the possibility of establishing a hospital accepting both foreigners and Japanese, but the prefectural response was not positive, and in February 1871 the foreigners decided to independently establish their own donation-funded international hospital, the International Hospital of Kobe (\u795e\u6238\u4e07\u56fd\u75c5\u9662, K\u014dbe bankoku by\u014din). John Cutting Berry, who became the International Hospital's medical director in July 1872, adopted a policy of examining Japanese patients as well as those from other countries. The hospital was run at first out of a house near Ikuta Shrine, but discontent over the inadequate facilities led to the construction in 1874 of a new hospital building in Yamamoto-d\u014dri 1-ch\u014dme.\n\n\n== Foreign residents ==\n\n\n=== Foreign population ===\nThe population of foreign residents in both the foreign settlement and mixed residential zone was as follows.\n\n\n=== Important foreign residents ===\n\n\n==== Businessmen ====\n\nAlexander Cameron Sim moved to Kobe in 1870, where he worked for the settlement druggist Llewellyn & Co. before establishing Sim & Co. on Lot 18. In addition to distributing Ramune and proposing the foundation of the KRAC, Sim was also known for leading the settlement's internal firefighting force, for which he held lookout from a fire lookout tower in Nishimachi Park near his home. He kept his firefighting clothes, helmet, and axe beside his pillow even when he slept and participated personally in almost every fire-fighting effort during his tenure. After the settlement was returned and the firefighting force incorporated into Kobe's, Sim was left a position as honorary advisor in the new structure and allowed to direct a team. Sim was also the vice chairman of the settlement's Municipal Council, and as the chairman was sick during the ceremony for the return of the settlement, Sim attended in his place and signed the associated documents.\n\nIn 1868 Arthur Hesketh Groom, in the service of Thomas Blake Glover's Glover and Co., came to Kobe to establish a branch office of that company. In 1871, Groom helped establish Mourilyan, Heimann & Co. at Lot 101 of the foreign settlement with his Glover and Co. colleague Heimann, exporting Japanese tea and importing Ceylon tea. In 1895 Groom built a villa on land on the peak of Mount Rokk\u014d borrowed under his son's name. Proceeding to sell off lots on the mountain to other foreigners, he laid the foundation for development on the mountain. Groom was also known as a sportsman, and was involved in the founding of both the Kobe Cricket Club and the Kobe Regatta & Athletic Club. Groom's private four-hole golf course, which he built in 1901 on Mount Rokk\u014d, was the first golf course in Japan. In 1903, after the return of the settlement, this developed into the Kobe Golf Club, with a membership system. Groom also worked as president of the managing company of the Oriental Hotel from 1897 to 1916.Edward Charles Kirby established Kirby and Co. immediately after the opening of the port, importing machinery as well as various goods and sundries. In 1869, Kirby and two Englishmen established Onohama Iron Works, which Kirby then took control of as Onohama Shipyards. Onohama Shipyards made a large contribution to Kobe's shipbuilding industry. In 1882 it produced Japan's first iron steamboat, the Dai-ichi Taiko Maru (\u7b2c\u4e00\u592a\u6e56\u4e38) (a train ferry over Lake Biwa). However, it fell into management difficulties, and in 1884 Kirby committed suicide.\n\nEdward Hazlett Hunter, a previous employee of Kirby and Co., left that company to establish his own trading business, Hunter and Co., at No. 29 in 1874. In 1879, he gained the cooperation of the lumber dealer Kadota Sabur\u014dbee to found Osaka Iron Works (the future Hitachi Zosen Corporation) at the mouth of the Abe River in Osaka and thereby expand into shipbuilding. Hunter succeeded in building a wooden dry dock in 1883, when the project was considered quite difficult with contemporary technology, and successfully transformed Osaka Iron Works into a leading shipbuilder of the Kansai region. Hunter's diversified management put his enterprise on a strong track. When the effects of the Japanese government's deflation measures drove Osaka Iron Works into dire straits in 1882, his company was able to endure the crisis with profits from exporting polished rice. At this time, Hunter exported over 10,000 tons of rice a year, and Kobe rice set the price standard on London's grain market. In his later years, Hunter trusted his business to his son Ryutaro Hunter, who worked hard to deepen cultural exchange between foreigners and Japanese, including by gathering votes for the amendment of the unequal treaties from the foreign residents.The Walsh Brothers, Thomas and John, moved to Kobe as soon as the port opened and established a branch of their trading business Walsh and Co. (later Walsh, Hall, and Co.). Walsh, Hall, and Co. purchased cotton, which was at the time used in the West to make paper, in Japan and then sold it abroad. They then used quicklime to harden the cotton before exporting it, but the traces of lime in the cotton afterwards would heat up when exposed to water, in a chemical reaction that frequently caused fires. Walsh, Hall, and Co. then switched to exporting the cotton as pulp, which brought in great profits. The Walsh Brothers also established the Kobe Paper Mill (the future Mitsubishi Paper Mills) in Sannomiya, thereby extending their reach into paper production as well.\n\n\n==== Writers ====\n\nLafcadio Hearn stayed in the Kobe foreign settlement from 1894 to 1896. He found employment at the Kobe Chronicle newspaper through an introduction by Basil Hall Chamberlain, and for four months published critical essays in its editorial section. It was in Kobe that Hearn made his decision to become a naturalized Japanese. In 1896, Hearn left Kobe to become a professor at the University of Tokyo.Wenceslau de Moraes was appointed as the first vice consul of the Portuguese consulate in the settlement, was quickly promoted to consul, and remained in Kobe until 1913. Beginning in 1901, Moraes published essays about Japan in the Portuguese newspaper Com\u00e9rcio do Porto.\n\n\n==== Christian missionaries ====\n\nThe Christian missionaries who visited the Kobe foreign settlement engaged not only in proselytizing, but also in the fields of education, medicine, and social service.\nIn the fall of 1886, the Southern Methodist missionaries James William Lambuth and Walter Russell Lambuth opened a school they called the Palmore Institute out of their home at No. 47. There they hosted lectures on English and the Bible. The Palmore Institute developed into a vocational school teaching English conversation, and its women's department became the Keimei Gakuin middle and high school. James Lambuth was further involved in the founding of the Hiroshima Girls' School (forerunner of Hiroshima Jogakuin University) Nursery School Teacher Training Department (one of the forerunners of Seiwa College), and in 1889 Walter Lambuth established Kwansei Gakuin University. James's wife, Mary Isabella Lambuth, is known for establishing the Kobe Ladies\u2019 School (\u795e\u6238\u5a66\u4eba\u4f1d\u9053\u5b66\u6821) (one of the forerunners of Seiwa College) in 1888.\n\nTwo female missionaries of the American Board, Eliza Talcott and Julia Dudley, called Kobe Home (later Kobe College), at the base of Mt. Suwa in 1875 in order to improve education for girls. In 1880, Dudley established Kobe Girls' School (\u795e\u6238\u5973\u5b50\u4f1d\u9053\u5b66\u6821) (one of the forerunners of Seiwa College).John Cutting Berry, another missionary of the American Board, directed not only the International Hospital of Kobe but also Kobe Hospital, and was energetic in his medical practice in Kobe, Himeji, and Sanda. In January 1873, Berry conducted the first human dissection in the prefecture at Kobe Hospital. He visited Kobe's prison in 1877, on the prefecture's request, in response to an outbreak of beriberi within, and saw with his own eyes the unsanitary conditions and inhumane treatment of prisoners there. He pushed the prefecture to reform its prison system, and many other missionaries followed him in visiting the prisons and presenting plans to the government for their reform.The nun Philomena Valentine Antonine looked after orphans at the girls' school on Lot 41 beginning around 1890. She continued this work until after the conclusion of the Pacific War, and over the course of her life helped several hundred children.\n\n\n=== Foreign cemetery ===\n\nA cemetery for foreign residents was first provided by the Tokugawa shogunate at Onohama Shinden (now Kobe City, Ch\u016bo-ku, Hamabe-d\u014dri, 6-ch\u014dme) The cemetery was managed by the Executive Committee of the Municipal Council, and by the city of Kobe after the return of the settlement.In 1899, after the return of the settlement, Kobe City established an additional cemetery at Kasugano, Fukiai-mura (now Nada-ku Kagoike-d\u014dri 4-ch\u014dme) because the original had filled up. In time, though, this cemetery became saturated as well, and the city began building yet another at Mt. Futatabi in Ch\u016b\u014d-ku. This new graveyard, Kobe Municipal Foreign Cemetery, was completed in 1952 after construction was interrupted during World War II. All the graves at Onohama were moved to the new location in the same year, and in 1961 those at Kasugano were relocated there as well.\n\n\n== Influence on surrounding area ==\nThe Kobe foreign settlement prospered as a foothold of trade and gateway to Western culture, imparting economic and cultural effects on its surroundings as well.Before the port opened, the local center of trade had been Hy\u014dgo Bay, around which a town had formed. After the opening of the port, the area around the foreign settlement became an economic powerhouse, leading to the construction of a new town around it. Beginning in 1890, the town around the foreign settlement and that around the old port met and joined into one contiguous town area. The port finally opened at Hy\u014dgo was not in fact the originally active one but rather somewhat removed, on the coast at K\u014dbe-mura; in 1892 an Imperial edict deemed this the Port of Kobe, and in that same year its area was increased to incorporate the old port of Hy\u014dgo as well.Some of the earliest effects were felt in the area of food. Japanese-run establishments began serving beef as early as 1869, butcher shops emerged shortly after, and from then on Japanese people made their livings working with beef. The drinking of milk and eating of bread spread around the same time. Beginning in 1873, Hy\u014dgo Prefecture promoted the construction of Western-style architecture in the town area near the settlement, and after the return of the settlement the building of Western-style designs proceeded well. The sight of the resident foreigners enjoying sports like tennis and rugby inspired the locals to take them up as well. The number of local Christians increased. Shibata Takenaka, who was involved with the construction of the settlement, advocated the construction of a red light district for foreigners on the grounds that \"the opening of the port will bring warships and merchant boats, and sailors and others will come and go; without brothels available the situation will be out of control.\" The Fukuhara red light district was therefore built in 1868 at the mouth of the Uji River, the outskirts of the mixed residential zone. In 1870, it was moved east of the banks of the Minato River, north of the Saigoku Kaid\u014d highway, and its new location was called Shin-Fukuhara. Fukuhara's brothels embraced the presence of their foreign clients, and some of its buildings mixed Eastern and Western styles.The presence of the foreign settlement gave Kobe a modern, stylish, and exotic atmosphere, with a rich spirit of venture, and an accepting attitude towards foreigners. Meanwhile, in the mixed residential zone, Japanese lived side by side with foreigners and interacted with them in their ordinary lives, which helped to mold Kobe into a multiethnic and multicultural city.\n\n\n== Comparison with other foreign settlements ==\nIn terms of land area, the foreign settlement at Kobe was third in the country, after Nagasaki and Yokohama, with about \u200b1\u20447 the area of the Yokohama settlement and \u200b1\u20442 that of the Nagasaki settlement. Strictly speaking, though, Yokohama was an aggregation of two separate settlements, and Nagasaki of eight. Each of the divisions at Yokohama was itself larger than the whole Kobe settlement, but even the largest at Nagasaki was smaller. The area of the mixed residential zone at Kobe was third in the country after Yokohama and Tsukiji.The settlement at Kobe was larger than the associated mixed residential zone, but at Tsukiji and Hakodate this was not the case. Tsukiji was overshadowed by the nearby Yokohama settlement, where foreign merchants preferred to reside, and its residential area was nearer to the workplaces of some foreign officials and government advisers. At Hakodate, conditions on the land of the settlement itself were so poor that foreigners preferred to reside outside it in the mixed residential zone.In terms of foreign population, the larger Yokohama settlement had 4,946 residents in 1893, while Nagasaki had 938 around 1868 and 1,711 on its return to Japan in 1899. Tsukiji, the next largest settlement after Kobe by area, and possessed of a larger mixed residential zone, nevertheless had only 72 official residents in September 1871 and 97 in 1877 due to the prevalence of illegal residency outside the allowed area.\nKobe and Yokohama both developed as windows to the outside world during the Meiji period. However, Kobe generally enjoyed smoother relations between Japanese and foreigners, while relations in Yokohama were much rockier, suffering from tumultuous boycotts of transactions with foreigners over unfair business practices on a near-yearly basis. One reason for this difference may have been the advantage of experience granted by Kobe's late start. Kobe's port opened eight years after Yokohama's, during which period the worst of the foreign merchants were weeded out and each side was able to deepen its understanding of the other.There was another similarity between the two ports. As discussed, the shogunate ultimately opened the port of Kobe, rather than that of Hy\u014dgo as was suggested by the Ansei Treaties. The port at Yokohama, similarly, was opened at the then-destitute Yokohama-mura rather than the bustling Kanagawa-juku. In Hy\u014dgo's case the change caused little incident, but in the case of Kanagawa the shogunate proceeded with preparations to open the port at Yokohama over the strong objections of the foreign powers. In the end, the foreign powers ratified the opening of Yokohama when the depth of the water there proved it a geographically superior location for a port compared to Kanagawa.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nKat\u014d, Masahiro (2005).

        "wiki": "Kobe ( KOH-bee, -\u2060bay; Japanese: [ko\ua71c\u02d0be]; officially \u795e\u6238\u5e02, K\u014dbe-shi) is the seventh-largest city in Japan and the capital city of Hy\u014dgo Prefecture. It is located on the southern side of the main island of Honsh\u016b, on the north shore of Osaka Bay and about 30 km (19 mi) west of Osaka. With a population around 1.5 million, the city is part of the Keihanshin metropolitan area along with Osaka and Kyoto.The earliest written records regarding the region come from the Nihon Shoki, which describes the founding of the Ikuta Shrine by Empress Jing\u016b in AD 201. For most of its history, the area was never a single political entity, even during the Tokugawa period, when the port was controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate. Kobe did not exist in its current form until its founding in 1889. Its name comes from Kanbe (\u795e\u6238, an archaic title for supporters of the city's Ikuta Shrine).  Kobe became one of Japan's designated cities in 1956.\nKobe was one of the cities to open for trade with the West following the 1853 end of the policy of seclusion and has since been known as a cosmopolitan and nuclear-free zone port city. While the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake diminished much of Kobe's prominence as a port city, it remains Japan's fourth-busiest container port.  Companies headquartered in Kobe include ASICS, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and Kobe Steel, as well as over 100 international corporations with Asian or Japanese headquarters in the city, such as Eli Lilly and Company, Procter & Gamble, Boehringer Ingelheim, and Nestl\u00e9. The city is the point of origin and namesake of Kobe beef, as well as the site of one of Japan's most famous hot spring resorts, Arima Onsen.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n Media related to History of Kobe at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n=== Origins to the Meiji era ===\nTools found in western Kobe demonstrate the area was populated at least from the J\u014dmon period. The natural geography of the area, particularly of Wada Cape in Hy\u014dgo-ku, led to the development of a port, which would remain the economic center of the city. Some of the earliest written documents mentioning the region include the Nihon Shoki, which describes the founding of the Ikuta Shrine by Empress Jing\u016b in AD 201.During the Nara and Heian periods, the port was known by the name \u014cwada Anchorage (\u014cwada-no-tomari) and was one of the ports from which imperial embassies to China were dispatched.  The city was briefly the capital of Japan in 1180, when Taira no Kiyomori moved his grandson Emperor Antoku to Fukuhara in present-day Hy\u014dgo-ku. The Emperor returned to Kyoto after about five months. Shortly thereafter in 1184, the Taira fortress in Hy\u014dgo-ku and the nearby Ikuta Shrine became the sites of the Genpei War battle of Ichi-no-Tani between the Taira and Minamoto clans. The Minamoto prevailed, pushing the Taira further.\nAs the port grew during the Kamakura period, it became an important hub for trade with China and other countries. In the 13th century, the city came to be known by the name Hy\u014dgo Port (\u5175\u5eab\u6d25, Hy\u014dgo-tsu). During this time, Hy\u014dgo Port, along with northern Osaka, composed the province of Settsu (most of today's Kobe belonged to Settsu except Nishi Ward and Tarumi Ward, which belonged to Harima).\nLater, during the Edo period, the eastern parts of present-day Kobe came under the jurisdiction of the Amagasaki Domain and the western parts under that of the Akashi Domain, while the center was controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate. It was not until the abolition of the han system in 1871 and the establishment of the current prefecture system that the area became politically distinct.\nHy\u014dgo Port was opened to foreign trade by the Shogunal government at the same time as Osaka on January 1, 1868, just before the advent of the Boshin War and the Meiji Restoration. The region has since been identified with the West and many foreign residences from the period remain in Kobe's Kitano area.\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\nKobe, as it is known today, was founded on April 1, 1889, and was designated on September 1, 1956 by government ordinance. The history of the city is closely tied to that of the Ikuta Shrine, and the name \"Kobe\" derives from kamube (\u795e\u6238, later kanbe), an archaic name for those who supported the shrine.During World War II, Kobe was bombed in the Doolittle Raid on April 18, 1942, along with Tokyo and a few other cities. Eventually, it was bombed again with incendiary bombs by B-29 bombers on March 17, 1945, causing the death of 8,841 residents and destroying 21% of Kobe's urban area. This incident inspired the well-known Studio Ghibli film Grave of the Fireflies and the book by Akiyuki Nosaka on which the film was based. It also features in the motion picture A Boy Called H.\nFollowing continuous pressure from citizens, on March 18, 1975, the Kobe City Council passed an ordinance banning vessels carrying nuclear weapons from Kobe Port. This effectively prevented any U.S. warships from entering the port, policy being not to disclose whether any warship is carrying nuclear weapons. This nonproliferation policy has been termed the \"Kobe formula\".On January 17, 1995, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake occurred at 5:46 am JST near the city. About 6,434 people in the city were killed, 212,443 were made homeless, and large parts of the port facilities and other parts of the city were destroyed. The earthquake destroyed portions of the Hanshin Expressway, an elevated freeway that dramatically toppled over. In Japan, the earthquake is known as the Great Hanshin earthquake (or the Hanshin-Awaji earthquake). To commemorate Kobe's recovery from the 1995 quake, the city holds an event every December called the Luminarie, where the city center is decorated with illuminated metal archways.\nThe Port of Kobe was Japan's busiest port and one of Asia's top ports until the Great Hanshin earthquake. Kobe has since dropped to fourth in Japan and 49th-busiest container port worldwide (as of 2012).\n\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nWedged between the coast and the mountains, the city of Kobe is long and narrow. To the east is the city of Ashiya, while the city of Akashi lies to its west. Other adjacent cities include Takarazuka and Nishinomiya to the east and Sanda and Miki to the north.\nThe landmark of the port area is the red steel Port Tower. A Ferris wheel sits in nearby Harborland, a notable tourist promenade. Two artificial islands, Port Island and Rokk\u014d Island, have been constructed to give the city room to expand.\nAway from the seaside at the heart of Kobe lie the Motomachi and Sannomiya districts, as well as Kobe's Chinatown, Nankinmachi, all well-known retail areas. A multitude of train lines cross the city from east to west. The main transport hub is Sannomiya Station, with the eponymous Kobe Station located to the west and the Shinkansen Shin-Kobe Station to the north.\nMount Rokk\u014d overlooks Kobe at an elevation of 931 meters. During the autumn season, it is famous for the rich change in colors of its forests.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\nKobe has nine wards (ku):\n\nNishi-ku: The westernmost area of Kobe, Nishi-ku overlooks the city of Akashi and is the site of Kobe Gakuin University. This ward has the largest population, with 247,000 residents.\nKita-ku: Kita-ku is the largest ward by area and contains the Rokko Mountain Range, including Mount Rokk\u014d and Mount Maya. The area is well known for its rugged landscape and hiking trails. The onsen resort town of Arima also lies within Kita-ku.\nTarumi-ku: Tarumi-ku is a mostly residential area. The longest suspension bridge in the world, the Akashi Kaiky\u014d Bridge, extends from Maiko in Tarumi-ku to Awaji Island to the south. A relatively new addition to Kobe, Tarumi-ku was not a part of the city until 1946.\nSuma-ku: Suma-ku is the site of Suma beach, attracting visitors during the summer months.\nNagata-ku: Nagata-ku is the site of Nagata Shrine, one of the three \"Great Shrines\" in Kobe.\nHy\u014dgo-ku: At various times known as \u014cwada Anchorage or Hy\u014dgo Port, this area is the historical heart of the city. Shinkaichi in Hyogo-ku was once the commercial center of Kobe, but was heavily damaged during World War II, and since, Hyogo-ku has lost much of its former prominence.\nCh\u016b\u014d-ku: Ch\u016b\u014d (\u4e2d\u592e) literally means \"center\" and, as such, Ch\u016b\u014d-ku is the commercial and entertainment center of Kobe. Sannomiya, Motomachi and Harborland make up the main entertainment areas in Kobe. Ch\u016b\u014d-ku includes the city hall and Hy\u014dgo prefectural government offices. Port Island and Kobe Airport lie in the southern part of this ward.\nNada-ku: The site of Oji Zoo and Kobe University, Nada is known for its sake. Along with Fushimi in Kyoto, it accounts for 45% of Japan's sake production.\nHigashinada-ku: The easternmost area of Kobe, Higashinada-ku borders the city of Ashiya. The man-made island of Rokko makes up the southern part of this ward.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Climate ==\nKobe has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa) with hot summers and cool to cold winters.

        "wiki": "Chiune Sugihara (\u6749\u539f \u5343\u755d, Sugihara Chiune, 1 January 1900 \u2013 31 July 1986) was a Japanese diplomat who served as vice-consul for the Japanese Empire in Kaunas, Lithuania. During the Second World War, Sugihara helped about 6,000 Jews flee Europe by issuing transit visas to them so that they could travel through Japanese territory, risking his job and the lives of his family. The fleeing Jews were refugees from German-occupied Western Poland and Soviet-occupied Eastern Poland, as well as residents of Lithuania. In 1985, the State of Israel honored Sugihara as one of the Righteous Among the Nations (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05e1\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd) for his actions. He is the only Japanese national to have been so honored. The year 2020 is \"The Year of Chiune Sugihara\" in Lithuania. It has been estimated as many as 100,000 people alive today are the descendants of the recipients of Sugihara visas.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nChiune Sugihara was born on 1 January 1900 (Meiji 33), in Mino, Gifu prefecture, to a middle-class father, Yoshimi Sugihara (\u6749\u539f\u597d\u6c34 Sugihara Yoshimi), and an upper-middle class mother, Yatsu Sugihara (\u6749\u539f\u3084\u3064 Sugihara Yatsu). When he was born, his father worked at a tax office in Kozuchi-town and his family lived in a borrowed temple, with the Buddhist temple Ky\u014dsen-ji (\u6559\u6cc9\u5bfa) where he was born nearby. He was the second son among five boys and one girl. His father and family moved into the tax office within the branch of the Nagoya Tax Administration Office one after another. In 1903 (Meiji 36) his family moved to Asahi Village in Niu-gun, Fukui Prefecture. In 1904 (Meiji 37) they moved to Yokkaichi city Mie Prefecture. On 25 October 1905 (Meiji 38), they moved to Nakatsu Town, Ena-gun, Gifu Prefecture. In 1906 (Meiji 39) on 2 April, Chiune entered Nakatsu Town Municipal Elementary School (now Nakatsugawa City Minami Elementary School in Gifu Prefecture). On 31 March 1907 (Meiji 40), he transferred to Kuwana Municipal Kuwana Elementary School in Mie Prefecture (currently Kuwana Municipal Nissin Elementary School). In December of that same year, he transferred to Nagoya Municipal Furuwatari Elementary School (now Nagoya Municipal Heiwa Elementary School). In 1912, he graduated with top honors from Furuwatari Elementary School and entered Aichi prefectural 5th secondary school (now Zuiryo high school), a combined junior and senior high school. His father wanted him to become a physician, but Chiune deliberately failed the entrance exam by writing only his name on the exam papers. Instead, he entered Waseda University in 1918 (Taish\u014d 7) and majored in English language. At that time, he entered Yuai Gakusha, the Christian fraternity that had been founded by Baptist pastor Harry Baxter Benninhof, to improve his English.\nIn 1919 (Taish\u014d 8), he passed the Foreign Ministry Scholarship exam. From 1920 to 1922 (Taish\u014d 9 to 11), Sugihara served in the Imperial Army as a second lieutenant with the 79th Infantry, stationed in Korea, then a Japanese colony. He resigned his commission in November 1922 and took the Foreign Ministry's language qualifying exams the following year, passing the Russian exam with distinction. The Japanese Foreign Ministry recruited him and assigned him to Harbin, China, where he also studied the Russian and German languages and later became an expert on Russian affairs.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Manchurian Foreign Office ==\nWhen Sugihara served in the Manchurian Foreign Office, he took part in the negotiations with the Soviet Union concerning the Northern Manchurian Railroad.\nDuring his time in Harbin, Sugihara married Klaudia Semionovna Apollonova and converted to Christianity (Russian Orthodox Church), using the baptismal name Sergei Pavlovich.In 1935, Sugihara quit his post as Deputy Foreign Minister in Manchuria in protest over Japanese mistreatment of the local Chinese.Sugihara and his wife divorced in 1935, before he returned to Japan, where he married Yukiko (1913\u20132008, n\u00e9e Kikuchi) after the marriage; they had four sons (Hiroki, Chiaki, Haruki, Nobuki). As of 2010, Nobuki is their only surviving son and represents the Chiune Sugihara family. Chiune Sugihara also served in the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and as a translator for the Japanese delegation in Helsinki, Finland.\n\n\n== Lithuania ==\n\nIn 1939, Sugihara became a vice-consul of the Japanese Consulate in Kaunas, Lithuania. His duties included reporting on Soviet and German troop movements, and to find out if Germany planned an attack on the Soviets and, if so, to report the details of this attack to his superiors in Berlin and Tokyo.Sugihara had cooperated with Polish intelligence as part of a bigger Japanese\u2013Polish cooperative plan.\n\n\n=== Jewish refugees ===\nAs the Soviet Union occupied sovereign Lithuania in 1940, many Jewish refugees from Poland (Polish Jews) as well as Lithuanian Jews tried to acquire exit visas. Without the visas, it was dangerous to travel, yet it was impossible to find countries willing to issue them. Hundreds of refugees came to the Japanese consulate in Kaunas, trying to get a visa to Japan. At the time, on the brink of the war, Lithuanian Jews made up one third of Lithuania's urban population and half of the residents of every town as well. In the period between 16 July and 3 August 1940 the Dutch Honorary Consul Jan Zwartendijk provided over 2,200 Jews with an official third destination to Cura\u00e7ao, a Caribbean island and Dutch colony that required no entry visa, or Surinam (which, upon independence in 1975, became Suriname). \nEuropean Jewish refugees began to arrive in Japan in July 1940 and departed by September 1941. An overview during this period is described in the Annual Report of 1940 and 1941 by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC).\nIn June 1940, Italy entered into the war and the Mediterranean route was closed. \"The Committee in Great Germany, forced to seek new outlets for emigration, arranged for the transportation of Jews from Germany across Europe and Asia (via the trans-Siberian railway) to Vladivostok, thence to Japan. From Japan the refugees were to embark for countries in the Western Hemisphere\". \"On December 31, 1940, Soviet Union declared giving all persons residing in Lithuania on September 1, 1940 the right to apply for Soviet citizenship. While the great bulk of Polish refugees in Lithuania opted for Soviet citizenship, there was a group of 4,000\u20135,000 persons for whom the New Order offered little opportunity. These were principally rabbis, yeshiva students, members of the intellectual classes and leaders of various Jewish communal and labor organizations. They immediately applied for exit permits from Lithuania. Although during the early weeks of 1941 exit permits and Japanese transit visas were readily granted, the problem was how to find transportation costs for those people whose very existences were jeopardized if they remained in Lithuania. The JDC in collaboration with a number of other American Jewish groups, contributed toward the funds required for the trans-Siberian trip to Japan of 1,700 persons\".\nIn July 1940, Jewish refugees in Germany and other countries began arriving at Tsuruga, Shimonoseki and Kobe. Japanese embassies and consulates except Kaunas issued 3,448 Japanese transit visas from January 1940 to mid-March 1941. Most of them held valid end-visas and immediately departed Japan. From October 1940, Polish refugees from Lithuania began to land on Tsuruga. Their number increased sharply from January 1941. \"By the end of March there were close to 2,000 in the country, mostly in Kobe. More than half of these refugees did not hold valid end-visas and were unable to proceed further than Japan\". They were forced to stay for a long time to find the immigration countries.\n\nThe number of Jewish refugees who came to Japan, as shown in Table 1, has documents with 4,500, 5,000 or 6,000. 552 persons of the second row of the table, are not match the number of departing persons edited by Jewcom. Siberian railway had been closed and no evidence supporting this figure is found in JDC annual reports or MOFA documents. For 200 persons described in note 1 of Table 1, there is a document in Archives of MOFA that the Japanese consulate of Vladivostok transferred about 50 Jewish refugees who had stranded in Vladivostok to Shanghai with Soviet Union cargo on April 26, 1941.\n\n\n==== Sugihara's visas ====\nAt the time, the Japanese government required that visas be issued only to those who had gone through appropriate immigration procedures and had enough funds. Most of the refugees did not fulfill these criteria. Sugihara dutifully contacted the Japanese Foreign Ministry three times for instructions. Each time, the Ministry responded that anybody granted a visa should have a visa to a third destination to exit Japan, with no exceptions.From 18 July to 28 August 1940, aware that applicants were in danger if they stayed behind, Sugihara decided to ignore his orders and issued ten-day visas to Jews for transit through Japan. Given his inferior post and the culture of the Japanese Foreign Service bureaucracy, this was an unusual act of disobedience. He spoke to Soviet officials who agreed to let the Jews travel through the country via the Trans-Siberian Railway at five times the standard ticket price.\n\nSugihara continued to hand-write visas, reportedly spending 18 to 20 hours a day on them, producing a normal month's worth of visas each day, until 4 September, when he had to leave his post before the consulate was closed. By that time he had granted thousands of visas to Jews, many of whom were heads of households and thus permitted to take their families with them. It is claimed that before he left, he handed the official consulate stamp to a refugee so that more visas could be forged. His son, Nobuki Sugihara, adamantly insisted in an interview with Ann Curry that his father never gave the stamp to anyone. According to witnesses, he was still writing visas while in transit from his hotel and after boarding the train at the Kaunas Railway Station, throwing visas into the crowd of desperate refugees out of the train's window even as the train pulled out.\n\nIn final desperation, blank sheets of paper with only the consulate seal and his signature (that could be later written over into a visa) were hurriedly prepared and flung out from the train. As he prepared to depart, he said, \"Please forgive me. I cannot write anymore. I wish you the best.\" When he bowed deeply to the people before him, someone exclaimed, \"Sugihara. We'll never forget you. I'll surely see you again!\"Sugihara himself wondered about official reaction to the thousands of visas he issued. Many years later, he recalled, \"No one ever said anything about it. I remember thinking that they probably didn't realize how many I actually issued.\"\n\n\n==== Numbers saved ====\nConcerning the number of refugees passing through Japan who held Japanese transit visas for Curacao issued by Sugihara (so-called \u201cSugihara visa\u201d), there are two documents saying 2,200 and 6,000. 6,000 persons written in \"Visas for Life\" was hearsay. K. Watanabe argued that there could be 6,000 for the reason that to use by three families per visa is reasonable, that there were newspaper articles with 6,000, and that most of the refugees landing on Tsuruga were now admitted to have a Sugihara visa. On September 29, 1983, Fuji Television aired \"One visa that divided the fate-the Japanese who saved 4,500 Jews\". In 1985 when Chiune Sugihara received \"Righteous among the Nations\", some Japanese newspapers reported that he saved 6,000 persons and others 4,500. The Japan Times, dated January 19, 1985, headlined \"Japanese Man honored for saving 6,000 Jews\", and reported \"Sugihara defied orders from Tokyo and issued transit visas to nearly 6,000 Jews\". Chiune Sugihara passed away in July 1986. US newspapers referred to Sugihara as \"a diplomat who defied his government's orders and issued a transit visas for 6,000 Jews\".\nTable 2 shows the number of refugees who had stayed at Kobe in 1941 based on Archives of MOFA. Refugees classified as \"No visa\" in table are presumed to have held fakes of Japanese transit visas issued by Sugihara. The Soviets wanted to purge Polish refugees who had been stranded in Soviet territory with Japanese transit visas as soon as possible, and so permitted them to get on the train to Vladivostok with or without a destination visa. The Japanese government was forced to admit the entry of them. On April 8, 1941, of the 1,400 Polish Jews staying at Kobe, \"for Cura\u00e7ao\" and \"No visa\" were about 1,300.\n\nThe Polish ambassador in Tokyo, Tadeusz Romer, remembered, \"They (Polish refugees) only had fictitious Dutch visas for the island of Cura\u00e7ao and Japanese transit visas\". According to the refugee name list surveyed by Fukui Prefecture, of the 306 persons who landed at Tsuruga Port on October 1940, there were 203 Poles. Their destinations were US 89, Palestine 46, Cura\u00e7ao 24, and others. It is estimated that about 80% of them were on the Sugihara visa list. The documents of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and \"Refugee and Survivor\" do not mention the number of people saved by \"Sugihara visa\".\nMore than half of the refugees who entered with invalid visas including \"Sugihara visa\" obtained valid visas with the help of JDC, HIAS, the Embassy of Poland and Japanese government, and embarked host countries. In August\u2013September 1941, Japanese authorities transferred about 850 refugees stranded in Japan to Shanghai before Japan and the United States began war. According to Emigration Table by Jewcom, the number of Polish refugees leaving Japan was Shanghai 860, US 532, Canada 186, Palestine 186, Australia 81, South Africa 59, and others 207 in total 2,111.\nThe total number of Jews saved by Sugihara is in dispute, estimating about 6,000; family visas\u2014which allowed several people to travel on one visa\u2014were also issued, which would account for the much higher figure. The Simon Wiesenthal Center has estimated that Chiune Sugihara issued transit visas for about 6,000 Jews and that around 40,000 descendants of the Jewish refugees are alive today because of his actions. Polish intelligence produced some false visas. Sugihara's widow and eldest son estimate that he saved 10,000 Jews from certain death, whereas Boston University professor and author, Hillel Levine, also estimates that he helped \"as many as 10,000 people\", but that far fewer people ultimately survived. Indeed, some Jews who received Sugihara's visas failed to leave Lithuania in time, were later captured by the Germans who invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, and perished in the Holocaust.\n\nThe Diplomatic Record Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has opened to the public two documents concerning Sugihara's file: the first aforementioned document is a 5 February 1941 diplomatic note from Chiune Sugihara to Japan's then Foreign Minister Y\u014dsuke Matsuoka in which Sugihara stated he issued 1,500 out of 2,139 transit visas to Jews and Poles; however, since most of the 2,139 people were not Jewish, this would imply that most of the visas were given to Polish Jews instead. Levine then notes that another document from the same foreign office file \"indicates an additional 3,448 visas were issued in Kaunas for a total of 5,580 visas\" which were likely given to Jews desperate to flee Lithuania for safety in Japan or Japanese occupied-China.\nMany refugees used their visas to travel across the Soviet Union to Vladivostok and then by boat to Kobe, Japan, where there was a Jewish community. Romer, the Polish ambassador in Tokyo, organized help for them. From August 1940 to November 1941, he had managed to get transit visas in Japan, asylum visas to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Burma, immigration certificates to the British Mandate of Palestine, and immigrant visas to the United States and some Latin American countries for more than two thousand Polish-Lithuanian Jewish refugees, who arrived in Kobe, Japan, and the Shanghai Ghetto, China.\nThe remaining number of Sugihara survivors stayed in Japan until they were deported to Japanese-held Shanghai, where there was already a large Jewish community that had existed as early as the mid-1930s. Some took the route through Korea directly to Shanghai without passing through Japan. A group of thirty people, all possessing a visa of \"Jakub Goldberg\", were shuttled back and forth on the open sea for several weeks before finally being allowed to pass through Tsuruga. Most of the around 20,000 Jews survived the Holocaust in the Shanghai ghetto until the Japanese surrender in 1945, three to four months following the collapse of the Third Reich itself.\n\n\n== Resignation ==\nSugihara was reassigned to K\u00f6nigsberg, East Prussia before serving as a Consul General in Prague, Czechoslovakia, from March 1941 to late 1942 and in the legation in Bucharest, Romania from 1942 to 1944. He was promoted to the rank of third secretary in 1943, and was decorated with the Order of the Sacred Treasure, 5th Class, in 1944. When Soviet troops entered Romania, they imprisoned Sugihara and his family in a POW camp for eighteen months. They were released in 1946 and returned to Japan through the Soviet Union via the Trans-Siberian railroad and Nakhodka port. In 1947, the Japanese foreign office asked him to resign, nominally due to downsizing. Some sources, including his wife Yukiko Sugihara, have said that the Foreign Ministry told Sugihara he was dismissed because of \"that incident\" in Lithuania.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nSugihara settled in Fujisawa in Kanagawa prefecture with his wife and three sons. To support his family he took a series of menial jobs, at one point selling light bulbs door to door. He suffered a personal tragedy in 1947 when his youngest son, Haruki, died at the age of seven, shortly after their return to Japan. In 1949 they had one more son, Nobuki, who is the last son alive representing the Chiune Sugihara Family, residing in Belgium. He later began to work for an export company as general manager of U.S. Military Post Exchange. Utilizing his command of the Russian language, Sugihara went on to work and live a low-key existence in the Soviet Union for sixteen years, while his family stayed in Japan.\n\nIn 1968, Yehoshua (alternatively spelled Jehoshua or Joshua) Nishri, an economic attach\u00e9 to the Israeli Embassy in Tokyo and one of the Sugihara beneficiaries, finally located and contacted him. Nishri had been a Polish teen in the 1940s. The next year Sugihara visited Israel and was greeted by the Israeli government. Sugihara beneficiaries began to lobby for his recognition by Yad Vashem. In 1984, Yad Vashem recognised him as Righteous Among the Nations (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05e1\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd\u200e, translit. Khasidei Umot ha-Olam). Sugihara was too ill to travel to Israel, so his wife and youngest son Nobuki accepted the honor on his behalf.\nIn 1985, 45 years after the Soviet invasion of Lithuania, he was asked his reasons for issuing visas to the Jews. Sugihara explained that the refugees were human beings, and that they simply needed help.\n\nYou want to know about my motivation, don't you? Well. It is the kind of sentiments anyone would have when he actually sees refugees face to face, begging with tears in their eyes. He just cannot help but sympathize with them. Among the refugees were the elderly and women. They were so desperate that they went so far as to kiss my shoes, Yes, I actually witnessed such scenes with my own eyes. Also, I felt at that time, that the Japanese government did not have any uniform opinion in Tokyo. Some Japanese military leaders were just scared because of the pressure from the Nazis; while other officials in the Home Ministry were simply ambivalent.\nPeople in Tokyo were not united. I felt it silly to deal with them. So, I made up my mind not to wait for their reply. I knew that somebody would surely complain about me in the future. But, I myself thought this would be the right thing to do. There is nothing wrong in saving many people's lives...The spirit of humanity, philanthropy...neighborly friendship...with this spirit, I ventured to do what I did, confronting this most difficult situation \u2013 and because of this reason, I went ahead with redoubled courage. \nWhen asked by Moshe Zupnik why he risked his career to save other people, he said simply: \"I do it just because I have pity on the people. They want to get out so I let them have the visas.\" \nSugihara died the following year at a hospital in Kamakura, on 31 July 1986. Despite the publicity given him in Israel and other nations, he remained virtually unknown in his home country. Only when a large Jewish delegation from around the world, including the Israeli ambassador to Japan, attended his funeral, did his neighbors find out what he had done. His subsequent considerable posthumous acclaim contrasts with the obscurity in which he lived following the loss of his diplomatic career.\n\n\n== Family ==\n\nYukiko Sugihara (1914\u20132008) \u2013 wife.

          "This is a neat place to stop to get a bird's eye view of the city. You can see the mountains and the port including Harbourland. There are two restaurants on the 24th floor so if you want to sit and have a great view, this is the place.",
          "The observation deck is open to the public and closes at 10 p.m., so you are able to go up and see the Kobe mountain and harbor views. There are also displays of: sister city and sister port gifts; photos of Luminarie, the annual light festival that takes place in early",
          "Kobe City Hall is well worth a visit. In fact it's the first thing is advise a visitor to do in Kobe because not only are the views from the observation deck absolutely jaw dropping, they give you are great orientation to the city layout and made it so much easier to find",
          "Free elevator to see Kobe. Good signage to identify points of interest. Take 15-20 minutes too see Kobe from the air.",
          "You just get inside of the building and the 1st elevator is marked red to observation deck. Nice views from the top. Don't be afraid of the guard who is outside of the building, he is not there to stop you!",
          "You could have a great view (mountain and sea view) of Kobe at 24th floor of this building. The best part is, it is free of charge and there were very few people on a Saturday morning. Be sure to check this place out when you are in Kobe.",
          "Nice view and good place to think or daydream over a cuppa and a snack. The food is not that great, but it can satisfy when hungry... or have the sweeter fare with a cuppa if just in a \"pause\" kind of mood (recommended).",
          "Its totally free and you can go there during opening hours as long and as often as you like. You can see the seaside and also the mountainside.",
          "This is an unprepossessing building which one would not realise held such lovely views from the top. It is in fact an office building housing a great number of office staff, considering it has 24 floors, but the signage for tourists indicating which lift to take, and from",
          "I happened to stay nearby. Just went up to see the city in the morning. It was free and nothing spectacular but enjoyable. There were a Korean restaurant and ucc coffee shop. Good place to have some quiet time. There was a large sitting place in the lobby floor.",
          "There is no charge to go up here, so it is a very good value observation deck. There is a dedicated (red in colour) lift to go up to the 24th floor. Nothing flash, but it is free, and the views are good, over the city and port of Kobe. Definitely worth doing if you are in Kobe.",
          "If you're on a budget and want to get some nice scenic photos for your family or friends to show that you visited Kobe, you just need to come here. First, this place is very close to Sannomiya station which is the main station in Kobe. Walk down the path (following the signs)",
          "It is just too funny to go here. We made the mistake to exit on a wrong floor, and than you are thrown back 40 years in an old office building of the city hall, so funny! The observation deck is a very posh word for an old floor where you have a nice view over Kobe. Absolutely",
          "Love observatories and this one was no different, but don't expect the Tokyo municipality experience. Views are limited by restaurants and offices, but you'll definitely get your share of this waterfront city surrounded by mountains. Very easily accessible and free.",
          "Just next to Sannomiya Station in Kobe, directly south in a mostly office and work area is the Kobe City Hall, next to a similar but more smaller and wider municipal building. There are clear signs on the door and the floor near the elevator noting the observation deck--which I",

          "Very nice for whoever enjoys panoramic views, you can understand how Kob\u00e9 is encaged between the mountain and the ocean. Mountains are surrounding the city, just like in Rio de Janeiro.",
          "Don't get me wrong, the view is great, whether you visit during the day or at night. The elevator brings you up to the 24th floor in just a few seconds. The elevator is marked red and the first one on the left once you enter the building and make your way through the lobby.",
          "Many cities charge to access observation decks. This was open for free and had toilet facilities - great for tourists. Kobe is not a massive city but it was great to be able to see the harbour, the nearby mountains and see which direction Osaka is etc.",

          "If you are in town, why don't you just pop up to 24th floor and get a panoramic 360 view of Kobe, day or night for free. Not many cities I know gives you this opportunity. You may catch-up with your friends etc with free wifi up there\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc.",
          "Free to go up to the observation level. There's a Korean restaurant there I was told by a Korean is good, but didn't try it. In December you can look down on the Luminaries and see the lights.",
          "It's very accessible. Walking distance from Sannomiya station. The view is good. And it's free. I knew about this at my 5th visit. I wish I've known it was free since my first knowing that I live just few steps away from the building.",
          "You can see most of central Kobe and more. Although not very spectacular during the day, perfect in the evening before going out to eat. Took a number of guests there and it always turned out worth it. Also easy to fit into your schedule! On the same floor there are 2 or 3",

          "Located on Flower Road, and accessible by a number of stations, including Sannomiya Station. The City Loop Bus also stops close by. Great views from the 24th floor, of the mountain side and sea side of Kobe. Maps near the windows will help you identify the landmarks. Definitely",
          "The entrance to Kobe City Hall Observation Deck is free, but many people including Japanese do not know that. Located in the center of Kobe, it takes just few minutes' walk to reach from Sannomiya or from Motomachi. So, why don't you go to take a look?",
          "Able to see the whole ocean view n port terminals. I wanted to know where is Shinko Pier Terminal No. 4. Was very happy to be able see the real position n a copy of a map on the real position n showing the names of buuldings.They give out maps of local interests n discounted",

          "A place worth visiting if you want to get a 360 view of Kobe. On one side, is the sea with Kobe port in view. On the other side, one gets to see the hilly perfecture of Kobe. Visit dampened by rain and low visibility. Better views if the skies were clear",
          "nice place to see the city osaka is a designated city in the Kansai region of Japan. It is the capital city of Osaka Prefecture and quite big and very metropolis",

          "Was told by the chef at a restaurant to come here for a nice view of Kobe. The observation deck is indoors and has two views - Bayside and Mountain, both free. The mountain view was ok but the bay view was nice. The building is a little dated but the deck at least had some",

          "We visited the viewing floor both during daylight and at night. We had been spoilt by the night view in Osaka, but this gave a good perspective of this city. There are exhibits to view and a restaurant on the same floor. Only 10 minutes from Sannomiya station.",

        "wiki": "The Akashi Kaiky\u014d Bridge (\u660e\u77f3\u6d77\u5ce1\u5927\u6a4b, Akashi Kaiky\u014d \u014chashi) is a suspension bridge, which links the city of Kobe on the Japanese mainland of Honshu to Iwaya on Awaji Island. It crosses the busy Akashi Strait (Akashi Kaiky\u014d in Japanese) as part of the Honshu\u2013Shikoku Highway.  It was completed in 1998, and has the longest central span  of any suspension bridge in the world, at 1,991 metres (6,532 ft; 1.237 mi).  It is one of the key links of the Honsh\u016b\u2013Shikoku Bridge Project, which created three routes across the Inland Sea.\n\n\n== History ==\nBefore the Akashi Kaiky\u014d Bridge was built, ferries carried passengers across the Akashi Strait in Japan. This dangerous waterway often experiences severe storms, and in 1955 two ferries sank in the strait during a storm, killing 168 people. The ensuing shock and public outrage convinced the Japanese government to develop plans for a bridge to cross the strait. The original plan called for a mixed railway-road bridge, but when construction on the bridge began in April 1988, the construction was restricted to road only, with six lanes. Actual construction did not begin until May 1988 and involved more than 100 contractors. The bridge was opened for traffic on April 5, 1998 in a ceremony officiated by the Crown Prince Naruhito and his spouse Crown Princess Masako of Japan along with Construction Minister Tsutomu Kawara.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe bridge has three spans. The central span is 1,991 m (6,532 ft; 1.237 mi), and the two other sections are each 960 m (3,150 ft; 0.60 mi). The bridge is 3,911 m (12,831 ft; 2.430 mi) long overall. The two towers were originally 1,990 m (6,530 ft; 1.24 mi) apart, but the Great Hanshin earthquake on January 17, 1995, moved the towers so much (only the towers had been erected at the time) that the span had to be increased by 1 m (3.3 ft).The bridge was designed with a dual-hinged stiffening girder system, allowing the structure to withstand winds of 286 kilometres per hour (178 mph), earthquakes measuring up to magnitude 8.5, and harsh sea currents. The bridge also contains tuned mass dampers that are designed to operate at the resonance frequency of the bridge to dampen forces. The two main supporting towers rise 282.8 m (928 ft) above sea level, and the bridge can expand because of heat by up to 2 m (6.6 ft) over the course of a day. Each anchorage required 350,000 tonnes (340,000 long tons; 390,000 short tons) of concrete. The steel cables have 300,000 kilometres (190,000 mi) of wire: each cable is 112 centimetres (44 in) in diameter and contains 36,830 strands of wire.The Akashi\u2013Kaikyo bridge has a total of 1,737 illumination lights: 1,084 for the main cables, 116 for the main towers, 405 for the girders and 132 for the anchorages. Sets of three high-intensity discharge lamps in the colors red, green and blue are mounted on the main cables. The RGB colour model and computer technology make for a variety of combinations. Twenty-eight patterns are used for occasions such as national or regional holidays, memorial days or festivities.The towers are located in an area of strong tidal currents where water velocity exceeds 7 knots (about 3.6 m/s). The selected scour protection measure includes the installation of a filtering layer with a thickness of 2 m in a range of 10 m around the caisson, covered with rip raps of 8 m thick.\n\n\n== Cost ==\nThe total cost is estimated at \u00a5500 billion or US$3.6 billion (per 1998 exchange rates). It is expected to be repaid by charging drivers a toll to cross the bridge. The toll is 2,300 yen and the bridge is used by approximately 23,000 cars per day.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGreat Seto Bridge\nXihoumen Bridge in China ( second longest suspension bridge worldwide)\nGreat Belt in Denmark ( third longest suspension bridge worldwide)\nHonshu-Shikoku Bridge Expressway Company\nHonsh\u016b\u2013Shikoku Bridge Project\nKurushima-Kaiky\u014d Bridge\nList of longest suspension bridge spans\nShiun Maru disaster\nGreat Hanshin earthquake\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAkashi Kaikyo Bridge at Structurae",

        "wiki": "Kobe Bean Bryant ( KOH-bee; August 23, 1978 \u2013 January 26, 2020) was an American professional basketball player.  As a shooting guard, Bryant entered the National Basketball Association (NBA) directly from high school, and played his entire 20-season professional career in the league with the Los Angeles Lakers. Bryant won many accolades: five NBA championships, 18-time All-Star, 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), two-time NBA Finals MVP winner. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he led the NBA in scoring during two seasons, ranks fourth on the league's all-time regular season scoring and all-time postseason scoring lists.\nBryant was the son of former NBA player Joe Bryant. He attended Lower Merion High School in Pennsylvania, where he was recognized as the top high-school basketball player in the country. Upon graduation, he declared for the 1996 NBA draft and was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th overall pick; the Hornets then traded him to the Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant earned himself a reputation as a high-flyer and a fan favorite by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest, and he was named an All-Star by his second season. Despite a feud with teammate Shaquille O'Neal, the pair led the Lakers to three consecutive NBA championships from 2000 to 2002. In 2003, Bryant was accused of sexual assault by a 19-year-old hotel clerk. Criminal charges were brought and then dropped after the accuser refused to testify, with a civil suit later settled out of court. Bryant denied the assault charge, but admitted to a sexual encounter and issued a public apology.\nAfter the Lakers lost the 2004 NBA Finals, O'Neal was traded and Bryant became the cornerstone of the Lakers. He led the NBA in scoring during the 2005\u201306 and 2006\u201307 seasons. In 2006, he scored a career-high 81 points; the second most points scored in a single game in league history, behind Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game in 1962. Bryant led the team to two consecutive championships in 2009 and 2010, and was named NBA Finals MVP on both occasions. He continued to be among the top players in the league through 2013, when he suffered a torn Achilles tendon at age 34. Although he recovered from that injury, he suffered season-ending injuries to his knee and shoulder, respectively, in the following two seasons. Citing his physical decline, Bryant retired after the 2015\u201316 season.\nAt 34 years and 104 days of age, Bryant became the youngest player in league history to reach 30,000 career points. He became the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history on February 1, 2010, surpassing Jerry West. Bryant was also the first guard in NBA history to play at least 20 seasons. His 18 All-Star designations are the second most all time, while it is the record for most consecutive appearances as a starter. Bryant's four All-Star MVP Awards are tied with Bob Pettit for the most in NBA history. He gave himself the nickname \"Black Mamba\" in the mid-2000s, and the epithet became widely adopted by the general public. At the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics, he won two gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team. In 2018, he won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for his 2017 film Dear Basketball.Bryant died at age 41, along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others, due to blunt force trauma sustained from a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBryant was born in Philadelphia, the youngest of three children and only son of former NBA player Joe Bryant and Pamela Cox Bryant. He was also the maternal nephew of NBA player John \"Chubby\" Cox. His parents named him after the famous beef of Kobe, Japan, which they saw on a restaurant menu. His middle name, Bean, was derived from his father's nickname \"Jellybean.\" Bryant's family was Catholic and he had always practiced his faith.Bryant started playing basketball when he was aged three, and the Lakers were his favorite team when he was growing up. When Bryant was six, his father retired from the NBA and moved his family to Rieti in Italy to continue playing professional basketball at a lower level. After two years, they moved first to Reggio Calabria, then to Pistoia and Reggio Emilia. Kobe became accustomed to his new lifestyle and learned to speak fluent Italian. He was especially fond of Reggio Emilia, which he considered a loving place and where some of his best childhood memories were made. Bryant began to play basketball seriously while living in Reggio Emilia. Bryant's grandfather would mail him videos of NBA games for Bryant to study. Another source of inspiration was animated European films about sports, from which he learned more about basketball. He also learned to play soccer and his favorite soccer team was A.C. Milan. During summers, Bryant would come back to the United States to play in a basketball summer league. When Bryant was thirteen, he and his family moved back to Philadelphia, where he enrolled in eighth grade at Bala Cywynd Middle School.\n\n\n=== High school ===\n\nBryant earned national recognition during a spectacular high school career at Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, located in the Philadelphia suburb of Lower Merion. He played on the varsity basketball team as a freshman. Bryant became the first freshman in decades to start for Lower Merion's varsity team, but the team finished with a 4\u201320 record. The following three years, the Aces compiled a 77\u201313 record, with Bryant playing all five positions. During his junior year, he averaged 31.1 points, 10.4 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 3.8 blocks and 2.3 steals and was named Pennsylvania Player of the Year while also earning a fourth-team Parade All-American nomination, attracting attention from college recruiters in the process. Duke, Michigan, North Carolina and Villanova were at the top of his list. However, after high schooler Kevin Garnett went in the first round of the 1995 NBA draft, Bryant also began contemplating going directly to the pros.At Adidas ABCD Camp, Bryant earned the 1995 senior MVP award while playing alongside future NBA teammate Lamar Odom. While in high school, then 76ers coach John Lucas invited Bryant to work out and scrimmage with the team, where he played one-on-one with Jerry Stackhouse. In his senior year of high school, Bryant led the Aces to their first state championship in 53 years. During the run, he averaged 30.8 points, 12 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 4 steals, and 3.8 blocked shots in leading the Aces to a 31\u20133 record. Bryant ended his high school career as Southeastern Pennsylvania's all-time leading scorer at 2,883 points, surpassing both Wilt Chamberlain and Lionel Simmons.Bryant received several awards for his outstanding performance during his senior year at Lower Merion. These included being named Naismith High School Player of the Year, Gatorade Men's National Basketball Player of the Year, a McDonald's All-American, a first-team Parade All-American and a USA Today All-USA First Team player. Bryant's varsity coach, Greg Downer, commented that he was \"a complete player who dominates\" and praised his work ethic, even as the team's top player. In 1996, Bryant took R&B singer Brandy to his senior prom. Ultimately, the 17-year-old Bryant made the decision to go directly into the NBA, becoming only the sixth player in NBA history to do so. Bryant's news was met with a lot of publicity at a time when prep-to-pro NBA players were not very common (Garnett being the only exception in 20 years). His basketball skills and SAT score of 1080 would have ensured admission to any college he chose, but he did not officially visit any campuses. In 2012, Bryant was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald's All-Americans.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\n\n\n=== 1996 NBA draft ===\nBefore the 1996 NBA draft, Bryant had worked out in Los Angeles, where he scrimmaged against former Lakers players Larry Drew and Michael Cooper and, according to then-Laker manager Jerry West, \"marched over these people\".The Lakers were looking to trade their starting center Vlade Divac for a player's draft rights to free up salary cap space to make an offer to free-agent center Shaquille O'Neal. Bill Branch, the Charlotte Hornets' head scout at the time, said that the Hornets agreed to trade their No. 13 pick to the Lakers the day before the draft. Before the trade agreement, the Hornets never considered drafting Bryant. During the draft, the Lakers told the Hornets whom to select minutes before the pick was made. Bryant was the first guard drafted directly out of high school. After the draft, the trade was put in jeopardy when Divac threatened to retire rather than be traded from Los Angeles. However, on June 30, Divac relented on his threat and the trade was made final on July 9, 1996, when the league's off-season moratorium ended. Since Bryant was still 17 at the time, his parents had to cosign his contract with the Lakers until he was able to sign his own when he turned 18 before the season began. Bryant signed a three-year rookie contract totaling $3.5 million.\n\n\n=== Adjusting to the NBA (1996\u20131999) ===\nBryant debuted in the Summer Pro League in Long Beach, California, scoring 25 points in front of a standing-room-only crowd. Defenders struggled to get in front of him, and his performance excited West and Lakers coach Del Harris. He scored 36 points in the finale and finished with averages of 24.5 points and 5.3 rebounds in four games. As a rookie in 1996\u201397, Bryant mostly came off the bench behind guards Eddie Jones and Nick Van Exel. At the time he became the youngest player ever to play in an NBA game (18 years, 72 days; a record since broken by Jermaine O'Neal and former teammate Andrew Bynum), and also became the youngest NBA starter (18 years, 158 days). Initially, Bryant played limited minutes, but as the season continued, he began to see some more playing time.\nBy the end of the season, he averaged 15.5 minutes a game. During the All-Star weekend, Bryant participated in the Rookie Challenge and won the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest, becoming the youngest dunk champion at the age of 18. Bryant's performance throughout the year earned him a spot on the NBA All-Rookie Second Team with fellow bench teammate Travis Knight.The Lakers advanced to the Western Conference semifinals in the playoffs against the Utah Jazz, when Bryant was pressed into a lead role at the end of Game 5. Byron Scott missed the game with a sprained wrist, Robert Horry was ejected for fighting with Utah's Jeff Hornacek, and Shaquille O'Neal fouled out with 1:46 remaining in the fourth quarter. Bryant shot four air balls at the end of the game; the Jazz won 98\u201393 in overtime to eliminate the Lakers 4\u20131. He first missed a game-winning two-point jump shot in the fourth quarter, and then misfired 3 three-point field goals in overtime, including two tying shots in the final minute. O'Neal commented that \"[Bryant] was the only guy who had the guts at the time to take shots like that.\"In Bryant's second season, he received more playing time and began to show more of his abilities as a talented young guard. As a result, Bryant's point averages more than doubled, from 7.6 to 15.4 points per game. Bryant would see an increase in minutes when the Lakers \"played small\", which would feature Bryant playing small forward alongside the guards he would usually back up. Bryant was the runner-up for the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year Award, and through fan voting, he also became the youngest NBA All-Star starter in NBA history. He was joined by teammates O'Neal, Van Exel, and Jones, making it the first time since 1983 that four players on the same team were selected to play in the same All-Star Game. Bryant's 15.4 points per game was the highest of any non-starter in the season.The 1998\u201399 season marked Bryant's emergence as a premier guard in the league. With starting guards Van Exel and Jones traded, Bryant started every game for the lockout-shortened 50-game season. During the season, Bryant signed a six-year contract extension worth $70 million. This kept him with the Lakers until the end of the 2003\u201304 season. Even at an early stage of his career, sportswriters were comparing his skills to those of Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson. The playoff results, however, were no better, as the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Semifinals.\n\n\n=== Three-peat (1999\u20132002) ===\n\nBryant's fortunes would improve when Phil Jackson took over as coach of the Lakers in 1999. After years of steady improvement, Bryant became one of the premier shooting guards in the league, earning appearances in the league's All-NBA, All-Star, and All-Defensive teams. The Lakers became championship contenders behind the center-guard combination of Bryant and O'Neal. Jackson utilized the triangle offense that he implemented to win six championships with the Chicago Bulls; this offense would help both Bryant and O'Neal rise to the elite class of the NBA. Three championships were won consecutively in 2000, 2001, and 2002, further cementing this view.Bryant was sidelined for six weeks prior to the start of the 1999\u20132000 season due to a hand injury that he had incurred during a preseason game against the Washington Wizards. When Bryant was back and playing over 38 minutes a game, he had an increase in all statistical categories during the 1999\u20132000 season. This included leading the team in assists per game and steals per game. The duo of O'Neal and Bryant backed with a strong bench led to the Lakers winning 67 games, tied for fifth-most in NBA history. This followed with O'Neal winning the MVP and Bryant being named to the All-NBA Team Second Team and All-NBA Defensive Team for the first time in his career (the youngest player to receive defensive honors). While playing second fiddle to O'Neal in the playoffs, Bryant had some clutch performances including a 25-point, 11 rebound, 7 assist, 4 block game in game 7 of the Western Conference finals against the Portland Trail Blazers. He also threw an alley-oop pass to O'Neal to clinch the game and the series. In the 2000 Finals, against the Indiana Pacers, Bryant injured his ankle in the second quarter of Game 2 after landing on the Pacers' Jalen Rose's foot. Rose later admitted he placed his foot under Bryant intentionally. Bryant did not return to the game, and he also missed Game 3 due to the injury. In Game 4, Bryant scored 22 points in the second half and led the team to an OT victory as O'Neal fouled out of the game. Bryant scored the winning shot to put the Lakers ahead 120\u2013118. With a 116\u2013111 Game 6 victory, the Lakers won their first championship since 1988.Statistically, the 2000\u201301 season saw Bryant perform similarly to the previous year, but he averaged six more points per game (28.5). It was also the year when disagreements between Bryant and O'Neal began to surface. Once again, Bryant led the team in assists, with five per game. The Lakers, however, only won 56 games, an 11-game dropoff from the previous year. The Lakers would respond by going 15\u20131 in the playoffs. They easily swept the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round. In the semifinals round, the Lakers swept the Sacramento Kings. In Game 4 against the Kings, Bryant recorded 48 points, 16 rebounds and 3 assists in a 119\u2013113 series-clinching win. They swept the San Antonio Spurs in the conference finals to advance to the Finals, before losing their first game against the Philadelphia 76ers in overtime. They would go on to win the next four games and bring their second championship to Los Angeles in as many seasons. During the playoffs, Bryant played heavy minutes which brought his stats up to 29.4 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 6.1 assists per game. In the playoffs, teammate O'Neal declared Bryant the best player in the league. Bryant ended up making the All NBA Second team and All NBA Defensive Team for the second year in a row. In addition, he was also voted to start in the NBA All-Star Game for the third year in a row (no game in 1999).\nIn the 2001\u201302 season, Bryant played 80 games for the first time in his career. On January 14, 2002, Bryant recorded a then career-high 56 points to go along with five rebounds and four assists in a 120\u201381 win over the visiting Memphis Grizzlies. He continued his all-round play by averaging 25.2 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game. Bryant also had a career-high 46.9% shooting and once again led his team in assists. He claimed his first All-Star MVP trophy after a 31-point performance in Philadelphia when he was loudly booed by fans as they had throughout the game, stemming from his earlier comment to a 76ers heckler during the Finals that the Lakers were \"going to cut your hearts out\". While making the All-NBA Defensive team again, Bryant was also named to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his career. The Lakers won 58 games that year and finished second in the Pacific Division behind in-state rival Sacramento Kings. Bryant was suspended one game after he punched Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers after the Lakers' March 1, 2002 victory over the Pacers.The road to the Finals would prove a lot tougher than the record run the Lakers had enjoyed the previous year. While the Lakers swept the Blazers and defeated the Spurs 4\u20131 in the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Lakers did not have home-court advantage against the Sacramento Kings. The series would stretch to seven games, the first time this had happened to the Lakers since the 2000 Western Conference Finals. However, the Lakers were able to beat their division rivals and make their third consecutive NBA Finals appearance. In the 2002 Finals, against the New Jersey Nets, Bryant averaged 26.8 points, 51.4% shooting, 5.8 rebounds, 5.3 assists per game, which included scoring a quarter of the team's points. At age 23, Bryant became the youngest player to win three championships. Bryant's play was notable and praised for his performance in the fourth quarter of games, specifically the last two rounds of the playoffs. This cemented Bryant's reputation as a \"clutch player\".\n\n\n=== Coming up short (2002\u20132004) ===\n\nIn the first game of the 2002\u201303 season, Bryant recorded 27 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists and 4 steals in an 87\u201382 loss to the visiting Spurs. On November 1, Bryant recorded a triple-double of 33 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists in a 108\u201393 win over the LA Clippers. He also set an NBA record for three-pointers in a game on January 7, 2003, when he made 12 against the Seattle SuperSonics. Bryant averaged 30 points per game and embarked on a historic run, posting 40 or more points in nine consecutive games while averaging 40.6 in the entire month of February. In addition, he averaged 6.9 rebounds, 5.9 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, all career-highs to that point. Bryant was once again voted to both the All-NBA and All-Defensive first teams, and came in third place in voting for the MVP award. After finishing 50\u201332 in the regular season, the Lakers floundered in the playoffs and lost in the Western Conference semi-finals in six games to the eventual NBA champions San Antonio Spurs.In the following season, the Lakers were able to acquire NBA All-Stars Karl Malone and Gary Payton to make another push at the NBA championship. Bryant was arrested for sexual assault before the season began. This caused Bryant to miss some games due to court appearances or attend court earlier in the day and travel to play games later on the same day. In the final game of the regular season, the Lakers played the Portland Trail Blazers. Bryant made two buzzer-beaters to win the game and the Pacific Division title. At the end of the fourth quarter, Bryant made a three-pointer with 1.1 seconds left to send it into overtime. The game eventually went to a second overtime, in which Bryant made another three-pointer as time expired to lift the Lakers past the Blazers, 105\u2013104.With a starting lineup of O'Neal, Malone, Payton, and Bryant, the Lakers were able to reach the NBA Finals. However, they were upset in five games by the Detroit Pistons, who won their first championship since 1990. In that series, Bryant averaged 22.6 points per game and 4.4 assists. He shot 35.1% from the field. Jackson's contract as coach was not renewed, and Rudy Tomjanovich took over. O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom, Caron Butler, and Brian Grant. The following day, Bryant declined an offer to sign with the Los Angeles Clippers and re-signed with the Lakers, on a seven-year contract.\n\n\n=== Scoring records and playoff upsets (2004\u20132007) ===\nBryant was closely scrutinized and criticized during the 2004\u201305 season with his reputation badly damaged from all that had happened over the previous year. A particularly damaging salvo came when Jackson wrote The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul. The book detailed the events of the Lakers' tumultuous 2003\u201304 season and has several criticisms of Bryant. In the book, Jackson called Bryant \"un-coachable\". Midway through the season, Tomjanovich suddenly resigned as Lakers coach, citing the recurrence of health problems and exhaustion. Without Tomjanovich, stewardship of the remainder of the Lakers' season fell to career assistant coach Frank Hamblen. Bryant was the league's second-leading scorer at 27.6 points per game, but he was surrounded by a subpar supporting cast, and the Lakers went 34\u201348 and missed the playoffs for the first time in over a decade. The year signified a drop in Bryant's overall status in the NBA, as he did not make the NBA All-Defensive Team and was also demoted to the All-NBA Third Team. During the season, Bryant also engaged in public feuds with Malone and Ray Allen.The 2005\u201306 season marked a crossroads in Bryant's basketball career. Despite past differences with Bryant, Jackson returned to coach the Lakers. Bryant endorsed the move, and by all appearances, the two men worked together well the second time around, leading the Lakers back into the playoffs. Bryant's individual scoring accomplishments posted resulted in the finest statistical season of his career. On December 20, 2005, Bryant scored 62 points in three quarters against the Dallas Mavericks. Entering the fourth quarter, Bryant outscored the entire Mavericks team 62\u201361, the only time a player has done this through three quarters since the introduction of the shot clock. When the Lakers faced the Miami Heat on January 16, 2006, Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal made headlines by engaging in handshakes and hugs before the game, signifying a change in the feud that had festered between them. A month later, at the 2006 NBA All-Star Game, the two were seen laughing together.On January 22, 2006, Bryant scored a career-high 81 points in a 122\u2013104 victory against the Toronto Raptors. In addition to breaking the previous franchise record of 71 set by Elgin Baylor, Bryant's 81-point game was the second-highest point total in NBA history, surpassed only by Chamberlain's 100-point game in 1962. Whereas Chamberlain was fed repeatedly by teammates for inside shots in a blowout win, Bryant created his own shot\u2014mostly from the outside\u2014in a game which the Lakers trailed at halftime by 14 and did not pull away until the fourth quarter. Chamberlain, playing in an era when the games were paced faster and scoring opportunities were more plentiful, accounted for 59 percent of his team's points in Philadelphia's 169\u2013147 win, compared to Bryant scoring 66 percent of the Lakers' 122 points. In that same month, Bryant also became the first player since 1964 to score 45 points or more in four consecutive games, joining Chamberlain and Baylor as the only players to do so. For the month of January, Bryant averaged 43.4 points per game, the eighth highest single month scoring average in NBA history and highest for any player other than Chamberlain. By the end of the 2005\u201306 season, Bryant set Lakers single-season franchise records for most 40-point games (27) and most points scored (2,832). He won the league's scoring title for the first time by averaging 35.4 points per game, becoming just the fifth player in league history to average at least 35 in a season. Bryant finished in fourth place in the voting for the 2006 NBA Most Valuable Player Award but received 22 first place votes\u2014second only to winner Steve Nash.Later in the season, it was reported that Bryant would change his jersey number from 8 to 24 at the start of the 2006\u201307 season. Bryant's first high school number was 24 before he switched to 33. After the Lakers' season ended, Bryant said on TNT that he wanted 24 as a rookie, but it was unavailable, as was 33, retired with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Bryant wore 143 at the Adidas ABCD camp and chose 8 by adding those numbers. In the first round of the playoffs, the Lakers played well enough to reach a 3\u20131 series lead over the Phoenix Suns, culminating with Bryant's overtime-forcing and game-winning shots in Game 4. They came within six seconds of eliminating the second-seeded Suns in Game 6, however, they lost that game 126\u2013118 in overtime. Despite Bryant's 27.9 points per game in the series, the Lakers broke down and ultimately fell to the Suns in seven games. After scoring 50 points on 20 of 35 shooting in the Game 6 loss, Bryant was criticized for only taking three shots in the second half of the 121\u201390 Game 7 loss to Phoenix.\n\nDuring the 2006\u201307 season, Bryant was selected to his ninth All-Star Game appearance, and on February 18, he logged 31 points, 6 assists, and 6 steals, earning his second career All-Star Game MVP trophy. Over the course of the season, Bryant became involved in a number of on-court incidents. On January 28 while attempting to draw contact on a potential game-winning jump shot, he flailed his arm, striking San Antonio Spurs guard Manu Gin\u00f3bili in the face with his elbow. Following a league review, Bryant was suspended for the subsequent game at Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks. The basis given for the suspension was that Bryant had performed an \"unnatural motion\" in swinging his arm backward. Later, on March 6, he seemed to repeat the motion, this time striking Minnesota Timberwolves guard Marko Jari\u0107. On March 7, the NBA handed Bryant his second one-game suspension. In his first game back on March 9, he elbowed Kyle Korver in the face which was retroactively re-classified as a Type 1 flagrant foul.On March 16, Bryant scored a season-high 65 points in a home game against the Portland Trail Blazers, which helped end the Lakers 7-game losing streak. This was the second-best scoring performance of his 11-year career. The following game, Bryant recorded 50 points against the Minnesota Timberwolves, after which he scored 60 points in a road win against the Memphis Grizzlies\u2014becoming the second Laker to score three straight 50-plus point games, a feat not seen since Jordan last did it in 1987. The only other Laker to do so was Baylor, who also scored 50+ in three consecutive contests in December 1962. In the following day, in a game against the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets, Bryant scored 50 points, making him the second player in NBA history to have four straight 50-point games behind Chamberlain, who achieved it twice with streaks of five and seven. Bryant finished the year with a total of ten 50-plus point games, surpassed only by Chamberlain. Bryant also won his second straight scoring title that season. Throughout the 2006\u201307 season, his jersey became the top selling NBA jersey in the United States and China. A number of journalists have attributed the improved sales to Bryant's new number, as well as his continuing All-Star performance on the court. In the 2007 NBA playoffs, the Lakers were once again eliminated in the first round by the Phoenix Suns, 4\u20131.\n\n\n=== Back on top (2007\u20132010) ===\nOn May 27, 2007, ESPN reported that Bryant stated that he wanted to be traded if Jerry West did not return to the team with full authority. Bryant later confirmed his desire for West's return to the franchise but denied stating that he would want to be traded if that did not take place. However, three days later, on Stephen A. Smith's radio program, Bryant expressed anger over a Lakers \"insider\" who claimed that Bryant was responsible for Shaquille O'Neal's departure from the team, and publicly stated, \"I want to be traded.\" Three hours after making that statement, Bryant stated in another interview that after having a conversation with head coach Jackson, he had reconsidered his decision and backed off his trade request. Bryant was later shown in an infamous amateur video saying that center Andrew Bynum should have been traded for All-Star Jason Kidd.\n\nOn December 23, 2007, Bryant became the youngest player (29 years, 122 days) to reach 20,000 points, in a game against the New York Knicks, in Madison Square Garden, after scoring 39 points to go along with 11 rebounds and 8 assists. This record has since been broken by LeBron James. On March 28, Bryant scored a season-high 53 points to go with 10 rebounds in a loss to the Memphis Grizzlies.Despite an injury to his shooting hand's small finger, described as \"a complete tear of the radial collateral ligament, an avulsion fracture, and a volar plate injury at the MCP joint\" that occurred in a game on February 5, 2008, Bryant played all 82 games of the regular season instead of opting for surgery. Regarding his injury, he stated, \"I would prefer to delay any surgical procedure until after our Lakers season, and this summer's Olympic Games. But, this is an injury that myself [sic] and the Lakers' medical staff will just have to continue to monitor on a day-to-day basis.\" In early September 2008, Bryant decided not to have surgery to repair the injury.Aided by the trade for All-Star Pau Gasol, Bryant led his team to a West-leading 57\u201325 record. The Lakers swept the Nuggets in the first round and on May 6, 2008, and Bryant was officially announced as the league MVP. He said, \"It's been a long ride. I'm very proud to represent this organization, to represent this city.\" West, who was responsible for bringing Bryant to the Lakers, was on hand at the press conference to observe Bryant receive his MVP trophy from NBA commissioner David Stern. Stern stated, \"Kobe deserved it. He's had just another great season. Doesn't surprise me one bit.\" In addition to winning his MVP award, Bryant was the only unanimous selection to the All-NBA team on May 8, 2008, for the third straight season and sixth time in his career. He would then headline the NBA All-Defensive First Team with Kevin Garnett, receiving 52 points overall including 24 first-place nods, earning his eighth selection.The Lakers concluded the 2007\u201308 regular season with a 57\u201325 record, finishing first in the Western Conference and setting up themselves for a first-round contest against the Nuggets. In Game 1, Bryant, who said he made himself a decoy through most of the game, scored 18 of his 32 points in the final eight minutes to keep Los Angeles safely ahead. That made Denver the first 50-win team to be swept out of the first round of the playoffs since the Memphis Grizzlies fell in four games to the San Antonio Spurs in 2004. In the first game of the next round, against the Jazz, Bryant scored 38 points as the Lakers beat the Jazz in Game 1. The Lakers won the next game as well, but dropped Games 3 and 4, even with Bryant putting up 33.5 points per game. The Lakers then won the next two games to win the semifinals. This set up a Western Conference Finals berth against the San Antonio Spurs. The Lakers defeated the Spurs in five games, sending themselves to the NBA Finals, against the Boston Celtics. This marked the fifth time in Bryant's career, and the first time without O'Neal, that he made the NBA Finals. The Lakers then lost to the Boston Celtics in six games.\n\nIn the 2008\u201309 season, the Lakers opened the campaign by winning their first seven games. Bryant led the team to tie the franchise record for most wins to start the season going 17\u20132, and by the middle of December they compiled a 21\u20133 record. He was selected to his 11th consecutive All-Star Game as a starter, and was named the Western Conference Player of the Month for December and January in addition to being named Western Conference Player of the week three times. In a game against the Knicks on February 2, 2009, Bryant scored 61 points, setting a record for the most points scored at Madison Square Garden. During the 2009 NBA All-Star Game, Bryant tallied 27 points, 4 assists, 4 rebounds, and 4 steals was awarded All-Star Game co-MVP with former teammate O'Neal. The Lakers finished the regular season with the best record in the west (65\u201317). Bryant was runner-up in the MVP voting behind LeBron James, and was selected to the All-NBA First Team and All-Defensive First Team for the seventh time in his career.\nIn the playoffs, the Lakers defeated the Utah Jazz in five games and the Houston Rockets in seven games in the opening two rounds. By finishing off the Denver Nuggets in the Conference Finals in six games, the Lakers earned their second straight trip to the NBA Finals. The Lakers defeated the Orlando Magic in five games. Bryant was awarded his first NBA Finals MVP trophy upon winning his fourth championship, achieving series averages of 32.4 points, 7.4 assists, 5.6 rebounds, 1.4 steals and 1.4 blocks. He became the first player since West in the 1969 NBA Finals to average at least 32.4 points and 7.4 assists for a finals series and the first since Jordan to average 30 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists for a title-winning team in the finals.\n\nDuring the 2009\u201310 season, Bryant made six game-winning shots including a buzzer-beating, one-legged 3-pointer against the Miami Heat on December 4, 2009. Bryant considered the shot one of the luckiest he has made. A week later, Bryant suffered an avulsion fracture in his right index finger in a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Despite the injury, Bryant elected to continue playing, rather than take any time off to rest the injury. Five days after his finger injury, he made another game-winning shot, after missing on an opportunity in regulation, this time against the Milwaukee Bucks in an overtime game. Bryant also became the youngest player (31 years, 151 days) to reach 25,000 points in his career during the season, surpassing Chamberlain. He continued his dominant clutch plays making yet another game-winning three-pointer against the Sacramento Kings, and what would be the game-winning field goal against the Boston Celtics. The following day, he surpassed West to become the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history. After being sidelined for five games by an ankle injury, Bryant made his return and made another clutch three-pointer to give the Lakers a one-point lead with four seconds remaining against the Memphis Grizzlies. Two weeks later, he made his sixth game-winning shot of the season, against the Toronto Raptors.On April 2, 2010, Bryant signed a three-year contract extension worth $87 million. Bryant finished the regular season missing four of the final five games, due to injuries to his knee and finger. Bryant suffered multiple injuries throughout the season and as a result, missed nine games. The Lakers began the playoffs as the number one seed in the Western Conference against the Oklahoma City Thunder, eventually defeating them in six games. The Lakers swept the Utah Jazz in the second round and advanced to the Western Conference Finals, where they faced the Phoenix Suns. In Game 2, Bryant finished the game with 13 assists, setting a new playoff career-high; it was the most assists by a Laker in the playoffs since Magic Johnson had 13 in 1996. The Lakers went on to win the series in six games capturing the Western Conference Championship and advancing to the NBA Finals for a third straight season. In a rematch against the 2008 Champion Boston Celtics, Bryant, despite shooting 6 for 24 from the field, led the Lakers back from a 13-point third-quarter deficit in Game 7 to win the championship; he scored 10 of his game-high 23 points in the fourth quarter and finished the game with 15 rebounds. Bryant won his fifth championship and earned his second consecutive NBA Finals MVP award. This marked the first time the Lakers won a Game 7 against the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals. Bryant said that this was the most satisfying of all of his five championships.\n\n\n=== Chasing a sixth championship (2010\u20132013) ===\n\nBryant wanted a sixth championship to match Jordan's total. The Lakers started the 2010\u201311 season by winning their first eight games. In his ninth game of the season, playing against the Denver Nuggets, Bryant became the youngest player in NBA history to reach 26,000 career points. Bryant also recorded his first triple-double since January 21, 2009. On January 30 against the Celtics, he became the youngest player to score 27,000 points. On February 1, 2011, Bryant became one of seven players with at least 25,000 points, 5,000 rebounds, and 5,000 assists. In Boston on February 10, Bryant scored 20 of his 23 points in the second half as the Lakers rallied from an early 15-point deficit for a 92\u201386 win over the Celtics. It was the Lakers' first victory of the season against one of the league's top four teams, as they entered the game 0\u20135 in previous matchups and had been outscored by an average of 11 points. Bryant, selected to his 13th straight All-Star game after becoming the leading vote-getter, had 37 points, 14 rebounds, and three steals in the 2011 All-Star Game and won his fourth All-Star MVP, tying Hall of Famer Bob Pettit for the most All-Star MVP awards. During the season, Bryant moved from 12th to 6th place on the NBA all-time career scoring list, passing John Havlicek, Dominique Wilkins, Oscar Robertson, Hakeem Olajuwon, Elvin Hayes, and Moses Malone. Bryant finished the season averaging less than 20 shots a game, his fewest since the 2003\u201304 season.On April 13, 2011, the NBA fined Bryant $100,000 for directing a gay slur at referee Bennie Adams in frustration in the previous day's game. The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation praised the NBA's decision to fine Bryant, and the Human Rights Campaign said that Bryant's language was a \"disgrace\" and \"distasteful\". Bryant stated that he was open to discussing the matter with gay rights groups and wanted to appeal his fine. He later apologized for the use of the word. Bryant and other Lakers appeared in a Lakers public service announcement denouncing his behavior. The team's quest for another three-peat was ended when they were swept by the Dallas Mavericks in the second round of the playoffs.\n\nBryant received experimental platelet-rich plasma therapy called Orthokine in Germany to treat the pain on his left knee and ankle, and Mike Brown replaced the retired Jackson as coach of the Lakers in the off-season. Bryant began the season playing with an injured wrist. On January 10, 2012, Bryant scored 48 points against the Suns. \"Not bad for the seventh-best player in the league\", said Bryant, referring to a preseason ESPN ranking of the NBA's top players. He went on to score 40, 42, and 42 in his next three games. It was the sixth time in his career he scored 40 or more points in four straight games, a feat exceeded only by Chamberlain (19 times). At the 2012 NBA All-Star Game, Bryant scored 27 points to pass Jordan as the career scoring leader in the All-Star Game. He also suffered a broken nose and a concussion in the third quarter of the All-Star Game after a hard foul from Dwyane Wade. In April, Bryant missed seven games with a bruised left shin. He returned three games before the end of the regular season. In the last game of the regular season, against Sacramento, he chose not to go for a possible third NBA scoring title, having needed 38 points to surpass Kevin Durant. The Lakers were knocked out of the playoffs by Durant's Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round of the playoffs, losing in five games.The Lakers in 2012\u201313 acquired center Dwight Howard and point guard Steve Nash. On November 2, 2012, Bryant scored 40 points with two steals, and he passed Magic Johnson (1,724) as the Lakers career leader in steals. However, the Lakers lost the game to the Clippers and started the season 0\u20133 for the first time in 34 years and just the fourth time in franchise history. After starting the season 1\u20134, coach Brown was fired. He was replaced by Mike D'Antoni, who Bryant knew as a child when Bryant's father was playing in Italy and D'Antoni was also a star player there. Bryant had grown close with D'Antoni during their time with Team USA. On December 5 against New Orleans, Bryant became the youngest player (34 years and 104 days) in league history to score 30,000 points, joining Hall of Famers Chamberlain, Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Karl Malone as one of five players to reach that milestone. On December 18, in a 101\u2013100 win over the Charlotte Bobcats, Bryant scored 30+ points in his seventh consecutive game, the longest streak by an NBA player after turning 34 years old; it was the fourth-longest such streak in his career. His streak would be snapped at 10 on December 28 in a 104\u201387 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, when he scored 27 points, sitting out the whole fourth quarter. In a move to improve the team's defense, D'Antoni began having Bryant guard the opponent's best perimeter player; Bryant was the primary defender on the Cavaliers' Kyrie Irving, who was held to 15 points. Bryant acknowledged he was a more focused defender when he had a challenging defensive assignment as opposed to when he played off the ball against weaker players. His defense disrupted opponents and freed Nash from unfavorable matchups.\n\nBryant was leading the league in scoring through much of the first 42 games. With a disappointing 17\u201325 start to the season, D'Antoni had Bryant became the primary facilitator on offense and Nash was moved off the ball and became more of a spot-up shooter. In the next three games, Bryant had at least 10 assists in three wins with a three-game total of 39 assists, the most in his career. He missed a triple-double in each game with nine rebounds twice and eight in the other. In two crucial wins in March, he scored at least 40 points and had at least 10 assists in back-to-back games, becoming the first Laker to accomplish the feat since West in 1970.With the Lakers fighting to secure the eighth and final playoff berth in the Western Conference, coupled with injuries on the team, Bryant began playing almost all 48 minutes each game. On April 10, 2013, Bryant became the first player in NBA history to get 47 points, eight rebounds, five assists, four blocks, and three steals in an NBA game. On April 12, Bryant suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors, ending his season. His injury came while he was playing seven consecutive quarters and at least 40 minutes for seven consecutive games. The 34-year-old Bryant was averaging his most minutes (38.6) in six years, and only Portland rookie Damian Lillard was averaging more minutes. Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak had spoken to Bryant about his extensive playing time 10 days earlier, but Bryant insisted the minutes needed to continue given the Lakers' playoff push. Bryant had surgery on April 13 to repair the tear, and it was estimated he would miss six to nine months. He ended the season with his customary numbers scoring an average of 27.3 points, 46.3 percent shooting, 5.6 rebounds, and 6 assists. However, The New York Times called his leading of the Lakers back into playoff contention \"perhaps some of the finest work of his career.\" Eight times he reached 40 points during the season, and eleven times he had 10 or more assists in his role as distributor, dubbed \"Magic Mamba\" after the passing skills of Magic Johnson. Bryant's assists were the second-highest of his career and his field goal percentage was its highest since 2008\u201309. The Lakers finished the season at 45\u201337, good for seventh in the West. Playing without Bryant, the Lakers were swept in four games by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the playoffs.\n\n\n=== Injury-plagued years (2013\u20132015) ===\n\nBryant resumed practicing in November 2013, after the 2013\u20132014 season had already begun. On November 25, he signed a two-year contract extension with the Lakers at an estimated value of $48.5 million. He remained the league's highest-paid player, although he accepted a discounted deal; he had been eligible to receive an extension starting at $32 million per year. Bryant's contract became a polarizing topic, with detractors arguing that stars should take less money to allow their team more financial freedom, while supporters countered that the NBA's biggest stars were being paid less than their true value. Bryant resumed playing on December 8 after missing the season's first 19 games. On December 17, Bryant matched his season high of 21 points in a 96\u201392 win over Memphis, but he suffered a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee that was expected to sideline him for six weeks. He had played six games since returning from his Achilles injury, which included time at point guard after injuries to Nash, Steve Blake, and Jordan Farmar. Bryant was averaging 13.8 points, 6.3 assists, and 4.3 rebounds. Despite being sidelined, he was voted by fans to start in his 16th All-Star game. Bryant did not feel he was deserving of the selection, and some likened it to a career achievement award for his past performance. However, he missed playing in the game, still hampered by his knee. On March 12, 2014, the Lakers ruled Bryant out for the remainder of the season, citing his need for more rehab and the limited time remaining in the season. At the time, the team was 22\u201342 and tied for the worst record in the Western Conference. The Lakers finished 27\u201355 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2005.Bryant returned for the 2014\u201315 season, his 19th season with the Lakers, who had replaced D'Antoni with Bryant's former Lakers teammate, Byron Scott. On November 30, 2014, in a 129\u2013122 overtime victory against the Toronto Raptors, Bryant recorded his 20th career triple-double with 31 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds. At age 36, he became the oldest NBA player to achieve 30 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists in a game. On December 14, Bryant became the NBA's third all-time leading scorer, passing Jordan (32,292) in a 100\u201394 win against Minnesota. He played in the first 27 games of the season, averaging team-highs with 26.4 points and 35.4 minutes per game while leading the league with 22.4 shots per game. However, Scott held him out for three straight games to rest after one of his worst performances of the season, when Bryant committed nine turnovers and scored 25 points on just 8-for-30 shooting in a 108\u2013101 loss to Sacramento. He was suffering from soreness in his knees, feet, back, and Achilles tendons and Scott planned to reduce his workload going forward. Three times Bryant had exceeded 40 minutes in a game, and the coach blamed himself for overloading him after he started the season in such great shape. For the season, Bryant had been shooting just 37 percent from the field, and the team's record was only 8\u201319. In his second game back after resting, he had 23 points, 11 assists, and 11 rebounds in a 111\u2013103 win over Denver, and became just the third player in league history to record multiple triple-doubles in a season at age 36 or older. On January 21, 2015, Bryant suffered a rotator cuff tear in his right shoulder while driving baseline for a two-handed dunk against the New Orleans Pelicans. Though he was right-handed, he returned to play in the game and ran the offense while shooting, dribbling, and passing almost exclusively with his left hand. Prior to the injury, Bryant had been rested in 8 of 16 games. He underwent season-ending surgery for the injury, finishing the season averaging 22.3 points but shooting a career-low 37.3 percent, well below his 45.4 percent career mark to start the season. He was expected to be sidelined for nine months with a return targeted toward the start of the 2015\u201316 season. The Lakers finished the season with a record of 21\u201361, surpassing the franchise record for most losses in a season that they had set the previous year.\n\n\n=== Final season (2015\u20132016) ===\n\nAfter recovering to play in the 2015\u201316 preseason, Bryant suffered a calf injury and missed the final two weeks of exhibition games. However, he played in the season opener to begin his 20th season with the Lakers, surpassing John Stockton's league record of 19 for the most seasons with the same team. On November 24, 2015, the Lakers fell to 2\u201312 after losing 111\u201377 to the Warriors. Bryant scored just four points in 25 minutes on 1-for-14 shooting, matching the worst-shooting game of his career in which he attempted at least five shots. On December 1, 2015, Bryant played his last game against his hometown team, the Philadelphia 76ers, where the Lakers lost 103\u201391.On November 29, 2015, Bryant announced via The Players' Tribune that he would be retiring at the end of the season. In his poem titled \"Dear Basketball\", Bryant wrote that he fell in love with the game at age six; \"A love so deep I gave you my all/From my mind & body/To my spirit & soul.\" The 2015\u201316 season \"is all I have left to give./My heart can take the pounding/My mind can handle the grind/But my body knows it's time to say goodbye./And that's OK./I'm ready to let you go.\" In a letter distributed to Lakers' fans before that evening's game against the Indiana Pacers, Bryant wrote, \"What you've done for me is far greater than anything I've done for you. ... My love for this city, this team and for each of you will never fade. Thank you for this incredible journey.\"At the time of his announcement, he was second on the team in minutes (30.8) behind Jordan Clarkson and leading the team with 16.7 field goal attempts per game, while averaging just 15.7 points and shooting a career-low 31.5 percent. His free throw attempts had dropped from his career average, and his game had become over-reliant on pump fakes and long-range shots, making a league-worst 19.5 percent from three-point range while attempting seven a game, almost double his career average. In his press conference after the announcement, he acknowledged his declining skills. \"Even though I play like shit, I've worked really, really hard not to play like crap and I do everything I possibly can. And I feel good about that\", he said.\n\nBryant requested that opposing teams on the road not hold any on-court ceremonies in his honor or present him any gifts in public. Prior to announcing his retirement, he had been steadfast about not wanting the fuss of a staged farewell tour, preferring to hear boos instead of cheers. Still, he was honored around the league with video tributes and fan ovations, including arenas that historically jeered him such as TD Garden in Boston, Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento, and Vivint Smart Home Arena in Salt Lake City. Previously, Bryant was respected but not beloved, and he was astonished at the cheers he was now receiving.On February 3, Bryant made seven three-pointers and scored a then season-high 38 points, including 14 of the team's 18 points in the last 5:02 of the game, for a 119\u2013115 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. The win ended a 10-game losing streak, and the Lakers averted establishing the longest losing streak in franchise history. He became just the fourth NBA player over 37 years old to log at least 35 points, five rebounds, and five assists in a game. Bryant was the leading overall vote-getter for the 2016 All-Star Game with 1.9 million votes, ahead of Stephen Curry's 1.6 million. Having moved to small forward that season, Bryant was selected as a frontcourt starter for the first time. Playing in his first All-Star game since 2013, Bryant had 10 points, six rebounds, and seven assists. West teammates offered to feed him the ball in an attempt to get him another All-Star MVP, but he declined.In the season finale on April 13, Bryant scored an NBA season-high 60 points against Utah in his last NBA game, outscoring the entire Jazz team 23\u201321 in the fourth quarter, in the Lakers' 101\u201396 victory. He became the oldest player to score 60 or more points in a game at 37 years and 234 days old. The Lakers finished the season with a 17\u201365 record, their worst record in franchise history.\n\n\n== National team career ==\n\nBryant declined to play in the 2000 Olympics because he was getting married in the off-season. He also decided not to play in the 2002 FIBA World Championship. Bryant was originally selected for the FIBA Americas Championship in 2003 but withdrew after undergoing arthroscopic shoulder and knee surgeries. In the following summer, he had to withdraw from the Olympic team because of his sexual assault case. Along with LeBron James, he was one of the first two players to be publicly named to the 2006\u20132008 U.S. preliminary roster in 2006 by Jerry Colangelo.However, he was once again sidelined after knee surgery and didn't participate in the 2006 FIBA World Championship.Bryant's United States national team career finally began in 2007. He was a member of the 2007 USA Men's Senior National Team and USA FIBA Americas Championship Team that finished 10\u20130, won gold and qualified the United States men for the 2008 Olympics. He started in all 10 of the USA's FIBA Americas Championship games. Bryant averaged 15.3 points, 2.9 assists, 2.0 rebounds, and 1.6 steals per game in the tournament.On June 23, 2008, he was named to the USA Men's Senior National Team for the 2008 Summer Olympics. This was his first time going to the Olympics. Bryant scored 20 points, including 13 in the fourth quarter, along with six assists, as Team USA defeated Spain 118\u2013107 in the gold medal game on August 24, 2008, for its first gold medal in a worldwide competition since the 2000 Olympics. He averaged 15.0 points, 2.8 rebounds, and 2.1 assists while shooting .462 from the field in eight Olympic contests.\nBryant rejoined the national team for the 2012 Summer Olympics. After winning another gold medal, Bryant decided to retire from the team. He finished his national team career with a record of 26-0 across three tournaments, winning a gold medal each time.\n\n\n== Player profile ==\n\nBryant primarily played as a shooting guard. He was listed at 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) and 212 pounds (96 kg), though Bryant himself said that he was 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m), or \"probably\" 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) in shoes. He was often cited as one of the most dangerous scorers in the NBA. Bryant has drawn frequent comparisons to Jordan, after whom he modeled his playing style. Like Jordan, he became most known for shooting a fall-away jump shot. Chris Ballard of Sports Illustrated described another of Bryant's most famous moves as the \"jab step-and-pause\": Bryant jabbed his non-pivot foot forward to let the defender relax, but instead of bringing the jab foot back, he pushed off of it and drove around his opponent to get to the basket.Bryant established a reputation for taking shots in the closing moments of tight games, even when he was double or triple-teamed, and was noted as one of the premier closers in the NBA. In a 2012 annual survey of NBA general managers, Bryant was selected for the 10th consecutive season as the player general managers would want to take a clutch shot with a game on the line.Bryant enjoyed being the villain, and reveled in being booed and then silencing the crowd with his play. His ability to make difficult shots has also drawn criticism of his shot selection. Throughout his career, Bryant was disparaged for being a selfish, high-volume shooter; he missed more field goal attempts in his career than any other player in NBA history. Phil Jackson, who coached Bryant for many years, stated that Bryant \"tends to force the action, especially when the game isn't going his way. When his shot is off, Kobe will pound away relentlessly until his luck turns.\" According to Bryant, \"I would go 0 for 30 before I would go 0 for 9; 0 for 9 means you beat yourself, you psyched yourself out of the game.\"In addition to his abilities on offense, Bryant also established himself as a standout defensive player. Bryant rarely drew charges when he played defense, which he believed spared his body and contributed to his longevity. Some critics have suggested that Bryant's defensive accolades in his later years were based more on his reputation than his actual play.Bryant was also lauded for his work ethic. Throughout his first 16 seasons, his body was resilient, and he exhibited a high pain threshold while often playing through injuries. A fierce competitor, Bryant made opponents and teammates alike the objects of his scorn. Many players have considered him difficult to play with because of his high level of commitment and performance. According to sportswriter Mark Heisler of Forbes, \"circa 2004\u20132007, Kobe was the most alienated superstar the NBA had ever seen.\" He did, however, lead the Lakers to two championships after the departure of Shaquille O'Neal; during this period, he became more of a mentor to his teammates than he had been earlier in his career. Bryant's longtime head coach Phil Jackson noted that the biggest difference between his first and second stints in coaching the Lakers was if Bryant talked to teammates in his earlier years with the Lakers, it was usually, \"Give me the damn ball.\" During the latter period, \"[Bryant] embraced the team and his teammates, calling them up when we were on the road and inviting them out to dinner. It was as if the other players were now his partners, not his personal spear-carriers.\"\n\n\n== NBA career statistics ==\nSource:\n\n\n=== Regular season ===\n\n\n=== Playoffs ===\n\n\n== Basketball legacy ==\n\nBryant was called \"one of the greatest players in the history of our game\" by NBA commissioner Adam Silver, and The New York Times wrote that he had \"one of the most decorated careers in the history of the sport.\" Reuters called him \"arguably the best player of his generation\", while both Sporting News and TNT named him their NBA player of the decade for the 2000s. In 2008 and again in 2016, ESPN ranked him the second-greatest shooting guard of all time after Jordan. Players including Kevin Durant, Dirk Nowitzki, Dwyane Wade, and Derrick Rose called Bryant their generation's version of Jordan. The Press-Enterprise described Bryant as \"maybe the greatest Laker in the organization's history\". He was the Lakers' all-time leading scorer, and his five titles are tied for the most in franchise history. Both numbers he wore during his career, 8 and 24, were retired by the Lakers on December 18, 2017.With career averages of 25.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.7 assists, and 1.4 steals per game, he was considered one of the most complete players in NBA history. He was the first player in NBA history to have at least 30,000 career points and 6,000 career assists, and was one of only four players with 25,000 points, 6,000 rebounds, and 6,000 assists. Bryant led the NBA in scoring during the 2005\u201306 and 2006\u201307 seasons. His 81-point performance against Toronto in 2006 was the second-highest in NBA history, behind only Chamberlain's 100. He scored at least 50 points 24 times in his career, which is third in league history behind Jordan (31) and Chamberlain (118); six times Bryant scored at least 60. He was just the third player in NBA history to average 40 points in a calendar month, which he accomplished four times. Bryant was voted the league MVP in 2008 and led his team to the 2008 NBA Finals as the first seed in the Western Conference. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, he won a gold medal as a member of the U.S. men's basketball team, occasionally referred to as \"The Redeem Team\". He won another gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics. He led the Lakers to two more championships in 2009 and 2010, winning the Finals MVP award on both occasions.\nBryant was an 18-time All-Star, which ranks second behind only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 19. He was chosen a record 18 straight times, each time as a starter. On four occasions (2003, 2011, 2013, 2016) he was the leading vote-getter. Four times Bryant was named the All-Star MVP, a record he shares with Bob Pettit. He was selected to the All-NBA Team on 15 occasions, tied for the most with Abdul-Jabbar and Tim Duncan, and his 11 first-team honors are tied for the second-most with Karl Malone. Bryant was also a 12-time All-Defensive Team selection, trailing only Duncan's 15, and nine times he was named to the All-Defensive First Team, tied with Jordan, Garnett, and Gary Payton for the most all time. He was the first guard to play 20 seasons in the NBA. He also won the NBA Slam Dunk Contest in 1997 and was its youngest winner. In his career, Bryant scored 40-plus points in 121 games, and 21 times he recorded a triple-double.Following his death, on February 15, 2020, commissioner Adam Silver announced that the NBA All-Star Game MVP Award would be renamed to the NBA All-Star Game Kobe Bryant MVP Award in honor of Bryant.\n\n\n== Off the court ==\n\n\n=== Personal life ===\n\nBryant was the youngest of three children. He grew up with two older sisters, Sharia and Shaya, and had a close relationship with them until his death.In November 1999, 21-year-old Bryant met 17-year-old Vanessa Laine while she was working as a background dancer on the Tha Eastsidaz music video \"G'd Up\". Bryant was in the building and working on his debut album. The two began dating and became engaged six months later in May 2000, while Laine was still a senior at Marina High School in Huntington Beach, California. To avoid media scrutiny, she finished high school through independent study. According to Vanessa's cousin Laila Laine, there was no prenuptial agreement. Vanessa said Bryant \"loved her too much for one\".They married on April 18, 2001, at St. Edward the Confessor Catholic Church in Dana Point, California. The wedding was not attended by Bryant's parents, his two sisters, his longtime advisor and agent Arn Tellem, or his Laker teammates. Bryant's parents were opposed to the marriage for a number of reasons. Reportedly Bryant's parents had problems with him marrying so young, especially to a woman who was not African-American. This disagreement resulted in an estrangement period of over two years, which ended when the couple's first daughter was born.The Bryants' first child was born in January 2003. The birth resulted in a reconciliation between Bryant and his parents. Due to an ectopic pregnancy, Vanessa suffered a miscarriage in the spring of 2005. Their second daughter, Gianna Maria-Onore (also referred to as \"Gigi\"), was born in May 2006. On December 16, 2011, Vanessa Bryant filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences, and the couple requested joint custody of their daughters. On January 11, 2013, Bryant and his wife both announced via social media that they had called off their divorce. In early December 2016, Vanessa gave birth to their third daughter, and in January 2019 the Bryants announced they were expecting a fourth daughter. Their daughter was born in June 2019.Bryant was a practicing Catholic. He said his faith and a priest helped him through difficult times, such as the period following his accusation of rape. A Catholic cantor said she was inspired by Bryant's faith, and the respect that he showed her. Bryant and his family were regular attendees at Our Lady Queen of Angels Catholic Church in Newport Beach. Bryant and his daughter, Gianna, received the Eucharist together just hours before they died.Bryant was multilingual. He was fluent in English, Italian and Spanish. Bryant assigned himself the nickname of \"Black Mamba\", citing a desire for his basketball skills to mimic the eponymous snake's ability to \"strike with 99% accuracy at maximum speed, in rapid succession.\" During the 2012\u201313 season, he began referring to himself as \"vino\" to describe how his play had been aging like a fine wine.In January 2002, Bryant bought a Mediterranean-style house for $4 million, located on a cul-de-sac in Newport Coast, Newport Beach. He sold the house in May 2015.In 2013, Bryant had a legal disagreement with an auction house over memorabilia from his early years that his mother had put up for auction. Bryant's mother received $450,000 from the auction house for the items, and contended Bryant had given her the rights to the items he had remaining in her home. However, Bryant's lawyers asked the auction house to return the items. Before the scheduled trial, a settlement was reached allowing the auction house the sale of less than 10% of the items. Bryant's parents apologized to him for the misunderstanding in a written statement, and appreciated the financial support he had given them over the years.Bryant was a lifelong fan of his hometown NFL team, the Philadelphia Eagles. He was also a fan of soccer teams Barcelona, AC Milan and Manchester City.According to Forbes, Bryant's $680 million in career earnings was the most ever by a team athlete during their playing career.\n\n\n==== Sexual assault case ====\n\nIn the summer of 2003, the sheriff's office of Eagle, Colorado, arrested Bryant in connection with an investigation of a sexual assault complaint filed by a 19-year-old hotel employee. Bryant had checked into The Lodge and Spa at Cordillera in Eagle County in advance of undergoing knee surgery nearby. The accuser stated that Bryant raped her in his hotel room the night before Bryant was to have the procedure. Bryant admitted to an adulterous sexual encounter with his accuser but denied her sexual assault allegation.The accusation tarnished Bryant's reputation, and the public's perception of him plummeted; his endorsement contracts with McDonald's and Nutella were terminated. Sales for Bryant's replica jersey fell significantly. However, in September 2004, the assault case was dropped by prosecutors after the accuser decided not to testify at the trial. Afterward, Bryant agreed to apologize to her for the incident, including his public mea culpa:\nAlthough I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.\nThe accuser filed a separate civil lawsuit against Bryant, which the two sides settled privately.\n\n\n=== Endorsements ===\n\nBefore starting the 1996\u201397 season, Bryant signed a six-year contract with Adidas that was worth approximately $48 million. His first signature shoe was the Equipment KB 8. Bryant's other, earlier endorsements included deals with The Coca-Cola Company to endorse their Sprite soft drink, appearing in advertisements for McDonald's, promoting Spalding's new NBA Infusion Ball, Upper Deck, Italian chocolate company Ferrero SpA's brand Nutella, Russell Corporation, and appearing on his own series of video games by Nintendo. Many companies like McDonald's and Ferrero SpA terminated his contracts when rape allegations against him became public. A notable exception was Nike, Inc., who had signed him to a five-year, $40\u201345 million contract just before the incident. However, they refused to use his image or market a new shoe of his for the year but eventually did start promoting Bryant once his image recovered two years later. He has since resumed endorsement deals with The Coca-Cola Company, through their subsidiary Energy Brands, to promote their Vitamin Water brand of drinks. Bryant was also the cover athlete for NBA '07: Featuring the Life Vol. 2 and appeared in commercials for the video games Guitar Hero World Tour (with Tony Hawk, Michael Phelps, and Alex Rodriguez) in 2008 and Call of Duty: Black Ops (alongside Jimmy Kimmel) in 2010.In a 2008 video promoting Nike's Hyperdunk shoes, Bryant appears to jump over a speeding Aston Martin. The stunt was considered to be fake, and the Los Angeles Times said a real stunt would probably be a violation of Bryant's Lakers contract. After promoting Nike's Hyperdunk shoes, Bryant came out with the fourth edition of his signature line by Nike, the Zoom Kobe IV. In 2010 Nike launched another shoe, Nike Zoom Kobe V. In 2009, Bryant signed a deal with Nubeo to market the \"Black Mamba collection\", a line of sports/luxury watches that range from $25,000 to $285,000. On February 9, 2009, Bryant was featured on the cover of ESPN The Magazine. However, it was not for anything basketball related; rather, it was about Bryant being a big fan of FC Barcelona. CNN estimated Bryant's endorsement deals in 2007 to be worth $16 million a year. In 2010, Bryant was ranked third behind Tiger Woods and Jordan in Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid athletes with $48 million.\n\nOn December 13, 2010, Bryant signed a two-year endorsement deal with Turkey's national airline, Turkish Airlines. The deal involved Bryant being in a promotional film to be aired in over 80 countries in addition to his being used in digital, print and billboard advertising.In September 2012, Bryant shot a commercial for Turkish Airlines with FC Barcelona star Lionel Messi. In the airline's latest commercial, the duo competes to win the attention of a young boy. In 2013, Forbes listed Bryant the fifth highest paid sports star in the world behind Floyd Mayweather, Cristiano Ronaldo, LeBron James and Lionel Messi.Bryant appeared as the cover athlete for the following video games:\n\nKobe Bryant in NBA Courtside\nNBA Courtside 2: Featuring Kobe Bryant\nNBA Courtside 2002\nNBA 3 On 3 Featuring Kobe Bryant\nNBA '07: Featuring the Life Vol. 2\nNBA '09: The Inside\nNBA 2K10\nNBA 2K17 (Legend Edition; Legend Edition Gold)Bryant was also one of the global ambassadors of the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup in China.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nIn high school, Bryant was a member of a rap group called CHEIZAW, named after the Chi Sah gang in the martial arts film Kid with the Golden Arm. The group was signed by Sony Entertainment, but the company's ultimate goal was to eliminate the group and have Bryant record on his own. The label wanted to capitalize on Bryant's youth and NBA fame. He performed at a 1997 concert by Sway & King Tech and recorded a verse for a remix of Brian McKnight's \"Hold Me\". Bryant even appeared on Lakers teammate O'Neal's Respect, starting the track \"3 X's Dope\", though Bryant's name was not listed on the credits.Sony pushed Bryant from his roots of underground hip hop into a more radio-friendly sound. His debut album, Visions, was scheduled to release in the spring of 2000. The first single, \"K.O.B.E'\", featured supermodel Tyra Banks singing the hook. The single debuted in January 2000, and was performed at NBA All-Star Weekend that month; the song was not well received. Sony abandoned plans for the album, which was never released, and dropped Bryant later that year. The Sony president who originally signed Bryant had already left, and Bryant's other backers had mostly abandoned him. Afterward, Bryant co-founded an independent record label, Heads High Entertainment, but it folded within a year. In 1999, Bryant appeared on a remix of \"Say My Name\" by Destiny's Child on the Maxi single version of the song.In 2011, Bryant was featured in Taiwanese singer Jay Chou's single, \"The Heaven and Earth Challenge\" (\u5929\u5730\u4e00\u9b25, pronounced \"Tian Di Yi Dou\"). The proceeds for downloads of both the single and ringtones were donated to impoverished schools for basketball facilities and equipment. The music video of the single also features Bryant. The song was also used by Sprite in its 2011 marketing campaign in China.In 2009, rapper Lil Wayne titled a song \"Kobe Bryant\". Similarly, in 2010, rapper Sho Baraka released a song called \"Kobe Bryant On'em\", which was featured on his album Lions and Liars.\n\n\n=== Television ===\nBryant made his acting debut in 1996, appearing in an episode of Moesha. He had met the show's star, Brandy, earlier in the year at a Nike All-Star basketball game, and then a couple of months later in May 1996, Brandy was Bryant's date to his high school senior prom.  That same year, he guest starred as himself on an episode of Arli$$ (episode: \"What About the Fans?\") and Sister, Sister (episode: \"Kid-Napped\"). In 1997, he appeared on an episode of Hang Time, this was followed by a guest appearance on the Nickelodeon sketch comedy series All That (1998), and then appeared on MTV's Ridiculousness in 2019.Beginning in 2018, Bryant wrote, produced and hosted the television series Detail, which aired for multiple seasons on ESPN and ESPN+. It featured his insights into the game of basketball and in-depth analyses of games and individual players.\n\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\nBryant was the official ambassador for After-School All-Stars (ASAS), an American non-profit organization that provides comprehensive after-school programs to children in thirteen US cities. Bryant also started the Kobe Bryant China Fund which partnered with the Soong Ching Ling Foundation, a charity backed by the Chinese government. The Kobe Bryant China Fund raises money within China earmarked for education and health programs. On November 4, 2010, Bryant appeared alongside Zach Braff at the Call of Duty: Black Ops launch event at the Santa Monica Airport, where they presented a $1 million check to the Call of Duty Endowment, an Activision-founded nonprofit organization that helps veterans transition to civilian careers after their military service has ended.Together with his wife, Bryant founded the Kobe and Vanessa Bryant Family Foundation (KVBFF). Its goals are \"helping young people in need, encouraging the development of physical and social skills through sports and assisting the homeless\". Bryant spoke of the injustice aimed at homeless people who are blamed for their situation, saying that homelessness should not be ignored or made a low priority. Bryant said he wanted more out of life than just a successful basketball career.Bryant was a founding donor of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. During his lifetime, Bryant granted over two hundred requests for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\n\n\n=== Business ventures ===\nBryant established Kobe Inc. to own and grow brands in the sports industry. The initial investment was a 10% stake in the Bodyarmor SuperDrink company for $6 million in March 2014. The headquarters are in Newport Beach, California. With The Coca-Cola Company purchasing a minority stake in the company in August 2018, the valuation of Bryant's stake rose to approximately $200 million.In 2013, Bryant launched a production company called Granity Studios, which developed different media, ranging from films, to television shows, to novels.On August 22, 2016, Bryant and his business partner Jeff Stibel launched Bryant-Stibel, a venture capital firm focused on different businesses including media, data, gaming, and technology, with $100 million in funding. In 2018, Bryant and Sports Academy launched Mamba Sports Academy, a joint athletic-training business venture. The academy established locations in Thousand Oaks and Redondo Beach, California.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nBryant was the subject of Spike Lee's 2009 documentary film Kobe Doin' Work, which chronicled Bryant during the 2007-08 NBA season.In 2018, Bryant became the first African-American to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film and the first former professional athlete to be nominated and to win an Academy Award in any category for his film Dear Basketball. The film also won the Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject and a Sports Emmy Award. The film was produced by Bryant's production company, Granity Studios. In addition to future animation projects, he had been in talks with animator veteran Bruce Smith for the last six months before his death about starting his own animation studio.\n\n\n=== Books ===\nOn October 23, 2018, Bryant's book The Mamba Mentality: How I Play, with photographs and afterword by Andrew D. Bernstein, an introduction by Phil Jackson, and a foreword by Pau Gasol, was published by MCD / Farrar, Straus and Giroux. The book looks back on his career with photos and his reflections.At the time of his death, he was working with Brazilian author Paulo Coelho on a children's book aimed at inspiring underprivileged children. After Bryant's death, Coelho deleted the draft, saying in an interview that \"it didn't make any sense to publish without him.\" He did not say how many pages had been written or whether the book had a title.Bryant also co-wrote/produced several young adult novels through Granity Studios: The Wizenard Series: Training Camp, Legacy and the Queen, and Epoca: The Tree of Ecrof. A fourth novel, The Wizenard Series: Season One, was released posthumously in March 2020.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\n\n=== Accident ===\nAt 9:06 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on January 26, 2020, a Sikorsky S-76 helicopter departed from John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, with nine people aboard: Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, six family friends, and the pilot. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California Secretary of State business database. The group was traveling to Camarillo Airport in Ventura County for a basketball game at Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks.Due to light rain and fog that morning, the Los Angeles Police Department helicopters and most other air traffic were grounded. The flight tracker showed that the helicopter circled above the L.A. Zoo due to heavy air traffic in the area. At 9:30 a.m. the pilot contacted the Burbank Airport's control tower, notifying the tower of the situation and was told he was \"flying too low\" to be tracked by radar. At that time, the helicopter experienced extreme fog and turned south towards the mountains. At 9:40 a.m. the helicopter climbed rapidly from 1,200 to 2,000 feet (370 to 610 m), flying at 161 knots (298 km/h; 185 mph).At 9:45 a.m., the helicopter crashed into the side of a mountain in Calabasas, about 30 miles (48 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, and began burning. Bryant, his daughter, and the other seven occupants were killed.  Initial reports indicated that the helicopter crashed in the hills above Calabasas in heavy fog. Witnesses reported hearing a helicopter struggling before crashing.\n\n\n=== Investigations ===\nThe cause of the crash is still unknown, as the helicopter was not equipped with a black box. The Federal Aviation Administration, National Transportation Safety Board, and the FBI have launched investigations into the crash. On January 28, Bryant's identity was officially confirmed using fingerprints. The following day, the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner stated that the official cause of death for him and the eight others on the helicopter was blunt force trauma.\n\n\n=== Tributes and funeral services ===\nOn February 7, Bryant and his daughter were buried in a private funeral in Pacific View Memorial Park in the Corona del Mar neighborhood of Newport Beach, California. A public memorial service was held on February 24 (2/24, marking both Kobe's and Gianna's jersey numbers) at Staples Center with Jimmy Kimmel hosting. Speakers at the service included Vanessa, Jordan, O'Neal, Diana Taurasi and Geno Auriemma.The NBA had postponed the Lakers' game against the Clippers just two days after the accident on January 28 \u2013 the first time an NBA game had been postponed for any reason since the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing led to the postponement of a Celtics game. On January 30, the first game after the crash was played at Staples Center between the Clippers and the Kings, the Clippers honored Bryant before the game, with Southern California native Paul George narrating a video tribute to Bryant. The next day, the Lakers played their first game after the crash against the Trail Blazers. Ahead of the match, the Lakers paid tribute to Bryant and all who lost their lives in the crash with a ceremony held just before tip off, with Usher singing \"Amazing Grace\" and Boyz II Men singing the National Anthem, while Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth reunited to perform \"See You Again\" \u2013 originally their tribute to Paul Walker after his death while filming Furious 7 \u2013 at halftime. James also delivered a speech to the crowd before the game, and every player in the Lakers starting lineup was announced with Bryant's name. The game was the second-most-watched in ESPN history, averaging 4.41 million viewers.Also, beginning with the Spurs and the Raptors in their game in San Antonio on the day of the crash, teams paid tribute to Bryant at the start of their games with intentional on-court violations referring to his uniform numbers on their first possession \u2013 either a 24-second shot clock or an 8-second backcourt violation. On February 15, NBA commissioner Adam Silver announced that the All-Star Game MVP Award would be renamed to the NBA All-Star Game Kobe Bryant Most Valuable Player in Bryant's honor.Elsewhere, the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards went ahead as scheduled at the Staples Center on the day of the crash, but included tributes by multiple artists and groups, including host Alicia Keys opening the show with a tribute speech and joining Boyz II Men to sing \"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday\". In May, the Mamba Sports Academy was renamed to Sports Academy out of respect for Bryant.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMcGrath, Ben (March 31, 2014). \"The fourth quarter : Kobe Bryant confronts a long\u2014and possibly painful\u2014goodbye\".

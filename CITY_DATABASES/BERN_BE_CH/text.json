        "wiki": "Bern [b\u025brn] (listen) (Alemannic German: B\u00e4rn [b\u0325\u00e6\u02d0rn]; French: Berne [b\u025b\u0281n] (listen); Italian: Berna [\u02c8b\u025brna]; Romansh: Berna [\u02c8b\u025brn\u0250] (listen)) is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their \"federal city\", in German Bundesstadt, French ville f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, and Italian citt\u00e0 federale. With a population of about 140,000 (as of 2019), Bern is the fifth-most populous city in Switzerland. The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014. The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000. Bern is also the capital of the canton of Bern, the second-most populous of Switzerland's cantons.\nThe official language in Bern is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the most-spoken language is an Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Bernese German.\nIn 1983, the historic old town (in German: Altstadt) in the centre of Bern became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe etymology of the name \"Bern\" is uncertain. According to the local legend, based on folk etymology, Berchtold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen, the founder of the city of Bern, vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt, and this turned out to be a bear. It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona, which at the time was known as Bern in Middle High German. As a result of the finding of the Bern zinc tablet in the 1980s, it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin, possibly *berna \"cleft\". The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of Bern from at least the 1220s. The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the B\u00e4rengraben dates to the 1440s.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nNo archaeological evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today\u2032s city centre prior to the 12th century has been found so far. In antiquity, a Celtic oppidum stood on the Engehalbinsel (peninsula) north of Bern, fortified since the second century BC (late La T\u00e8ne period), thought to be one of the 12 oppida of the Helvetii mentioned by Caesar. During the Roman era, a Gallo-Roman vicus was on the same site. The Bern zinc tablet has the name Brenodor (\"dwelling of Breno\"). In the Early Middle Ages, a settlement in B\u00fcmpliz, now a city district of Bern, was some 4 km (2 mi) from the medieval city.\nThe medieval city is a foundation of the Z\u00e4hringer ruling family, which rose to power in Upper Burgundy in the 12th century. According to 14th-century historiography (Cronica de Berno, 1309), Bern was founded in 1191 by Berthold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen.\nIn 1218, after Berthold died without an heir, Bern was made a free imperial city by the Goldene Handfeste of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II.\n\n\n=== Old Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nIn 1353, Bern joined the Swiss Confederacy, becoming one of the eight cantons of the formative period of 1353 to 1481.\nBern invaded and conquered Aargau in 1415 and Vaud in 1536, as well as other smaller territories, thereby becoming the largest city-state north of the Alps; by the 18th century, it comprised most of what is today the canton of Bern and the canton of Vaud.\nThe city grew out towards the west of the boundaries of the peninsula formed by the river Aare. The Zytglogge tower marked the western boundary of the city from 1191 until 1256, when the K\u00e4figturm took over this role until 1345. It was, in turn, succeeded by the Christoffelturm (formerly located close to the site of the modern-day railway station) until 1622. During the time of the Thirty Years' War, two new fortifications \u2013 the so-called big and small Schanze (entrenchment) \u2013 were built to protect the whole area of the peninsula.\nAfter a major blaze in 1405, the city's original wooden buildings were gradually replaced by half-timbered houses and subsequently the sandstone buildings which came to be characteristic for the Old Town. Despite the waves of pestilence that hit Europe in the 14th century, the city continued to grow, mainly due to immigration from the surrounding countryside.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nBern was occupied by French troops in 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars, when it was stripped of parts of its territories. It regained control of the Bernese Oberland in 1802, and following the Congress of Vienna of 1814, it newly acquired the Bernese Jura. At this time, it once again became the largest canton of the Confederacy as it stood during the Restoration and until the secession of the canton of Jura in 1979.\nBern was made the Federal City (seat of the Federal Assembly) within the new Swiss federal state in 1848.\nA number of congresses of the socialist First and Second Internationals were held in Bern, particularly during World War I when Switzerland was neutral; see Bern International.\nThe city's population rose from about 5,000 in the 15th century to about 12,000 by 1800 and to above 60,000 by 1900, passing the 100,000 mark during the 1920s.\nPopulation peaked during the 1960s at 165,000 and has since decreased slightly, to below 130,000 by 2000.\nAs of September 2017, the resident population stood at 142,349, of which 100,000 were Swiss citizens and 42,349 (31%) resident foreigners. A further estimated 350,000 people live in the immediate urban agglomeration.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBern lies on the Swiss plateau in the canton of Bern, slightly west of the centre of Switzerland and 20 km (12 mi) north of the Bernese Alps. The countryside around Bern was formed by glaciers during the most recent ice age. The two mountains closest to Bern are Gurten with a height of 864 m (2,835 ft) and Bantiger with a height of 947 m (3,107 ft). The site of the old observatory in Bern is the point of origin of the CH1903 coordinate system at 46\u00b057\u203208.66\u2033N 7\u00b026\u203222.50\u2033E.\nThe city was originally built on a hilly peninsula surrounded by the river Aare, but outgrew natural boundaries by the 19th century. A number of bridges have been built to allow the city to expand beyond the Aare.\nBern is built on very uneven ground. An elevation difference of up to 60 metres exists between the inner city districts on the Aare (Matte, Marzili) and the higher ones (Kirchenfeld, L\u00e4nggasse).\nBern has an area, as of 2009, of 51.62 km2 (19.93 sq mi). Of this area, 9.79 km2 (3.78 sq mi) or 19.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 17.33 km2 (6.69 sq mi) or 33.6% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 23.25 km2 (8.98 sq mi) or 45.0% is settled (buildings or roads), 1.06 km2 (0.41 sq mi) or 2.1% is either rivers or lakes, and 0.16 km2 (0.062 sq mi) or 0.3% is unproductive land.Of the developed area of Bern, 3.6% consists of industrial buildings, 21.7% housing and other buildings, and 12.6% is devoted to transport infrastructure. Power and water infrastructure, as well as other special developed areas, made up 1.1% of the city, while another 6.0% consists of parks, green belts, and sports fields.\nOf Bern's total land area, 32.8% is heavily forested. Of the agricultural land, 14.3% is used for growing crops and 4.0% is designated to be used as pasture. Local rivers and streams provide all the water in the municipality.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification, Bern has a humid continental climate (Dfb) closely bordering on an oceanic climate (Cfb).\nThe closest weather station near Bern is located in the municipality of Zollikofen, about 5 kilometres (3 mi) north of the city centre. The warmest month for Bern is July, with a daily mean temperature of 18.3 \u00b0C (64.9 \u00b0F), and a daily maximum temperature of 24.3 \u00b0C (75.7 \u00b0F).

It is composed of five councillors (German: Gemeinderat/-r\u00e4tin, French: conseiller/conseill\u00e8re municipal(e)), each presiding over a directorate (de: Direktion, fr: direction) comprising several departments and bureaus. The president of the executive department acts as mayor (de: Stadtpr\u00e4sident, fr: Le Maire).

Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the City Council are carried by the Municipal Council. The regular election of the Municipal Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. Any resident of Bern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. Contrary to most other municipalities, the executive government in Berne is selected by means of a system of Proporz. The mayor is elected as such as well by public election while the heads of the other directorates are assigned by the collegiate. The executive body holds its meetings in the Erlacherhof, built by architect Albrecht St\u00fcrler after 1747.As of 2017, Bern's Municipal Council is made up of two representatives of the SP (Social Democratic Party), and one each of CVP (Christian Democratic Party), GFL (Gr\u00fcne Freie Liste a.k.a.

Any resident of Bern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the City Council. The parliament holds its meetings in the Stadthaus (Town Hall).The last regular election of the City Council was held on 27 November 2016 for the mandate period (German: Legislatur, French: la l\u00e9gislature) from 2017 to 2020.

        "wiki": "The Old City (German: Altstadt) is the medieval city center of Bern, Switzerland. Built on a narrow hill surrounded on three sides by the river Aare, its compact layout has remained essentially unchanged since its construction during the twelfth to the fifteenth century. Despite a major fire in 1405, after which much of the city was rebuilt in sandstone, and substantial construction efforts in the eighteenth century, Bern's old city has retained its medieval character.\nThe Old City is home to Switzerland's tallest minster as well as other churches, bridges and a large collection of Renaissance fountains. In addition to many historical buildings, the seats of the federal, cantonal and municipal government are also situated in the Old City. It is a UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site since 1983 due to the compact and generally intact medieval core and is an excellent example of incorporating the modern world into a medieval city. Numerous buildings in the Old City have been designated as Swiss Cultural Properties of National Significance, as well as the entire Old City.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest settlements in the valley of the Aare date back to the Neolithic period. During the second century BC the valley was settled by the Helvetii. Following the Roman conquest of Helvetia a small Roman settlement was established near the Old City. This settlement was abandoned during the second century AD. From that time until the founding of Bern the area remained sparsely settled.\n\n\n=== Founding ===\n\nThe history of the city of Bern proper begins with its founding by Duke Berchtold V of Z\u00e4hringen in 1191. Local legend has it that the duke vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt, which turned out to be a bear. Both the name of the city (Bern can stand for B\u00e4r(e) n, bears) and its heraldic beast, come from this legend. At that time, much of today's Switzerland (then considered part of southern Burgundy) was under the authority of the house of Z\u00e4hringen. The Z\u00e4hringer leaders, although with no actual duchy of their own, were styled dukes by decree of the German king and exercised imperial power south of the Rhine. To establish their position there, they founded or expanded numerous settlements, including Fribourg (in 1157), Bern, Burgdorf and Morat.The area chosen by Berchtold V was a hilly peninsula surrounded by the Aare on three sides. This location made the city easy to defend and influenced the later development of the city. The long, narrow shape of the peninsula made the city develop as several long, parallel rows of houses. The only major cross streets (going north and south) developed along the city walls, which were moved to allow the city to expand. Therefore, the cross streets mark the stages of development in the Old City of Bern.\nOn the eastern end of the peninsula a small fort, called Castle Nydegg, was founded by Berchtold IV in the second half of the twelfth century. Either when the fort was built or in 1191, the city of Bern was founded around the eastern end of the peninsula.\n\n\n=== First expansion \u2013 1191 ===\nThe first expansion of Bern occurred as the city was founded. Most likely the first city started at Nydegg Castle and reached to the Zytglogge (Swiss German: clock tower). The city was divided by three longitudinal streets, which stretched from the Castle to the city wall. Both the position of the town church and the shape of the eaves were typical for a Z\u00e4hringer city.During the first half of the thirteenth century two additional streets (Brunngasse and Herrengasse) were added. Brunngasse was a semi-circular street on the north edge of the city, while Herrengasse was on the south side of the city. A wood bridge was built over the Aare which allowed increased trade and limited settlements on the east bank of the river.\n\n\n=== Second expansion \u2013 1255 to 1260 ===\nDuring the second half of the thirteenth century, the riverside foundation of Nydegg Castle was strengthened and connected to a new west city wall. This wall was added to protect the four streets, known as the New City or Savoy City, that had sprung up outside the Zytglogge. The new west wall included a gate known as the K\u00e4figturm (German: Prison Tower).\nAround 1268 Nydegg Castle was destroyed, and the city expanded into the area formerly occupied by the castle. In the south-east part of the peninsula below the main hill that the rest of the Old City occupied, a section known as Matte grew up.\n\n\n=== Third expansion \u2013 1344 to 1346 ===\nFor almost a century the K\u00e4figturm remained the western boundary of Bern. However, as the city grew, people began settling outside the city walls. In 1344 the city started to build a third wall to protect the growing population. By 1346 the project was finished and six new streets were protected by a wall and the Christoffelturm (German: St. Christopher Tower). The Christoffelturm remained the western border of Bern until the nineteenth century. From 1622 to 1634 a series of defensive walls and strong points were added outside the Christoffelturm. These defensive walls, known as the Grosse Schanze and Kleine Schanze (large and small redoubts respectively) as well as the Schanzegraben (redoubt ditch or moat), were never used as living space for the city, though the Schanzengraben was used for a while to house the B\u00e4rengraben.\n\n\n=== Great Fire of 1405 ===\n\nBern was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites because of \"an exceptionally coherent planning concept\" and because \"the medieval town...has retained its original character\". Bern owes its coherent planning concept and its famous arcades to a disaster. In 1405 a fire broke out in Bern, which was mostly wooden buildings at the time. The fire raced through the city and destroyed most of the buildings in town. In the wake of this disaster, the city was rebuilt with all stone houses in similar medieval styles. The arcades were added throughout the fifteenth century as houses expanded in the upper stories out into the street. Throughout the next three centuries houses were modified, but the essential elements (stone construction, arcades) remained.\nIn the sixteenth century, as Bern became a powerful and rich city-state, public fountains were added to Bern. A number of fountains were topped with large allegorical statues, eleven of which are still visible in the city. The fountains served to show the power and wealth of the city, as well as providing fresh water for the citizens of the city. Overall, the city remained nearly unchanged for the next two centuries.\n\n\n=== Expansion and destruction of the Christoffelturm ===\n\nBy the early nineteenth century, Bern had expanded as far as it could within the old city walls. An increasing number of people were living outside the city walls in neighbouring communities. Throughout the nineteenth century, this ring of modern cities grew up around the Old City without forcing it to demolish the medieval city core. However, the growth around the Old City did lead to several projects.\nWithin the Old City of Bern, many of the old stone buildings were renovated without changing the outer appearance. The bell tower was finally finished on the M\u00fcnster (German: Minister or Cathedral), making it the tallest church in Switzerland. A new bridge was built across the Aare at Nydegg in 1842 to 1844. The new bridge was larger than the, still standing, old bridge, called Untertorbr\u00fccke, which had been built in 1461 to 1487.\nOne of the biggest projects was the proposed destruction of the Christoffelturm to open up the west end of the city. Following a very close vote, the decision to remove the Christoffelturm and city wall was made on 15 December 1864. In the spring of the following year Gottlieb Ott led the team that removed the tower. Currently, the former location of the Christoffelturm is a large road interchange, a major bus station and the central train station.\n\n\n=== Federal Capital in the twentieth century ===\n\nFollowing the Sonderbundskrieg (German: Separate Alliance War) in 1847, Switzerland established a federal constitution and Bern was chosen as the capital of the new Federal State. The vote to make Bern the federal city was met with little enthusiasm (419 vs 313 votes) in Bern due to concerns over the cost. The first Bundesrathaus or Parliament House was built in 1852\u20131857 by the city of Bern in a New-Renaissance style. The mirror image Bundeshaus Ost (East Federal Building) was built in 1884\u20131892. Then, in 1894\u20131902 the domed Parlamentsgeb\u00e4ude or Parliament Building was built between the other two buildings. The three parliament buildings represent the majority of the new, federal construction in the Old City. Most of the other buildings that come with a national capital were placed outside the Old City or were incorporated into existing buildings.\nFor centuries the famous B\u00e4rengraben (German: Bear Pits) were located in the Old City. According to the Bernese historian Valerius Anshelm, the first bears were kept on B\u00e4renplatz (German: Bears' Plaza) in 1513. They were moved from the modern B\u00e4renplatz to the Schanzengraben near the former Christoffelturm in 1764. However, the bears remained in the Old City until the expansion of the new capital forced them out. The bears and the B\u00e4rengraben were moved from the Old City across the Aare on 27 May 1857.In the twentieth century, Bern has had to deal with incorporating the modern world into a medieval city. The plaza where the Christoffelturm used to be, has become the central bus stop for the city. The main train station was built under the plaza, and actually includes some of the foundations from the Christoffelturm and wall in the train station. However, one of the biggest challenges has been integrating automobile traffic into the Old City. Due to the number of important buildings in the Old City and the central location of the Old City, it was impossible to completely close off this area to vehicles. While some streets have remained pedestrian zones, most major streets carry city buses, trams or personal vehicles.\n\n\n== Districts and neighbourhoods ==\n\nThe old city was historically subdivided into four Viertel and four Quartiere. The Viertel were the city's official administrative districts. They ware instituted for tax and defence purposes in the thirteenth century, and ceased to be used in 1798 after the fall of the Ancien R\u00e9gime in Bern.Of greater practical importance were the Quartiere, the four traditional neighbourhoods in which people of similar social and economic rank congregated. They emerged in the late Middle Ages, overlap the Viertel boundaries and remain easily identifiable in today's cityscape.The central and oldest neighbourhood is the Z\u00e4hringerstadt (Z\u00e4hringer town), which contained the medieval city's principal political, economic and spiritual institutions. These were strictly separated: official buildings were situated around the Kreuzgasse (Cross Alley), ecclesiastical buildings were located at the M\u00fcnstergasse (Cathedral Alley) and Herrengasse (Lords' Alley), while guilds and merchants' shops clustered around the central Kramgasse (Grocers Alley) and Gerechtigkeitsgasse (Justice Alley). Junkerngasse (Junker Lane), which is parallel to Gerechtigkeitsgasse, was originally known as Kilchgasse (Church Lane) but was renamed because of number of patricians or untitled nobility which lived on the southern side of the peninsula.\nThe second oldest neighbourhood, the Innere Neustadt (Inner New City), was built during the city's first westward expansion in 1255, between the first western wall guarded by the Zytglogge tower and the second wall, guarded by the K\u00e4figturm. Its central feature is the broad Marktgasse (Market Alley).\n\nSituated in the northeast and southeast of the Aare peninsula, the Nydeggstalden and the Mattequartier together constitute medieval Bern's smallest neighbourhood. Workshops and mercantile activity prevailed in this area, and medieval sources tell of numerous complaints about the ceaseless and apparently nerve-wracking noise of machinery, carts and commerce. The Matte area at the riverside features three artificial channels, through which Aare water was diverted to power three city-owned watermills built in 1360. In the early twentieth century, a small hydroelectric plant was built in that location. Nearby, the busy Schiffl\u00e4ndte (ship landing-place) allowed for the reloading of goods transported by boat up and down the river.The last neighbourhood to be built was the \u00c4ussere Neustadt (Outer New City), which added a third and final layer to Bern's defences starting in 1343. All of these walls, gates and earthworks were demolished in the nineteenth century ending with the destruction of Bern's greatest of its three guard towers, the Christoffelturm. Only the four central streets were lined with residential houses in late medieval times, while the rest of the area was devoted to agriculture and animal husbandry.\n\n\n== Significant buildings ==\nWhile the entire old town of Bern is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, there are a number of buildings and fountains within the city that merit special mention. All of these buildings are also listed in the Swiss Inventory of Cultural Property of National and Regional Significance.\n\n\n=== M\u00fcnster (Cathedral) ===\n\nThe M\u00fcnster of Bern (German: Berner M\u00fcnster) is a Protestant Gothic cathedral located on the south side of the peninsula. Construction on the M\u00fcnster began in 1421 and finished with the bell tower in 1893. The bell tower is 100 m (328 ft) and is the tallest in Switzerland. The largest bell in the bell tower is also the largest bell in Switzerland. This enormous bell, weighing about 10 tons and 247 cm (8.1 ft) in diameter, was cast in 1611 and is still rung every day. It is possible to stand next to the bell when it is rung, but one has to cover one's ears to avoid hearing damage.\n\nAbove the main portal is a rare complete collection of Gothic sculpture. The collection represents the Christian belief in the Last Judgment where the wicked will be separated from the righteous. The large 47 free-standing statues are replicas (the originals are in the Bern History Museum) and the 170 smaller statues are all original.\nThe interior is large, open and fairly empty. Nearly all the art and altars in the cathedral were removed in 1528 during the iconoclasm of the Protestant Reformation. The paintings and statues were dumped in what became the Cathedral Terrace, making the terrace a rich archaeological site. The only major pieces of art that survived the iconoclasm inside the cathedral are the stained glass windows and the choir stalls.\n\nThe stained glass windows date from 1441\u20131450 and are considered the most valuable in Switzerland. The windows include a number of heraldic symbols and religious images as well as an entire \"Dance of Death\" window. This window shows death, as a skeleton, claiming people from all professions and social classes. A \"Dance of Death\" was intended as a reminder that death would come to everyone regardless of wealth or status, and may have been a comfort in a world filled with plagues and wars.\nThe choir, in the eastern side of the Cathedral between the nave and the sanctuary, houses the first Renaissance choir stalls in Switzerland. The stalls are carved with lifelike animals and images of daily life.\n\n\n=== Zytglogge ===\n\nThe Zytglogge is the landmark medieval clock tower in the Old City of Bern. It has existed since about 1218\u20131220 and is one of the most recognisable symbols of Bern. The name Zyglogge is Bernese German and translates as Zeitglocke in Standard German or time bell in English. A \"time bell\" was one of the earliest public timekeeping devices, consisting of a clockwork connected to a hammer that rang a small bell at every full hour. The Zytglogge clock is one of the three oldest clocks in Switzerland.\n\nFollowing the first expansion of Bern, the Zytglogge was the gate tower of the western fortifications. At this time, it was a squat tower of only about 16 m (52 ft) in height which was open in the back. During the second expansion, to the K\u00e4figturm, the Zytglogge wall was removed and the tower was relegated to second-line status. Around 1270\u20131275 an additional 7 m (23 ft) was added to the tower to allow it to overlook the surrounding houses. After the third expansion, to the Christoffelturm, the Zytglogge was converted into a women's prison. Most commonly it was used to house Pfaddendirnen \u2013 \"priests' whores\", women convicted of sexual relations with clerics. At this time, the Zytglogge also received its first slanted roof.\n\nIn the Great Fire of 1405, the tower was completely burned out. The structural damage would not be completely repaired until 1983. The prison cells were abandoned and a clock was installed above the gate. This clock, together with a bell cast in 1405, gave the tower the name of Zytglogge. In the late fifteenth century the tower was decorated with four decorative corner towerlets and heraldic symbols. The astronomical clock was extended to its current state in 1527\u20131530. In addition to the astronomical clock, the Zytglogge features a group of mechanical figures. At three minutes before the hour the figures which include a rooster, a fool, a knight, a piper, a lion and bears, put on a show. The animals chase each other around, the fool rings his bells and the rooster caws. During the day it is common to see small crowds gathered around the foot of the Zytglogge waiting for the show to start.\n\nThe Zytglogge's exterior was repainted by Gotthard Ringgli and Kaspar Haldenstein in 1607\u201310, who introduced the large clock faces that now dominate the east and west fa\u00e7ades of the tower. The corner towerlets were removed again sometime before 1603. In 1770\u201371, the Zytglogge was renovated by Niklaus Hebler and Ludwig Emanuel Zehnder, who refurbished the structure in order to suit the tastes of the late Baroque, giving the tower its contemporary outline.Both fa\u00e7ades were again repainted in the Rococo style by Rudolf von Steiger in 1890. The idealising historicism of the design came to be disliked in the twentieth century, and a 1929 competition produced the fa\u00e7ade designs visible today: on the west fa\u00e7ade, Victor Surbek's fresco \"Beginning of Time\" and on the east fa\u00e7ade, a reconstruction of the 1770 design by Kurt Inderm\u00fchle. In 1981\u201383, the Zytglogge was thoroughly renovated again and generally restored to its 1770 appearance.\n\n\n=== Parliament buildings ===\n\nThe Parliament Building (German: Bundeshaus, French: Palais f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, Italian: Palazzo federale, Latin: Curia Confoederationis Helveticae) is built along the southern edge of the peninsula and straddles the location of the former K\u00e4figturm wall. The building is the used by both the Swiss Federal Council or Executive and Parliament or Federal Assembly of Switzerland. The complex includes the Bundeshaus West (built in 1852\u201357), the central Parliament Building (built in 1894\u20131902) and the Bundeshaus East (built in 1884\u20131892). The central plaza in front of the Parliament building was built into a fountain in 2004. The plaza was paved with granite slabs and 26 water jets, one for each canton, were hidden under the plaza. The design of the plaza has won two international awards\n\nThe central Parliament Building was built to be visible and is topped with several large copper domes. The interior was decorated by 38 artists from every corner of the country. Three major themes tied all the works together. The first theme, national history, is represented by events and persons from Swiss history. This includes the R\u00fctlischwur or the foundation of Switzerland in 1291 and figures such as William Tell, Arnold von Winkelried and Nicholas of Fl\u00fce. The second theme is the fundamental principles that Switzerland was founded on; including independence, freedom, separation of government powers, order and security. The final theme is the cultural and material variety of Switzerland; including politically (represented by Canton flags), geographically and socially.The two chambers where the National Council and the Council of States meet are separated by the Hall of the Dome. The dome itself has an external height of 64 m, and an internal height of 33 m. The mosaic in the center represents the Federal coat of arms along with the Latin motto Unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno (One for all, and all for one), surrounded by the coat of arms of the 22 cantons that existed in 1902. The coat of arms of the Canton of Jura, created in 1979, was placed outside of the mosaic.\n\n\n=== Untertorbr\u00fccke ===\n\nThe Untertorbr\u00fccke (German: Lower Gate bridge) is the oldest bridge in Bern still in existence. The original bridge, most likely a wooden walkway, was built in 1256 and spanned the Aare at the Nydegg Fortress. The bridge was destroyed in a flood in 1460. Within one year, construction began on a new stone bridge. The small Mariakapelle (Mary's Chapel) located in the side of the bridge column on the city side was blessed in 1467. However the bridge wasn't finished until 1490. The new bridge was 52 meters (171 ft) long with the three arches spanning 13.5 m (44 ft), 15.6 m (51 ft) and 13.9 m (46 ft). The bridge was modified several times including the removal of the stone guard rails which were replaced with iron rails in 1818\u201319.Until the construction of the Nydeggbr\u00fccke in 1840, the Untertorbr\u00fccke was the only bridge crossing the Aare near Bern. See List of Aare bridges in Bern.\n\n\n=== Nydegg Church ===\n\nThe original Nydegg Castle was built around 1190 by either Duke Berchtold V. von Z\u00e4hringen or his father Berchtold IV. as part of the city defenses. Following the second expansion, the castle was destroyed by the citizens of Bern in 1268. The castle was located about where the Choir of the church now stands, with the church tower resting on the southern corner of the donjon.From 1341 to 1346 a church with a small steeple was built on the ruins of the castle. Then, between 1480 and 1483 a tower was added to the church. The central nave was rebuilt in 1493 to 1504. In 1529, following the Reformation, the Nydegg Church was used as a warehouse for wood and grain. Later, in 1566, the church was again used for religious services and in 1721 was placed under the M\u00fcnster.\n\n\n=== Holy Ghost Church ===\n\nThe Holy Ghost Church (German: Heiliggeistkirche) is a Swiss Reformed Church at Spitalgasse 44. It is one of largest Swiss Reformed churches in Switzerland. The first church was a chapel built for the Holy Ghost hospital and abbey. The chapel, hospital and abbey were first mentioned in 1228 and at the time sat about 150 meters (490 ft) outside the western gate of the first city wall. This building was replaced by the second church between 1482 and 1496. In 1528 the church was secularized by the reformers and the last two monks at the Abbey were driven out of Bern. During the following years it was used as a granary. In 1604 it was again used for religious services, as the hospital church for the Oberer Spital. The second church was demolished in 1726 to make way for a new church building, which was built in 1726\u201329 by Niklaus Schiltknecht.The first organ in the new church was installed in 1804 and was replaced in 1933 by the second organ. The church has six bells, one of the two largest was cast in 1596 and the other in 1728. The four other bells were all cast in 1860. The interior is supported by 14 monolithic columns made of sandstone and has a free-standing pulpit in the northern part of the nave. Much like the St. Pierre Cathedral in Geneva, the Church of the Holy Ghost holds about 2,000 people and is one of the largest Protestant churches in Switzerland.From 1693 to 1698 the hospital's chief minister was the Pietist theologian, Samuel Heinrich K\u00f6nig. In 1829 and 1830, the vicar of the church was the poet Jeremias Gotthelf.\n\n\n=== Fountains ===\n\nThere are over 100 public fountains in the city of Bern of which eleven are crowned with Renaissance allegorical statues. The statues were created during the period of civic improvement that occurred as Bern became a major city-state during the sixteenth century. The fountains were originally built as a public water supply. As Bern grew in power, the original fountains were expanded and decorated but retained their original purpose.\nNearly all the sixteenth-century fountains, except the Z\u00e4hringer fountain which was created by Hans Hiltbrand, are the work of the Fribourg master Hans Gieng.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nL\u00e4uferbrunnenFrom east to west, the first fountain is the L\u00e4uferbrunnen (German: Runner fountain) near the Nydegg Church on Nydeggstalden. The trough was built in 1824, but the figure dates from 1545. The Runner has moved several times since its creation, and until about 1663 was known as the Brunnen beim unteren Tor (Fountain by the lower gate). Originally the L\u00e4uferbrunnen had an octagonal trough and a tall, round column. The trough was replaced with a rectangular trough before 1757 which was replaced in 1824. The round column was replaced with the current square limestone pillar in the eighteenth or nineteenth century.\n\nGerechtigkeitsbrunnenThe next fountain is the Gerechtigkeitsbrunnen (German:Justice fountain) on Gerechtigkeitsgasse. Built in 1543 by Hans Gieng, the fountain is topped with a representation of Justice. She stands with her eyes and ears bound, a sword of truth one hand and the scales in the other. On the pillar below her feet are four figures; the Pope, a Sultan, the Kaiser or Emperor and the Schulthei\u00df or Lord Mayor. This represents the power of Justice over the rulers and political systems of the day; Theocracy, Monarchy, Autocracy and the Republic.The statue has been widely copied in towns throughout Switzerland. Currently, eleven \"fountains of Justice\" remain in Switzerland, and several others have probably been destroyed. Direct copies exist in Solothurn (1561), Lausanne (1585), Boudry, Cudrefin and Neuch\u00e2tel; designs influenced by the Bernese statue are found in Aarau (1643), Biel, Burgdorf, Brugg, Z\u00fcrich and Luzern.\nVennerbrunnenThe Vennerbrunnen (German: Banner Carrier or Vexillum) is located in front of the old city hall or Rathaus. The Venner was military-political title in medieval Switzerland. He was responsible for peace and protection in a section of a city and then to lead troops from that section in battle. In Bern, the Venner was a very powerful position and was key in city's operations. Each Venner was connected to a guild and chosen from the guild. Venner was one of only two positions from which the Schulthei\u00df or Lord Mayor was chosen. The statue, built in 1542 shows a Venner in full armour with his banner.\nMosesbrunnenThe Moses fountain, located on M\u00fcnsterplatz (German: Cathedral Plaza) was rebuilt in 1790\u20131791. The Louis XVI style basin was designed by Niklaus Spr\u00fcngli. The Moses figure dates from the sixteenth century. The statue represents Moses bringing the Ten Commandments to the Tribes of Israel. Moses is portrayed with two rays of light projecting from his head, which represent Exodus 34:29\u201335 which tells that after meeting with God the skin of Moses' face became radiant. The twin rays of light come from one longstanding tradition that Moses instead grew horns.\nThis is derived from a misinterpretation of the Hebrew phrase karan `ohr panav (\u05e7\u05b8\u05e8\u05b7\u05df \u05e2\u05b9\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05b8\u05d9\u05d5). The root \u05e7\u05e8\u05df Q-R-N (qoph, resh, nun) may be read as either \"horn\" or \"ray of light\", depending on vocalization. `Ohr panahv (\u05e2\u05b9\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05b8\u05d9\u05d5) translates to \"the skin of his face\".Interpreted correctly, these two words form an expression meaning that Moses was enlightened, that \"the skin of his face shone\" (as with a gloriole), as the KJV has it.The Septuagint properly translates the Hebrew phrase as \u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03cc\u03be\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u1f21 \u1f44\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2, \"his face was glorified\"; but Jerome translated the phrase into Latin as cornuta esset facies sua \"his face was horned\".With apparent Biblical authority, and the added convenience of giving Moses a unique and easily identifiable visual attribute (something the other Old Testament prophets notably lacked), it remained standard in Western art to depict Moses with small horns until well after the mistranslation was realized by the Renaissance. In this depiction of Moses, the error has been identified but the artist has chosen to place horns of light on Moses' head to aid in identification.\n\nSimsonbrunnenThe Simsonbrunnen or Samson fountain represents the Biblical story of Samson killing a lion found in Judges 14:5\u201320. According to the story, Samson was born to a sterile Israelite couple on the conditions that his mother and her child (Samson) abstain from all Alcohol and that he never shave or cut his hair. Because of his commitment to living under these conditions, Samson is granted great strength. As a young man, he falls in love with a Philistine woman and decides to marry her. At this time, the Philistines ruled over the Israelites and Samson's decision to marry one causes great concern among his family. He calms their concerns and travels to marry his love. On the way, he is attacked by the lion and with his incredible strength kills the lion. Later, he sees that bees have built a honeycomb in the lion's body. He uses this event as the basis of a riddle, which when not answered, gives him the pretext to attack the Philistines and lead an unsuccessful rebellion.\nThe fountain, built in 1544 by Hans Gieng, is modeled after the Simsonbrunnen in Solothurn.\nZ\u00e4hringerbrunnenThe Z\u00e4hringerbrunnen was built in 1535 as a memorial to the founder of Bern, Berchtold von Z\u00e4hringer. The statue is a bear in full armour, with another bear cub at his feet. The bear represents the bear, that according to legend, Berchtold shot on the Aare peninsula as he was searching for a site to build a city.\n\nKindlifresserbrunnenOne of the most interesting statues is the Kindlifresserbrunnen (Bernese German: Child Eater Fountain but often translated Ogre Fountain) which is located on Kornhausplatz. The fountain was built in 1545\u201346 on the site of a fifteenth-century wooden fountain. Originally known as Platzbrunnen (German: Plaza Fountain), the current name dates to 1666. The statue is a seated giant or ogre swallowing a naked child. Several other children are visible in a sack at the figure's feet. There are several interpretations of what the statue represents; including that it is a Jew with a pointed Jewish hat or the Greek god Chronos. However, the most likely explanation is that the statue represents a Fastnacht figure that scares disobedient children.\nAnna Seiler BrunnenThe Anna Seiler fountain, located at the upper end of Marktgasse memorializes the founder of the first hospital in Bern. Anna Seiler is represented by a woman in a blue dress, pouring water into a small dish. She stands on a pillar brought from the Roman town of Aventicum (modern Avenches). On 29 November 1354 in her will she asked the city to help found a hospital in her house which today stands on Zeughausgasse. The hospital initially had 13 beds and 2 attendants and was to be an ewiges Spital or a perpetual hospital. When Anna died around 1360 the hospital was renamed the Seilerin Spital. In 1531 the hospital moved to the empty Dominican Order monastery St. Michaels Insel (St. Michael's Island) and was then known as the Inselspital, which still exists over 650 years after Anna Seiler founded it. The modern Inselspital has about 6,000 employees and treats about 220,000 individuals per year.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of World Heritage Sites in Europe\nSwiss Federal Council\nHerrengasse 23 (Bern)\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial UNESCO listing for Old City of Bern\nUNESCO Evaluation of the Old City of Bern (.pdf only)\nTourist Office of the city of Bern\nThe Website of the Clock Tower (Zytglogge) in English and German\nLists of Swiss Inventory of Cultural Property of National and Regional Significance for Every Canton",

          "Best building in Bern, free entrance. Some 40 minutes guided tour in several languages.",
          "Walked by the parliament bldg by accident and saw a stunning 20min sound & light show - really worth it. Seems it only runs until end Nov. or Dec.",
          "The building is impressive on the outside, and don't neglect to walk through the arches to see the view of the river from the terrace. But there are also free tours of the interior available. Tickets are limited and I was told most are reserved in advance by tour groups. There"

Very important because one can spend hours in a museum. The staff is very helpful and speak fluent English very recommended, visit even if you only have an hour.",

          "As you arrive at the museum, you can plan your stay to perhaps have a meal before or after your visit. The cafe that is located next to the museum has a very tasty menu - eat outside and enjoy the lovely day. You'll have to leave your belongings in a locker, once you enter, so",
          "We visited the Einstein part of the museum and got a broad insight into life, work and environment of A. E. It is well documented and presented in a very attractive manner and let you explore not only those time but also give a timeline of inventions until the current day.",

          "This is a fantastically laid out museum. Really, I enjoyed everything about it. We went for the Einstein Museum -- and spent nearly 2 hours in that space. There is lots to read -- perhaps more to read than to see. Lots of letters, demos of theories, artifacts. Everything is",
          "We liked this museum, it was nice, not incredible. It was a bit expensive for my taste, compared to other museums I\u2019ve visited. But heh, it\u2019s Switzerland! There were other exhibitions but I had no time to visit them. Maybe that would have made up for the price. Still, I",
          "I went specifically for the Einstein exhibition. It was a little too short and a bit too focused on his personal life, but still I enjoyed it a lot. The other exhibition rooms are about the history of Bern... they are amazing. The best part of all is you get a ticket for the",
          "This wonderful museum covers a huge swathe of history, from the ancient civilisations to Bern itself right up to the year 2000. The building itself makes the layout of some of the exhibits a little confusing or irritating (it's a shame to have to walk all the way back through",

          "The building itself is a masterpiece and it\u2019s front gardens will bring you some great feelings. You can walk through the gardens and find some great spots for taking pics! And the museum is something else. You can feel the importance within its walls. The ticket totally worths",

          "This is a must see. Much of this is dedicated to Einsteins life and what he did during the Hitler reign. Take time to read all of the information available. It provides some insights into what he was doing during that time and his regrets and what he did for many of the Jews.",
          "The Einstein Museum is on the top floor of the Bern Historical Museum and requires a separate entry ticket. At CHF13 per adult it is not cheap when you consider that much of what is on display relates to the era in which Einstein lives and not specifically about him or his life.",

          "Go to this museum if it the only one you see in Bern. Wonderful exhibits -well laid out with English translations. We missed out the floor on Einstein as we had spent time on him in his own house. The modern section was evasive on the war years which was a shame as there is",

          "After we purchased our tickets the advice was to start at the top and work our way down. Each floor welcomed you to more and more exciting things. Very few people come be found that made it nice to slowly enjoy your visit. The displays were very clean and I noticed a guard",

          "The museum contains a wide range of historical exhibits but the main attraction for most will be the 3rd floor which is dedicated to the life of Albert Einstein who lived in Bern at the start of his career and famously worked in the Bern patent office. The museum tells the story",
          "We have been to Bern many times but had never visited this museum. We were completely surprised how great the Einstein Museum is on the 2nd floor. Please do not confuse this with the Einstein apartment found on Kramgasse in the center of the city. This is an excellent biography",
          "We were attracted by pictures of the funny glass wall on the web. It is really worth to come and see it by ourselves. We didn't go inside and spent approx. 1 hr to take pictures of the building only.",

          "You know a museum is good when it wows you before you even enter properly. I only went to the exhibition on Einstein and boy I was impressed. It had a mixture of media that should fascinate anybody. A word of the wise: the stuff on World War 2 is potentially upsetting.",
          "Fascinating building and insights into Bern. The exhibit on the town plans was fascinating. The curators are helpful and friendly. The Einstein museum is brilliant, with one of the most impressive entrances I've ever seen",
          "A great museum - no one could be bored here! It also feels very well done and well financed, unlike some museums. I went on a quiet Sunday and was alone in some of the exhibition halls. The models are so realistic and the lighting is so perfectly dimmed, that I got freaked out!",

          "Several reviewers said earlier that it is an average museum - I agree. Due to limited time on my hands, I needed to prioritize and only wanted to see the Einstein Museum but was disappointed to learn that you cannot separately buy the ticket. Permanent exhibits cost 13 CHF and",

          "Loved this museum and spent ages in the Einstein section. Whole place was enjoyable and informative - particularly Millefleur tapestry and relics from the Konigsfeldon monastery. We thought the entrance fees were worthwhile.",
          "A really lovely place with exquisite food. The prices are not low, but the quality of both food and beverages makes the experience satisfying, especially in the fine ambience.",
          "Tons and tons of items of his...photos, descriptions. You'll learn a lot. Swiss Pass gets you free entrance in museums, saving you a bit of money.",
          "The Bern Historical Museum actually contains three seperate permanent exhibits to include: Bern City History, Bern Fine Arts, and the Einstein Museum. The Einstein Museum is absolutely wonderful as you get a unique insight into Einstein the physicist, teacher, and family man.",
          "The museum was practically three in one: The Bern City/State History, The Bern Fine Arts and the Einstein Exhibition. Each of them were printed in English and well organized and thorough. The Bern City History was particularly interesting...with artifacts and explanations",
          "Spent a few hours here, learned a lot about Bern and Switzerland, great displays, and plenty of space to cover everything from the earliest times to the present. Free with the Swiss Pass, aside from temporary exhibits.",
          "The tickets were chf 18 and chf 21 for the Einstein museum (not Einsteins house which is separate and in the city) and it was really great! Worth the $$. Unfortunately my friend and I came in the afternoon and were not able to see most of it, so if you like to read and see every",
          "Very complete museum, many different areas distributed by floor and by period in history! Not too expensive, the prices is faire for what you get",
          "This museum houses a wealth of histories from local, Norman, encryption, religious artifacts and histories. As well as the exceptional einstein museum. Discounts for groups and students/concessions. There is a bistro and toilets on site. Highly recommended. It is also the second",
          "A colleague and I visited the museum on a Saturday afternoon. We are both astronomers so we went straight to the Einstein exhibit which covers a whole floor. It was fantastic. It has a great number of Einstein artifacts and goes into a very detailed history of his life and",
          "Bern has lots of good museums, but the Historical Museum is a special place in a spectacular building just across the bridge from the old town. The Einstein Museum, inside the Historical Museum, is really well put together and there are interesting things for all ages. The",
          "This review is for the museum and not Einstein's house. The house and museum are diferent and located away from each other. The museum is about a 15 min. walk from the train station. I was looking forward to visiting the museum and found it more interesting than expected.",

          "Visited on a Saturday afternoon having booked the exhibition online for 1200 time slot. Cost for family of 4 was CHF $60. Free lockers for backpacks and cameras were available, we were not allowed to take cameras into the exhibition at all. The audio guides were $5.00 each and",
          "The exhibition is a good 2 hours worth spending. Also, they have a nice little shop. It's well done and you can learn a lot if you do not have previous knowledge. It's a good mix of videos, archeological findings and cultural knowledge. However, in my opinion it's a bit",
          "Lovely museum, lack of maps to show the layout of the museum only a list to tell you about different levels within the building. Overall everything is limited but it is interest especially on level three with each years special events.",

          "On the museum's second floor, a fantastic wing is devoted to Einstein's life, the historical times he lived in and their main influences on / interactions with his life (including antisemitism, zionism, nationalism, nazism, the A-Bomb...) as well as his career development and",
          "I was very pleased with the visit to the museum. Staff was very courteous and knowledgable. The facilities were clean and well organized. The museum was easy to find with parking avaibale in front of the building. Another neat aspect of the museum is, that at the point of exit,",
          "The Qin dynasty terracotta statues are well worth the visit to the Bern Historical Museum. The exhibit is full of different artefacts from the period as well as the terracotta warriors them selves. One wonders how they are able to transport what must be very fragile objects to",
          "The exhibition about the Qin destiny and the Terracotta Army was fascinating and the exhibition pieces very well set out and easy to see. The number of people allowed in at one time is regulated so that it is never too crowded. Audio guides in different languages can be hired",
          "I just paid a visit there to see the Einstein exhibition and did not check the others. It was very thorough beginning from Einstains childhood, walking through his life and explaining the most of his ideas in a way everybody can understand them. I also liked the fact that there",
          "The Einstein Museum, part of the Bern Historical Museum, is very interesting, expecially since I'm also a physicist. The museum is well laid out, beautiful and has ear phone tours in many languages nicely correlated with stop numbers. The museum weaves Einstein's life into",
          "We specially went for the exhibition of the clay army of The Qin dynasty. It is not a cheap entrance fee, but absolute worth it. The visitor is in three languages guided through the history of Qin and its impressive terracotta statues. Also the clarifying short videos are very",
          "We went specifically to see the Terra Cotta Warrior exhibit, which was pretty cool (yes, there's only a few of the actual warriors, but the information presented is extensive and interesting). The rest of the museum was okay, some parts were pretty stuffy (literally and",
          "Judging by the title of the exhibition, I was expecting to actually see something resembling at least a battalion of an army...instead a lot of artifacts, 1 real-life terracotta horse and just 4 warriors...that was it...While it was meticulously organized, it didn't live up to",
          "Exhibits have English labels - so very helpful. The Museum uses as much space in the building as possible making it a little difficult to follow an exact timeline of the history of Bern but this is not a big problem. The very early periods are not covered as well as the",
          "This museum has LOTS to see and makes provisions for English speakers unlike some other Bern tourist attractions.",
          "The entrance was exorbitant at 28 CHF per adult, the exhibitions we saw was mediocre, the only exhibit which was worth seeing was the \"TausendBlumen carpet\" from Burgundy. We would not return.",
          "In London we probably wouldn't have stood a chance of getting in to see this exhibition by just turning up, but on a soaking Saturday in Bern we got in. The exhibiton is well organised and thorough. Of course it would have been nice to have seen a (very) small army of warriors,",
          "From the permanent exhibits on Einstein and Switzerland/Bern history to the temporary exhibits, this is a great museum to visit while in Switzerland. The museum is larger than you expect and offers a wealth of imagery. Skip the nearby Swiss Alpine Museum and spend your time and",
          "A fantastic exhibition, meticulously planned, and very well organized. The exhibition, leads you from the quirky discovery of the Warriors in 1974 by farmers digging, back through the history of China, to understand why Qin was such a powerful first Emperor, and then onto the",
          "We went there for the exhibition of the terracotta warriors from China. It was full of people but the organisation was very good as is in any Swiss museum. The only fault was maybe that it was not very clear where to go next. We almost missed to see the actual warriors. The",
          "This is a phantastic exhibition about the first emperor of China and its famous army of clay soldiers. Eight original figures from China are on exhibit. The rest of the Museum is also very worthwhile. Plan half a day for this Museum.",
          "The Qin exhibition was good. The Audio guide added some extra information and was worth the 5 CHF. The service in the restaurant has improved slightly from that given by a previous reviewer. waiting time is now down to about 30 minutes! Unfortunately the museum has not thought",
          "This special exhibit is definitely worth seeing if you will be in Bern during 2013. Plan to spend about an hour or more to see it in its entirety. We opted to skip the audio guides and just browse and read the information as we went. There are some interesting videos",
          "Oh , what a delight to view this exhibition in Berns Historical Museum. Although only a relativly small exhibition compared to the Chinese one it is superb and gives the visitor , who may never go to China more than an insight to life then. Tickets are easily booked on line ,",
          "If you have a few time of your own in Bern between 10 AM and 4 PM, and ask yourself what to visit, don't miss the Einstein Museum in the Historical Museum building, Helvetia Place, at the second floor: http://www.bhm.ch/en/exhibitions/einstein-museum/. You need at least one",

          "We visited the Historical Museum to see the Einstein exhibit on the third floor. First, we were very lucky to choose a Saturday in August when admission is free. The Einstein exhibit takes up a whole floor and goes through the life and times of the man. It even tries to explain",
          "We only went here because Einsteinhaus was closed due to water damage and it was recommended to us. We didn't see any other part of the museum other than the exhibit on Einstein due to time limitations. This is an excellant exhibit which not only traces his life's achievements",

          "I had the Swiss Pass, so entrance was free for me. Otherwise, I believe entrance fees are actually quite expensive. I made my way to the Einstein section straightaway and loved it. I did find the layout a little confusing, in that it wasn't immediately obvious how to leave at",

        "wiki": "The canton of Bern or Berne (German: Kanton Bern; French: canton de Berne) is the second-largest of the 26 Swiss cantons by both surface area and population. Located in west-central Switzerland, it borders the canton of Jura and the canton of Solothurn to the north. To the west lie the canton of Neuch\u00e2tel, the canton of Fribourg and canton of Vaud. To the south lies the canton of Valais. East of the canton of Bern lie the cantons of Uri, Nidwalden, Obwalden, Lucerne and Aargau.\nThe canton of Bern is bilingual and has a population (as of 31 December 2018) of 1,034,977. As of 2007, the population included 119,930 (or 12.45%) foreigners. The cantonal capital, also the \"federal city\" of Switzerland, is Bern. Other major cities are Thun and Biel/Bienne.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBern joined the Old Swiss Confederation in 1353. Between 1803 and 1814 it was one of the six directorial cantons of the Napoleonic Swiss Confederation.\n\n\n=== Early Prehistory ===\nThe earliest traces of a human presence in the area of the modern Canton is found in three caves in the Simmental region; Schnurenloch near Oberwil, Ranggiloch above Boltigen and Chilchlih\u00f6hle above Erlenbach. These caves were used at various times during the last ice age. The first open-air settlement in the area is an upper paleolithic settlement at Moosb\u00fchl in Moosseedorf. During the warmer climate of the mesolithic period, increasing forest cover restricted the movement of hunters, fishers and gatherers. Their temporary settlements were built along lake and marsh edges, which remained free of trees due to fluctuations in water level. Important mesolithic sites in the Canton are at Pieterlenmoos and Burg\u00e4schisee lake along with alpine valleys at Diemtig and Simmental. During the neolithic period, there were a number of settlements on the shores of Lake Biel, the Toteisbecken (Lobsigensee, Moossee, Burg\u00e4schisee and Inkwilersee) and along rivers (Aare, Zihl). Several of these sites are part of the Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.One of the best explored neolithic sites is at Twann (now Twann-T\u00fcscherz). In the Twannbach delta there were about 25 Cortaillod culture and Horgen culture villages that existed between 3800 and 2950 BC. One of the oldest examples of bread from Switzerland, a sourdough from 3560\u20133530 BC, came from one of these villages.Simple copper objects were already in use in the 4th millennium BC, including a copper pin from Lattrigen from 3170 BC and a knife blade from Twann. Shortly before 2000 BC bronze production entered the area and brought about a surge in development. Settlements began to spread into the pre-Alpine and Alpine areas. The area between Lake Thun and the Niedersimmental were densely settled. Archeological finds include scattered items along mountain passes, a fortified hilltop settlements at Spiezberg, Cholis Grind by Saanen and at Pintel by Wimmis, along with cemeteries at Thun-Allmendingen, Einigen and Hilterfingen. Late Bronze Age (ca. 1000\u2013800 BC) settlements along Lake Biel (M\u00f6rigen, Vinelz) have yielded up a wealth of items.\n\n\n=== Iron Age ===\n\nDuring the Early Iron Age changes in climate forced the Hallstatt culture (800\u2013450 BCE) to abandon settlements along many waterways and in the valley floors and move to the plateaus and hills. With increased trade contacts across the Alps, the cultural influence of the Mediterranean region grew in the area. Evidence of this trade include a hydria which was discovered in Gr\u00e4chwil. Burial rituals and social classes became more developed during this time. The so-called princely graves became more common, many of the burial mounds were over 30 m (98 ft) in diameter and 4 m (13 ft) high and richly outfitted with grave goods. In a grave mound in B\u00fctzberg the first burial in the mound was followed by several later burials. Often, several grave mounds combined to become a necropolis, such as at Grossaffoltern, Ins, Bannwil, Langenthal and B\u00fctzberg. Most of the knowledge about the Hallstatt culture in the Canton comes from graves. The only discovered settlement is around Blanche Church in La Neuveville.\nThe grave goods show that iron was forged into swords, daggers, spearheads, knives and wagon accessories. Gold, which was probably collected from river sand, was made into diadems, rings and pendants. Thin bronze arm, leg and neck plates with geometric designs were often buried, especially in the graves at Allenl\u00fcften in M\u00fchleberg, at Ins and at B\u00fctzberg. The jewelry that was buried included bracelets and rings which were also made of jet and lignite coal. At M\u00fcnchringen, the grave pottery was both shaped by hand or thrown on a potter's wheel, and was painted with multi-colored ornamentation.\nThe transition to the Late Iron Age of the La T\u00e8ne culture (450\u22121st century BCE) is indicated by a sudden change of style in the metalworking and ceramic industries. Numerous graves (from unknown settlements), along with the two oppida at Bern-Engehalbinsel and Jensberg by Studen, mark the population centers during the late Iron Age. Gold coins (from Melchnau) along with silver and bronze coins first start to appear during this era. A sword with Greek characters that said Korisios was found at the Port site. At the oppidum at Bern-Engehalbinsel, there were studios for glass and ceramic production, and iron working achieved a high level of skill, along with craftsmen who worked in wood, leather and goldsmithing. There was a nearby place of worship in the Bremgarten wood, and cemeteries at M\u00fcnsingen and Bern-Engehalbinsel.\n\n\n=== Roman era ===\n\nAfter the Roman era victory at Battle of Bibracte in 58 BCE, the Helvetii were forced to return to their homes as foederati of the Romans. Under increasing Roman influence, the local economy and trade flourished. The main settlements lay at the foot of the Jura Mountains and on the Central Plateau.\nThe existing roads were expanded, especially the Aventicum-Vindonissa and the Petinesca-Augusta Raurica roads. A fourth alpine pass, the Rawil pass, was added to the traditional three; the Grimsel, Br\u00fcnig and Susten passes. In the Bernese Jura the Mont Raimeux and Pierre Pertuis passes opened.\nUnder the Romans, many of the old fortified places were expanded and refortified. The old Helvetii oppidum at the Engehalbinsel became a Roman vicus, which was probably known as Brenodor or Brenodurum. At the foot of the Jens mountain, the fort Petinesca was built to guard the roads over the Jura Mountains. This was reinforced in the late-Roman era (368\u2013369 CE) by a fortified bridge over the Thielle/Zihl river between Aegerten and Br\u00fcgg.\nA number of Roman villas were built around the Canton. At Oberwichtrach both the main building (pars urbana) and the industrial section (pars rustica) of a Roman villa have been discovered. The villas at M\u00fcnsingen, Toffen and Herzogenbuchsee have richly detailed Roman mosaics that are still partly visible.\nThe religious practices of the local population merged with Roman beliefs and the Canton of Bern is home to a number of unique cult centers. They include the larger than life statues of gods (including enthroned Jupiter) at Petinesca, Engehalbinsel, and Thun-Allmendingen; and a number of stone inscriptions. At the beginning of the 5th century CE, Rome withdrew its troops from the Rhine garrisons, but allowed the Burgundians to settle on Helvetii lands in 443 CE.\n\n\n=== Early Middle Ages ===\n\nEast of the Aare, the transition from the Gallo-Roman dominated population to a Germanic population in the Early Middle Ages happened relatively peacefully. One exception was the Battle of Wangen in 610, but elsewhere it generally was a slow process of cultural infiltration. By the 7th century, the Alamannic settlers had already taken most of the good locations southeast of the Aare and they began moving up the Aare to the regions of Lake Thun and Lake Brienz. All areas west of the Aare belonged to the romanised Burgundian kingdom, which became part of the Merovingian Frankish kingdom in the 534. During the Carolingian era, the political structure of the Franks had spread into parts of what became Switzerland. In 762/778 the County of Aargau was founded, followed in 861 by the County of Oberaargau and in 965 the County of Bargen. The Treaty of Verdun in 843 put the border between Central and Eastern Frankish Empires at the Aare, and divided the Aare region in half. The population west of the Aare generally spoke a Romance language, while those to the east spoke a Germanic language. The region between the rivers Saane and Aare became the language border.\nChristianity spread slowly into the Aare valley. The dioceses of Lausanne, Basel, Sion, Chur and Constance were all established before the new faith made inroads into the valley. The Aare valley was bordered by three dioceses; Lausanne, Constance and Basel. However, the first Christian missionaries came into the valley from Alsace and other western areas. In 630 the Abbey of Luxeuil established the Abbey of Moutier-Grandval along the old transit route through the Pierre Pertuis Pass. By the 9th or 10th Century, this Abbey had property and influence all the way to Lake Biel and into the Balsthal valley. The first monastic cells of what would become the Abbey of Saint-Imier was also founded in 600. In the Seeland and Aare valleys, wooden churches were first built during the Merovingian period. The current churches in Kirchlindach, Oberwil bei Buren and Bleibach were all built above the ruins of these early churches. About 30 churches in the Bern and Solothurn portions of the Aare valley were created over ruins of Roman villas and subsequent burial grounds in the 7th Century (including Meikirch and Oberbipp). In Mett, the church was built over a 5th-century mausoleum, which was built over a 4th-century tomb. In 700, six sarcophagi were buried on St. Peter's Island next to a Roman temple complex. A wooden monastery was built over the complex in the 8th\u20139th century.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nDuring the 10th century, the Aare valley came fully under the Second Kingdom of Burgundy. Under King Rudolph I and his son Rudolph II Burgundy's influence reached across most of modern Switzerland. They established royal courts at B\u00fcmpliz, M\u00fcnsingen, Uetendorf, Wimmis, Kirchberg and Utzenstorf to allow them to govern the Aare valley. Later, the Aare valley moved toward closer ties with the Holy Roman Empire during the Ottonian and Salian dynasties.\nThe succession dispute following the death of Rudolph III in 1032 allowed the Salian kings to acquire the Kingdom of Upper Burgundy and with it the Aare valley. As a part of the Holy Roman Empire, the valley was involved when the Investiture Controversy broke out in 1056. In 1077, the Regent of Burgundy, Count Rudolf of Rheinfelden, declared himself as an anti-king against King Henry IV. The Bishops of Basel and Lausanne remained loyal to King Henry IV, and took the Rheinfelden lands in Oberaargau and the upper Aare valley. After Rudolf's death in 1090, his lands went to his son, Berchtold II of Z\u00e4hringen. He and his son, Berchtold III, tried to use these lands to expand their power. In 1127 the Z\u00e4hringer were appointed Rector or delegate of the king in Burgundy. Their hopes for a new, independent Burgundy were dashed in 1156, and the last Z\u00e4hringen count, Berchtold V, embarked on a program of city founding. The cities of Burgdorf, Murten, Thun and Bern were all founded by Berchtold V. When he died without an heir, the Z\u00e4hringen lands went to the House of Kyburg, while the offices and fiefs reverted to the empire.During the High Middle Ages both the Aare valley and the Bernese Oberland were divided into a number of small counties, each with their own baron. Nobles from the Holy Roman Empire began to marry into the local noble families and a number of the Z\u00e4hringen Ministerialis families (unfree knights in the service of a feudal overlord) moved into the Oberland. The nobles also began to found monasteries to spread their power into the Oberland. During the period between 1070 and 1150, at least ten large monasteries were founded by local nobles. These include; the Cluniac Priory of R\u00fceggisberg (Lords of R\u00fcmligen in 1072), M\u00fcnchenwiler (Wiler family in 1080), St. Peter's Island (Count of Hochburgund-M\u00e2con in the late 11th century), Hettiswil (1107), R\u00f6thenbach im Emmental (Lords of R\u00fcmligen or Signau), the Benedictine monastery at St. Johannsen in Erlach (Fenis family in 1100), Trub (Lords of L\u00fctzelfl\u00fch before 1130) and R\u00fcegsau (possibly also the Lords of L\u00fctzelfl\u00fch in first half of the 12th century), the Augustinian Collegiate church in Interlaken (Oberhofen family in 1130) and the Cistercian Frienisberg Abbey (Count Saugern around 1130). However, in 1191 the Oberland barons revolted against Berchtold V of Z\u00e4hringen and many of the Oberland barons were killed in the battle of Grindelwald.\nDuring the 13th Century a number of the cities near Bern were granted the city right and appointed mayors and city councils. Bern became an imperial city. During the mid-13th century, the Empire's presence weakened in the Aare valley, forcing the local nobles to find allies to protect themselves. Bern entered into a number of treaties with its neighbors in the 13th century. In 1274, the Emperor Rudolph I of Habsburg, confirmed Bern's imperial immediacy. However, in 1285 he imposed an imperial tax which drove the city to support Rudolph's enemies. Although it withstood two sieges by the Emperor in 1288, after the defeat at Schosshalde in 1289 it had to pay taxes and a penalty.\nIn 1298 Bernese forces won a victory at Oberwangen in K\u00f6niz against the County of Savoy and the Habsburg Austrian nobility. In 1300, the city acquired the four surrounding parishes of Bolligen, Vechigen, Stettlen and Muri, destroyed the threatening castles of Bremgarten and Belp and gave the Baron of Montenach Bernese citizenship. After the victory of Louis IV of Bavaria over the Habsburg Frederick the Fair in the battle of M\u00fchldorf (Bavaria) in 1322, Bern entered an alliance with the anti-Habsburg Swiss Forest Cantons in 1323.\n\n\n=== Old Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nBern joined the Old Swiss Confederation in 1353.\n\n\n==== 14th century ====\nIn 1310 Emperor Henry VII pledged Laupen Castle, Laupen and the surrounding lands as collateral for a loan. In 1324, Bern acquired the pledged castle and lands. When the Emperor was unable to repay the loan, Laupen became the first bailiwick of Bern.In 1322, the brothers Eberhard II of Neu-Kyburg and Hartmann II of Neu-Kyburg started fighting with each other over who would inherit the family's lands around Thun. The fighting led to the \"fratricide at Thun Castle\" where Eberhard killed his brother Hartmann. To avoid punishment by his Habsburg overlords, Eberhard fled to Bern. In the following year, he sold the town of Thun, its castle and the land surrounding Thun to Bern. Bern then granted the land back to Eberhard as a fief. Bern's support of Eberhard, their resulting expansion into the Oberland and their alliance with the Forest Cantons brought the city into conflict with the Habsburgs during the 14th Century. The G\u00fcmmenenkrieg in 1333 between Bern and Fribourg over rights and influence in the Sense/Singine area ended without resolving anything.\nIn 1334, Bern fought with the Barons of Weissenburg and occupied Wimmis and Unspunnen in the Oberland. Bern's victory allowed them to bring the Oberhasli region, its capital of Meiringen and Weissenburg under their control. Bern's continued expansion was at the expense of the feudal lords in the surrounding lands. In 1339 the Habsburgs, Kyburgs and Fribourg, marched against Bern with 17,000 men and besieged the border town of Laupen. To raise the siege, Bern raised a force of 6,000, consisting of Bernese, supported by the Forest Cantons, and other allies (Simmental, Weissenbur and Oberhasli). The allied Bernese forces were victorious at the Battle of Laupen and Bern drew closer to the Swiss Forest Cantons. It entered into a permanent or eternal alliance with Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden in 1353. This date is usually considered the date of Bern's entrance into the Swiss Confederation, however the alliance only indirectly tied Bern to Z\u00fcrich and Lucerne.\nIn 1358 the cash-strapped Count Peter II of Aarberg pawned the County of Aarberg to Bern. However, in 1367 he sold it, without repaying Bern, to his cousin Rudolf IV of Nidau. After Rudolf's death (1375) Bern acquired clear right to the Aarberg lands from the other heirs.Throughout the 14th Century, Bern entered into alliances and treaties with many of its neighbors, including members of the Swiss Confederation. Bern entered into a series of agreements with Biel/Bienne, which led to a conflict with Biel's ruler, Jean de Vienne, the Prince-Bishop of Basel, in 1367\u201368. The bishop marched south and destroyed Biel along with a number of towns in the southern Jura Mountains. During the Gugler war in 1375, there were several battles between Bernese troops and English mercenaries under Enguerrand de Coucy.\nBy the 1370s, the Kyburgs (which still held Thun as a fief for Bern) were deeply in debt to Bern. On 11 November 1382, Rudolf II of Neu-Kyburg made an unsuccessful raid on Solothurn. The ensuing conflict with the Old Swiss Confederacy (known as the Burgdorferkrieg or Kyburgerkrieg) allowed Bern to move against the Habsburgs in Aargau. After the Bernese laid siege to Burgdorf, Neu-Kyburg was forced to concede an unfavourable peace. Bern bought Thun and Burgdorf, the most important cities of Neu-Kyburg, and their remaining towns passed to Bern and Solothurn by 1408. The last of the Neu-Kyburgs, Berchtold, died destitute in Bern in 1417.In 1386, the Austrians under Leopold of Habsburg invaded eastern Switzerland. When they besieged the city of Sempach, troops from Z\u00fcrich, Lucerne and the Forest Cantons marched out and defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Sempach. While Bern was not involved at Sempach they took advantage of the Austrian weakness to march into the Oberland in 1386, followed by the Seeland (the region south of the Jura Mountains containing the Morat (Murten), Neuch\u00e2tel and Bienne (Biel) lakes) in 1388 and the Aargau in 1389. In the peace agreement of 1389 Bern got Unterseen and the Upper Simme valley (Simmental) from the Habsburgs. In the same year, Fribourg accepted Berns acquisition of the Iselgaus, i.e. the area between Lake Biel and the Seeland. Over the next several decades Bern continued to expand to the detriment of the Habsburgs and Fribourg. They acquired the following towns: 1391 Simmenegg, 1399 Signau, 1400 Frutigen, 1407 Wangen, 1408 Trachselwald and Huttwil, 1412 Oltigen and in 1413 (together with Solothurn) Bipp and Bechburg.\n\n\n==== 15th century ====\nBy 1400, Bern controlled the entire Bernese Oberland. Under their control, the five valleys of the Oberland enjoyed extensive rights and far-reaching autonomy in the B\u00e4uerten (farming cooperative municipalities) and Talverb\u00e4nden (rural alpine communities). However, throughout the Late Middle Ages, the Oberland, as a whole or in part, revolted several times against Bernese authority. The Evil League (B\u00f6ser Bund) in 1445 fought against Bernese military service and taxes following the Old Z\u00fcrich War, in 1528 the Oberland rose up in resistance to the Protestant Reformation and in 1641 Thun revolted.In the Bernese Oberland during the 13th and the beginning of the 14th century Interlaken Monastery grew to become the largest landholder in the region. The Monastery controlled the towns of Grindlewald, Lauterbrunnen and numerous farms along Lake Brienz. However, in 1350 a period of crises and conflicts led to a decline in the number of monks and nuns and increasing debt. In 1348, the people of Grindelwald and Wilderswil joined a mutual defense league with Unterwalden. Bern responded with a military expedition to the Bernese Oberland, which ended in defeat for Unterwalden and its allies. By 1472, Bern was the patron of the Monastery. During the Protestant Reformation, the Monastery was secularized in 1528. The canons received a financial settlement and the properties were now managed by a Bernese bailiff. The tenants of the Monastery who had expected the abolition of all owed debts, responded by rioting, which was suppressed by Bern.\n\nThe lands around the northern shore of Lake Geneva and between Lake Neuch\u00e2tel were the next area into which Bern expanded. The region had originally been part of the Carolingian Empire. Then, in 1032 the Z\u00e4hringens of Germany defeated the Burgundians, who were then replaced by the counts of Savoy in 1218. Under the counts of Savoy the area was given political unity, and established as the Barony of Vaud. However, as the power of the Savoys declined at the beginning of the 15th century the land was occupied by troops from Bern. By 1536 the area was completely annexed. Reformation was started by co-workers of John Calvin, including Viret, who engaged in a famous debate at the cathedral of Lausanne; but it was only decisively implemented when Bern put its full force behind it. Vaud was another French-speaking region in the mostly German-speaking canton, which caused several uprisings.\nBoth Ch\u00e2teau-d'\u0152x and Saanen were part of the county of Gruy\u00e8re. Both districts had quite a bit of independence and often entered into treaties against the will and best interests of the Counts. In 1340 the Saanen valley concluded a peace treaty with the Simmental, which provided for arbitration in disputes. They entered into another treaty in 1393 with the Valais. In 1401, Count Rudolph of Gruy\u00e8re entered into a treaty with Bern which included Saanen. Two years later Saanen and Ch\u00e2teau-d'\u0152x negotiated their own alliances with Bern. Due to the Bernese alliance, Saanen sent troops, under their own banner, to support the Bernese invasions of Aargau in 1415 and Valais in 1418. The military losses and taxes following the Old Z\u00fcrich War led Saanen to support the Evil League (B\u00f6ser Bund) in 1445 against Bern.\n\nIn 1475, during the Burgundian Wars, the mountain regions of Saanen and Pays-d'Enhaut, who were allied with Bern, attacked and burned the tower of Aigle Castle. They then gave Aigle town and the surrounding district to Bern in exchange for not having to pay one-third of their income to Bern. In the treaty of Fribourg from 1476, Fribourg received rights over the Aigle district, which they gave up to Bern in 1483. Bern rebuilt Aigle Castle in 1489 and made it the seat of the bailiwick of Aigle. Also in 1475, the Confederation attacked and captured Grandson Castle. In the next year, Charles the Bold retook the castle and executed the Bernese garrison. In 1476, at the Battle of Grandson, Charles' forces retreated and the Bernese retook Grandson. After Charles' defeat at the Battle of Murten, Grandson became a shared territory between Bern and Fribourg. Each city appointed a vogt for five-year periods. Aigle and Grandson were the first French speaking regions in the Canton of Bern.\nDuring the Burgundian War in 1475, Saanen, together with troops from Ch\u00e2teau-d'\u0152x and the Simmental captured the Savoy district of Aigle for Bern. Saanen and the surrounding district enjoyed a great deal of independence during the 16th century. \nHowever, in 1555 the last Count of Gruy\u00e8re lost both districts to Bern when his county went bankrupt. Bern took over the entire Saanen valley in the following year and introduced the Protestant Reformation. They incorporated the Pays-d'Enhaut with Ch\u00e2teau-d'\u0152x into the new Bernese district of Saanen.\n\n\n==== Acquired districts ====\nThe area of the canton of Bern consists of lands acquired by the city of Bern mostly between the 14th and the 16th century during the original Swiss Confederacy period, both by conquest and purchase.\nAcquired districts, with dates of acquisition, include:\n\nLaupen (1324)\nOberhasli (1334)\nAarberg (1375)\nThun and Burgdorf (1384)\nUnterseen and the Upper Simme valley (1386)\nFrutigen and other towns in the Bernese Oberland (1400)\nAargau (1415)\nLower Simme valley (1439\u20131449)\nAigle and Grandson (1475)\nInterlaken, with Grindelwald, Lauterbrunnen and Brienz (1528, all the suppression of the Augustinian Canons at Interlaken Monastery)\nVaud (1536)\nSaanen or Gessenay (1555)\nthe Pays d'En-Haut including Ch\u00e2teau-d'\u0152x (1555)\nK\u00f6niz (1729).\n\n\n=== Social changes in Early Modern Bern ===\n\nIn the Middle Ages, upwards mobility and access to public offices was relatively easy for successful traders and craftsmen, but Bernese society became ever more stratified and aristocratic as the power and wealth of the city grew.\nBy the 17th century in the Early Modern period, citizenship had become an inherited prerogative, all political bodies elected one another and officials were elected for life. In effect, public offices were now the exclusive prerogative of the gn\u00e4dige Herren, the \"merciful lords\", as the small number of noble families now ruling Bern came to be called. In 1605 there were 152 families that were qualified to rule, by 1691 that number was only 104, while towards the end of the 18th century there were only 69 such families. Meanwhile, the land ruled by the town was extending over more and more territory, so that finally it governed 52 bailiwicks. These offices became very lucrative as the Bernese territories grew. Patrician Landv\u00f6gte, sheriffs, ruled the politically powerless countryside, often using armed force to put down peasant revolts.\nIn Vaud the Bernese occupants were not popular amongst the population. In 1723, Major Abraham Davel led a revolt against Bern, in protest at what he saw as the denial of political rights of the French-speaking Vaudois by the German-speaking Bernese, and was subsequently beheaded.\n\n\n=== Napoleonic period ===\n\nInspired by the French Revolution, the Vaudois drove out the Bernese governor in 1798 and declared the Lemanic Republic. Vaud nationalists like Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric-C\u00e9sar de La Harpe had called for French intervention in liberating the area and French Revolutionary troops moved in, taking over the whole of Switzerland itself in the process and setting up the Helvetic Republic.\nIn 1798, with the establishment of the Helvetic Republic, Bern was divided, the canton of Oberland with Thun as its capital and the canton of L\u00e9man with Lausanne as its capital were detached from what was left of the Canton of Bern.\nWithin the new canton of Oberland, historic borders and traditional rights were not considered. As there had been no previous separatist feeling amongst the conservative population, there was little enthusiasm for the new order. The situation in the canton of L\u00e9man was quite different. The French-speaking Vaudois had never felt like part of the German-speaking Canton of Bern. When they joined the Swiss Confederation in 1803, it was as the Canton of Vaud.\nUnder the Helvetic Republic, Pays-d'Enhaut with Ch\u00e2teau-d'\u0152x became part of the Canton of L\u00e9man while Saanen and the rest of the district became part of the Canton of Oberland. When the Helvetic Republic collapsed in 1803, Saanen and its district became a district in the new Canton of Bern while Ch\u00e2teau-d'Oex and its district joined Vaud.\nThe 1801 Malmaison Constitution proposed reuniting the Oberland with Bern, but it was not until the Act of Mediation, two years later, with the abolition of the Helvetic Republic and the partial restoration of the ancien r\u00e9gime, that the two cantons were reunited.Between 1803 and 1814 Bern was one of the six directorial cantons of the Napoleonic Swiss Confederation.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nWith the post\u2212Napoleonic Restoration of 1815, Bern acquired the Bernese Jura with Biel/Bienne from the bishopric of Basel, while the canton of L\u00e9man became the canton of Vaud and remained separate from Bern.\nBern still remained the largest canton of the confederacy from 1815 to 1979, when parts of the Bernese Jura broke away to form the canton of Jura. In 1994 the Laufen District was transferred to the canton of Basel-Landschaft.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe canton of Bern is mainly drained by the river Aare and its tributaries. The area of the canton is commonly divided into six regions. The most populated area is the Bernese Mittelland on the plateau north of the Alps, with the capital city of Bern. The northmost part of the canton is the Bernese Jura bordering the Canton of Jura. The Bernese Oberland is the mountainous region which lies in the south of the canton.\nThe area of the canton is 5,959 km2 (2,301 sq mi). Of this area, 6.4% is occupied with houses, businesses or roads. 43.3% of the canton is agricultural land, and 31.0% is forested. Less than 19.3% is considered non-productive, which includes glaciers, cliffs and lakes.\n\n\n=== Bernese Mittelland ===\n\nThe Bernese Mittelland (Bernese Midlands) is made up of the valley of the rivers Aare, the (Grosse) Emme, some of the foothills of the Bernese Alps, as well as the plain around the capital Bern, and has many small farms and hilly forested regions with small to mid-sized towns scattered throughout. It is perhaps best known by foreigners and visitors for the Emmental. The classic Swiss cheese with holes Emmentaler comes from this region's forests and pastures, of hilly and low mountainous countryside in the 1,000 to 2,000 m (3,300 to 6,600 ft) range.\n\n\n=== Three Lakes Region and Bernese Jura ===\nIn the north of the canton lies the predominantly French speaking Three Lakes Region (Seeland), concentrated around Lake Biel, Neuch\u00e2tel, and Murten, which rises from the plain up to the northernmost Swiss mountain chain of the Jura. This area has more relaxed geography, although still some lower mountains and some waterfalls, and large lakes.\n\n\n=== Bernese Oberland ===\n\nThe Bernese Oberland (German: Berner Oberland) constitute the north side of the Bernese Alps and the west side of the Urner Alps within the canton of Bern. The highest mountain in the Bernese Alps is the Finsteraarhorn at 4,274 metres (14,022 ft), but the best known mountains are Eiger, M\u00f6nch, and Jungfrau.\nThe well known hiking and ski resorts in the eastern Oberland are located around Interlaken and the Jungfrau, such as car-free M\u00fcrren and Wengen in the Lauterbrunnen valley, and Grindelwald. Further east, in the Haslital are the Aareschlucht and the town of Meiringen, famous for the fateful scene of Sherlock Holmes's 'death' at the hands of Professor Moriarty on the nearby Reichenbach Falls. In the Western Bernese Oberland there are many other resorts and small villages catering to visitors. These are accessed from the lake town of Thun, and the most notable of them are Kandersteg with the Oeschinensee and Adelboden. Further west is the Simmental with Lenk and Zweisimmen and the Saanenland with the famous resorts Gstaad and Saanen.\nThe whole area is very mountainous, with steep cliffs, many glaciers, and countless waterfalls. It is renowned for its scenic beauty and the charm of the small Swiss villages that dot the area. As a result of this, tourism is one of the main sources of income in the Bernese Oberland. The region also has an extensive train network as well as many cable cars and funiculars, with the highest train station in Europe at the Jungfraujoch and the longest gondola cableway in the world from Grindelwald to the M\u00e4nnlichen.\nMountains in the Bernese Oberland include:\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nThe Grand Council of Bern (German: Grosser Rat / French: Grand conseil) is the parliament of the canton of Bern. It consists of 160 representatives elected by proportional representation for four-year terms of office. The French-speaking part of the canton, the Bernese Jura, has 12 seats guaranteed and 3 seats are guaranteed for the French-speaking minority of the bilingual district of Biel/Bienne.\nThe Executive Council of Bern (German: Regierungsrat / French: Conseil-\u00e9xecutif) is the government of the canton of Bern. This seven-member collegial body is elected by the people for a period of four years. The cantonal constitution reserves one seat in the Executive Council for a French-speaking citizen from the Bernese Jura.\nThe canton has a two-tiered court system, consisting of district courts and a cantonal Supreme Court (German: Obergericht, French: Cour supr\u00eame). There is also an administrative court (German: Verwaltungsgericht; French: Tribunal administratif) as well as other specialised courts and judicial boards.\n\n\n== Political subdivisions ==\n\nOn 1 January 2010, the 26 districts (Amtsbezirke) were combined into 10 new districts (Verwaltungskreise):\nBern-Mittelland with capital Ostermundigen, made up of all or part of the former districts of Bern, Fraubrunnen, Konolfingen, Laupen, Schwarzenburg and Seftigen\nBiel/Bienne with capital Biel/Bienne, made up of all of the former district of Biel and about half of the former district of Nidau\nEmmental with capital Langnau im Emmental, made up of all or part of the former districts of Burgdorf, Signau and Trachselwald\nFrutigen-Niedersimmental with capital Frutigen, made up of all or part of the former districts of Frutigen and Niedersimmental\nInterlaken-Oberhasli with capital Interlaken, made up of all or part of the former districts of Interlaken and Oberhasli\nJura bernois with capital Courtelary, made up of all or part of the former districts of Courtelary, Moutier and La Neuveville\nOberaargau with capital Wangen an der Aare, made up of all or part of the former districts of Aarwangen and Wangen\nObersimmental-Saanen with capital Saanen, made up of all of the former districts of Obersimmental and Saanen\nSeeland with capital Aarberg, made up of all or part of the former districts of Aarberg, B\u00fcren, Erlach and Nidau\nThun with capital Thun, made up of all of the former district of Thun\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe canton of Bern is bilingual: (as of 2014) both German (85.1% of the population) and French (10.4%) are spoken. The German-speaking majority speaks Bernese German, a Swiss German dialect. French-speakers live in the western and northern part of the canton, the Bernese Jura. Both German and French are spoken in the bilingual district of Biel/Bienne. In the cantonal government and administration, both languages are official languages of equal standing.\nBern has a population (as of December 2018) of 1,034,977. As of 2014, 15.0% of the population are resident foreign nationals. Over the last 4 years (2010\u20132014) the population has changed at a rate of 3.0%. Most of the population (as of 2000) speaks German (804,190 or 84.0%) as their first language, French is the second most common (72,646 or 7.6%) and Italian is the third (18,908 or 2.0%). There are 688 people who speak Romansh. Based on the new methodology of the 2014 census, the percentage of German native speakers increased to 85.1%, French speakers increased to 10.4% as did Italian speakers to 3.1%. The number of Romansh speakers was too small to accurately estimate, but was around 0.1%. The census also reported that 2.9% of the population speaks English as their native language. Respondents could choose up to three native languages, leading to a total above 100%.As of 2008, the population was 47.5% male and 52.5% female. The population was made up of 44,032 Swiss men (35.4% of the population) and 15,092 (12.1%) non-Swiss men. There were 51,531 Swiss women (41.4%) and 13,726 (11.0%) non-Swiss women. Of the population in the canton, 292,559 or about 30.6% were born in Bern and lived there in 2000. There were 339,659 or 35.5% who were born in the same canton, while 154,709 or 16.2% were born somewhere else in Switzerland, and 129,864 or 13.6% were born outside of Switzerland.As of 2014, children and teenagers (0\u201319 years old) make up 19.1% of the population, while adults (20\u201364 years old) make up 60.9% and seniors (over 64 years old) make up 19.9%. The 2000 census recorded 22%, 60.9% and 17.1% respectively.\nAs of 2000, there were 397,095 people who were single and never married in the canton. There were 449,014 married individuals, 61,206 widows or widowers and 49,882 individuals who are divorced.As of 2014, there were 454,000 private households in the canton, and an average of 2.2 persons per household. As of 2013, the construction rate of new housing units was 4.4 new units per 1000 residents.As of 2003 the average price to rent an average apartment in Bern city was 1108.92 Swiss francs (CHF) per month (US$890, \u00a3500, \u20ac710 approx. exchange rate from 2003). The average rate for a one-room apartment was 619.82 CHF (US$500, \u00a3280, \u20ac400), a two-room apartment was about 879.36 CHF (US$700, \u00a3400, \u20ac560), a three-room apartment was about 1040.54 CHF (US$830, \u00a3470, \u20ac670) and a six or more room apartment cost an average of 2094.80 CHF (US$1680, \u00a3940, \u20ac1340). The average apartment price in Bern was 99.4% of the national average of 1116 CHF. The vacancy rate for the canton, in 2010, was 1.19%.\n\n\n== Historic population ==\nThe historical population is given in the following chart:\n\n\n== Politics ==\nIn the 2011 federal election, the most popular party was the SVP which received 29.0% of the vote. The next three most popular parties were the SP/PS (19.3%), the BDP (14.9%) and the Green Party (9.4%). The SVP received about the same percentage of the vote as they did in the 2007 Federal election (33.6% in 2007 vs 29.0% in 2011). The SPS retained about the same popularity (21.2% in 2007), the BDP moved from below fourth place in 2007 to third and the GPS moved from below fourth place in 2007 to fourth.\n\n\n=== Federal election results ===\n^a  FDP before 2009, FDP.The Liberals after 2009\n^b  \"*\" indicates that the party was not on the ballot in this canton.\n^c  Part of a coalition with Separatist Party\n^d  Part of a coalition with the FGA\n^e  Party fragmented, part remained in a coalition with the FGA and the remainder formed the Green Party of Bern\n^f  Part of a coalition with the Green Party\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\nThe blazon of the coat of arms is Gules, on a bend or, a bear passant sable, langued, armed and vilen\u00e9 of the field. The official blazon specifies that the tongue, claws and penis are red\u2014and by extension it is important to always depict the bear as male.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\nMost Bernese are Protestant (as of 2000, 67%), and most Protestants belong to the Swiss Reformed Church, which is officially recognised as a state church (German: Landeskirche), although it is autonomous in its governance and is organised along democratic principles. The canton is also home to a great number of small Evangelical Christian denominations unaffiliated with the state church. Bernese evangelical groups are mostly found in the Emmental and Berner Oberland, where they have a long tradition; several contemporary American religious groups, such as the Amish and Mennonites, were founded or co-founded by Bernese emigrants to the United States. Two small Evangelical political parties are represented in the Bernese cantonal parliament.\nBern features substantial Roman Catholic (16%) and Christian Catholic minorities. These churches also have state church status, and the small Jewish community is similarly recognised by law. As everywhere in Switzerland, there are also significant religious communities of immigrants, including Sikhs (who have a prominent Gurdwara, or temple, in Langenthal), The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (who have built the Bern Switzerland Temple) and Muslims. As of 2006, the plans to expand a backyard mosque in Langenthal with a symbolic minaret have, as elsewhere in Switzerland, caused a public stir due to vocal opposition from local conservative and evangelical leaders.From the 2000 census, 607,358 or 63.5% belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church, while 153,357 or 16.0% were Roman Catholic. Of the rest of the population, there were 9,153 members of an Orthodox church (or about 0.96% of the population), there were 1,064 individuals (or about 0.11% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church, and there were 71,233 individuals (or about 7.44% of the population) who belonged to another Christian church. There were 807 individuals (or about 0.08% of the population) who were Jewish, and 28,377 (or about 2.96% of the population) who were Muslims. There were 2,662 individuals who were Buddhist, 5,991 individuals who were Hindu and 913 individuals who belonged to another church. 74,162 (or about 7.75% of the population) belonged to no church, are agnostic or atheist, and 37,059 individuals (or about 3.87% of the population) did not answer the question.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nTourism is the main source of income in the Bernese Oberland. Other important sectors are agriculture (especially cattle breeding), cheese making, and hydroelectric power generation. The Bernese cheese Emmentaler is known around the world. In the Bernese Midlands the lands are more fertile. Agriculture is of great importance, but this part of the canton is also the most industrialized. Small and middle-sized businesses are important employers in this part of the canton of Bern. There is a nuclear power plant at M\u00fchleberg.\nThe area around Lake Biel is renowned for its wine production. The 3 French-speaking districts of the Bernese Jura and the bilingual district of Biel/Bienne are renowned for their watch industry and its mechanical industry (high precision machine tools, automation and machining).\nAs of  2015, Bern had an unemployment rate of 2.58%, compared to the Swiss national average of 3.3%. As of 2013, there were 34,200 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 11,563 businesses involved in this sector. About 132,800 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 11,925 businesses in this sector. Approximately 453,800 people were employed in the tertiary sector, with 55,347 businesses in this sector. Of the working population, 31.0% used public transportation to get to work, and 51.0% used a private car.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn Bern about 385,640 or (40.3%) of the population have completed non-mandatory upper secondary education, and 121,749 or (12.7%) have completed additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule). Of the 121,749 who completed tertiary schooling, 65.0% were Swiss men, 24.8% were Swiss women, 6.2% were non-Swiss men and 4.0% were non-Swiss women.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMunicipalities of the canton of Bern\nCanton of Bern castles and fortresses\nList of mountains of the canton of Bern\nBerner Zeitung\nBernese March, traditional anthem of the canton\nBieler Tagblatt\nDer Bund\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nBerne Economic Development Agency\nOfficial statistics\nCanton of Bern in  German, French and Italian in the online Historical Dictionary of Switzerland.\nCoolidge, William Augustus Brevoort (1911). \"Bern\" .

          "Must see location when visiting Bern. Climbing the tower for a small fee of 5 Swiss Francs is well worth the effort. The view from the top is stunning and the experience can be very humbling for anyone interested in history and architecture. Would certainly recommend!",
          "Beautiful cathedral with a nice open space overlooking the River. We were able to see the Christmas markets set up as well, which was lovely albeit very busy. We did not see the inside of the cathedral.",
          "This is a beautiful church in Bern. The architecture is amazing, even the smallest of the details will make you feel awestruck that how beautifully it is created. Some part of it is still under renovation bit that doesn't obstruct your way \u2026",

          "Very nice building! Very organized and clean town!",
          "Great cathedral. It shows how a catholic church was converted to a reformed church. You can see how the virgin Marie figure brings sharp sword. You can also two different figures of 5 wise girls in the right of the gate and 5 stupid girls in the left. This suggests you to respect Holy spirit until Jesus' second coming.",
          "The platform behind/south of the cathedral also offers wonderful views and could be easily missed, go and seek it out! This church has a very unique architectural design. It is a must see when in Bern. Beside the church is a park overlooking the senic riverside.",

          "Beautiful cathedral with a rich history. Worth a visit for sure",
          "Excellent monument of medieval culture and architecture built by 1422. Unfortunately protestants destroyed majority of statues and icons but still there are many stained glass windows of XV century survived Protestant pogroms. Polichrome \u2026",
          "Nice church to visit even if you aren't religious. Recommend to climb to the top, it's a really long climb and it's payed but it's worth for the amazing view. If you are 70+ year's old you can sign a book if you climb to the top.",
          "Stupendous Gothic Minster that dominates the skyline of the Old City of Bern. Visited here January 2015 and it's an unforgettable experience. The first thing I noticed is the very tall spire of about 100 metres. The portals entrance is \u2026",

          "Cathedral service exquisite!",
          "Open daily 12-16. Attention, cash only! The Bernese M\u00fcnster, an attraction in the old town, but as a church little impressive. You can go up to the highest church tower in Switzerland, therefor is a charge of 5 CHF and cash only.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Zytglogge (Bernese German: [\u02c8tsi\u02cck\u02d0l\u0254k\u02d0\u0259]) is a landmark medieval tower in Bern, Switzerland. Built in the early 13th century, it has served the city as guard tower, prison, clock tower, centre of urban life and civic memorial.\nDespite the many redecorations and renovations it has undergone in its 800 years of existence, the Zytglogge is one of Bern's most recognisable symbols and the oldest monument of the city, and with its 15th-century astronomical clock, a major tourist attraction. It is a heritage site of national significance, and part of the Old City of Bern, a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nWhen it was built around 1218\u201320, the Zytglogge served as the gate tower of Bern's western fortifications. These were erected after the city's first westward expansion following its de facto independence from the Empire. At that time, the Zytglogge was a squat building of only 16 metres (52 ft) in height. When the rapid growth of the city and the further expansion of the fortifications (up to the K\u00e4figturm) relegated the tower to second-line status at around 1270\u201375, it was heightened by 7 metres (23 ft) to overlook the surrounding houses.Only after the city's western defences were extended again in 1344\u201346 up to the now-destroyed Christoffelturm, the Zytglogge was converted to a women's prison, notably housing Pfaffendirnen \u2013 \"priests' whores\", women convicted of sexual relations with clerics.  At this time, the Zytglogge also received its first slanted roof.\n\nIn the great fire of 1405, the tower burnt out completely. It suffered severe structural damage that required thorough repairs, which were not complete until after the last restoration in 1983. The prison cells were abandoned and a clock was first installed above the gate in the early 15th century, probably including a simple astronomical clock and musical mechanism. This clock, together with the great bell cast in 1405, gave the Zytglogge its name, which in Bernese German means \"time bell\".In the late 15th century, the Zytglogge and the other Bernese gate towers were extended and decorated after the Burgundian Romantic fashion. The Zytglogge received a new lantern (including the metal bellman visible today), four decorative corner towerlets, heraldic decorations and probably its stair tower. The astronomical clock was extended to its current state. In 1527\u201330, the clockwork was completely rebuilt by Kaspar Brunner, and the gateway was overarched to provide a secure foundation for the heavy machinery.\n\nThe Zytglogge's exterior was repainted by Gotthard Ringgli and Kaspar Haldenstein in 1607\u201310, who introduced the large clock faces that now dominate the east and west fa\u00e7ades of the tower. The corner towerlets were removed again some time before 1603. In 1770\u201371, the Zytglogge was renovated by Niklaus Hebler and Ludwig Emanuel Zehnder, who refurbished the structure in order to suit the tastes of the late Baroque, giving the tower its contemporary outline.Both fa\u00e7ades were again repainted in the Rococo style by Rudolf von Steiger in 1890. The idealising historicism of the design came to be disliked in the 20th century, and a 1929 competition produced the fa\u00e7ade designs visible today: on the west fa\u00e7ade, Victor Surbek's fresco \"Beginning of Time\" and on the east fa\u00e7ade, a reconstruction of the 1770 design by Kurt Inderm\u00fchle. In 1981\u201383, the Zytglogge was thoroughly renovated again and generally restored to its 1770 appearance. In the advent season and from Easter until the end of October, it is illuminated after dusk.\n\n\n=== Name ===\nThe Bernese German Zytglogge translates to Zeitglocke in Standard German and to time bell in English; 'Glocke' is German for 'bell', as in the related term 'glockenspiel'. A \"time bell\" was one of the earliest public timekeeping devices, consisting of a clockwork connected to a hammer that rang a small bell at the full hour. Such a device was installed in the Wendelstein in Bern \u2013 the tower of the Leutkirche church which the M\u00fcnster later replaced \u2013 in 1383 at the latest; it alerted the bell-ringer to ring the tower bells.The name of Zytglogge was first recorded in 1413. Previously, the tower was referred to as the kebie (\"cage\", i.e., prison) and after its post-1405 reconstruction, the n\u00fcwer turm (\"new tower\").\n\n\n== Exterior ==\n\n\n=== External structure ===\n\nThe Zytglogge has an overall height of 54.5 metres (179 ft), and a height of 24 metres (79 ft) up to the roof-edge. Its rectangular floor plan measures 11.2 by 10.75 metres (36.7 by 35.3 ft). The wall strengths vary widely, ranging from 260 centimetres (100 in) in the west, where the tower formed part of the city walls, to 65 centimetres (26 in) in the east.The outward appearance of the Zytglogge is determined by the 1770 renovation. Only the late Gothic cornice below the roof and the stair tower are visible artifacts of the tower's earlier history.The main body of the tower is divided into the two-storey plinth, whose exterior is made of alpine limestone, and the three-storey tower shaft sheathed in sandstone. The shaft's seemingly massive corner blocks are decorative fixtures held in place by visible iron hooks. Below the roof, the cornice spans around the still-visible bases of the former corner towerlets. The two-story attic is covered by  the sweeping, red-tiled, late Gothic spire, in which two spire lights are set to the West and East. They are crowned by ornamental urns with pinecone knobs reconstructed in 1983 from 18th-century drawings.From atop the spire, the  wooden pinnacle, copper-sheathed since 1930, rises an additional 15 metres (49 ft) into the skies, crowned with a gilded knob and a weather vane displaying a cut-out coat of arms of Bern.\n\n\n=== Bells and bell-striker ===\n\nThe tower's two namesake bronze bells hang in the cupola at its very top.\n\nThe great hour bell, cast by Johann Reber, has remained unchanged since the tower's reconstruction in 1405. It has a diameter of 127 centimetres (50 in), a weight of 1,400 kilograms (3,100 lb) and rings with a nominal tone of e'. The inscription on the bell reads, in Latin: \"In the October month of the year 1405 I was cast by Master John called Reber of Aarau. I am vessel and wax, and to all I tell the hours of the day.\"\nWhen the great bell rings out every full hour, struck by a large clockwork-operated hammer, passers-by see a gilded figure in full harness moving its arm to strike it. The larger-than-life figure of bearded Chronos, the Greek personification of time, is traditionally nicknamed Hans von Thann by the Bernese. The wooden bell-striker, which has been replaced several times, has been a fixture of the Zytglogge since the renewal of the astronomical clock in 1530, whose clockwork also controls the figure's motions. The original wooden Chronos might have been created by master craftsman Albrecht von N\u00fcrnberg, while the current and most recent Hans is a 1930 reconstruction of a Baroque original. The bell-striker has been gilded, just like the bells, since 1770.Below the hour bell hangs the smaller quarter-hour bell, also rung by a clockwork hammer. It was cast in 1887 to replace the cracked 1486 original.\n\n\n=== Clock faces and fa\u00e7ade decorations ===\n\nBoth principal fa\u00e7ades, East and West, are dominated by largeclockfaces. The Zytglogge's first clockface was likely located on the plinth, but was moved up to the center of the shaft during the tower's 15th-century reconfiguration.The eastern clock face features an outer ring of large golden Roman numerals, on which the larger hand indicates the hour, and an inner ring on which the smaller hand indicates the minutes. The golden sun on the hour hand is pivot-mounted so that it always faces up. Below the clock face one sees an idealised profile of city founder Duke Berchtold V of Z\u00e4hringen. While the exact decoration of the clockface has varied from renovation to renovation, the current (post-1983) layout is generally that of 1770.The western clock face has similar hands, but is an integral part of Victor Surbek's 1929 fresco \"Beginning of Time\". The painting depicts Chronos swooping down with cape fluttering, and, below the clockface, Adam and Eve's eviction from Paradise by an angel.\n\n\n=== Astronomical clock ===\nThe dial of the Zytglogge's astronomical clock is built in the form of an astrolabe. It is backed by a stereographically projected planisphere divided into three zones: the black night sky, the deep blue zone of dawn and the light blue day sky. The skies are crisscrossed with the golden lines of the horizon, dawn, the tropics and the temporal hours, which divide the time of daylight into twelve hours whose length varies with the time of year.Around the planisphere moves the rete, a web-like metal cutout representing the zodiac, which also features a Julian calendar dial. Above the rete, a display indicates the day of the week. Because leap days are not supported by the clockwork, the calendar hand has to be reset manually each leap year on 29 February. A moon dial circles the inner ring of the zodiac, displaying the moon phase. The principal hand of the clock indicates the time of day on the outer ring of 24 golden Roman numerals, which run twice from I to XII. It features two suns, the smaller one indicating the date on the rete's calendar dial. The larger one circles the zodiac at one revolution per year and also rotates across the planisphere once per day. Its crossing of the horizon and dawn lines twice per day allows the timing of sunrise, dawn, dusk and sunset.The painted frieze above the astronomical clock shows five deities from classical antiquity, each representing both a day of the week and a planet in their order according to Ptolemaic cosmology. From left to right, they are: Saturn with sickle and club for Saturday, Jupiter with thunderbolts for Thursday, Mars with sword and shield for Tuesday, Venus with Cupid for Friday and Mercury with staff and bag for Wednesday. The painting of the entire clock area was refurbished in 1983. Only the matte areas on the clock face are from the earlier coat of paint.\n\n\n==== Movement ====\nThe clock dial has been dated to either the building phases of 1405 or 1467-83, or to the installation of the Brunner clockwork in 1527-30. Ueli Bellwald notes that the planisphere uses a southern projection, as was characteristic for 15th-century astronomical clocks; all later such clocks use a northern projection. This would seem to confirm the dating of the clock to the 1405 or 1467/83 renovations.A clock is documented in this tower since 1405, when a new bell was installed.\n\n\n== Interior ==\nThe Zytglogge's internal layout has changed over time to reflect the tower's change of purpose from guard tower to city prison to clock tower. The thirteenth-century guard tower was not much more than a hollow shell of walls that was open towards the city in the east. Only in the fourteenth century was a layer of four storeys inserted.The rooms above the clockwork mechanism were used by the city administration for various purposes up until the late 20th century, including as archives, storerooms, as a firehose magazine and even as an air raid shelter. The interior was frequently remodelled in a careless, even vandalistic fashion; for instance, all but three of the original wooden beams supporting the intermediate floors were destroyed. Since 1979, the tower's interior is empty again. It is only accessed for maintenance and in the course of regular guided tours.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBellwald, Ueli (1983).

          "Built in the early 13th century to serve the city as guard tower, prison, clock tower, centre of urban life and civic memorial. Eqquipped 15th-century astronomical clock that still working. There is tram stop in front of tower named after it, that's good stop to explore the",
          "This clock is a heritage one and takes you to an era. The streets are amazing and the clock looks magestic.",
          "we had a lot of time shooping and walking in the streets in this amazing place under the clock tower.There was a lot of tourists and the place was magical in Christmas.",
          "Must see. This astronomical calendar clock is more than 500 years old. It shows the time, the moon phases, the zodiac and others. It has figures that move every hour. Must see in Bern.",
          "This old tower and it\u2019s fantastic, mechanical clock is a must have seen in Berne. Your guide will teach you a lot about the history of the capital city of Switzerland and how the city grew. If you are interested why there was a \u201eBerne mean time\u201c and what ended it, you need to",
          "We had herd so much about this clock tower that we were literally wanting to see this first. It did not disappoint! We felt like kids standing there waiting for the clock to strike the hour! When it did ... it was very nostalgic of simpler times! If you are in Bern... it\u2019s hard",
          "One of the oldest clocks in Europe which sits on the old tower entrance to the Old Town in Bern The figures on the clock make cameo appearances every hour .",
          "While its tough to get a good shot of the clock face because of the tourists who flock to it, you see it coming and going along the Kramgasse and it's worth braving the crowds to see!",
          "I saw it on my way to the hotel, I saw it when I was going to a visit point, I saw it on my return, I saw it when I left to the train station. I found out that you can book visits - I would recommend you to do so, otherwise it will be just a check on a list or another photo",
          "Come join the hoards of others at the top of the hour to watch the minuretes bang the bell and dance. Not much more than that but it sure draws the crowds.",
          "On the marktgasse you can meet and observe the Zytglogge the very beautiful clock which is another symbol of the city of Bern.",
          "Try to visit at midday for the best show as the clock strikes twelve. Get busy at this time but is worth it. Enjoy",
          "When in Bern, make sure to have reservations for the tour of the Zytglogge. It sure is a marvel of medieval technology. Our guide, an older lady, was very knowledgeable and taught us about the history of the tower and it's beautiful clock. We got the chance to see the figurines",
          "We waited to see the clock strike! My kids were amazed to watch the whole performance of the mechanized characters come out. I have the best pictures of my son watching!",
          "Every place has its uniqueness and history to convey. This is the tower next to the residence of Albert Einstein. It attracts more visitors to see since it has witnessed the history of Bern since 13/14th century, One could see the astronomical clock and tower. The tourists",
          "The wonderful astrolabium clockwork is very elaborate. However the action is more longterm than on the hour and promises more than it actually keeps. There a tiny little bit of movement: Golden Hans von Thann rings the bell, the fool too, the chickens nod. That\u2018s it.",
          "A beutiful attraction in Bern, right on the main street of old town of Bern....you can reach it also with bus No 12 and get off at ''Zytglogge'' stop. Nice cafes closeby.....",
          "The outside is interesting to look at, but the real gem is to pay for a tour and see the inner workings and the view. I learned of the history of Bern, and enjoyed contemplating the craft that goes into building something like this--it's the seeds of Swiss excellence that",
          "If you happen to be around, take your time to watch it. It is definitely worth your while. Just a few minutes before each hour.",
          "It's a clock tower in the middle of the square with shopping and a few fountains around. It's a cool thing to see but not much else around unless you want to do some shopping, eating or drinking.",
          "As you walk down a main shopping street in Bern you will pass the Zytglogge. If you are lucky enough to be there on the hour, the clock mechanism puts on quite a show! Well worth timing the visit for this. With your back to the tower, look down the street and you will see a",
          "Don\u2019t miss the clock tower when visiting Bern. All the action starts at 3 minutes before each hour. Watch the different figures and bells from the street below the clock face. Best seen during the higher number hours. There\u2019s also a daily tour at 2:30pm that\u2019s well worth the",
          "Well, as silly as this sounds, if you are in Bern, this is free and really, why not? So you stand in the street and watch the clock. And as the time gets to the hour, the figurines all do their thing and it really is worth seeing.",
          "A short walk from the church on the main road lined with all branded stores, takes you here. Do have a look at all the old measuring instruments maintained & kept painstakingly just below it.",
          "Zyglogge-Turm is Bern\u2019s famous clock tower (circa 1530) which was part of the original wall of the first gate to the city",
          "After wandering through the streets of Bern, we came across the exquisite Zytglogge just before it was due to strike noon. It is a real crowd puller with plenty of people gathered in the streets below to see its mechanics in action. Very pretty to look at & a great spectacular",
          "Visited here with myn wife and a Swiss friend and were given the tour in the company of German and English-speaking visitors. Unfortunately the guide concentrated on delivering her talk in German, particularly focussing on one German-speaking boy, so not as informative as it",
          "Don\u2019t get me wrong, the clock is amazing but the views and photo ops are all marred by the wires to power the trams. I know, it\u2019s petty, but I feel like it would be so much more interesting and better advertised if all the photos didn\u2019t include tram wires. Again, it\u2019s amazing,",
          "A beautiful clock tower in the heart of the Alstadt. On the face is a series of miniature figures that signal the time.",
          "The clock tower is a prominent tower in the Old Town of Bern. Every hour you will get to hear and see the little figures move. A more detailed explanation of the mechanism and history is available if you take the tour.",
          "Beautiful building that highlights old town of bern, qith a beautiful clock and sculptures! It is located in the middle of a wonderful walk on the old town of Bern!",
          "Right in the centre of the city. you can stop on a walk around the city and watch the little figures move around. Easy to reach",
          "Since I wasn't that into the history of the square, it was a nice walk around the town. However, I do not think that this is an absolute must for visiting as there are many other wonderful places in Switzerland.",
          "You've got to see this if for no other reason than because of it's iconic status. Be sure to get there about 5 minutes before the hour to see the bears come go around.",
          "The Zytglogge is quite the site to see! It dates back to 1530. (So many things in Bern have quite the history!) I was there with a group, waiting for the hour to chime. There is a bronze figure at the top, that hits a small bell, and there are figures below that, what looks",
          "Do visit the clock tower, but expect that you will be one of many tourists gawking when the clock strikes the hour.",
          "This lovely old town clock is well worth 5 minutes of your time. catch it at just before the hour and watch the figures 'dance' around as the chimes go. it makes a very strange noise just before the movement starts so you can start videoing and not miss a thing",
          "If there is a crowd somewhere, you will usually believe it is worth waiting. This applies here and there is nothing to see. It was 1pm... so I observed one gong... and that\u2019s it !",
          "The clock is a nice symbol of Bern but I expected more. The bells toll on the hour a mechanical bird makes some noise and the figures move around for a few seconds and that's about it. I had read and heard the hype but honestly its just that, hype. Nice to see but don't go out",
          "What best remember me about how beautiful Bern is . The clock tower to me was symbolic of the city. Nice to observe how it is made. Nice to see how it reflects what it is.",
          "Best to go when the figures are all in action. Crowds of tour parties were lined up for the big photo shots at noon.",
          "My favorite travel writer describes the hourly performance of the Zytglogge a non-event ... and that is absolute truth! Starting at four minutes before the hour, the rooster crows once (big gap -- maybe a minute), the jester rings bells for the time while the bears swirls on a",
          "I do not understand how anyone could have seen this and not thought it to be amazing. The clock tower and the clock are both mammoth-sized and utterly beautiful. The chimes/bells sound so lovely as well. This is truly a part of the town's history.",
          "It\u2019s a beautiful clock by a beautiful area of town. However, the mechanism of the clock is disappointing comparing to the one in Prague Old Town. You could see the disappointed expression of everyone\u2019s face on top of the hour. If you\u2019re there, ok. Don\u2019t make it a priority for",
          "This is a bit of unusual history when you read sign about how it was first used. Can't miss is as you come into the city.",
          "You can't miss it. Definitely should see it and take a few pics. You can sense the history here. On the hour, there's a little surprise...",
          "We gathered with the crowd at both noon and 3pm to see the magical clockworks do it's thing. Honestly, it wasn't much of a thing. A wheel of characters paraded once around, and a few things wiggled. But that was it. The clock tower and animatronics are quite a thing to see.",
          "This is a must see attraction if in Bern. Not only is it an historical and interesting building, it has a unique clock tower. In addition to the chimes, there are moving figures on one side.",
          "The Clock Tower (Zytglogge) was the main clock of Bern in earlier days. Built in the 15th century - the Clock Tower has become the landmark of Old Town Bern. The fascinating clockwork and display of mechanics every hour are awe-inspiring. A \"must visit\" when you are in",
          "Reminds me of the Astronomical Clock of Prague. You can't miss this historic clock in Bern when you walk around the old town. It may not be grand as the one in Prague but it won't hurt to stop for a while and inspect its detail.",
          "If you head over to the old town, one of the first things you will notice is the clock tower. It is one of the pieces of past history in Bern that I admire best. Sadly it is only opened once every day but at every hour is a bell ringing where the parts of the clock move. Very",
          "It's a clock but the truth is that I have seen a better one in Prague!but is something beautiful where need to see when you travel in Berne",
          "I have passed by several times along this famous clock in the heart of Bern. Every half an hour there is a sort of choreography appearing on the clock, intact you find many tourists standing by in front of this clock, waiting for the spectacle. It is possibile to enter also",
          "Good to visit several times as it is easy to miss some of the action. Be careful of passing trucks & other vehicles.",
          "We went to Bern to see the clock . It is very beautiful but it is only open once a day to go in and we could not make that time ,so slightly disappointed",
          "We were so amazing and delighted to be able to watch this ancient clock chime the hour and listen to the bells as they were struck high up in the tower, watch the movement of various sculpted golden animals, birds, people as the time was acclaimed! How wonderful that it is still",
          "Be sure to be there 5 minutes before the full hours to witness the moving of the differents parts of the clock!",
          "We were there last Friday, the clock is working well but the hourly show did not happen. At the hour mark the clock would jump but couple of minutes, scaping the show!!! My guests were disappointed not being able to witness a 700-year-old traditional event!",
          "Set in the bustling shopping area it is a throwback to a different era. Being a World Heritage site , it\u2019s a must visit.",
          "I love a good clock tower. My wife and I were conveniently walking by this one when it started to do it\u2019s on the hour show. It\u2019s a cute little thing enhanced by the extreme age of the structure and the clock.",
          "In Old Town Bern, there are a few clock towers but Zytglogge was my favorite. I thought it was very colorful and very pretty. Just be careful of the trams that run underneath them if you are trying to take a picture.",
          "Enjoy the views and the quaint streets with several restaurants and cafe. Some prior reading on the history and inner workings of the clock will make you appreciate the clock tower a bit more.",
          "This is a beautiful clock tower and is the centerpiece of Bern. Highly detailed and interesting. Much like the clock tower in Prague, it is one of the must see sites of a lovely city.",
          "Try to time your visit to this astronomical clock \"on the hour\" when the bells strike and the figures commence their performance.",
          "This clock tower is 10 min waking distance from train station. Its a colourful clock tower. 5 min from tower there is Aare river, one can sit and relax at the side of river.",
          "Old clock towers are one of my weak points because I always admire the great mix of Engineering, architecture and art that usually make each one of them special. This example is not as spectacular as the one is Prague but still very interesting to see",
          "I arrive just before noon to see 100s of people gathered in the middle of the street looking up at, and taking pictures of the clock tower. Everyone was waiting for the clock to reach 12. Suddenly there silently appeared an electric street car, trying to get the people to move",
          "Arguably the most famous clock tower in Swiss. Famous for the mechanical show which performed at 5 pm.",
          "We visited here on the last day of our trip to Switzerland, was somewhat underwhelmed... maybe it was down to bad timing?... clock tower was covered in scaffolding and workers buzzing around it",
          "The history behind the clock tower is a good read for history lovers. We traveled to Bern on the way to Zurich Airport to see this clock tower as recommended by my relatives. But I was not very impressed with it.",
          "When we were there, they were renovating it so we really couldn't see it very well, the history behind it is interesting and from what we could see, the clock seemed to be very beautiful, it reminded me of the clock in Vienna, I love old clocks and would have loved to see it in",
          "This was under repair when we watched. So not much happened on the hour. Scaffolding and workmen around.",
          "The clock has some interesting history behind it if you take the time to read about it or have a guide, but beyond that I didn\u2019t find it that remarkable. It\u2019s a big clock, but not amazingly beautiful or ornate. Every hour at 4 min before the hour the bells ring and the figures",
          "I have heard of this clock and seen it in movies for most of my life. They have just finished a restoration and fresh painting of the figures on the clock. They were removing the scaffolding the day we were there. The tour inside the clock was interesting and worthwhile.",
          "Was just here June 3 and the picture below shows that there is only a little scaffolding left. Great clock, fun to see.",
          "Unfortunately when I was there, workers were busy working. Disappointed as I was unable to get a good picture with all the scaffolding around it.",
          "Located in a lively part of the city, the area is teeming with shops and activity...nice for a stroll",
          "My rating is based on a previous visit when we could admire the famous Clock Tower in its full beauty. This time we were quite disappointed to discover that it was being renovated and we could only see the painting on the covers. But of course, renovation is welcome and I",
          "Check before you go. Clock tower was under construction, with a huge cloth covering it. But I believe it will look great with that huge clock face once fully renovated. What a pity",
          "The clock tower adds to the historic feel for Bern. Fun to walk around and enjoy the historical setting.",
          "The clock is being renovated at the moment so there is nothing to see at the moment. I don't know when the work will be finished.",
          "Definitely worth seeing this whimsical clock tower. It plays every hour on the dot. Lots of tourist stop by to see it. Would recommend to get there a few minutes before it starts playing to get good pictures",
          "I made a special effort to go and see this clock, having read about it on the internet ahead of our travels. I loved the bears who make up the characters in the clock, and the Jester who rings his bell! I would have stayed for a whole day to watch all the different bear",
          "15 April I arrived at Bern this tower is under construction. I cannot see this clockwork. I am not sure when it is finished but for a while you cannot see the ceremony of clock",
          "Was a wonderful visit. Got to know the history of the clock tower from the guide . Inside the tower,one has to climb the steps, however to see the whole mechanism that makes the whole clock tower work was priceless experience.",
          "I grew up in this beautiful town and till this day I am still mesmerized by the incredible history Bern has to offer. Even after living more than two decades in the US I still go back here once in a while to see the workings of one of the most famous clock towers in the world.",
          "We would have liked to see it, but unfortunately it has been under renovation since February. It should be visible again in June. We'll be back to see it",
          "One side is being repaired, the other is available for viewing. Heard the hourly chimes, but did not see the animation.",
          "If seeing the clock is a major objective of your travel, which I doubt, be aware that the clock is shrouded in scaffolding and will be until 6/18. I was sad to have missed seeing it work... it will be back in all its glory this summer, 2018",
          "Clock is undergoing some renovations so you might not be able to see it in all its glory for the next couple of months.",
          "Switzerland and clocks go hand in hand and this attraction proves how true this is. In the center of the old town stands this huge clock tower that immediately grabs everyone's attention. Whenever it plays makes it feel as though you're in medieval times surrounded by",
          "This monument to the passage of time was one of the highlights of my visit to Bern. The feeling of antiquity generated by the clock itself is enhanced by its surroundings: cobbled streets, galleried stone buildings concealing the commercial premises of a city centre",
          "This only needs a short description, as the important thing is to there at least then minutes before the hour. Any visitor to Switzerland is automatically interested in clocks and watches, and this one is a Must See in Bern. It is in the centre of town, halfway down the main",
          "Huge clock and very beautiful, so it is a must see. It's in the middle of the Old Town so it is hard to miss.",
          "Clock tower was built in the 13th century. It\u2019s one of those things you just need to go see even though it\u2019s not a huge or magnificent in size. Interesting history and a Bern must see.",
          "I\u2019m Bern there was a clock, clearly a beautiful clock, we are all traveling through time together, sometimes it\u2019s nice to stop and watch the time go buy and admire the beauty of it with strangers with just as much time to spare.",
          "Probably better seen in summer, this did the job of striking the hours with animated figures. Quite orbate, mildly interesting.",
          "When you take a trip aroud Bern ...wanted or not you will see and clock tower...wich i think is good to visit coz 100%you will have this at your way..not.much to say just take a pic and move on .",
          "It is worthy to visit in Bern. There is a old clock that include an astrolabe. It is said that there is a ceremony to change the astrolabe because it will not move itself anymore.",
          "We enjoyed the clock tower twice. Once on our way to Albert Einstein's house and then on our return. The clock tower's intricacies deserve a second look. Quite enjoyable.",
          "The 13the century clock is located in the old town of Bern. The bell rings at the hour and the statues start moving. Get there before the hour, (get your phone/camera ready) wait and watch!",
          "Lovely little clock tower, it's not as impressive as the one in Prague, but when you walk through the cobbled street towards the tower it does look nice and it gives the street a nice feature point.",
          "A major tourist attraction, most are oblivious to passing busses! It is a must see if you come to Bern.",
          "This is a remarkable clock which is a must seeing when you are in Bern. Be there on time and watch the qiet spectacle. Clock lovers from all over the world visit the Ziitgloggeturm.",
          "At the entrance to your promenade inside the old town you will meet this lovely designed clock that a great golden designs.",
          "The Clock Tower, one of the towers you will find around the city, is a magnificent show of history and time-telling. Centuries old, the clock, still works perfectly and continues to delight crowd who comes to witness its show as it changes hour. A tour inside is possible, and",
          "Bern is a waking city where you could find historic and modern attractions in one go. Reachable by foot or tram, the city offers historic sites, shopping, food and things to while away your time. Place could be so cold at winter time and so warm on summer. Just be really and",
          "It is a beautiful thing to watch if you are walking around the old city, it doesn't take too much time, especially if you can get to see it on the full hour, is worth the few minutes.",
          "Nothing special but a typical clock tower in Europe. Manage your expectation, it's nothing comparable with the Prague one.",
          "Ancient clock tower is exquisite to look at. It is located on the main thoroughfare through the old city. A very beautiful display of Swiss workmanshhip, the clock is a must see!",
          "it's not particularly a must-go, but if you roam around and walk by, then feel free to take a photo and maybe wait for the 'show' at every hour.",
          "This is a great historic clock tower and, uniquely, offers great views from two sides. It's especially scenic at night.",
          "Every hour, the ancient Zytglogge (Clock Tower) marks the time with a crowing rooster, a circle of bears, a zodiacal clock, a man striking a bell, and more As the top of the hour neared, our accredited city guide unlocked a door and took us right inside. We climbed narrow",
          "You dont have to make time to go visit this. When you walking along the streets of Bern you would be able to see the clock tower and make a quick stop. Its a good old landmark monument.",
          "One of its most famous sites, the square around the tower gets quite crowded as the 'hour' gets near. One needs to look up to see the anvils strike the bell and the rotating figures which appear a few minutes before the hour.",
          "Apparently 3pm is the magic hour for this clock to perform. It's beautitful but it doesn't put on a big show like I expected. The town square is cobbled and old with cafes everywhere and trams running right through the middle of it. There are several cafes around to have an",
          "We did not tour it but the animated figures that come to life each hour are quaint and entertaining.",
          "So historic and gorgeous ! A must see while in Bern! You will love it! Try to walk around and enjoy the view.",
          "Similar to many similar clock towers all over Europe, nothing out of the ordinary; but it does serves as a good landmark for visitors unfamiliar with the city like us.",
          "Wow, to think this was created nearly 500 years ago is quite mind blowing considering the technology/engineering involved. If you go to Bern to must watch the clock & read up on what all the astrological motions mean, very fascinating!",
          "As part of a walking tour of old town, the clock tower overview was a definite highlight. Our very knowledgeable and enthusiastic tour guide explained the workings of the clock, the various gears, counterweights and pendulum. She talked about the clock keeper who spent a",
          "You have to take a photo of the clock tower in Bern but the clock movement isnt all that exciting. I guess you have to watch it if you are in town but it is relatively short and not on par with others such as in Prague.",
          "Nice, old tower to look at and take pictures of but slightly disappointing when we got there 15 min until the hour to view the 'show'. Everyone was left with a 'was that it?' expression after it was finished.",
          "A beautiful tower from anciant time, the symbol of Bern city is the Time Tower with a super complicated astronomic watch. Read a guid book to know details haw it works. Really complicated but if you follow the description, you will find ech symbol on it. The tower has another",
          "As we were already close to the clock tower after having lunch at restaurant anker we decided we'd go and see what all the fuzz in the tourist guide was about. There were at least 3 asian groups in front of the tower so it was hard to get a decent picture but we did enjoy the",
          "The main tourist spot of the city, but I was disappointed from the sound of the bells. I was a better sound and more bells. Of course I respect the clock due to the time it was made.",
          "Lovely old clock tower with mechanical figures set in a very scenic location. We sat on the other side in the square with a coffee and it's a great view.",
          "The clock tower is a large, historical clock, with an animated display at certain times of day. It overlooks a bustling market street. Make sure to look at both faces, and check out the measuring standards on the wall underneath.",
          "This 15th century astronomical clock attracts large crowds daily in the nearby streets to witness the hour chimes. The coordinated movements of the various pieces have the crowds in awe and gasping. Don't focus in on one movement or you may miss others. Perhaps best to watch",
          "We enjoyed viewing this historical landmark in Bern and every hour you can see how the mechanism performs. This clock dates back to the 16th century and is certainly a memorable Part of world heritage!",
          "Nice tower clock but nothing special. You can take a nice picture, but do not expect more. There are many clock towers in Europe.",
          "It is an amazing tower, rich, historical and iconic. You will just feel good looking at the tower and taking lots of pictures with t!!",
          "Still keeping time. Timex and Rolex eat your heart out. This structure is highly representative of Bern, stalwart and always on the job.",
          "before you visit you should inform yourself about the history of the Clocktower. Esepcially take a look at your timing. If you miss the certain hour, you wont see the \"Performance\" the tower will show. If you are realy interested in the mechanism in the interier, you can book a",
          "Read about it first before you go so that it will be easier to understand and follow through the mechanics of this complicated and fascinating piece of history. It was raining a. It when we were there but that did not stop us from listening to our Your guide and admiring this",
          "Not the bigger or the most interest clock tower I've seen in Europe. It's located on the middle of Bern Old Town and it's hard to miss it. Take some pictures, but don't expect more than that.",
          "There are clock towers all over Swiss cities, from stand alone clock towers to churches and beyond. This was a nice clocktower because of the archway underneath where both people and public transportation can flow through. It also makes for a good landmark for finding your way",
          "The clock tower is old, beautiful and cool to see but you should level set your expectations regarding the puppet show. First, it's a very short display. Secondly, due to its age the puppet show is out of sync with the clock. It starts a minute or so before the hour. So be",
          "Near to train station and located in UNESCO world heritage site this is a nice attraction to see and click pics.",
          "I've climbed many cathedral and city hall towers in European cities, and the Berne Munster click tower is pretty much on par with the better ones. It is a bit if a hike (344 steps), but it is a one-way path so you don't have oncoming traffic constantly trying to squeeze by. It",
          "Many tour groups stop in Bern on the way trough either from Lucerne/Interlaken to Geneva. All they get to see/do is a quick run from the Bear pit where busses can conveniently park to the clock tower where there is a mechanical 16th century \"Glockenspiel\" set of figurines coming",
          "I was in the old part of Bern and just happen to come upon the clock tower. I pulled out my guide book to read all about the tower, and as I was reading, the clock started moving. I had been traveling in Germany and had seen some of their clocks, but I loved Bern's clock tower",
          "I will say it has a nice architecture & all the animals do look good at the top of the hour when it starts ringing bells. It is one the main street in the old city area where you see the street with all the flags & Einstein's house. Plan to visit around the top of an hour so",
          "I was very good clocks ring bell at every hour and every character moves it was good to see and also recommend",
          "Once the clock strikes the hour, the figures beneath provide some entertainment... the cock crows, then the figure waves his seplacaru and the lion moves his head... then wait, and wait and the cock crows again (takes about 7 minutes)... it's ancient so you need to wait till",
          "There are many other clock towers in the world that are more interesting and more spectacular than the one in Bern. It is OK to see when passing by, but not worth a detour!",
          "Large crowds with tourists everywhere waiting for the clanging of the bells on the hour. It was nice if you are in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to see it. It was incredible how all the parts synchronized together.",
          "Such a beautiful clock tower, to be understood on many different levels. We were lucky enough to be on a private tour with Maria Teresa Lauper, a private local guide who is not only very knowledgeable but also winds this clock twice a week. There is a very involved sequence of",
          "It seemed as if all the tourists congregate right in front of the clock tower just before the hour strikes. It was fun to watch all the moving parts of the clock when it struck. However, there is more to Bern than just the clock tower. Go further.",
          "The clock tower is iconic in the home of find watches. Be there on the hour to view the activity. Awesome",
          "The clock tower is historic, central, on the self guided walking tour map and interesting. Go on the hour to see the full effect. Perhaps going late morning or early evening may give you more effects ?",

          "The clock tower (Zytglogge) in Bern should be an integral part of any walking tour of the city. Yes, it's a clock, but a special one, and once an hour you get a minor show where parts of the clock do their thing. It doesn't last long, so don't expect too much. The sun clock",
          "Read any book on Bern and one of the \"must see\" things to take in is the Clock Tower marking the hour. So we joined the crowds gathered beneath this admittedly very impressive structure and awaited with baited breath. About two to three minutes before the hour one section sprung",

          "One cannot pass thru Bern without stopping by this marvel of a Monument, be there when the clock strikes, its an unforgettable experience",
          "There is a spinning part and a gold man strikes the hour. My husband told me that it's really old and I shouldn't expect so much. Which is true. Somewhere there's a life size cuckoo clock that I was expecting but it isn't here.",
          "This is one of the oldest clock towers with very traditional feel to it. The little figurines on the clock are very cute. At first look you will think whether the clock is working or not, but as you spend time gazing you will fall for it. Try and visit the clock tower at an",

          "Undoubtedly it is the key landmark to visit in the city of Bern. It is an old clock tower which served the city for several hundred years as an important monument, very well preserved and maintained till today. Clock tower is known as \"Zytglogge\" locally. It is located in the",

          "The clock tour is located in one of the towers near the central area of 'Old Bern'. The history of the clock and tower is quite interesting begging any visitor to take an official tour to see the inner workings. You can just visit the outside to see the hourly display but we",
          "We arrived in plenty of time to see the \"show,\" yet there was really not much to it. A bird squawked, a king raised his hour glass, and the clock chimed. It's a beautiful clock in a lovely town, but there's really not much to the show.",
          "If you are close by near the top of the hour, it is worth a stop. It is nice that a longstanding tradition remains alive. Get you camera ready and zoomed in...",
          "Figures strike a bell on the hour which is heard throughout the town. Not something seen in the USA but in relatively few locations throughout Europe. A cool, must see event.",
          "Impressive for its age and easy to find in the old town. They don't make them like that anymore. Worth a bisit",
          "It has two faces, the back face tell the story of Adam and Eva after eating from the tree and getting spilled out of Aden. The front face is a great clock with beautiful colors.",
          "This was one of my favorite parts of my trip to Switzerland. Maybe it was because we were there for a Swiss watchmaking business trip but we got to go inside and climb all the way to the top of the tower!! Very steep climbs to the top but worth the picturesque views at the top",

          "One the oldest Clock towers in the world and located in the heart of charming Old Town of Bern is a must-see attraction in the capital of Switzerland. Just stone throw away you can find Einstein's apartment.",

          "Beautiful and very clear and loud . You can see the boy in gold banging the bell at the top. Lovely sound too",
          "Nice tower to see, most people wait for the puppet play every full hour, which in my eyes is overrated. Also the surrounding of the tower is not really beautiful, too much public transportation driving around by any time. The almost similar clocktower in Prague is much more",
          "The clock tower is a landmark that you will be disappointed to not see if you visit Bern. There are a number of clock towers across the city - and Switzerland more broadly - that all have historical significance, but this one is certainly the stand-out of them all. It's",
          "We timed our meandering through the city so we could watch the clock. By modern standards the movement of the figures is stilted and minimalistic, but to think about all of the engineering required to run this historical clock is amazing! Would love to have taken the tour that",

          "First let me say this is a must see attraction for any visitor to Bern BUT I wouldn't say that the top of the hour visit is a must. The history is incredible but the motion at the hourly chimes is just a small short amount of motion. We even heard others waiting with us saying",
          "Nice example of architecture and engineering. Located in the main center of the relatively small size",

          "Full of its details, the clock is very well made and shows not only hours and minutes, but also day, weekday, month and zodiac sign of the current period.",
          "This is an imposing and very pretty, colourful clock tower and you'll want photos of it for your album. As it gets closer to the hour large numbers of people gather to see the figures. The display is interesting, but not spectacular.",
          "Located in the picturesque centre of Bern the clock tower draws people from all around on the hour when the figures appear from one side and move around in front of the clock, disappearing at the other side. Get there arly if ou want to be close enough to see the action.",
          "This clock tower is colourful and nice. The unique part is that this is a two side clock instead of the normal 4 sided clock. There are two clocks on the one side and only one the other. Why? Hope that somebody can tell me that.",
          "Waited for the hour to see the clock in action, not worth the wait! See it, pretty colours, style. But the action on/around the hour is so so.",
          "The clock is a nice historic and iconic landmark to see in Bern. On the hour, there is a small cuckoo clock display that starts moving. The display is really small compared to the rest of the clock, though.",
          "The clock tower is a must-see if you come to Bern. It is a huge tower with an ancient clock with a middle-aged style. It reminds the clock tower in Prague. If you ever come to Bern, visiting this tower is mandatory. Very nice!",
          "Many people wait for o'clock show around the clock tower but not much clock movement to see. Only little tricks and clock bell rings. Don't expect much @ o'clock performance. The clock tower condition is well maintained and colourful painting by the side is nice.",
          "This is a beautiful example of engineering and history but I would not recommend hanging around for ages to see it striking the hour; there's so much else to see in the city. Admire it for a few moments and carry on exploring",
          "We visited Bern for the Christmas markets and also waited for the 12pm show from clock tower. Bern is beautiful with its covered arcades and street fountains but the Clock Tower is a little disappointing. I would not wait around to see the show as not much happens. Plus the",
          "Whether you wait for the \u201cshow\u201d or you pass by to take a few photos....Stop and admire the details of this ornate clock.",
          "Unfortunately the only attraction of this Clock Tower is the clock face and associated astronomical clock. It is possible to climb up inside the tower but as it is now privately occupied it's not possible to either get a city view from the tower or see inside the old rooms.",
          "There is so much going on here when it sounds from the bears to the rooster to the bells that you should take the clock tour to appreciate everything that goes on behind the scenes to how everything happens to make it so cool.",
          "Its a clock tower, unfortunately I do not have much history on it but its definitely something everyone wants to see. Beautifully designed.",
          "Walking through central Bern you will find it hard not to encounter this clock. Visible from the Main Street along which most of the teams seem to run, it attracts virtually every tourist group. That's not a bad thing - you can still view the clock and its mechanical figurines",
          "Just walking around town you'll see the Clock Tower, it's impressive, so well kept a must see along with the rest of the Old Town.",
          "Purely by chance my walk of Old Bern arrived at the perfect hour, midday, to see all the movements the clock makes. Usefully explained by my ipod guide, the symbolism would have otherwise completely escaped me. One dial tells the time, yes, but look at the hands - it also",
          "One of the beautiful attraction place in Bern , there are so many attraction place in this Old Town ,which very close to each other , it is easy to spot it and most of the trams and buses will passing this area~",
          "Merely a photo-op unless you are visiting inside the clock. Skip the hourly \"show\" of the clock, its absolutely unimpressive.",
          "I passed by on the 20th of October while going on a nearby restaurant to dine. It is nice to look at it and take a couple of photos. Nothing to spend a lot of time on it. There are other better options to spend your time on.",
          "Had a guided tour of Bern, which may be the only way to get inside the clock tower -- the guide has keys. Really fascinating inside, and worth the steep climb to the top. Guide said this is the oldest and largest clock mechanism in the world that is still working. Very cool!",
          "Not very interesting. You can see all chinese in the city. An usual tower not a big ben. Switzerland is divided in 4 regions. German speaking french italian and Roman. Tourist have selected areas . Some areas are full of indian visitors some with russian some with arabic and and",

          "The clock tower is one of the main sights in Bern and it's an interesting structure, but it's not a must-see sight. You'll almost certainly see the tower anyway as you explore the old town and it's difficult to miss it as it is very visible from the main street through the old",
          "This is a must see if you're in Berne especially since the complicated mechanical clock puts on a little \"show\" on the hour. It's also the gateway to the wonderful sho\u00fcping arcades of the old city.",
          "It's a very impressive clock tower, and definitely worth a look if you are visiting Bern. It is also nice to see the architecture of the surrounding buildings.",
          "Kind of like a market place but very artistic and nice.also a must see in Bern and it is very easy to go there.",
          "The clock tower was great. We arrived in Bern in a Thursday morning and found the clock tower as we walked around exploring the city. When we got back to the hotel at night we were informed that they do offer very small group tours of the inside of the clock. My hotel arranged",
          "I was walking by the tower without even knowing it was there, but as I got close I noticed a big crows watching it, and it was about 14:57 (on a Sunday), so I decided to wait until three. Unfortunately there wasn't really a show at the hour, one of the statues rotated some rod",
          "It's a nice clock if you have time. Best to have watch 11am or 12pm. The golden statue will hit a longer time according the time.",
          "The clock is beautiful and medieval, set awkwardly in the Bern Old Town which I found quite modernized in spite of the cobblestone ground. The clock looked well maintained and shiny. We did not have a lot of time to linger as we were rushing through the Old Town before setting",
          "We did the 2pm official Bern tour of the clock tower in late September. The clockwork was absolutely amazing. My husband is an engineer and really appreciated seeing how a complex (and very old) piece of machinery worked. We were the only English speakers on the tour so the tour",
          "If you are nearby, it is worth walking a few extra steps to see this famous tower and clock which is very close to the apartment where Einstein lived.",
          "This is in the Medieval part of Bern, the Capital of Switzerland. You must hit the clock when it chimes as there is a show, with movement. This is on a cobblestone street with fountains in the middle of the street. There are shops under the arcade so it is a perfect place to",
          "It's not the Glockenspiel but it is a great looking clock, when it plays (~4 minutes before the hour) it lasts ~20 seconds so be ready. The clock tower is closed other than for organised guided tours. Still from the outside it is worth s visit.",
          "This clock looks amazing. We've walked past it four times and each time my wife said \"we have to come back when it rings\". We arrived at 10 to the hour and crowds of tourists we're looking up. At 2.5 minutes to the hour the bears spin round at the bottom right and a jester rings",
          "At a few minutes before each hour, the clocke does a little show. It is a fun little thing if you happen to be in the neighborhood, but I would not go out of my way to to find it otherwise. It is a marvel to think that this thing still works after all of these years. Charming.",
          "The beauty and complexity of the clock face and animated figures surrounding the clock face are amazing. On the hour, the figurines move but move so very little its not worth waiting a long time to see. Inside the arch underneath the clock tower, on the inner wall of the arch's",
          "Take an hour to see the \u201eZytglogge\u201c (Clock Tower) in the main street oft he old town. See at each full hour the puppets moving. Also you can view the old clockwork from inside, too. The clock was built in the 16th-century. The tour takes approx. 50 min.",
          "Most people look at this building from the outside but it is definitely worth getting inside to see the 500 year old mechanism and to climb to the top to look out across the roof tops. some of the climb is steep it you want to get to the very top. Tickets are booked at tourist",
          "It's a beautiful clock tower to check out and see. Very ornate and intricate. Worth a few minutes of your time to stop and see while touring the old town and on the way to the bear park.",
          "This clock is located in the center of the Old Town section, and is neat to watch. The mechanism has many moving parts that can be viewed when the chime strikes on the hour, and always attracts a crowd.",
          "This clock is very beautiful. It was built in the 15th century, and when gazing upon its hands, it is great to imagine all of the millions of people over the centuries who have looked to this clock to tell them time, one of them being the great Einstein, who lived right down the",
          "The Clock Tower (Zytglogge) in Bern is very interesting to see from the outside. One should plan to be there a few minutes before the hour to see the 'theatrics'. However one should temper expectations given that this is a clock that is a few centuries old. However, it is",
          "A striking landmark in the heart of the Old Town, the Clock Tower is fascinating. The visible mechanism of the clock combined with the decorative characters and paintings on the wall make this an iconic site. Time your visit to be on the hour!",
          "Walking through the clock tower was a very unique experience. The street on which it was on was very unique too with attached buildings and cobbled streets",
          "Bern's medieval clock tower Zytglogge is one of many architectural features that gives the old town so mush character. The clock tower has two faces, and while not as impressive as the Prague Astronomical Clock, it's worth a look as you're strolling by.",
          "Fascinating clock tower, we will return to tower just to see clock do it's thing on the hour. Part of audio guided tour of old city of Bern.",
          "The Clock Tower offers a great opportunity for a short video. It's mechanism is not as elaborate as other old clocks such as Munich's. It is, however, worth the photo op. Be at the clock four minutes before the hour to appreciate all that it does.",
          "Actually I love this place.Its basically a gate for old town.Kids love to see how metal man doing this in each hour.",
          "If you are in downtown Bern at 12:00 noon swing by and join the crowd waiting for the animated clock to go into action. Similar to other European clocks (e.g.,Munich), it starts with the anticipation and then teases you with some introductory activities before it settles down to",
          "Tour guide was easy to listen to and communicated well. Enough time to look at views and machinery as well as listen to the explanations. Good views of the city and fascinating to see the machinery at work while the clock struck the hour.",
          "On a company event we had the opportunity to have a guided clock tower tour. It was very interesting and there were many aspects I didn't know before. The technic from 1530 is amazing and it is fantastic to see what people at that time could build with simple technics.",
          "This is one of those clocks that you only see in Europe It not tells time but also the zodiac of the month If you get there before the hour you can watch the various automatics work It's charming",
          "It is one of the highlight of the city. You meet it right at the entrance of the old town at the beginning of the old main street.ot contains a wonderful carillon system performing movements at every hour clocking.",
          "The Clock Tower is simply a very old Building, used to be the Gate to the then walled City of Berne. Tourists love the play when the clock strikes and start to crowd in front of the tower a few minutes before the clock strikes the full hour.",
          "Unfortunately we didn't make it in time for the clock to strike on the hour but still there was plenty to marvel at. It is worth consulting a tour guide or read up on how exactly the clock works.",
          "It isn't quite like the clock tower in Prague however it was very simple and and beautiful. I really liked the design of it and how central it was to the rest of the city. It was nice that it was large however not unlike the other architecture in the city. Nice place and easy to",
          "While we visited many castles & historic buildings in Bern, this one stands out as a favorite. Next time we travel there, I'd like to do it in the summertime instead of the dead of winter. Although, I have to say the snow sparkling on the trees etched an indelible memory that",
          "We loved the clock tower. The wait for the clock to strike 4 was fun too. We could see people gathering around to see it in action.",
          "THE symbol of Bern. The first actions of the clock figures start yet before the full hour. Best place to watch is at the Eastern side (opposite side of main station).",
          "While Zytglogge tower and clock are beautiful on the outside, I highly recommend taking a guided tour to see and learn about its inner workings. You'll learn about the clock and some of its less visible features (dancing figures, etc.) and appreciate the craftsmanship behind it.",
          "At noon every day the clock tower has a display lasting for several minutes. If you are there arrive fifteen minutes early as there are large crowds at noon. You look up and can watch a wooden figure striking a bell at noon. A telephoto lens helps you remember this show.",

          "This is probably Bern's most famous landmark. Built in 1530, it is probably the oldest clock in Switzerland. Several centuires ago, this served as the first Western gate of the city. Revolving figures turn every four minutes before the hour",
          "I think every city I had visited in Switzerland had a clock tower and this one we are talking about is located at the centre of the city in bern, easy accessibility since it was just near the tram station, the clock seemed to be ancient and had a rich ancient look but just that",
          "One of the more iconic sights of Bern, it provides a cute show of moving parts on the hour. It's easy to get to by tram, only a couple of stops from the main station. There is a myriad of restaurants and other shops nearby.",
          "The clock tower in the center of the city is one of the better known attractions to see in the center of town. It is located very centrally - so you will definitely walk by if strolling in the town center. We happened to cross it exactly at 11:55 - so a crowd and joined. 4",
          "This is an attraction that you really cat miss but try and get there at the top of the hour or it won't be worth it .Mcdonalds right across the street",
          "I watched the 'show' at Zytglogge myself once to see what all the tourists are always waiting for so eagerly and just let me tell you; its a pretty and historic tower thats for sure but dont expect to see a big show there at the given times cause there are sime figures moving",
          "After reading all the reviews about this clock tower. We had to see it. And there we were waiting 10 to12 for the clocks to ring. And they did!!! But it was quite a disappointment. Our expectations were too high. The tower is beautyfull but there is no spectacle.",
          "we arrived there 4 min before the clock start to work . it was imperesing to see how in old time people were interested for time and astrology",
          "Got here around noon on a Monday with about two hundred other people, smart cameras waiting for that perfect social media moment and for the clock to go ding dong. It did. Couple of cute things happened on the clock itself, which may be an amazing feat of engineering for all I",
          "This is a great big clock tower that you can walk under. It serves as a good way to keep track of time while shopping in Bern.",
          "The clock at the clock tower gives a very impressive show at noon. Different parts of this perform a show at noon that lasts several minutes. Bring your camera, especially if you have a zoom lens. Bern is a world heritage site as it has preserved the old world feel.",
          "Don't get me wrong... I love the Clock Tower structure. In fact it's absolutely beautiful and is one of Bern's most recognizable landmarks. But I was a little disappointed with the \"show\" by the Clock's characters 3 minutes before every hour. I truly expect more than just the",
          "This is a very intricate but clever clock with almost everything time related on just a couple of faces, including astronomical and calendar information. It took quite a while to work out what all the information was telling us. Definitely in need of some photos for a city",
          "RIght on the main drag of town. We were just walking up the street when it was time. So interesting to see these relics of a different day.",
          "It is a mechanical watch. It belongs to 600 years before. In the city of watches. Still working. Old one on old town, country of watchmaking, don't miss it . Don't compare it to other clocks, perhaps they are more beautiful, but this one is unique.",
          "A beautiful colourful Clock Tower which has become an iconic landmark of the city. The mechanical figurines and the \"man\" striking the bell at the top of the tower, \"perform\" on the hour. It is over so quickly that I found it an anti-climax after standing and waiting to see what",
          "I joined one of the daily tours at 14:30. It was exciting to see that the 500 year-old mechanical clock still work. Amazing mechanism!!",
          "Honestly I thought it would have more emotion when I went there to visit. I waited for hours in order to see the mechanics working. It was not spectacular, but it is worth going there to be an obligatory place of passage.",
          "Well presented very colourful and different time of the day some demonstration going on here. It is within walking distance of Einstein house. No chance to miss this iconic clock tower, free to watch but not free to entrance into the tower.",
          "The clock is beautiful and in a lovely area of town but we waited to see it striking and were somewhat disappointed, luckily we had only waited a few minutes!!",
          "How this is advertised as something to wait and see is beyond me BUT that being said the plaza and surrounding old town are all worth the visit so go anyway. I ran to the clock, like an idiot, to see the action at 6:00 .... Drum roll .... Fail. Seriously it is a gorgeous clock",
          "Its marvellous beautiful and its must visit in Bern. Its big imposing and Swiss beauty adds glamour to it.",
          "If you've ever visited other clock squares in Europe, this one is a disappointment. Sorry, but that is the truth, in my opinion. Shopping is great around here, though.",
          "I have visited clock tower. Surroundings are so good. Love the streets. Also near to main station...",
          "The street and the clock tower together are really the first picture and the representation of Bern.",
          "For a clock making country, it is normal. The similar clock in Prague is more better. Maybe they like this simple style.",
          "While I don't think the clock itself is worth going out of your way to see - unless you're very into horology. But if you're Bern, you'll most likely anyways be visiting the old town, so it's worth a couple of minutes. Please give this review a thumbs up.",
          "Fantastic, when the clock is going to ring!!! Bears, Rooster and .... dancing and make a fun for everybody, specially for children. But you should be a little patient to clock adjust in proper time.",
          "The clock is beautiful but not bother waiting for it to strike on the hour .. the 'show' is pathetic. we stood around for like 30 mins.. and the 1 min 'show' was below pathetic.",
          "The clock is beautiful and a focal point of the city.... It's amazing to watch it when it hits an hour the larger the number the more time to see . We saw it at 4:00 pm!! Remember Einstein used to watch this on his way to his apartment ...",
          "I was looking forward to seeing this clock chime at 12 pm last Sunday. Having been to the glockenspiel in Munich I was expecting an interesting display of multiple moving parts, but noon came and the clock didn't perform that much. The rooster crowed. Father time turned his sand",
          "This is one of the MOST amazing Clocks that I have seen. Try to be there on THE HOUR . that is 1pm or 2pm or 3pm or the exact hour. You will be treated to an amazing display of Sound and characters f",
          "Impressive, large, iconic clock tower close to the train station, walkable. Please obtain a map of the major Bern attractions from the tourism office at the station, which can be a lot of help, specially if you are pressed for time and want to make the most of your stay at Bern.",
          "Like so many things, how can you really rate a medieval masterpiece? Join the crowds at midday and enjoy! It's a great spectacle.",
          "I think the best time to see this clock is at midday as it makes lots of movements then. Do not miss it whilst walking around the old town.",
          "A must see in Bern. Take time to watch it on the hour. We did not go inside, but you can take a tour of the clock.",
          "It's an attractive looking clock, but I'm not sure it lives up to the hype. We visited at 12 o clock and at 5 o clock in the afternoon on a Sunday and were underwhelmed. It just seemed to chime the hour much like any other clock. There were plenty of tourists there waiting for",
          "The clock is beautiful but I must have sight problems because I didn't notice anything special happening when the hour changed. There was a bunch of people waiting for it to happen and I think I just could spot a wooden person moving outside of a hole on the top of the clock. Is",
          "Right at the square and very nice to just set down for a cup of coffee for a look. This site can be on your way to see other sites if you plan you travels.",
          "This clock tower can only be visited by guided tour and it's well worth booking to get on one. The history of the town, the tower and clock are explained. The mechanics of the automata is demonstrated and a view over Bern is well worth the climb.",
          "One of the marvels of Old Bern is a 13th century Clock Tower known as \"The Zytglogge\". This medieval structure that was once a guard tower is famous for what it does when the hour changes. The later you can be there to see the hour change the more things you'll see the various",
          "Very intricate workings. A must see at the top of the hour while visiting. Has many moving parts like a rooster, jester and much more.",
          "We gathered at the base of the clock tower several times to see the chiming. Every 15 minutes, the bears would go around and every hour, the huge bell would ring. There is a guided tour at 2:30pm where they take you inside the tower. There was a tiny notice at the bottom of the",
          "It is wonderful clock where you see the heritage of the town ,the clock has action and color that not in any clock tower , I really recommend this city for family .",
          "If you visit Bern for more than 10 minutes you will see the clock tower. I'm sure it is one of the most photographed landmarks in Bern. Try to be there on the hour.",
          "Along the main street heading towards the center of town you will come to the Clock Tower. Well preserved, the tower's various characters help ring in the hour. Well worth timing your stop to coincide with this hourly ritual that starts about 10 minutes prior to the hour.",
          "There are other more beautiful or speactacular clock or clock towers in Europe, but this one is unique for its long history. It would be more interesting if you can arrnage an insider's view to vist the tower interior and see the clock up close.",
          "We arrived just before 2 PM. Heard the bells on the hour. Beautiful clock with unique hands. Look forward to returning for the mid day animation.",
          "Most tourists come around stop a few minutes, make a picture and carry on. Others wait for 12 o clock and then they can see the man at the top, banging on the bell 12 times. But do they really know the clock tower? Probably they are not interested, what in my opinion is a waste",
          "An old astronomical clock but nothing that special. Sure its interesting to have a look but other than that....not much. Some ppl wait minutes to hear the drum or the rooster but its literally a 10 sec thing... Have been also inside but apart of an explanation of the working",
          "Well this is a MUST SEE - a piece of Bern History - please wait until the clock ring - Amazing attraction",
          "It is always stunning to see the clock of the Clock Tower (Zytglogge) in operation. You should make sure to go there when the clock has more strokes, i.e. at 10, 11 or 12 o'clock. At 1 or 2 o'clock, there is considerably less action (works as designed (many hundred years ago)).",
          "We visited the place during our walk through the old town. We liked very much the entire area and we saw the Clock Tower as one of its elements rather than an individual tourist attractions.",
          "Loved watching the clock chine out its hour with movements from the statues within. Only lasts a few minutes but lovely to see.",
          "The view of the clock tower in Bern is a spectacular centre piece to the city. The architecture is beautiful and the view of the river from the tower is wonderful. Parking is a bit of a pain, but once you settle in the city, it's a wonderful experience.",
          "If you are in Bern and wandering around old town I don't think you will miss the clock tower. It's quite impressive and central to the area. There are loads of people around - even at night so you may need to be patient to get a good picture.",
          "If you take the Old Town walking tour you will pass through the Clock Tower. Impressive on the outside with three different clocks however, still just a clock. Didn't see any information on tours of the tower however, going up the tower would add to the experience.",
          "Old town clock tower. With Main Street passing under the tower. It's an iconic symbol. Unfortunately you can't go up without tour reservations. Nice to look at with its astronomical clock And bears dancing around",
          "Nice monument for history/architecture lovers. Is worth a passing there and is not taking too much time.",
          "This is quite an iconic sight and worth a detour in the old town. You can wander around and see some very unique heritage architecture that all complements - bundestag, munster, street buildings.",
          "my friend arranged a tour of the clock tower. It was awesome! Tour guide was very nice, knowledgable and patient.",
          "Over the years living in the DC area I visited this clock tower many times and was disappointed when it was under renovations, but hopefully when those are finished it will be available for the public to once again enjoy",
          "The clock is quite beautiful. Just wait for the rings of the clock, there are some characters moving and dancing!",
          "All this stories sounds like this must be one of the best attractions in Bern, sadly I was a little dissappointed. At least for me it was not so much interesting to see all that stuffs moveing arround...",
          "It's just a clock in the middle of the street with shops surrounding that area. Just pass by to have a picture and read it's story.",
          "This was one of the attractions stated in trip advisor for the City of Bern. It was very easy to find this clock tower since our hotel was nearby. And there is always a bunch of people standing right in front of this tower. It nothing spectacular really except that you'l see the",
          "The Zytglogge has about 600 years old and it stands, for me, as the most beautiful animated watch in Europe, even better than the Prague one. You have 24 opportunities a day to see it work! It function in a beautiful tower in old town.",
          "We loved the clock tower, it was cold but we still watch the clock to turn. Many people waited with us to take photo. We loved also the Christmas decorations.",
          "One of the most beautiful clock in Switzerland. It's located in the middle of the town. Very easy to reach with the bus or tram or by walk.",
          "I think many go there as it is recommended in tourist guides. Often see a lot of people under the clock looking at it waiting for something to happen. Nothing special about this except its historical significance.",
          "Easily found,on the entrance of the old city of Bern,you can't miss it.Very well kept,like the old city itself:)",
          "The place to be! The Clock Tower in the middle of the old town in Bern is one of the most famous sights in this city. Every hour puppets dance on the tower and everybody takes picters of that. While standing there you might smell something - and that is the way more interesting",
          "I get that this is an old clock you should see. It will take you about 1 minute to see it, take a picture, and be on your way. Why not stop by if you rip old town Bern?",
          "I stood there and watched this because like a lemming everyone else was, I was not even the least bit thrilled by this, the little critters at the bottom move, and I think it only completely spins at 12 3 6 9... the other times on the hour I only seen it move one little guy.",
          "It's nice place to walk around the clock tower but be careful since there are not traffic lights but bus and train are frequently pass by",
          "Waited for the \"magical\" hourly display. Was disappointed to see a couple of small moving figures and then it was over.",
          "Bern's most famous attraction. It is charming and I recomend it, especially if you see the performance on the hour. Use your imagination and allow yourself to be a child.",
          "This is absolutely beautiful in fact the whole of Bern is. This master piece is a work of ark and is well worth a little visit.",
          "This was a built up thing to do, so reluctantly I went along. It is very neat to see, but you keep waiting for something to happen on the hour.",
          "It is a nice clock but not compared to other great clocks like the one in Prague, but if you are in Bern it is a must",
          "This is probably Bern's most famous attraction. It is charming and probably worth a quick stop, especially if you see the little performance on the hour. If you only stop long enough to snap a quick photo, that might be enough.",
          "This is really worth a quick visit. What a wonderful old clock tower. I'm told that if one can actually see the workings they are old wooden movement pieces? The craftsmanship is really beautifully apparent!",
          "After exit from train station take a left and after a mile you will reach there. Nice view of the tower and good place to click pics. There are small souvenir shops around. This is the marketplace with shops on both the sides.",
          "Nice place with the figures coming out at exact hours..it's better to take a guided tour as you get to know more details",
          "Yes, every town in Switzerland has a watch, but that does not mean they shouldn't be seen and admired. This one for instance is located in the beginning of the most beautiful street in Bern and hour by hour you can see the soldiers moving, which is already quite pretty. We",
          "One of the nice buildings around Bern old town. Busy area where you can walk, shop, eat and visit the major landmarks.",
          "We booked this tour through Bern City Tourism. We did the city walking tour in the morning and after lunch finished off with a tour of the inside of the clock. It was so interesting to see the workings and to actually watch them in motion on the hour. And the perspective from",
          "It is a very nice tower and nice watch, but the stand there waiting to see the figurines it is not impressive as in many others in Europe.",
          "This old glockenspiel clock is a must see if you are walking around Old Town. It goes every hour but you have to be there 4 minutes early as it begins with the rooster crow at that time. Also be patient as many things happen but it is about 30 seconds in between. You know it is",
          "Wait there with camera ready five minutes before the hour and film the entire ceremony of the clock. You will be enchanted of the old swiss Tradition of the Clock - Play.",
          "Just the time you will take to stand there and take a picture. It's a clock. It's something to look at and then continue walking, nothing extraordinary about it to me.",
          "Nice attraction to see in Bern. The tower actually has two clocks, the main one at the top tells the time but there is another underneath. Not sure what this is depicting but in many ways it is similar to the astrological clock in Prague! Easy to find and centrally located",
          "Even if you are not a watch fan, this is an amazing visit! Every day at 14:30 a guided tour of around 45 min shows you one of the oldest watch tower in the world! The view of the city from inside the tower is mesmerizing! Dont miss!!!",
          "It's easy to walk around Bern. With a simple map you will not miss all the highlights of the city. That's a masterpiece and very simple to find. Everybody will look astonished. It's the biggest clock in Switzerland, and probably also the bigger and the more accurate of this",
          "One of the main attractions which you can't really miss as it marks the entrance to the old town. Crowds gather on the hour to see it strike but get there about 7 minutes early to see the figures rotating",
          "Now this is an attraction you would see if you like it or not. After a few photos you move on, however still a great part of history",
          "Bern Is an amazing place to have a walk in the city and one of the most beautiful and well conserved momument that you can see is the Clock Tower dont miss one of the big attractives in the old town in Bern!",
          "In the Heart of Bern. Waited along with loads of tourists to see it in operation but disappointed when it happened at 3 o' clock. Something spined in the bottom right had corner but was expecting more!",
          "Most can easily view the external display of this fine timepiece from medieval times. A crowd gathers on the hour to watch the new hour arrive accompanied by a crowing rooster, a rotating set of figures and a golden bell ringer, 12 noon is especially good to see all of the",
          "The Clock Tower is one of the famous attractions in the old city of Berne, the capital city of Switzerland. Watch the clock playing every full hour!",
          "We take all of our visitors here. The clock is quite beautiful and it is so unusual. There is a guided tour of the tower available, I believe in both English and German, uncertain of the cost. The clock does have winter and summer hours so be attentive to that.",
          "Tziet Glogge, is charming and considering its age, quite a marvel. Particularly when I found out that it wasn't created by a clock maker, but rather military equipment designer. The crowds are large and enthusiastic, so if you want pictures plan on staking out a spot about 15",
          "Make sure you do this in the walking tour (available at info centre by railway station) to find out the history of it otherwise it is just a clock that chimes.",
          "it's in the center of Bern so you can't miss it. it's not the typical looking clock tower like in other cities in Switzerland so it's nice to see",
          "The guide tour costs 15 Euro and was held in two languages, German and English. A bit complicated to understand, but you will find out from inside how the clock from medieval works. And also the view from the top of the tower is stunning!",
          "When you visit the Old Town of Bern, you will not miss this important piece of Swiss history, the Zytglogge (as in German) is one of Bern's most recognizable symbols. It stood at the main intersection of the town. It s also an astronomical clock. I saw it moves a few minutes",
          "The clock is still working on a centuries old technology and it was really a thrilling experience to see the clock functioning.We watched the clock strike 12 and it was a wonderful experience",
          "While visiting the Old Town in Bern, you must visit the Tower Clock that situates in the middle of the town. Apart from showing the time to all, it is also an astrological instrument indicating many information. The clock will sounds 3 minutes to the hour and many visitors",
          "Right on Main St. on Old Town. Try to get there at 12 noon for the show with the inner workings of the clock.All the old clocks in Switzerland all still work! Picture perfect",
          "Well, you were not in the old town if you did not visit this place. Worthy a picture and also a coffee in one of the Caf\u00e9s located in this region.",
          "It's great! Doesn't only show time but also different astrological information (I don't know about). three minutes before the full hour a Rooster comes out to \"warn\" you.",
          "We walked under this tower just before 12 to see a large group of people before us. We turned around to see that it was 12 o'clock and the tower was making it's hourly \"attraction\". The clockwork is original and there are some nice things to see when it chimes.",
          "It is just a clock tower with an astronomical clock. The street that leads from it is much more interesting and picturesque. You shall see many weird statues and fountains on the way and definitely not to miss is Einstein\u2019s House on the right, the one where he derived the theory",
          "Worth looking at, but only really when passing by as the 'display' is a little overrated. It is a pretty sight though and very Swiss. Good for a photo.",
          "If you pay for the tour, you get to see how this magnificent astronomical clock functions from the inside. Well worth the price of admission.",
          "Pretty to look at, but the the \"show\" - when the little figures on the clock move around, which occurs at 5 of the hour - is mobbed and totally overrated.",
          "Maybe I missed the point, but it was just an old looking clock. I barely noticed it the first time. It probably adds to the character of the street, totally missed this one.",
          "The first time you see it, interesting. The second time, and you will be lucky if you are not trampled to death by a hoarde of Asian Tourists who seem not to see you, or, are run over by one of the Buses charging through the narrow opening into Kramgasse. If you have seen one",
          "Regularly going to bern and i always enjoy watching the clock towel when the little show is going on It is Very sweet and cute",
          "If you are really in a hurry you could do this in 1 hour. The clock tower is a few blocks from the main train station. But, once you go out and see it there is so much more than the clock. The Bears are just a short walk away. There are many restaurants and the best is the",
          "Lovely to see - beautiful building but the clock's performance is a let down - don;t wait an hour to see it!",
          "Just incredible to see how it works!!!!! I don't think one realizes what it actually looks like until it starts to work!!!",
          "You cannot miss this clock if you visit Bern as it stands right in the centre of town.It is beautiful and interesting but it's a clock ,dont build your whole trip around it and then be disappointed when it doesn't sing and dance or chime as you want it to.....",
          "We came across this wonderful 600 year old clock on the way down the main shopping street in Bern looking for the bears. (That's correct- 4 bears live happily in this city but are away until autumn). If possible be around the clock tower as it is about to strike the hour,",
          "For all of the tour book recommendations telling you to see the clock tower, it really is underwhelming. The little repertoire 4 minutes before each hour is unimpressive. The clock tower itself doesn't even look so well-preserved, which is too bad if this is one of the top",
          "This is a gorgeous and iconic spot in Bern and so interesting to watch the clockworks. It's an easy spot to get to and from and well worth a visit.",
          "even when it's crowded at every full hour what the play of the different parts of the clock tower do their presentation - its' worth to watch and reflect at the skills of the people who created all this.",
          "The clock includes an astronomical dial and sits at the top of the cobbled \"high street\" leading down through the old town - probably the most photographed monument in Bern",
          "Thanks to our guide, Nora we got a preview of what was going to happen on the clock. It was only 13:00 so we had to look quickly. Glad we saw it.",
          "It's a landmark of Bern. You may need some patience if you want to see the animations. Otherwise a walk down in the main street is a good choice as well.",
          "This is actually called \"Zeitglogge,\" which means \"time clock.\" It is the most recognizable attraction in downtown AltStadt (old city) Bern, Switzerland. While it chimes frequently, you really need to be there on the hour (preferably noon) to see it do its stuff. Several",
          "The clock is very attractive and stands out well over the main shopping street. Can be viewed from all four sides. A great photo-op along a street with no vehicle access (except for the trams) and lots of stores with colourful flags hanging from upper windows.",
          "Our tour guide got us there about 10 minutes early to make sure we were in a prime location. She explained what to look for as the hour grew near. There were about a half dozen actions to be ready for. It was fun.",
          "The title says it all. Do not go out of your way to see it strike the hour. Thousands have said \"that's it?\" Upon seeing the hour struck.",
          "Absolutely a trip back into history. The language barrier was not as much as an issue as I thought it would be.",
          "beautiful and historical also good for taking time to take picture also view it in detailed although getting many tourists sometimes.",
          "The clock is an amazing timepiece that tells more than just the time but also astrology, moon etc. The movements at each hour should be quite an interesting sight especially for kids.",
          "nothing special, just a clock tower, took some picture, lots of tourist there, worth a visit and tell people you were there",
          "I liked the construction and the place is amazing when thinking about all the little details of the clock.",
          "The Clock Tower In Bern Is one of the 2 main towers (the other being the Prison Tower) in the City of Bern. It is a nice sight and the clock on it is very antique with a complex mechanism. Perhaps not as picturesque as the Clock Tower in Prague, this tower is still quite worth",
          "While strolling around the city you can't run into this clock area. It's located in the end of the main avenue, where you can find many restaurants and shops. Personally, I fall in love with that city, right away :)",
          "I agree with many of the reviews that the Clock Tower itself (Zeitglockenturm) doesn't live up to the hype at the strike of the hour. We hurried to the clock to see it strike the hour and to watch the mechanical clock weave its magic but when it moved, we thought there must be"

        "wiki": "A bear pit was historically used to display bears, typically for entertainment and especially bear-baiting. The pit area was normally surrounded by a high fence, above which the spectators would look down on the bears.\nThe most traditional form of maintaining bears in captivity is keeping them in pits, although many zoos replaced these by more elaborate and spacious enclosures that attempt to replicate their natural habitats, for the benefit of the animals and the visitors.\nA noteworthy example is found in Bern, Switzerland. Known as the B\u00e4rengraben, it was built in 1857 and is still in use though much modified.\n\n\n== Other meanings ==\nAnother meaning is for an unusually aggressive political arena, in which direct, heated attacks are common.A bear pit also refers to a type of trap used to deter or trap bears.  It usually consists of a large earthen pit with sharpened pikes in the bottom to impale the bear.  They are most often used to deter bears from approaching a cabin, rather than as a means of actually catching them.\nThe term \"bear pit\" is also used to describe a tournament or sparring format sometimes also referred to as \"king of the hill\". The participants form a queue behind the first two to compete. Once each match is over, the winner remains to face the next opponent in line while the loser goes to the end of the queue. For tournaments, it is usual that the process is continued for a set period of time during which the victor of each match is noted. At the end of the tournament the winner is determined to be the contestant that won the most matches. Multiple bear pits may also be employed, with defeated contestants able to choose which queue to re-enter.\nIn Scotland, the phrase \"Bear pit\" is used to describe bars or public houses that are known to have a violent reputation.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBerenkuil (traffic)\nMenagerie\nZoo\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSheffield Botanical Gardens Bear Pit\nBear parc in Bern",

Still, I feel there is no need to keep them inside the fence and they should be left in the forest.",
          "Nice view of downtown from the top of bears house",
          "Nice area, unfortunately the bears were hibernating when I visited in November.",
          "Just a sight to see and to learn about Switzerland history. \n\nEven brought by a friend a place to go to honestly amazing.",

          "A nice place to start Town walk.A restaurant with restrooms. Garden places to sit.can also buy gift items.The bears seen  in the bear pit relax our minds. Also the flowing river nearby is a great relief to stressed minds.Enjoy the scenic beauty around and the Chill clean air.",
          "I almost didn\u2019t believe there would be bears here but THERE ARE! It was so cool to see them in the pit searching for food under barrels and obstacles. Highly recommend stopping by and observing the 3 bears in Bern.",
          "Its a scenic area, lovely walk along the river. I just cannot understand why Bern still needs to keep bears in the middle of the town. I think this is animal abuse, regardless of how good the enclosure is. Animals should be in their natural habitat",
          "3 stars only because the bears were in hibernation I've visited the bear pit in the summer total different atmosphere the bears were out in there enclosure and rolling around 5 ***** although it does get very busy in the summer months but we'll worth a visit",

          "Good place to have a pint of beer or two",

          "It's interesting to see the bear in a nice out door environment. The idea is brilliant... You no longer need to look through a fence and see them loked up in a cage.\n\nToo bad you can't feed it.",
          "I like to see the view from this place. The houses...the river....the air...was nice",
          "Really cool and different concept of a beer park without cages..  Was amazing to see beers do their own thing at a distance",
          "No bears around anywhere .. disappointed",
          "Excellent bear pit existing from the middle age where lives the bear family. They can move freely and they have access to the river, trees and bushes. So, they are living almost in natural conditions. This is \"the must see place at Burn\". Children will be especially pleased!",
          "Despite some trepidation about bears being kept in captivity, we were pleasantly surprised by the very large enclosure with a mix if habitats alongside the river where the three bears live. We visited twice and were lucky to see all three \u2026",
          "Very interesting. Loved watching the bears.",

          "I had a rare mix of feelings at this place.\n\nFirst, you see the beautiful roofs of the city and the river surrounded by green areas, I never thought bears were this big and such an amazing animals! You are able to see them really close. \u2026",
          "Decent sized naturalized habitat for three beautiful bears. They can hide in bush and shade, swim in the river and lay in the sun as they like.",
          "Bears seem in good health and are key active by regular hiding of berries, nuts, etc. Still strange watching people watching bears but worth a visit",
          "Lucky to visit this place \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c",
          "Got a chance to see 3 bears here. We dropped our camera lens cover here and waited until the bears went out for lunch and then security gave us the cover  :) Good chance to see the bears here",
          "Really well done. Wasn't sure if seeing captive bears would be a good idea, but I think it's well organised.",
          "There be bears! The bear is the symbol of the city of Bern, and so they have decided to adopt a couple of brown bears. They built the bear pit by the river, it is a very large enclosure where the happy couple, and now their young daughter, \u2026",
          "One of the best places in Bern to get a nice view I'd the old city and river.  Bears roam around the pit and are a nice sight for people who are not used to seeing that type of wildlife. Brewerey with tasty beer and good food near by.",
          "I have a childhood memory (age 5) of the bear pit in Bern. It was small and had a large number of bears. Since then (58 years elapsed) the bears have been moved to a spacious set of terraces along the banks of the river. They are harder to \u2026",
          "Nice place to do some bear watching. Nice view into town, too. A little restaurant to relax and a vivarium nearby.",
          "A great place, but mostly because it has gorgeous views of Bern. If you walk to the bottomof the pit you can sit next to the bright blue River and dip your feet in while enjoying a view of Bern. The bears are nice but sometimes hard to see, \u2026",
          "Visited the Barenpark in July 2019 and it was an incredible experience. The bears are absolutely gorgeous and it was so wonderful to see them up close. I fell in love with them straight away. \n\nYou can reach the Barenpark by taking bus 12 \u2026",

          "A cute attraction where you can see bears being bears! We got to see them walking around the woods and two bears even took a swim!\n\nA fun place to test your luck at bear spotting.",
          "The Bear Pit is just one of those places in Bern that you have to visit! Hopefully you will have the chance to see the bears!",
          "Scenic place, but saw no bears. They should really state the hibernation period for the beers for visitors. The visit was underwhelming.",
          "Brilliant natural atmosphere, a must for people visiting Bern. Take a lift (at the far end of the bear pit)down to the Aare river and do dip your legs in the river. It's a refreshing experience. A family of 3 bears gives you a thrill \nwhen you look down on the now extended bear pit. A must do when you visit Bern.",
          "Bear was hibernating...too cold I guess. Beautiful old buildings. Nice place",
          "Nice place for bear watching. You can use the elevator to go down and sit by the river as well, quite relaxing",

          "This is a classic spot for tourists, dont worry the bears are not confined to a pit anymore they have a nice area to play around in by the river Aare! And the old tram depot now houses a micro brewery and resteraunt which is great for a \u2026",

          "We saw one brown bear in the woods. Kids loved watching him wander in the woods. You come across a rose garden and can enjoy spectacular views around there. If too hot soak in the water stream running along there.",
          "Love that place! Amazing view with the beautiful river and also the historical old town. There are a few big and small bridges, and of course the bear park with the amazing bears!",
          "A very cool place to visit, you also get a nice view of the river and some of the city.",
          "Beautiful park for 3 bears called Bj\u00f6rk, Ursina & Finn. Large space next to the river. Unfortunately we only saw one of them. We had free entrance. The bears have a large space to take a bath. The bear is the symbol of the city Bern",
          "I mean it's a pit, which in the winter has no bears as they are sleeping. There is a 360\u00b0 view around the top of it. There is another enclosure close to it where the bears can also go.",
          "Great place to relax after a long day at Bern. There's a nice path to take a leisurely stroll or if you prefer, a cool spot to dip your tired feet in the Aare river. Oh, and you might spot a family of 3 bears walking around if the day's not too hot.",
          "3rd time visiting Bern and it was a dry day, last two visits It was \u2614 .....saw 3 of the bears out enjoying the sun.  Glad they have a good space and pool in the enclosure. Although \nI still feel wild animals should be free in their natural habitat.",
          "Nice place and you can see real bears walking through the trees. This place also have beautiful river along with:)",
          "Best views of Bern. Best brewery in Europe just nearby  - Altes Tramdepot. Bathing opportunities also right here and across the river - when it s warm enough, of course. There s a lift to go from the riverbed to ghe resraurant ground, but it only works till 17.00 or so",
          "Pleasantly surprised bears had more space to roam around than first thought.  They let them out of the central pit.",
          "A wonderful experience I must say. Seeing  nature so beautiful.",
          "The best bear pit in Switzerland.  I wouldn't go out of your way to just visit the bears, but if you're in the area it's worth walking around the enclosure and saying hi to the family of bears.",
          "The bears are so nice \u2764\ufe0f \nIt is a very good place to visit together with kids or just with other adults :)) Very nice the story with all the names written on the stones - all are the names of the persons which contributed financially to the bear park",

          "The best location I have ever been to \u2764\u2764\u2764",
          "well maintained and good for spending time with family. \n\nFrom downtown, just walk 10-15 minutes and cross the bridge. Bear pitt is on the right.  Dont miss the spectacular views of Bern city housing from the bridge\n\nThere is a coffee shop inside the bear pit complex and children can enjoy ice cream",

          "Only place, where one can see gaint bears (\ud83d\udc3b) right in the heart of city, without going to zoo. Loved the way authorities have made it without restricting their space. There is a beautiful river flowing by where these bears can be seen playing in summers.",
          "Wonderfull memories of Bern and Rolf Hadorn",

          "Nice place and view you can see bear moving freely  in Bern",

There is one bear there, that's what I saw, and it looked restless and without enough space. I would say it had more space than other enclosures, hence the 3*, but still...",
          "Although there are only three bears, they seem to be well taken care of, with freedom space. The bear pit area has natural river beauty. For tourists, it is one of the rare tour sites in Switzerland which offer extremely clean and fee-free toilets. It also has escalator for visitors to be around the river.",
          "Can't see any bear",
          "If you walk from the main train station it will take you about 20 minutes to arrive to this bear pit (It is guaranteed to be a nice walk because you will walk through the center of the town). You may already see tne bears from the nearby \u2026",

          "If I could give this a zero rating I would.  It's disgusting to see animals in captivity. The area where the bears are kept is so small. This is not a tourist attraction, it's a shameful example on how backward some nations are on animal welfare.",

          "Loved the bears ....",
          "Sure, you can see some bears exist but they really aren't that happy there. It's a shame really but fortunately it's free so at least the city isn't financially benefiting from this mistreatment. Check the photos, this is literally all there is to see, because this is all that they can do.",

          "Attractive tourist place",
          "BEARS!!! Although it says Bear Pit the city actually has a pretty swank set up for the bears. They have a separate huge space that connects with the pit where they can roam around. If you are going to Bern, you gotta see the bears. Because. \u2026",

          "Absolutely beautiful.",
          "5 stars only for the enclosure and on-site historic information, as during winter all 3 bears are in hibernation.\nShould be great to visit during summer ;)\n(and if you make it here, you should also climb a little more on the hill, to visit the small Bern Zoo).",
          "Bar park is very good",
          "A good place to park and start your tour of Berne on foot or by bus. The bears look a bit miserable, but have more room than in the European zoos, where they were born.",
          "You smell the bears, before you see them....",
          "Today's weather was cloudy and not too warm, and while I prefer sunny weather, it seems to be ideal for the bears! They were unusually active and provided great entertainment for the entire time I visited. If you're in the area and the \u2026",

          "No bear in pit,nearby lake was beautiful",
          "It was quite nice place to stay during my visit of Bern. There is woman only shower or a kitchen you can use. One bad thing that it is nearby the famouse old clock so maybe it can bother you a bit in night.",

          "Much better than the old Bear Pit.",
          "Historic and touristic place. The bear are oftenly not present during winter. They are probably hibernating during this period. It is worth to have a walk around there only for the scenery on the river. Local people are getting near from there to get some sun during the winter as well.",
          "Animals in captivity never make me happy",
          "It isn't exactly a pit or a confined space. It is more like a compound with even an opening on the river",

          "Nice place",
          "Beautiful place to visit",
          "The Berner bears. As a Canadian I think the bears are not shown in the best light. But they are are adorable bears who put a smile on your face.  It is good that the bears have been given more spacious accommodation but it still pulls at your heart to see their past treatment.",

They have such a lovely, proper outdoor area to be in, why do they need to be in the \u2018medieval\u2019 bear pits?? We did ask, and were told, that they were only there for 1/2 an hour...

          "The bear is a symbol for Bern so it was great to see a lovely open enclosure for the 3 brown bears. You can watch them from the area above and so not disturb them. They were walking beside the river area, resting under the trees , playing etc. It was great to see them so",
          "The bears got upgraded facilities a few years ago. They now have a great view, a bath and most importantly more space. The kids loved to see them. You get there by just following the main street (Marktgasse, later turns Kramgasse) and cross the Nydegg Bridge. In warm weather you",

          "What a lovely attraction and centrally placed. We saw the bears being allowed through to the feeding area on 2 occasions. The behaviour of the male bear knocking in the access door was rather worrying at first but he clearly knows when feeding time is. Often the bears disappear",
          "We went to Bern to see the old streets , was surprised to find the Bears . We first saw the old bear pits and felt that were a stark reminder of how they treated the Bears . It was a surprise to see the new enclosure which included different levels trees and a section of the",
          "Well, a bit frustrating going there and not seeing the bears, but I suppose we can't expect them to be always out and about.",
          "As you may read from the guide, Bears are symbols of the city and were kept in the pit from the 16th century or something. Since the city life and wild animals do not come together, in 2009 they were relocated to the place near the bridge in a special \"park\" which is more like a",
          "Since they upgraded from the old bear pit to this new enclosure, not much can be said a part of the fact that it is impressive and touching to see how much bernese people are attached to have the animals of their flag in their city !",
          "I was expecting a proper park where you could walk around and see the bears. What this really is is a bear enclosure next to the river where you can see three bears from afar if you're lucky. If you want to see bears, go to a zoo.",
          "Yes, bears are the city mascot and it\u2019s interesting to be able to see a few (3 I think) lumbering around a city park doing bear things. In a way it\u2019s kind of cool but I also question the limited amount of space these wild creatures have and whether it\u2019s right to confine them for",
          "The kids enjoyed watching the bears roaming around. It was a nice walk down to the river with picturesque views of the old town. We had a lovely dinner at the restaurant beside the park.",
          "I saw some bears. They are looked like happy bears. The bears have a great view of the city from their habitat, which must make them extra happy.",
          "This is a vast improvement on the old Barenpit where the bears were housed at least here they can stretch their legs, more for the bears than the visitor.",
          "We had a great time at bear park. We Spotted two bears , who were having a good time in the park. River flows in front of the bear park which makes it more beautiful and natural in surroundings .",
          "View the three bears in captivity in what we understand cost some $25 m after estimates of only $5m when construction commenced.Has lift from cafeteria/bar/restaurant down to waterfront which is calming/spectacular.Also vantage points from adjoining bridge offer great views .",
          "The bears are a gift to the city and the river is a beautiful teal which is a great place to put your feet. It's an amazing sight and a great tap house.",
          "The park is famous for the bears... River goes through the park and you can watch 3 bears... Sight of river from top is beautiful.",
          "We enjoyed the walk through town to see the bears. The bear park is well organized with displays and placards, and the bears were quite active when we were there! It is a memorable part of our visit this Bern.",
          "Enjoying the fairy tale vibe of this city and what do we find...Bears, of course! Loved it, we saw beautiful bears, just wanted to check them out for a few min. but its hard not to just watch and watch and watch. They are magnificent! The park is wonderful and fun, you should",
          "We were fortunate the bears were out when we visited. After walking away to the Rose garden and came back, the bears had been let out to their \"pasture\" down by the river.",
          "We looked high and then we looked low but couldn\u2019t find any bears. There are large bushes for them to get out of the sun and the public eye. It was the middle of the day and rather hot, so they may have been sleeping. Wish I had been.",
          "Its a nice walk down through he 'Old Town' of Bern to the Bear Park. The Bear park itself is an excellent facility for the care of the cities bears. On the day we visited it was warm and sunny so the three bears we saw were out and about in the pens and seemed to be very well",
          "Had to go see the bears while in Bern and thought it was fun for about 5 minutes. Ended up watching them for about 30 minutes because of my wife. During the entire time one bear laid down in the grass and two others paced back and forth. I\u2019m not sure what I expected but it was",
          "The park is a fantastic piece of open space, that combines Bern\u2019s tradition of bears with the public open space of the city, through this beautiful green park that runs parallel to the river, and opens up to a linear stepped bank. The natural topography of the land creates two",
          "It's a beautiful location by the river. You can get a clear view from above, below and from the bridge. The bears looked happy and the park was very natural. The old bear put it still on display, the contrast is interesting. Worth a visit.",
          "The Bear Pits are an interesting stop. Since 1513 bears have been at home in Bern. The spacious bear park is worth the walk. The history of bears with Bern, makes this a special place.",
          "It was so unusual to see life bears in the city and they living on they own and they looking happy , and it was in the downtown! great place to come with kids. actually bear is an ancient symbol of the City",
          "OMG a bear pit! In the centre of a city!!!! One not too miss. Once you're there enjoy the fantastic views across the aare and over the city from the top terrace. Then take the stairs or lift down the bank to watch the bears frolicking in the water. Fantastic.",
          "The bear place is a cute place to watch bears in Bern city !. Never seen anything like this before. Its also a great place to take a walk around the river.",
          "When I was here in 1979, I thought there was something wrong about the bear pits. It didn't look like the bears belonged here. It wasn't natural. The current bear park is a huge upgrade. The bears have a LOT of room to roam and play and act like bears. If you're in Bern,",
          "The bears have a large very natural habitat along the Aare river. We saw bears on the top of the habitat and then took funicular down to river where we saw the, in the lower habitat. Great for kids",
          "This barenpark is a place you should visit if you visiting Bern. However winter/autumn isn't a good time as the bears were in hibernation. I went in january and it was a bit disapointing.",
          "Seemed like the saddest bears around. Especially in the pit. Couldn't find any others in the larger enclosure.",
          "Bern is supposed to have been named after the bears (one of the versions of the origin of its name). So a bear is the mascot of the city. I think it is really a good idea to actually keep bears in the city to show this connection. I would not approve if the animals were in a",
          "If you visit the City of Bern, you must go see the bears at the bear park, which is across the river from the old city. It is easy walking or take the #12 bus. The habitat is large, so you have to be patient to see the bears. A good photo-op.",
          "Three bears in the keep, and there is no entrance fee. Bring your zoom lens if you want to capture really good pictures of the bears.",
          "Intrigued by this, I learned a bit more. The Bear has been a symbol of the city of Bern for a long time. In the 12th century, a Duke went hunting in a nearby forest and decided to name his new city after the first animal he met on his hunting expedition. The party came across a",
          "Fun place to visit and watch the bears. They were moving around quite a bit compared to most zoos. They were fun to watch and you are close enough to get great pictures.",
          "The bears have a large area, they are in the bear pit in the morning and go to the area near the river in the afternoon. If you compare the size of this of this 'cage' compared to the ones I have often seen in zoos, this is the biggest living area for bears I have seen. The",
          "This is my city and i never get tired of coming here. You have a great view of the aare and just beside it is a restaurant where you can enjoy the view. Parking is around the corner. Not free though. But once you grab a beer in tramdepot walk down near the water and just enjoy",
          "This is a small park, in my opinion. Worth a quick visit just for a walk and to look at the bears. Nice view to the river.",
          "This park is situated in the D\u00e4hlh\u00f6lzli Tierpark and in a nice looking,well maintained habitat for bears. We saw two of the bears during our visit. It was spectacular to observe them from behind a glass wall in their pool while they were swimming and playing together. A must see",
          "I went to the Barenpark during a visit to Bern, when we first arrived the bears were in the small enclosure being fed. When I returned they were in the larger enclosure, there are three bears. The bears are only out between April and October, otherwise they remain in their den.",
          "My husband loves bears, we were very excited to visit and were not disappointed. A lovely spot to watch the bears roam around, eat and swim! The bears seem happy and have a nice amount of room to move around compared to most zoo enclosures. You can view the bears from the top,",
          "This is the symbol of Bern and is obviously worth a visit. See the bears as close up as you would want to.",
          "After seeing old Bern, with beautiful facades of buildings, nice wells and towers, and cross the bridge with an amazing view, what else can you wish but seeing some really bears playing. They have a nice landscape near the river, with shelters where they can hide, but there are",
          "Two beautiful bears in the center of Bern. The attraction is very followed. You can see bears from many locations",
          "This is where the city gets its name, fabulous pens with the bears enjoying their days wandering in their enclosures close to the river. well worth a visit.",
          "really nice: one can enjoy nature, view, sun, water and land. and yet so near to the busy center. the walk by the river is great and offers banks all along to sit and rest and enjoy",
          "Bears are not out much this time of year. You will see them a lot in april. Weather will be nicer and will make for nlgreat photos.",
          "It was winter so I couldn\u2019t see the bears but it\u2019s a great place to walk. I had a black vanilla ice cream that I didn\u2019t know it excited but it was great I\u2019ll post a photo so yo can see. They also have a restaurant and bar with lots of options and the food was great. They also",
          "I visited during winter so I suppose the bears are in deep sleep, but can't wait to visit during spring to see them. For now, the statue must suffice.",
          "Bears live in Switzeralnds Capital since centuries. The new Bear Pit is more zoo -alike than the pit before and complies much better with animal protection requirements. Bern is maybe the only capital city in the world that tributes in such a way to its coat of arms...",
          "Nice to visit, at end of the old town. Bears are like anywhere else you have visited, look for the 45 degree elevator that goes down to the river. That is a cool ride, and it's free!",
          "We visited at the end of November and unfortunately did not get to see the bears since I\u2019m assuming they were all tucked in somewhere warm for the winter. That being said it was a nice walk to get to the Bear park and the views were spectacular. We walked around and saw the",
          "Beautiful and good setting for the animals and to observe their behaviour. It is worth a visit. It doesn\u2018t matter if young or old everybody falls in love with these cuddly animals that are the name givers of our capital.",
          "Bears hibernate in the winter so note in colder months there will be no bears there! This is probably common sense but I just didn\u2019t think about it at all and no reviews advise you...so, I thought I do my part for fellow readers of TripAdvisor reviews. I\u2019m going out on a limb",
          "Went there and could not see the bears, we then asked at the touristninfo, and told us the bears went hibernating :( since the day beforebut the lady showed us on the webcam. We went a bit around the park and OH what a surprise we saw one of the 3 bears looking for last minute",
          "Unforgettable place to meet bear for real. The park is pretty big for them. Absolutely free for visitors and right across the bridge. 20 min walk from the central train station.",
          "I was pleasantly surprised to find that there are real bears here! I was expecting an old bear pit and sad stories about dancing bears in the 19th century. However, what I discovered was a large, modern space for three, very healthy and happy bears to live. I ended up spending",
          "Bern was founded in the late 12century and the first animal caught on the ruling duke\u2019s hunt was a bear so the city was named Bern and the black bear became the symbol of the new city. The first record of bears being kept in the city is from 1513. The bear park dates from 2009.",
          "The bears are super lovely. The park is perfectly matched with city and nature. There's a lift in the park. Elderly and handicapped can also enjoy the park easily.",
          "We're not enamored with zoos - mammals cooped up in smaller than natural areas. Given that, these bears have more room than in most zoos and even have access to the river. The views from the Nydeggasse bridge are impressive. You can walk down to the river, to see the bears up",
          "We\u2019ve heard that bear enclosure has been expanded and went to visit the bears. It was a very sad experience. Indeed, there is more space available to the animals now but it does not change the fact that they are caged and look extremely unhappy. When we visited the bears",
          "The Bern bears were always a treat to see. Overall the space was quite large for the bears to roam and we enjoyed stopping by and seeing them on multiple days. They were often quite active and my daughter loved watching them.",
          "The bears were active even on the super hot day we were there. One bear took a swim in their little pool attached to the river. It was fun watching the bears roaming around their compound, surrounded by the beautiful, ancient walls of the city.",
          "I had to visit a couple of times to se the bears , they were either asleep in the wild bit or in the feeding area . Patience pays off and if you are lucky you will see the bears at play. Interesting to find out how bears are linked to Bern. Out of interest there is a bernese",
          "It takes some luck to get a good view of the bears, either in the original bear pit or in the expanded habitat along the river. Even with that, it's well worth walking to for the great views of the old town looking back across the river. There's also a handy elevator to get",
          "We were just walking through the city and found this park. Its interesting how much historic this town is and how bears are part of it. This park has 4 bears in it and a nice park view with the town in the background.",
          "Interesting to learn how bears were part of the history of Bern.  The new enclosure is obviously much more natural than the old bear pits/cages, but still found it a bit weird to have bears locked up in the city centre.    Didn\u2019t see any bears this time around because of the",
          "Visited here on the advice of two locals. The bears are stunning creatures and seem to be very well cared for in a reasonably large area. It is very popular and you do get some great views but you are looking at wild animals that are in a pit!! Not sure about these kinds of",
          "We found the fact that there were real live bears living naturally in a large city fascinating. The very large enclosure was an excellent home for the family of bears,who seemed to be healthy and content. The public could get very close to the bears. Know there has been",
          "Was a bit worried to hear there were bears in the city, thought the enclosure would be small but it's bigger than they would probably get in any zoo and it looks well laid out. The bears are beautiful and look very healthy. There is a shop, restaurant lots of information points",
          "You can see bears swimming and eating and playing from about 5m away! It's free, easy to get to, and right below the loveliest bar in Bern. What more do you want?!?!",
          "This is something you must see while in Bern. There were 3 awfully cute big \ud83d\udc3b \ud83d\udc3b \ud83d\udc3bBears! And,it was dinner time so they were all really really hungry!",
          "Nice place to enjoy a view on the city bears. The park is ok, but the location is amazing, right next to the river and below a nice restaurant which brews its own beers!",
          "I wasn't sure about keeping bears even though it is historic. Whilst they can't run free they do have a large area on the river bank to explore, have shade and water to cool off in. The park gives all their names and details and all around there are interesting facts about them.",
          "Cute bears but only two of them in a small area. It's kind of a 'must-do' since there's not much to do in Bern but it was very underwhelming.",
          "Wow! A free attraction. Just bY the river and set in some wooded area is the home to the three bears. They have room to roam and so is reasonably natural for them. You may have to be patient and look closely.",
          "We went to the barenpark on Saturday morning, it was a very sunny day so the place was crowded but we did get to see some bears enjoying the weather.",
          "It was fun to watch the bears cruise through their habitat. Also, the river runs surprisingly fast - so it was fun to watch people float along in it too. (NOTE: There is an elevator near the restaurant if you don't want to walk the stairs.)",
          "The Barenpark is a Bear habitat overlooking the river. The bears remain for historic reasons, and actually have some variety in their enclosure. For contrast, you can see the old pit in the upper portion of the park. Definitely good people watching.",
          "Three large bears can be viewed from many angles surrounding the pit in this park at the lower end of old town. We just missed the mating season of May - July, but the bears were fairly active especially at feeding time when vegetables, fruits, nuts are fed the bears to provide",
          "The Bare Park is a symbol of Bern. Its a must for everyone, even if you have only couple of hours to see Bern, this should be on top of your list. The stream flowing across, invites you to dip your feet into the super fast moving stream. The locals swim but only if you are",
          "I came to this place from the park nearby, and first of all noticed people sat on the bank and refreshing their feet in the river. I did the same, envying people from Bern taking a bath in the water of the river running fast. Then I didn't stop at the zoo, but I surely recommend",
          "3 large brown bears can be seen in this huge natural enclosure beside the river & only metres from the old unenlightened bear pit. Enclosure has a long pool sectioned from the river, & the enclosure can be walked around on 3 sides. Bears can hide amongst the trees if they are",
          "In a kindly habitat, the bears are emblematic of the city of Bern. Stand on the bridge overlooking Old Town and the Bear Park.",
          "Very cute!! No price to pay so donations are recommended. The bears are very visible for the majority of the enclosure and a lift will take you from the top to the bottom to view the bears from a different angle. We did wonder if the enclosure is slightly small but I believe",
          "The three bears are adorable! Yes, these might be the most spoiled bears in captivity with their spacious three/four-story park with private fishing pond just on the outskirts of the city center. We were able to get a few photos of the bears that just brings a smile to",
          "Just over the river from Old Town is a terraced park for 3 bears. This multi level \"home\" with a pool adjacent to the river is much better than the old enclosure which is nearby. A funicular takes you from the upper level to the lower level which leads to a walkway next to the",
          "You can observe the bears from the bridge going into the town or the pathway above or closer to the river.",
          "A 'must see' destination for any bear fan but I did go with some trepidation wondering if I would think it a bit cruel. I was pleasantly surprised. The bears (there are 3 of them) do have access to one of the original pits but they are now also able to roam around a nicely",
          "Place where to see the bears, very nice attraction in the bern, very close to the center. It's worth to see.",
          "Interesting to see a mini-zoo exhibit on the hillside of a city, but unique to Bern. Read up on the history of why there are bears and enjoy checking them out from a variety of angles both on the same side of the river and opposing it.",
          "The enclosure for bears is well designed with lots of space, trees and pond. However, we spotted only 3 bears who didn't seem to be enjoying their artificial habitat. As a foreign tourist, I had expected a larger bear family. The bear statues have not been maintained at",
          "Nice place for a sunny afternoon, after seeing tge bears the Nearby Restaurant \"altes Tramdepot\" invites for a beer of its own brand and a meal.",
          "This attraction is free. It is in easy walking distance of the city and we spent hours watching and naming the bears! This is the only tourist attraction in bern, yet amazingly quiet. Sit back. Relax. And enjoy bears swim 1m away from you!!",
          "This is a quick, easy side trip from anywhere in Bern. While I guess it is a must-see, it isn't because of the exciting nature of the Barenpark, but more because of what the bears mean to the people of Bern. The bears are cool to see, and their environment is very nicely set up,",
          "A must-see in Bern, don't miss it. Spend some time on reading the detailed information on the signs.",
          "It is always a joy to see the family just across the bridge from the historic centre of Bern. They look so docile you would think you could pop down and give them a hug. Perhaps not. They are in good condition and there is plenty of shade for them in the warm weather.",
          "I was pleased to see the bears had plenty of room to live their lives but I was horrified at the old space where they had lived. Any animal lover would be horrified that the government have not filled in the old small bear pit. There are many good zoos around the world to see",
          "For years the bear (Bern is derived from bear according to local lore) at het entrance to the old town near the river was the main tourist draw and he was living in a very dismall bear pit, unworthy of a modern countrie's attitude to animal welfare. A couple of years ago the",
          "Basically if you are in Bern --you go see the bears while you are here. Easy parking but lots of tourists busses parked everywhere. Simply we saw 3 bears living in a protected habitat on a hill next to a beautiful river. Very scenic area. I can't imagine driving miles out of",
          "Most fun is if you can find the 3 bears and follow their actions for a while. They're not in the pits anymore, but there's an informative display in one of the original pits. Walk there from the downtown, or take the tram.",
          "I would rate this a 5 but in theory I have an issue about caged animals and being in a \"run\" effectively in the middle of a city, easily seen had me conflicted as I felt so sorry for them. However, given the area used to have bears everywhere and now the locals believe there",
          "All the tourists seem to go over the bridge to this part of the town; there is a bus stop also. Bern means bear, apparently, and the crest of the canton has the bear figure on it. There is a bear fountain right near the clock tower. So, there is a bear park and right beside it",
          "The bear park is at the end of the main street just over the bridge that runs through the old town. The bears seem to have a good environment to live and looked happy. It was a hot day and we saw a bear (Bjork?) lazing in the water and walking around looking for food. Also",
          "They really give the bears a ton of beautiful space to roam around. They can even go in the water if they want. The three or them were hanging out very close to where we were standing at the railing which was great. They also had a viewing of them being fed which was cool.",
          "The Barenpark has historic significance (the bear is on the Bern crest). Still, I cannot believe that the city does not display them in a more humane and dignified fashion.",
          "A free and fun exhibit to find all of the bears on display. Bears roam freely in a beautiful environment, have a fishing area and appear to be very comfortable. A tram is available to those who wish to observe the bears from different levels. There is a beautiful walk along the",
          "the poor bears i caged in this hill that looks like nature cage with much space, but does it make the situation better??!?!?! There are fences and the poor bears are caged no matter how space and food you give them. PLEASE FREE THEM!!!!",
          "Great views. Excellent food. Something for all the family. Dads know what i mean. They brew their own beer here and it is yummy.",
          "Since the bear is such an important symbol in Bern, it's really cool that they still have the bears here to see- you can look at their old cement enclosures behind- cool to see how far they have come. The exhibits are quite large and the bears were easy to see enjoying some deer",
          "Free to see the bears.The area is on a steep slope on the bank of the river Aare.Today one bear had a swim , was entertaining.There are 3 bears and they were all doing their own thing .You can view from the bridge , from the top of the area and at river level,via steps or a free",

          "It's located at the end of Marktgasse across the bridge, during which you will pass the Clock Tower, Einstein Cafe and Nydeggbrucke. Below the Nydeggbrucke, there is a crystal clear Aare river surrounding the old town of Bern with scenic view. Bears are lovely and lazily lying",
          "As we walked through Bern, it was easy to walk to see the bears. I am not a huge fan of keeping animals in captivity, but if you have never seen bear, this is a great place to go.",
          "We were lucky as it was feeding time when we Went down to the river. 2 of the Bears Went to the water to find their food.",
          "The bears used to be in the small bear pit and not closer to the river in a much bigger location with a much better habit . easy to watch , now nice to watch without thinking its a zoo",
          "There weren't a lot of bears, but it was fun to watch the few that were there. It's also a great spot to get some nice views of Bern and the river.",
          "Shocking that animals would be kept in a cement pit in this day and age. Upsetting to see and no entertainment or educational value whatsoever. Just dreadful.",
          "Nice attraction in Bern, conveniently located at the old city and easy to reach using city Tram. It was really nice to see the Bears at the natural surroundings. There should be several of them but we managed to see only one, which was out in the open. Area surrounding the bear",
          "So good to see these lovely creatures in a much better habitat than when we last visited some 10 years ago. Lovely location, nice to walk along the river and enjoy the scenery as well as the famous bears",
          "The bears are in a more natural environment, have fun near the water - the river is flowing through - and in the bushes",
          "In the heart of Bern, just off the bridge, this is a real attraction. He bears roam free in their big enclosure. We've seen then in the water and running about in the trees, etc. Great views for everyone. No formality and totally free of charge.",
          "Saw 3 of them. One was asleep & the other two were wrestling in the water. Was really interesting to see bears housed in a city. The enclosure is spacious and the bears look very well taken care of.",
          "A must visit on your tour though Bern. Bears, right in the center of town! Very cool experience and a beautiful habitat for them",

          "Much improved environment for the bears as compared to a number of years ago. There is easy access for those needing assistance between levels. The bears were out and seemed to be enjoying themselves on a sunny day. The place is clean and well maintained. Can be crowded. When we",
          "My wife and I were very amazed to see bears (or Baren in Swiss) have their own private spacious enclosed area in the heart of the city, where they are allowed to move around freely within an enclosure filled with trees, bushes and a cave. Interact with each other, play and be",
          "Here you get to see bears play with each other and walk around a natural area near the river. The bears are not from the area, but it does not matter. It's worth a few minutes and is free to watch.",
          "Interesting to be able to see the bear family for free. Not sure about the ethics of keeping bears in such a location.",
          "Of course they can't reach you :) . But at least you can see them not in a zoo, but in public and enjoy watching them taking bath.",
          "situated across the river, out side and at the apex of the hair pin loop of bern city, there is a bear park. the name of the city is after the bears and they bears are very respected in switzerland. even on the roads and water fountains you can see lots of bears wearing army",
          "An enjoyable outing for the whole family. There is some walking of stairs, but an elevator is available for use.",
          "If you are in Bern of course you must see the bears! It is so nice to see that they have more space than the pits from years ago. They are very easy to find if walking away from the famous clock in old Bern.",
          "There was one bear out when we went by. It's a fun stop at the end of the arcades. We very much enjoyed reading the history of the bears and seeing their \" new\" home.",
          "I went to see this place with a friend. It was ok. It's nice to see the bears but nothing special about it. You must be an animal lover or bear lover to enjoy watching them.",
          "Great view over the Aare river! Bears in a natural habitat, near the Rosen Garten. A great restaurant the Altes Tram Depot in near by.",
          "it is a park in the heart of Bern... where three bears live in..... poor bears!!! I understand it is a touristic place, I understand the legend that brought them here but it is unvelieveble. Free these bears! who cares about the legend?",
          "A big pro is that the bears aren't overly confined compared to other animal attractions. The bears just do what they like, usually sleeping. The park is located in a pretty spot for a walk around.",
          "This is a MUST visit when in town. DON'T Miss this one . . . . A very attractive Bear Park with great surroundings and fantastic view to the old part of Bern. Located right at the Aare River. Visit also the Altes Tramdepot behind (Brewery and Restaurant) they make their own",
          "This must be the top attraction in Bern. It is great to see the three bears back. They obviously have a busy life which they make up for by sleeping. They looked very comfortable in their surroundings. Walk along the river and see more of the old town.",
          "Sadly, the bears were not out in the Bear Park when my family visited one Saturday morning. The park, however was open and there was a lot to see. You can learn about how the bears were housed initially for around 350 years and of the tradition as to why the city of Bern keeps",
          "I accept that some people might not like the idea of captive bears but these bears have 5 star facilities!..it was really good to see them and made our trip to the beautiful city of Bern complete!",
          "The 'B\u00e4renpark' is completely free and beautifully located on the river Aare. So here's my tip for anyone visiting Bern on a budget (which is difficult because the city is expensive): On a sunny day, get yourself a packed lunch or take-away food and go down to the Barenpark. On",
          "Barenpark is the perfect place to start a tour of the Bern. Lots of tourist information here and papa, mama and baby bears. It is hard to pull oneself away from watching the bears. A short walk to the rose garden offers an overlook view of the Old Town. Definitely worth the",
          "The barenpark is a MASSIVE upgrade from its \"hole-in-the-ground\" predecessor! It's an absolutely gorgeous three tiered enclosure with lots of greenery for the bears and high visibility for us humans! It's clear that these wonderful animals are very well looked after by the",
          "We loved the city views of Bern from the Bear Park and fortunately for us as we were there early in the morning the Bears were active too.",
          "This free bear zoo in the middle of the city is just an awesome deal; HOWEVER, the BEARS are sleeping right now so don't expect that for now. The views of Bern are very nice from here. I would definitely visit here if it was Summer, Spring or Fall.",
          "It's a lovely little spot in the old town of Bern. It's kind of fun and amusing to see these bears. There is a little beer brewery for fresh beer located just behind the bear park. You have to try it out. Really good beer and very picturesque scenery.",
          "If the bears are outside, playing and having fun, it's amazing to see them! Very nice to get infos about bears.",
          "Dropped by barenpark, hoping to see the bears, but was told they are sleeping and would only come out in February! But the area have a scenic view, at least it was not a very wasted trip!",
          "Written on the notice board: the bears are sleeping. We went at around 2 o'clock. No bear coukd be seen. Only wooden bear sculptures for photo taking and kid bear area for visit ( no real bear, too). But the surrounding environment is so nice and picturesque, you could see the",
          "Unfortunately we were here in late November after the bears had been moved to their winter hibernation spot so there is little to see at the Bear Park. You can walk down to one of the bear pits and see a visual display of the history of the bears in Berne but that's about it.",
          "Bern - the city of bears Comparatively less famous than cities like Zurich or Geneva, Bern however is the capital of Switzerland. Historical and beautiful city with a B\u00e4rengarten where you can see bears. Fun fact: Originally a family of four, a bear was transferred elsewhere",
          "Great Bear-sightings. Area fully accessible with panoramic lift platform! Riverside view were also amazing.",
          "It is very close to the old part of Bern, hence easy to visit. Also wheelchair accessible with a lift. A great way to make a rather boring tour of the city worthwhile for young children. ;-) The fact, that the bears' cage is rather big (5000 square meters) made me feel a bit",
          "You will almost always see a bear in the bear pit. These are remembrances of time past when bears roamed through the area. There are always people here including tour groups. You look down into the \"pit\" to see the bears and also have a good view of the city from here",
          "Went to the Bern Bear park in Switzerland, at the time we were there the bears were enclosed in an area that was mainly concrete which I found to be quite sad as they had nothing to do. However I was informed that they could access an adjacent parkland through a tunnel that gave",
          "Bern is a relatively small city and Barenpark is one of the best 'landmarks' to visit while in town. You can take nice pictures by the river, on the bridge nearby or have a walk next to the water, bears and the sea lions. It is an enjoyable activity for everyone. I really liked",
          "A long time ago, I arrived in Bern by the night train in Summer and before going to my meeting, I went to visit the bears which Bern keeps since the middle age, I found them in a late 19th century zoo setting, now they are in a nearby park where they can either hide or watch",
          "Walk down to see the bear in the bear park. Nice new facilities for the bear. Seems animal appropriate. He can walk about with inside and outside access. Also has his own pool of river water.",
          "You're in Bern, you've naturally decided to take a walk along the main street. The bears are just a little further down the street. Keep walking and remember to make a donation to support the care of the bears. They're bears, they're great.",
          "While this is not a must visit sight in Bern, it's perfectly located at the end of the old town and is on the way to the Rosegarden (probably the best viewpoint over the city). With that in mind, it's worth a short visit to see the bears and enjoy the view across the river. The",
          "The Barenpark is a really good and easy way to see some wild bears on the edge of a modern city. The setup is basically a elevated path with glass 'walls' around the exterior of an enclosure (think a zoo enclosure, but the size of 1-2 football pitches) that allows good viewing",
          "This is such a strange thing to see in Bern and is definitely worth a look. I'd never seen bears before and I thought this was a great attraction. The walk and view are also stunning. Children and adults alike would love to see these bears. There is also a great restaurant next",
          "Unfortunately we did not see any bears, but the walk and the view were certainly worth the time that we took to see it. On our way back to our hotel we passed another couple we knew who were on their way down to the pit as well. They had to have gotten there only 15-20 minutes",
          "Having seen brown bears in the wild I could never grade this highly. However the new bear area is much better than the old bear pits on top of the hill. These were tiny. See for your self. The new enclosure has space, river to swim in and multiple levels they can climb up and",
          "We walked through the very beautiful city of Bern, saw the zytlogg then wandered through the markets that were set up, as we visited on a Saturday. We made our way over the bridge to Barenpark. There were 3 bears to watch. It was a very popular attraction. We were hoping to",
          "I'm always a little concerned about seeing animals in big cities. In days of old, the city bears were kept in a bear pit. Ick. But they're in a big lovely spot next to the river where they get to fish from the water. There's an underground area for them for hiding out.",
          "I remember when the bear pit was just that a pit. This is so beautiful for people to watch the bears and much better for the bears to roam free.",
          "Well worth the visit to see the big brown bears bathing, playing and sleeping - and free to see. Information centre and bar close by for refreshments and food. Across the road is Brasserie Barengraben - very nice for lunch or dinner.",
          "On top of the fact that it was seen in the James Bond film On Her Majestys Secret Service, it is just one of the coolest places Ive ever been. Located just outside the main city section of Bern, you can spend hours sitting and watching the adorable bears swim, play and roll in",

          "The Bear Pit is a justly famous part of Bern. At a very simple level, it is exactly what it claims to be: a large enclosure containing bears for the tourists to watch (or maybe a provider of tourists for the bears to watch). Totally free, too. Set on a steep bank by the River",
          "If you are in Bern, you just have to see them. It is a long walk from the train station, but I was glad we went.",
          "We were in the area, so took a look (at 2 bears in an enclosed park). But I would not suggest making a special trip to this place.",
          "Every tourist in bern must have to see bear park. Located directly on the Aare, with a great restaurant in the river.",
          "If you're not used to seeing large bears, this is a quick place to visit as you cross the bridge into town. The architecture of the old bear exhibit is interesting too.",
          "We were walking in old town and stumbled upon the bear park by the river. It was neat to watch the bears eating and playing in the water. There is a nice bar at the top as well.",
          "For any animal lovers, you will truly enjoy a trip to barenpark. The Bears were out swimming and eating their veggies when we were there a little before noon. Their habitat is right off the river and close to old town Bern.",
          "Never bored seeing these bears running, playing in water, climbing trees, do wrestling with his firends. It is located on the crystal green clear riverside! very nice feeling",
          "The bears look so nice and easy going at this viewer friendly sight. The ranger was there at the time and he had lots of good information. The Bears weigh about 350 kilos and they put on about 40 more to hibernate. Nice setting and we'll worth seeing.",
          "We were visiting Bern with friends who live in the area, and found this to be a neat surprise while exploring the old city of Bern. Bern gets its name because of a bear being spotted near the place the city was founded, so there's a bear park. There's binoculars to watch the",
          "As with all captive animals this was a little sad although the three bears do have access to water to swim in and some trees. The bears are moved into the original pit to feed and access to viewing them is excellent at this point. My husband noticed how the Bears place their",

          "Barenpark (Bear park) is a very picturesque location to take in Bern's old town as well as a couple of bears who live on the slope of Aare river. Hence the name and a symbol of the city. The best part is it's free and perfect for children. In addition to the bears, be sure to",
          "Several bears are kept at the park. Visitors can view from two perspectives - eye level or above. The park is simple and pales in comparison to a good zoo.",
          "We almost walked past it and then we noticed a bear. It was truly amazing to find bears in the centre of a capital city. We enjoyed watching the bears in this impressive state of the art enclosure (totally free!) and the view of the city and river was also great. If you're in",
          "There are 3 bears here. It's free to see the bears in their bear park which is huge. You can get a glass lift to the bottom and back up. I was lucky enough to be at the bottom when they were getting fed. One of the bears really likes the attention and they all get",

          "Like a mini-zoo right by the bridge. One of the bears was out and about so it is an interesting area to see before you cross the bridge in to the old section of town.",
          "It may seem a bit odd (putting it nicely) for visitors that the Bernese built a park for a few bears at a price at which other cities would build an entire zoo. But the people of Berne just absolutely love their bears. Much of the cost of construction was covered by voluntary",
          "We walked through old town to get to the park It was a beautiful day and we did see 2 bears roaming around There were lots of people so I,guess it's a must if you are in Bern",

          "20 minutes walk from train station Quite interesting to be able to see bears roaming freely Lots of kids There is a restaurant with own brewery beer . Interesting but not a great attraction",
          "While walking to the Rosengarten we walked past the Barenpark. It would be a lovely places to take kids and it is also a lovely view of the old town. So if you want to have a free view of a bear it might be fun for kids.",

          "Our Geneva hosts did not think the famous 'Bear Pit' still existed after civil sensitivities were expressed about such captivity. But, during a day in Bern we made our way down through the old town to the location of the Pit. When we saw a large crowd of people, camera in",
          "Bear is the symbol of Bern and the city has a special beautiful place for live bears just in center. Surprise!! Male and female bears live in open air park near the beautiful river and you can admire their live in almost free space. The name of park and place is Barenpark",

          "Sad to see the Bears cooped up, but lots better than it used to be. We did see two of the Bears, one big one not feeling well and a young one really enjoying carrots and playing on the hillside. Hardly any crowds when we stopped late afternoon..",
          "I was able to see only 3 bears in the whole park, I liked their elevator which went slanting down towards the bears in the water, the two bears in the water were fun to watch as they were continuously playing with each other, rest the park is well maintained but not worth",
          "The park is at the end of the old town near the Rosegarten. There are three bears here in a large compound.This is as close to bears as you can get. Personally,I dont like to see wild animals in captivity,but here they have a lot of space to wander around in.",
          "Whilst visiting Bern, I was surprised to see that you were able to see actual bears here. It's worth a visit to see how they are kept and it is part of the UN Heritage Site. There's two areas where the bears may be: The first is the bear pit. This is where they are fed so",
          "The Barengraben or Bear Pit is a small compound near the center of the city of bern. The Bear is the symbol of Bern, in in his honor the city built a beautiful little compound near the Aare river just across the Nydegg bridge. The pit is built on a slope ranging from the top of",

          "We were able to see the three bears in fairly close proximity. The park is not particularly large, not that I know how much space bears are supposed to need. I'd prefer them to be left in the wild.",
          "So indeed there is a zoo type enclosure in the middle of Bern. I'm not a huge fan of animal in captivity but I hear this one is rescued. Also the attitude of the Swiss about bears is a bit unusual. They seem to not want bears in their country unless they are locked up. Bears",
          "Have you seen a bear before in a zoo? Then you've pretty much seen this. Not saying don't do it, but it's really for the lovely views of the river and city, more than the bears. I only saw one bear, and it pretty much did what bears do--foraged for berries and grubs, while",
          "Not sure what I expected but what I found was a free attraction - free venicular down and up if you don't want to walk but it wa hot in the car. There were 3 bears - one was hanging out alone half way up and hard to see - the other 2 were playing in the water. For me it was",
          "There are not many cities in the world that can boast a bear park central to town! These beloved bears are the heart of the city and have been so for many hundreds of years. Throughout town there are statues and fountains of bears made from a variety of different materials over",

          "We enjoyed the bear park today with our 1.5 yr old. We only saw one bear, but their enclosure is quite lovely and large. We also had lunch at the restaurant there, it was tasty and reasonably priced. Continued on to old town afterwards.",
          "A free thing in Switzerland? The sad bear pit remains (it was home to the Bears until an upsetting 2009) but now the Bears have a flash riverside home with a funicular lift (for the visitors). You can park nearby for a couple of francs, but as you can also walk into the city",
          "If in Bern don't miss it You can see bears in there habitat in the park take the angular lift down walk in the promenade enjoy the park Thou small it's a must see",
          "Is this really necessary? A small enclosure, at least it has some green areas, which must be terribly boring for the bears. And not much more interesting for their capturers Definitely not worth any special effort to visit",

          "Are the bears there becaue Bern sounds like bear? I was quite surprised when I found the place while going to Rosengarten. I could spot 2 bears but they were sleeping. They for sure have more place for themselves than in a zoo but I dont know if it's enough. I wish I could",
          "For so many years the bears languished in their unforgiving, medieval pits, which, I doubt, few (people or bears) could have liked. Now the Bears have exemplary accommodation right next to the river Aare. And it's great to see.",

          "It's hard to imagine a bear park in a city centre but this seems to work well. The Bears have lots of space, seem very relaxed and in great condition. The public love these bears and they watch them for ages. A great surprise",

          "Did not expect to see bears while walking through Bern. They are in habitats, but seem to have some freedom. Each area has access to river water coming into a basin but I assume the entry is small so they can not get through. There is a trail between the bears and the river",

          "Be Aware in winter there are no bears, they sleep! But in summer sometimes they are very active, swimm, play, klimb, dig in the ground, walk around and sniff in the air. They are cute just to watch, and I know they are tempting...but they are wild animals and nowone should try",
          "Nice location, not far from old town. Bears have a very roomy place to live and their environment looks nice. Also a great view of old town from there. It's free!",

          "We saw one of the Bears poke his head out, that was all. But you cannot visit Bern without coming here to where the original Bear pit was. The area is worth a visit, there is a terrace restaurant that is good for a drink overlooking the river. There is a walk along the river",

          "Located just across the bridge from Old Town this is easy to get to. As we visited in February the bears were hibernating however, could see where this would be a draw in the spring, summer and fall months. Lots of viewing locations to see the bears in various habitats. The",

          "The Barenpark can be quite simply and a normal bear park, but its proximity with the city and the Aar river turn it in a must visit place! The bears are very calm and very lovely! After visit them you can refresh yourself with the feet in the clean and fresh waters of the Aar!",
          "We went there in December but could not see bears as they were hibernating. Still there were a lot of tourists there looking at the empty bear park trying to get a glimpse of bears without success. The place is nicely done by the river. Suggest go there when bears are awake.",
          "We went here with my Aunt who went to school in Bern and she was able to share some of the history of this town with us. I am happy to see the conditions of the bear habitat so improved. At the time if our visit, I was thankful to even see the actual bear's head although he was",
          "We visited on a rainy December day so I think the Bears must have been inside. We did not see one little fella outside.",
          "We were a little disappointed that the Bears didn't show up. I can only infer that they were either sleeping or hibernating. Took Bus no. 12 from the city centre and a short walk to get here. Nevertheless, it's a nice surrounding with a good view.",
          "We went there on an afternoon. Once you exit the station, take a left and move for a couple of miles to reach the place. En route we found many shops (Sunday market and routine shops). Just before the destination there is a small but beautiful bridge. We saw a bear in the park.",
          "Nice place...just a small walk away from the city center...you feel amidst nature...children will definitely enjoy",
          "The bear garden is at the far end of the city, though an easy walk from the city centre. The garden runs alongside the river that runs through Bern. You can view the Bears either from the riverside or from the higher point, having crossed over the bridge and viewing from near",
          "Currently there are 2 bears, and they are really cute! You also profit from a great view of the old city of Berne. A must!",
          "\"Bern\" coming from the name \"B\u00e4ren\" wich means Bears. Of course you have to have some Bears in Bern ! Really cute and funny Bears! You don't pay anything you have also a great view from Bern.",
          "Although I don't like captive animals, these would be worth visiting. The bears have a lot of place to walk around and you can walk around the whole cage.",
          "IF the bears are out, kids will get a kick out of it, but otherwise we go for the general scenery - the area is beautiful. It is a pretty small enclosure and like I said, I feel badly for the bears.",
          "I only went here as one of my children noticed this attraction fro the James Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret service (Bond drives past this) but parking nearby was easy and cheap (!) and the old bear pits have been changed into a visitors centre and the new ones have very",
          "This is more a question of, are they there,or, are they not? A sort of Einstein question relating to Special Theory of Relativity. is it me that is moving, or you? Haven`t seen the Bears in a long time; why, because they are not there. Of course, a thing can only exist if you",
          "The bears weren't there and quite frankly I was glad. The enclosure is incredibly small and boring. I can't imagine 3 bears living in such a confined space! I sure hope the so-called renovation work includes a major expansion. Bears roam and this park is nothing short of a",
          "Well, it is worth coming here for a quick look around but , really it is nothing special. Still some work going on, maybe it will be better later",
          "When going to watch the bears, I always think it is like a luxury outdoor spa for bears Always a pleasure to see these great animals enjoying the place",
          "This is a very nice place and a must see for all visitors. Living close if yust want to share that a the moment they are redoing the place very nicely, but it could be that in Summer 2015 there might some things be closed and the Bears are on vacation. But its a nice spot",
          "As the bears were moved away from the park, there were not much to see. Just a few statues of the bears and the bear garden.",
          "One of the main reasons for visiting Bern was to see the bears but the bern tourism office failed to let people know properly that the bear pit was being redeveloped ......",
          "The site has been closed for maintenance works and the bears have been relocated elsewhere. This is poorly announced and many confused visitors arrive at the location only to find empty bear pits. Before the renovation, the site was \"ok\" because I felt that the bears did not",
          "I visited Bern today, asked a few locals the way to see the bears and their directions were accurate and they happily helped me. However, when I got down to the part of the city where the bears live, I was greeted with a message from the bears that they are away on vacation",
          "I'm reviewing the Barengraben (\"bear pits\") in downtown Bern, and the \"Barenpark\" may be something different. I just couldn't find a listing directly for \"Barengraben.\" This unusual attraction lies along the river Aare right in downtown Bern. This famous tourist attraction is",
          "Went to see the Bears at Barenpark. Unfortunately for us but lucky for them, they are away for the summer\ud83d\ude1f, better luck next time.",
          "It is a delightful surprise to see bears as you visit the city. I know there is a discussion around if they should be there or free in the nature. I confess that, as a tourist, I enjoyed the visit and reading about each one\u00b4s life (yes, they have names and life summary",
          "We visited late at night, but as darkness falls it's harder to see. Next morning, we were up again, to catch them for their breakfast. Bears are put into the old smaller pen for feeding. So fun to watch them!",
          "I didn't know it is on construction. It is closed until Septemeber. There is nothing to see about bears. However, the view on the way of going there is awesome. Just walking there to see a beautigul view and going to Rose Garden;)",
          "Will be fantastic once bears return. Glad I knew not to expect them before I visited. The area is very nice however. Looking forward to a return visit.",
          "The bear were gone when i was there, transferrred to another cities, a bit disappointed, i guess if the bears were there, it's fun to have a look at them",
          "The Swiss Tourism is so Strong & Good that One can not expect any in correct Statement . Information from them. This was some time in July 2013. And at the \" I \" Information Centre at the Ben Railway Station ; we went for the Information on what to see in a day , there",
          "Crossing over a cannon like area on foot or car, look down to see where the bears live. It really wasn't all that exciting but fun to see them right in the middle of town, there were probably about 4 bears. You can cross a bridge over the river to see them on one side, then",
          "The Barenpark is the first place I have seen that has a number of bears on display publicly outside a zoo. It is free and at certain times of the day there and depending on the season, there are exhibitions where the bears do tricks! The Barengraben was also a nice way to see",
          "One of the most accepting and entertaining towns in all of Europe, let alone Switzerland. It is a treat to visit Bern and the Barenpark and you will find yourself spending much more time there than initially anticipated.",
          "We were Very sad to not be able to see the brown bears of Bern. A true disappointment Won't be open until Fall 2015 it claims. Careful though all the tour busses still seem to go there so don't get excited about it if it's on your itinerary !",
          "The park is being renovated. No bears on site until Autumn 2015. We were disappointed! Just a word of caution for others to avoid the same disappointment.",
          "It is an amusing story how bears have been kept in Bern for decades, you see signs of interest in this beautiful animal all over the city. Alas we were disappointed as when we visited, the animals had been removed due to renovations.",
          "The fact that they have a bear park in the city centre is bizarre yet brilliant. This is a free attraction and is definitely worth going to visit to spend an hour or two.",
          "Where are my bears! The pit is closed at the moment for much needed renovations. I hope they make it much bigger for them. The bears are currently at a nature facility while maintenance continues. You can, however, visit the gift shop, walk along the river, and see the sheep",
          "The bears now have a nice hillside habitat. It's fun to watch them, and the view of the river is excellent. Just take the number 12 bus across the bridge and you're there!",
          "playful. fun to watch. standing up and play fighting. And right there in a public place, a bear pit. totally unexpected when walking past.",
          "I was not sure what to expect before visiting the Barenpark. I knew the history and was keen to understand how this translated into 2015. We saw three bears who live in a large enclosure just across the river from the old town. They seem to be well catered for...they certainly",
          "Made the trip to a city enjoyable for the kids. Whilst we admired the amazing buildings in this historic place we were able to promise the children we were walking to the bear park! It was odd to see bears in a city but they seemed to have lots of space by the river and it was a",
          "Having lived in Bern 25 years ago as a child I vividly remember the Bears in what is now the closed bear pit. Having just returned for the first time i was pleased on one hand to see the new bear park which is considerably bigger and gives the Bears more space, however",
          "Yep, I said it boring ! One bear and the area where they live is so small. I understand the importance of the bear for the city but honestly ok for 5 minutes to look at them before you head in the tourist information shop and that's about it.",
          "The three bears have a large, terraced, hilly home along the Aare River with a great view of Old City Bern. It was winter, so the bears were hibernating and not out and about.",
          "It's still a nice walk across the river with a quick stop off at the Bear Park even though the bears are hibernating. Stop here along your way up to the Rose Garden at the top of the hill for gorgeous views of Bern any time of year.",
          "Another popular and justly so with kids and adults. You are atop a valley with a secure railing while you can see many bears down under in their near to natural habitat. Its a endearing site to watch a baby bear or a family of them. Kids truly love this site. On a beautiful day",
          "Lovely situation just across the river from the end of the old town. Unfortunately the bears were in hibernation, so only empty bearpits and info boards. I'm sure its lovely when the bears are there.",
          "This is a nice small park with a few bears. River is great to dip tired feet. Located in a cool edge of he old town. Easy access from the city's transport hub.",
          "Always go when I'm in Bern. It's a nice spot - just on the edge of the old town, on the slopes by the river. It's free to see the bears (3-4 of them). They're indoors hibernating in winter, so don't waste your time until they're up. It's ok but nothing special - marked as very",
          "I was here in the winter/cold months. Stood here for a while waiting on the hibernating bears. Needless to say none of them came out(they have compartments kinda tucked against the hill), they don't when it's cold. Nevertheless, the idea of having an 'open zoo' in the middle of",
          "We visited the bear park but they are hibernating at the moment. Bear pit looks a bit sad, maybe that's why they hibernate for 7 months!!",
          "Although a nice area to visit, don't expect to see the bears in winter since they are hibernating in their enclosure. There is a short hike up the nearby hill opposite the Bear Park to get beautiful views of Bern but it was snowing heavily so that deterred us.",
          "If you want to see bears and discover everything about them, it is te place to go. It is free of charge in winter and you can learn a lot. Great with children.",
          "We decided to take a stroll thru this park since the been bear 's where in hibernation . It's a great workout especially if you take the stairs . You'll see plenty of ducks and natural scenery .",
          "Bern is a lovely town and I had a great visit there, but in so-called civilised Switzerland keeping bears in a polluted, noisy town-centre location to be ogled at from above by tourists is a deeply depressing sight. Surely nobody can possibly think this is a suitable habitat for",
          "Given they hibernate winter time locals said I was lucky to see a bear. Yes, if you go to a zoo or visit national parks in the States you'll see bears, but given this is Bern it is worth trying to see their bears. But bears or not if you have walked out of the city centre across",
          "In the past the bears had only a tiny pit where they could hardly move around, in recent years they have moved them to the side of the river where they have now a sort of \"playground\" with a small swimming pool. It is a big improvement for the bears -although I do not believe",
          "I have never seen a bear before so after hearing there is a bear enclosure on the river bank in Bern, I was a bit excited. But I visited Switzerland in November and of course bears hibernate so I didn't see any. Damn you sleepy bears. I can imagine it being a great in summer to",
          "I liked that there was a live-feed camera of the dens (base of the long stretch of concrete stairs) so that you could see the bears when they weren't out. But the images weren't too clear. Saw \"Bjork\" the bear at dusk/twilight (quite dark, well past sunset) come out and graze",
          "what would a visit to Bern be without seeing the famed Bear Pits that house the city's armorial animal, the brown bear. The Bear Pits were established in the 19th century, but it is well known that throughout history the city of Bern kept specimens of these animals as city",
          "There's a nice area with bear sculptures our children enjoyed. We didn't stay too long as it was late in the day. However, it was still quite crowded and the cafe was every busy.",
          "Really only bears pacing around an enclosure. Reminder of historic times. Not really worth seeing unless killing time or passing.",
          "Since the city of Bern is named after the animal \"Bear\", it is fitting that the city keeps a few bears in a bear park or \"bear pit\". It is located across the river from the old city. There is a souvenir shops and cafe nearby. We went because it was part of our tour.",
          "They have done an incredible job with the bear park. I mean first of all the fact that there is a bear park in the old town is amazing. The bears are always walking around and playing. There are a nice restaurant at the top or you can grab some ice cream and spend some time",
          "Nothing much except some brown bear there, a gift shop surrounded by the river. Relaxing walk from the town.",
          "Yes I do like bears so I was very excited to see them. The park has two section, a pit and a slope with river. You can see the bears eating fruits (apples, watermelons, etc), swimming and running around. I suppose you won't find any bears in winter because they will be",
          "I found this pain in my heart when saw the bears, surely they need more then few meters of play area open to everybody's eyes... Well so sad to me and I do not understand why... But on the other side, they claim they actually saved the bears from nature as orphans so they would",
          "I travelled in December 2013 and I was hoping I could see some bears. However, I went there in the morning and to my dismay there was not even one bear. One thing though, the views to the mirror the at that time, the clocks too rung with cheered me up. One tip, try not to go too",
          "Nice first stop after you get into Bern. Simply hop on tram 12. A trio of ambling bears in the evening, the bridge here is a nice backdrop for evening photos. Its great to run along the river in the morning too. Check out the brewery restaurant for a hearty meal.",
          "The famous Bears from Bern got a few years ago a very nice park, an attraction for the wohle family. A must !",
          "the bears looked happy, not bored. they had treats buried along the banks as well s scattered around. We watched them for an hour. They did not pace as if they were bored. They frolicked along the banks of the river and were happy to go into the pit in the late afternoon. Lovey",
          "The Bear Park is something that you must see, even if on a short visit to Bern. It's a lovely stroll through Old Town from the train station, and then across a beautiful bridge with the clear waters of the Aare river flowing below. The bears lounge on the hillside, so you can",
          "We had one of my business associates that was born in Bern, show us the attractions. This was one he said you should not miss. We loved it. Nice breeze on a hot summer day and many activities and views for people of all ages.",
          "The bears were playful and were just fun to watch. It is a cute area with a barrier where the bears and people can roam free to enjoy the scenery. The steps lead down to the river where you can sit with your feet in the fast flowing river.",
          "Just walking 200 meters you can enjoy several shops, restaurants, historical places, and everything with the traditional order and cool atmosphere of Switzerland.",
          "It's a free one species zoo. The bears seemed happy and healthy, but that's it - 3 bears in a big pit (or enclosure) doing what bears do in captivity. That's it.",
          "Enjoyed seeing the bears at the end of our old city walk. We did not take the stairs down for a closer look but they were fun to see.",
          "The bears are great, they are without doubt well cared for and have a good environment to play, swim and climb. Are they a suitable 21st century attraction? Perhaps not. I just kept feeling they would be happier in the wild where they belong.",
          "Definitely worth a visit when in Bern. It's lovely to see the bears strolling around a more natural environment and swimming in their river and gives a real sense of the importance of these creatures to the locals in the statues and flags seen around. It's totally free to stand",
          "As Canadians bears are nothing new but I still marvel at these massive giants and how amusing they can be.",
          "I saw the bears originally about 20 years ago when they were in a cement pit, which is right next to the new place. To the new place, I give kudos to the town for creating a more humane environment for the bears. As far as it really being an \"attraction\" I would say that it",
          "Until 2009, a small enclosure served as home to the four bears of Bern. After a concerted effort, and many donations, the large Bear Park was built on the hillside facing the Aare River. With significant foilage, acerage, and a swimming pool, the four bears of Bern are much",
          "it is situated in the old city of bern.originally the bears were kept in pits,n later with rules coming in another area adjacent to it was made for them .this newer area is bigger,has natural surroundings,n a cleaner more hospitable environment for the bears.it is adjacent to",
          "We had hoped to see more bears, but we only saw two. We felt that the overall experience was underwhelming, but easy to see on your way to visit the Rosengarten.",
          "There were only three bears, souvenir shop with toilet. The place was below of rose garden. The place should be good for rendezvous point but I could not spend long time to see only bears.",
          "We had read that the Bear Park had been renovated and the enclosures made bigger and more hospitable for the bears. But when we went there, there were still bears in the older enclosures and they looked quite small for such big creatures. The newer areas were bigger and more",
          "The bears here are happy in their environment. It's beautiful place to sit and relax and watch their antics. There are rangers around who are very informative. Many places around for a picnic. Parking can be tricky. Best times are early in the day. They usually have some",
          "Yes, there are bears here and yes, you will likely see them at play. Very cool to watch them splash around and forage. Their enclosure is right next to the Aare River, which is also neat to see.",
          "You see bears on just about everything in Bern, so though there isn't that much to it, I guess if you go to Bern you ought to go see the bears. The location is right at one of the old town of Bern and also quite close to the Rosengarten so you could make a nice afternoon either",
          "My twelve year old loved watching the bears (we came twice during our stay). There are three bears and we were fortunate enough to see them sleep, eat, swim and even wrestle a bit with eachother. It is an easy walk across the bridge from the Altstadt, and you can catch tram",
          "We had so much fun watching the bears at the Barenpark! The park is quite large and the three bears have lots of room to roam as well as swim. They were very active while we were there and one played with a coconut until he decided to crack it open and then carefully remove",
          "The 3 bears were cute but the park was slightly boring. Maybe kids would love it. It is a large open air enclosure, easy to get to via tram. They did have interesting facts on the bears around the park, other than that.. Nothing wow-worthy.",
          "it is very small park. and i'm so surprised that it has total 2 bears. Maybe due to history of this park and the donation/fund raising nature for this park, it's quite famous. but to be frank, nothing worth seeing here except the view oversigh old town.",
          "The barengraben is a fenced in area next to a tram stop and across the bridge from the Olde Town. It's a good spot for people who want to see brown bears at a close but safe distance in a fairly small area, but on two separate visits I have to say that I felt bad for the bears.",
          "and a lot of fun, they feed them in the morning in the old bear pit, and the three bears then wander the park on the hill by the river, in the glass enclosed section plenty of photo ops for bears up close.",
          "This riverside park is a beautiful place for the bears to reside. They have an amazing view and must be very content with it all. Unfortunately we have visited twice and only seen one bear for a very short time! It was quite a warm day so perhaps they were under cover to keep",
          "We went the the bear park on a very sunny day,we found the bears very entertaining they were on the move most of the time wander up and down their fairly large enclosure they seemed comfortable in their environment and quite happy. We took lots of pictures. Well worth a visit.",
          "I found this kind of amazing. It's basically a small, enclosed, park located right along the river that has live bears. You can go and watch them do bear things, buy bear related memorabilia, pretend you're a bear yourself, whatever strikes your fancy and everything but the",
          "I anticipated this would be a sad place for the bears, but the renovation of several years ago, make it a fairly nice place for them. Plus, it offers visitors multiple places to observe them from a close distance, without being obtrusive. For a good view of the river & Old",
          "Though it is the symbol of Bern, the Bear park is nothing more than a sad spot for 3 bears that don't seem to enjoy being there. All tourists want to see this uninteresting place; I don't understand why.",
          "Visiting the Bears in Bern is a must. We visited with our two young children who thoroughly enjoyed it. You can buy vegetables to feed them fir a nominal fee. It is also a good place to start your walking tour of the city.",
          "I keep coming back. I first visited in 1989 when the bears lived in the pit and came back several times last year. They have a wonderful new home and I am sure they love it. I was delighted on this last visit to see one of the bears swimming! He/she was happily and leisurely",
          "Loved seeing bears in the park. Loved their little river enclosure too, but was sad to see some of the glass had been smashed (maybe from May Day?)",
          "On the bottom of the park, there are seating areas for visitors to eat, relax and enjoy the view of the running river. The interesting part is that the colour of the water changes according to the weather reflection! I totally love them when it's a bit cloudy :D",
          "The Barengarben is located just across the river to the east from the Altstadt of Bern and walkable (~20 mins) from the Bern bahnhof. It is also accessible by taking No.12 bus and get off right at the entrance. The enclosure is much bigger than expected. The \"pit\" you'd see",
          "This is a nice location over the bridge from the central district and offers a close a view as you would like from the brown bears. Open all day. Berne is inseparably linked with bears. According to legend the city\u2019s founder, Duke Berchtold V von Z\u00e4hringen, named the city after",
          "It was a surprise to see some live bears. We saw 3 different ones and they seem to have a great habitat.",
          "The bear park is cool because of it's ties to the history of the town but that's about it. It's a basic best exhibit and nothing too special. It's worth going to but we didn't spend more than 10 minutes there.",
          "Nice enclosure, slight shame you cant get closer but the bears seem happy and a great spot to grab lunch and is near to quite a few other sights and museums.",
          "When I lived in London there was an old myth that if the Ravens ever left the Tower of London then London would collapse. There is a similar story about the bears in Bern. The story starts with the fact that the founder of the city said that he would name it after the first",
          "We stopped here with our kids for a short visit on our drive through Bern. We all enjoyed the visit. I had visited here 20+ years ago before the park had been expanded - they've really made it look nice, and comfortable for the bears. -- We drove our car and were able to",
          "Lovely place with cool bears, cool restaurant and nice street where you can buy a stone and your name will be written on it! love this idea! This park is recommended for kids and adults!",
          "The legend of Bern, its name, and the resident bears is both unusual and fascinating. The only objection I have is that the space available to the bears is rather small, considering 3 of them must live together. The construction of the park in addition to the traditional \"pit\"",
          "There were two bears that were out grazing in the grass. It looked like a male and a female. It was enjoyable watching them forage for the roots in the ground around their enclousure.",

          "If you are visiting in winter, don't be disappointed as the bears are in hibernation now. In summer, you will see them roaming around their large enclosure and - on a hot day - having a dip in the water. In winter, you can go see the \"Bern Show\" (access through entry to",
          "Boycott this place. Keeping wild animals in captivity cruelty. Enjoy the medieval architecture and the beautiful sight from the Rosengarten instead.",
          "I can recommend Bern as a place to see!!!! And definitely you have to see the bears once you are in Bern it's very nice calm environment with the beautiful lake and sun.. Bears are big but beautiful..loved that I didn't miss it",
          "I should offer the disclaimer that I am opposed to keeping wild animals in captivity like this, but I think that the city of Bern has done the best they can with the construction of this bear park and the transfer of the bears from that awful and primitive \"bear pit\" where they",
          "The bears (Brown bears) are no longer kept in the traditional pit. Instead they have pleasant paddocks in the steep slopes overlooking the river Aar, opposite the Altstadt (Old Town). When a visiting dignitary comes to Bern, then a couple of bears maybe brought into the old",
          "This is a must see, if you're here in Bern! Very beautiful place and nice peoples! Lots of old buildings, very nice things to see!!! A romantic place to be with your loved ones!!! I can recommend Bern as a place to see!!!!!!!",
          "I reached Bear Park when the counter was closed, so I did not get into it. However, I can see that there are two bears were wandering outside. One bear was walking back and forth appears on the same route, and the other bears were sleeping in the visible wooden beams. The Bear",

          "the bear park in bern is a very nice place to visit, as long as the weather is good! the best way to get there is by bike. there are heaps of places in bern where you can rent a bike for free. it takes you about 10mins from the city center to the bear park. the park itself is",
          "It was nice to finally see the famous bears of Bern, and their enclosure is impressive. However at the time of my visit 2 of the bears were already hibernating, which is to be expected. So if you really want to see the bears don't come in the middle of Winter!",
          "I regularly visit the Bear Pit and enjoy it more now than when they were in the old bear pit. Even now the being winter the Bears are very content and a joy to watch.",
          "The Bears although out of their normal environment look so peaceful. A good view on way to tramdepot",
          "Brown bears are part of Bern's culture. This enclosure on the river bank provides a good setting for people to view the bears. The cafe is worth visiting.",
          "This where the old gates to the medieval town of berne. The old and the new bear park are a great site. Enjoy bern's best beer in the local brewery here and have a walk ether to the rosengarten or to the fischerm\u00e4tteli.",
          "When I visited Bern years ago, I felt sad for the bears in the small pit. Today, they have a lovely home with enough space to frolic in. It is nice to see wild animals in the city. They add to the charm of Vern.",
          "Not something I particularly agree upon, but the bears seem happy, they have a lot of space at their disposal now, the location is fantastic, grounds are well kept. They are so beautiful.",
          "New bear is excellent and bears were active and appeared to like the enclosure. Very pretty location when the sun is out. Restaurant/Pub located above bear pit is great to people watch while having a beer.",
          "Bear Park is a cool place to see some bears hanging out, walking around and sleeping. It's just next to the river and when you walk along, there is a path that goes into the forest. But the problem is I saw only two bears outside and the others were just hiding inside! Gotta be",
          "The bear park is right in the middle of the city with amazing views all around. The bears were pretty active. Its great to watch them from close up aswell as fom the bridge. And its absolutely free!",
          "The bear is the Swiss symbol and these bears now have a large area near the river to roam. In the past they were kept in a pit, so this is a big improvement. Fun to see if you like zoos",
          "We went to see the 3 bears at the Bear Park and they were outside even on this rainy day. There is a nice cafe nearby, Brasseris Barengraben, which is on the bridge that leads to the park. The main street that leads to the oldest clock tower [dancing figures a few minutes before",
          "If you are visiting Bern and have the time it is an easy walk across the bridge from the old town to get to Bear Park. On our visit we saw three brown bears in the new, much improved enclosure. But it really is nothing special. There are a few place in the area for buying a",
          "When I lived in Bern I used to be so saddened by the old bear pits. They are now fabulous - lots of room for the bears to roam, things for them to do and of course an area for them to swim in. Well done Bern",
          "Living arrangements are better than they had been. Sometimes the bears are out of public view but a walk way round their park allows good scope to see them. There were three bears when we visited.",
          "Next to the river and the old tram depot, there's a bear enclosure! Something different, and worth a look before or after enjoying a beer in the old tram depot.",
          "This is a nice thing to do if you're looking for something free and entertaining. It's basically a free walk along the river where you can see some brown bears. Nothing crazy that you should go out of your way to see, but if you're in the area and have some time, it a nice",
          "We really appreciated the habitat that was built for Bern's famous bears. It was fun for the kids to bike ride across a bridge and suddenly see bears lumbering around the hillside.",
          "I last visited Bern 5 years ago and the conditions were terrible as I recall. It was dirty and quite dark, and the bears mostly hid from public view, defeating the purpose of having visitors to the bear pit. After a recent renovation, the bears have a much more 'green'",
          "I worked in bern 36 years ago and in those days the poor old bears were in a horrible smelly pit called the baren graben. Now they have a lovely park on the banks of the beautiful blue, fast flowing river Aarer to play in. There are four happy fat brown bears in residence. They",
          "To have 3 brown bears in the middle of a city is great. This attraction is also free which makes it even better. The bears seem to really enjoy putting on a show for the people admiring them. You have to make a stop here while in Bern.",
          "well, for me it's something different to see an animal enclosure in a city. The bears however looked bored and sick though. hopefully they are well taken care of."

      "name": "Paul Klee Center",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Paul Klee (German: [pa\u028a\u032fl \u02c8kle\u02d0]; 18 December 1879 \u2013 29 June 1940) was a Swiss-born artist. His highly individual style was influenced by movements in art that included Expressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism. Klee was a natural draftsman who experimented with and eventually deeply explored color theory, writing about it extensively; his lectures Writings on Form and Design Theory (Schriften zur Form und Gestaltungslehre), published in English as the Paul Klee Notebooks, are held to be as important for modern art as Leonardo da Vinci's A Treatise on Painting for the Renaissance. He and his colleague, Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky, both taught at the Bauhaus school of art, design and architecture in Germany. His works reflect his dry humor and his sometimes childlike perspective, his personal moods and beliefs, and his musicality.\n\n\n== Early life and training ==\nFirst of all, the art of living; then as my ideal profession, poetry and philosophy, and as my real profession, plastic arts; in the last resort, for lack of income, illustrations.\nPaul Klee was born in M\u00fcnchenbuchsee, Switzerland, as the second child of German music teacher Hans Wilhelm Klee (1849\u20131940) and Swiss singer Ida Marie Klee, n\u00e9e Frick (1855\u20131921). Under Swiss law citizenship was defined by the father's nationality and Klee thus inherited his father's German citizenship. His sister Mathilde (died 6 December 1953) was born on 28 January 1876 in Walzenhausen. Their father came from Tann and studied singing, piano, organ and violin at the Stuttgart Conservatory, meeting there his future wife Ida Frick. Hans Wilhelm Klee was active as a music teacher at the Bern State Seminary in Hofwil near Bern until 1931. Klee was able to develop his music skills as his parents encouraged and inspired him throughout his life.\nIn 1880, his family moved to Bern, where they eventually, in 1897, after a number of changes of residence, moved into their own house in the Kirchenfeld district. From 1886 to 1890, Klee visited primary school and received, at the age of 7, violin classes at the Municipal Music School. He was so talented on violin that, aged 11, he received an invitation to play as an extraordinary member of the Bern Music Association.\n\nIn his early years, following his parents' wishes, Klee focused on becoming a musician; but he decided on the visual arts during his teen years, partly out of rebellion and partly because modern music lacked meaning for him. He stated, \"I didn't find the idea of going in for music creatively particularly attractive in view of the decline in the history of musical achievement.\" As a musician, he played and felt emotionally bound to traditional works of the eighteenth and nineteenth century, but as an artist he craved the freedom to explore radical ideas and styles. At sixteen, Klee's landscape drawings already show considerable skill.Around 1897, Klee started his diary, which he kept until 1918, and which has provided scholars with valuable insight into his life and thinking. During his school years, he avidly drew in his school books, in particular drawing caricatures, and already demonstrating skill with line and volume. He barely passed his final exams at the \"Gymnasium\" of Bern, where he qualified in the Humanities. With his characteristic dry wit, he wrote, \"After all, it\u2019s rather difficult to achieve the exact minimum, and it involves risks.\" On his own time, in addition to his deep interests in music and art, Klee was a great reader of literature, and later a writer on art theory and aesthetics.With his parents' reluctant permission, in 1898 Klee began studying art at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich with Heinrich Knirr and Franz von Stuck.  He excelled at drawing but seemed to lack any natural color sense.  He later recalled, \"During the third winter I even realized that I probably would never learn to paint.\" During these times of youthful adventure, Klee spent much time in pubs and had affairs with lower-class women and artists' models. He had an illegitimate son in 1900 who died several weeks after birth.After receiving his Fine Arts degree, Klee traveled in Italy from October 1901 to May 1902 with friend Hermann Haller. They visited in Rome, Florence, Naples and the Amalfi Coast, studying the master painters of past centuries. He exclaimed, \"The Forum and the Vatican have spoken to me.  Humanism wants to suffocate me.\" He responded to the colors of Italy, but sadly noted, \"that a long struggle lies in store for me in this field of color.\" For Klee, color represented the optimism and nobility in art, and a hope for relief from the pessimistic nature he expressed in his black-and-white grotesques and satires. Returning to Bern, he lived with his parents for several years, and took occasional art classes. By 1905, he was developing some experimental techniques, including drawing with a needle on a blackened pane of glass, resulting in fifty-seven works including his Portrait of My Father (1906). In the years 1903\u201305 he also completed a cycle of eleven zinc-plate etchings called Inventions, his first exhibited works, in which he illustrated several grotesque characters. He commented, \"though I'm fairly satisfied with my etchings I can't go on like this.  I\u2019m not a specialist.\" Klee was still dividing his time with music, playing the violin in an orchestra and writing concert and theater reviews.\n\n\n== Marriage and early years ==\n\n\n=== Marriage ===\n\nKlee married Bavarian pianist Lily Stumpf in 1906 and they had one son named Felix Paul in the following year.  They lived in a suburb of Munich, and while she gave piano lessons and occasional performances, he kept house and tended to his art work. His attempt to be a magazine illustrator failed. Klee's art work progressed slowly for the next five years, partly from having to divide his time with domestic matters, and partly as he tried to find a new approach to his art.  In 1910, he had his first solo exhibition in Bern, which then travelled to three Swiss cities.\n\n\n=== Affiliation to the \"Blaue Reiter\", 1911 ===\nIn January 1911 Alfred Kubin met Klee in Munich and encouraged him to illustrate Voltaire's Candide. His resultant drawings were published later in a 1920 version of the book edited by Kurt Wolff. Around this time, Klee's graphic work increased. His early inclination towards the absurd and the sarcastic was well received by Kubin, who befriended Klee and became one of his first significant collectors. Klee met, through Kubin, the art critic Wilhelm Hausenstein in 1911. Klee was a foundation member and manager of the Munich artists' union Sema that summer. In autumn he made an acquaintance with August Macke and Wassily Kandinsky, and in winter he joined the editorial team of the almanac Der Blaue Reiter, founded by Franz Marc and Kandinsky. On meeting Kandinsky, Klee recorded, \"I came to feel a deep trust in him.  He is somebody, and has an exceptionally beautiful and lucid mind.\" Other members included Macke, Gabriele M\u00fcnter and Marianne von Werefkin. Klee became in a few months one of the most important and independent members of the Blaue Reiter, but he was not yet fully integrated.The release of the almanac was delayed for the benefit of an exhibition. The first Blaue Reiter exhibition took place from 18 December 1911 to 1 January 1912 in the Moderne Galerie Heinrich Thannhauser in Munich. Klee did not attend it, but in the second exhibition, which occurred from 12 February to 18 March 1912 in the Galerie Goltz, 17 of his graphic works were shown. The name of this art exhibition was Schwarz-Wei\u00df, as it only regarded graphic painting. Initially planned to be released in 1911, the release date of the Der Blau Reiter almanac by Kandinsky and Marc was delayed in May 1912, including the reproduced ink drawing Steinhauer by Klee. At the same time, Kandinsky published his art history writing \u00dcber das Geistige in der Kunst.\n\n\n=== Participation in art exhibitions, 1912\u20131913 ===\nThe association opened Klee's mind to modern theories of color. His travels to Paris in 1912 also exposed him to the ferment of Cubism and the pioneering examples of \"pure painting\", an early term for abstract art. The use of bold color by Robert Delaunay and Maurice de Vlaminck also inspired him. Rather than copy these artists, Klee began working out his own color experiments in pale watercolors and did some primitive landscapes, including In the Quarry (1913) and Houses near the Gravel Pit (1913), using blocks of color with limited overlap. Klee acknowledged that \"a long struggle lies in store for me in this field of color\" in order to reach his \"distant noble aim.\"  Soon, he discovered \"the style which connects drawing and the realm of color.\"\n\n\n=== Trip to Tunis, 1914 ===\nKlee's artistic breakthrough came in 1914 when he briefly visited Tunisia with August Macke and Louis Moilliet and was impressed by the quality of the light there.  He wrote, \"Color has taken possession of me; no longer do I have to chase after it, I know that it has hold of me forever... Color and I are one. I am a painter.\" With that realization, faithfulness to nature faded in importance. Instead, Klee began to delve into the \"cool romanticism of abstraction\". In gaining a second artistic vocabulary, Klee added color to his abilities in draftsmanship, and in many works combined them successfully, as he did in one series he called \"operatic paintings\". One of the most literal examples of this new synthesis is The Bavarian Don Giovanni (1919).After returning home, Klee painted his first pure abstract, In the Style of Kairouan (1914), composed of colored rectangles and a few circles. The colored rectangle became his basic building block, what some scholars associate with a musical note, which Klee combined with other colored blocks to create a color harmony analogous to a musical composition. His selection of a particular color palette emulates a musical key. Sometimes he uses complementary pairs of colors, and other times \"dissonant\" colors, again reflecting his connection with musicality.\n\n\n=== Military career ===\n\nA few weeks later, World War I began. At first, Klee was somewhat detached from it, as he wrote ironically, \"I have long had this war in me. That is why, inwardly, it is none of my concern.\" Klee was conscripted as a Landsturmsoldat (soldier of the reserve forces in Prussia or Imperial Germany) on 5 March 1916. The deaths of his friends August Macke and Franz Marc in battle began to affect him. Venting his distress, he created several pen and ink lithographs on war themes including Death for the Idea (1915). After finishing the military training course, which began on 11 March 1916, he was committed as a soldier behind the front. Klee moved on 20 August to the aircraft maintenance company in Oberschleissheim, executing skilled manual work, such as restoring aircraft camouflage, and accompanying aircraft transports. On 17 January 1917, he was transferred to the Royal Bavarian flying school in Gersthofen (which 54 years later became the USASA Field Station Augsburg) to work as a clerk for the treasurer until the end of the war. This allowed him to stay in a small room outside of the barrack block and continue painting.He continued to paint during the entire war and managed to exhibit in several shows. By 1917, Klee's work was selling well and art critics acclaimed him as the best of the new German artists. His Ab ovo (1917) is particularly noteworthy for its sophisticated technique. It employs watercolor on gauze and paper with a chalk ground, which produces a rich texture of triangular, circular, and crescent patterns. Demonstrating his range of exploration, mixing color and line, his Warning of the Ships (1918) is a colored drawing filled with symbolic images on a field of suppressed color.\n\n\n== Mature career ==\n\nIn 1919, Klee applied for a teaching post at the Academy of Art in Stuttgart. This attempt failed but he had a major success in securing a three-year contract (with a minimum annual income) with dealer Hans Goltz, whose influential gallery gave Klee major exposure, and some commercial success. A retrospective of over 300 works in 1920 was also notable.Klee taught at the Bauhaus from January 1921 to April 1931. He was a \"Form\" master in the bookbinding, stained glass, and mural painting workshops and was provided with two studios. In 1922, Kandinsky joined the staff and resumed his friendship with Klee. Later that year the first Bauhaus exhibition and festival was held, for which Klee created several of the advertising materials. Klee welcomed that there were many conflicting theories and opinions within the Bauhaus: \"I also approve of these forces competing one with the other if the result is achievement.\"\n\nKlee was also a member of Die Blaue Vier (The Blue Four), with Kandinsky, Lyonel Feininger, and Alexej von Jawlensky; formed in 1923, they lectured and exhibited together in the US in 1925. That same year, Klee had his first exhibits in Paris, and he became a hit with the French Surrealists. Klee visited Egypt in 1928, which impressed him less than Tunisia. In 1929, the first major monograph on Klee's work was published, written by Will Grohmann.\n\nKlee also taught at the D\u00fcsseldorf Academy from 1931 to 1933, and was singled out by a Nazi newspaper, \"Then that great fellow Klee comes onto the scene, already famed as a Bauhaus teacher in Dessau. He tells everyone he's a thoroughbred Arab, but he's a typical Galician Jew.\" His home was searched by the Gestapo and he was fired from his job. His self-portrait Struck from the List (1933) commemorates the sad occasion. In 1933\u201334, Klee had shows in London and Paris, and finally met Pablo Picasso, whom he greatly admired. The Klee family emigrated to Switzerland in late 1933.Klee was at the peak of his creative output. His Ad Parnassum (1932) is considered his masterpiece and the best example of his pointillist style; it is also one of his largest, most finely worked paintings. He produced nearly 500 works in 1933 during his last year in Germany. However, in 1933, Klee began experiencing the symptoms of what was diagnosed as scleroderma after his death. The progression of his fatal disease, which made swallowing very difficult, can be followed through the art he created in his last years. His output in 1936 was only 25 pictures. In the later 1930s, his health recovered somewhat and he was encouraged by a visit from Kandinsky and Picasso. Klee's simpler and larger designs enabled him to keep up his output in his final years, and in 1939 he created over 1,200 works, a career high for one year. He used heavier lines and mainly geometric forms with fewer but larger blocks of color. His varied color palettes, some with bright colors and others somber, perhaps reflected his alternating moods of optimism and pessimism. Back in Germany in 1937, seventeen of Klee's pictures were included in an exhibition of \"Degenerate art\" and 102 of his works in public collections were seized by the Nazis.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nKlee suffered from an autoimmune disease, scleroderma, toward the end of his life, enduring pain that seems to be reflected in his last works of art. One of his last paintings, Death and Fire, features a skull in the center with the German word for death, \"Tod\", appearing in the face. He died in Muralto, Locarno, Switzerland, on 29 June 1940  without having obtained Swiss citizenship, despite his birth in that country. His art work was considered too revolutionary, even degenerate, by the Swiss authorities, but eventually they accepted his request six days after his death. His legacy comprises about 9,000 works of art. The words on his tombstone, Klee's credo, placed there by his son Felix, say, \"I cannot be grasped in the here and now, for my dwelling place is as much among the dead as the yet unborn. Slightly closer to the heart of creation than usual, but still not close enough.\" He was buried at Schosshaldenfriedhof, Bern, Switzerland.\n\n\n== Style and methods ==\n\nKlee has been variously associated with Expressionism, Cubism, Futurism, Surrealism, and Abstraction, but his pictures are difficult to classify. He generally worked in isolation from his peers, and interpreted new art trends in his own way. He was inventive in his methods and technique. Klee worked in many different media\u2014oil paint, watercolor, ink, pastel, etching, and others. He often combined them into one work. He used canvas, burlap, muslin, linen, gauze, cardboard, metal foils, fabric, wallpaper, and newsprint. Klee employed spray paint, knife application, stamping, glazing, and impasto, and mixed media such as oil with watercolor, watercolor with pen and India ink, and oil with tempera.He was a natural draftsman, and through long experimentation developed a mastery of color and tonality. Many of his works combine these skills. He uses a great variety of color palettes from nearly monochromatic to highly polychromatic. His works often have a fragile childlike quality to them and are usually on a small scale. He often used geometric forms and grid format compositions as well as letters and numbers, frequently combined with playful figures of animals and people. Some works were completely abstract. Many of his works and their titles reflect his dry humor and varying moods; some express political convictions. They frequently allude to poetry, music and dreams and sometimes include words or musical notation. The later works are distinguished by spidery hieroglyph-like symbols. Rainer Maria Rilke wrote about Klee in 1921, \"Even if you hadn\u2019t told me he plays the violin, I would have guessed that on many occasions his drawings were transcriptions of music.\"Pamela Kort observed: \"Klee's 1933 drawings present their beholder with an unparalleled opportunity to glimpse a central aspect of his aesthetics that has remained largely unappreciated: his lifelong concern with the possibilities of parody and wit. Herein lies their real significance, particularly for an audience unaware that Klee's art has political dimensions.\"Among the few plastic works are hand puppets made between 1916 and 1925, for his son Felix. The artist neither counts them as a component of his oeuvre, nor does he list them in his catalogue raisonn\u00e9. Thirty of the preserved puppets are stored at the Zentrum Paul Klee, Bern.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Early works ===\nSome of Klee's early preserved children's drawings, which his grandmother encouraged, were listed on his catalogue raisonn\u00e9. A total of 19 etchings were produced during the Bern years; ten of these were made between 1903 and 1905 in the cycle \"Inventionen\" (Inventions), which were presented in June 1906 at the \"Internationale Kunstausstellung des Vereins bildender K\u00fcnstler M\u00fcnchens 'Secession'\" (International Art Exhibition of the Association for Graphic Arts, Munich, Secession), his first appearance as a painter in the public. Klee had removed the third Invention, Pessimistische Allegorie des Gebirges (Pessimistic Allegory of the Mountain), in February 1906 from his cycle. The satirical etchings, for example Jungfrau im Baum/Jungfrau (tr\u00e4umend) (Virgin on the tree/Virgin (dreaming)) from 1903 and Greiser Phoenix (Aged Phoenix) from 1905, were classified by Klee as \"surrealistic outposts\". Jungfrau im Baum ties on the motive Le cattive madri (1894) by Giovanni Segantini. The picture was influenced by grotesque lyric poetries of Alfred Jarry, Max Jacob and Christian Morgenstern. It features a cultural pessimism, which can be found at the turn of the 20th century in works by Symbolists. The Invention Nr. 6, the 1903 etching Zwei M\u00e4nner, einander in h\u00f6herer Stellung vermutend (Two Men, Supposing the Other to be in a Higher Position), depicts two naked men, presumably emperor Wilhelm II and Franz Joseph I of Austria, recognizable by their hairstyle and beards. As their clothes and insignia were bereft, \"both of them have no clue if their conventional salute [\u2026] is in order or not. As they assume that their counterpart could have been higher rated\", they bow and scrape.\n\nKlee began to introduce a new technique in 1905: scratching on a blackened glass panel with a needle. In that manner he created about 57 Verre \u00e9glomis\u00e9 pictures, among those the 1905 Gartenszene (Scene on a Garden) and the 1906 Portr\u00e4t des Vaters (Portrait of a Father), with which he tried to combine painting and scratching. Klee's solitary early work ended in 1911, the year he met and was inspired by the graphic artist Alfred Kubin, and became associated with the artists of the Blaue Reiter.\n\n\n=== Mystical-abstract period, 1914\u20131919 ===\nDuring his twelve-day educational trip to Tunis in April 1914 Klee produced with Macke and Moilliet watercolor paintings, which implement the strong light and color stimulus of the North African countryside in the fashion of Paul C\u00e9zanne and Robert Delaunays' cubistic form concepts. The aim was not to imitate nature, but to create compositions analogous to nature's formative principle, as in the works In den H\u00e4usern von Saint-Germain (In the Houses of Saint-Germain) and Stra\u00dfencaf\u00e9 (Streetcaf\u00e9). Klee conveyed the scenery in a grid, so that it dissolves into colored harmony. He also created abstract works in that period such as Abstract and Farbige Kreise durch Farbb\u00e4nder verbunden (Colored Circles Tied Through Inked Ribbons). He never abandoned the object; a permanent segregation never took place. It took over ten years that Klee worked on experiments and analysis of the color, resulting to an independent artificial work, whereby his design ideas were based on the colorful oriental world.\n\nF\u00f6hn im Marc'schen Garten (Foehn at Marc's Garden) was made after the Turin trip. It indicates the relations between color and the stimulus of Macke and Delaunay. Although elements of the garden are clearly visible, a further steering towards abstraction is noticeable. In his diary Klee wrote the following note at that time:\n\nIn the large molding pit are lying ruins, on which one partially hangs. They provide the material for the abstraction. [\u2026] The terrible the world, the abstract the art, while a happy world produces secularistic art.\nUnder the impression of his military service he created the painting Trauerblumen (Velvetbells) in 1917, which, with its graphical signs, vegetal and phantastic shapes, is a forerunner of his future works, harmonically combining graphic, color and object. For the first time birds appear in the pictures, such as in Blumenmythos (Flower Myth) from 1918, mirroring the flying and falling planes he saw in Gersthofen, and the photographed plane crashes.\nIn the 1918 watercolor painting Einst dem Grau der Nacht enttaucht, a compositional implemented poem, possibly written by Klee, he incorporated letters in small, in terms of color separated squares, cutting off the first verse from the second one with silver paper. At the top of the cardboard, which carries the picture, the verses are inscribed in manuscript form. Here, Klee did not lean on Delaunay's colors, but on Marc's, although the picture content of both painters does not correspond with each other. Herwarth Walden, Klee's art dealer, saw in them a \"Wachabl\u00f6sung\" (changing of the guard) of his art. Since 1919 he often used oil colors, with which he combined watercolors and colored pencil. The Villa R (Kunstmuseum Basel) from 1919 unites visible realities such as sun, moon, mountains, trees and architectures, as well as surreal pledges and sentiment readings.\n\n\n=== Works in the Bauhaus period and in D\u00fcsseldorf ===\nHis works during this time include Camel (in rhythmic landscape with trees) as well as other paintings with abstract graphical elements such as betroffener Ort (Affected Place) (1922). From that period he created Die Zwitscher-Maschine (The Twittering Machine), which was later removed from the National Gallery. After being named defamatory in the Munich exhibition \"Entartete Kunst\", the painting was later bought by the Buchholz Gallery, New York, and then transferred in 1939 to the Museum of Modern Art. The \"twittering\" in the title refers to the open-beaked birds, while the \"machine\" is illustrated by the crank. The watercolor painting appears at a first glance childish, but it allows more interpretations. The picture can be interpreted as a critic by Klee, who shows through denaturation of the birds, that the world technization heist the creatures' self-determination.Other examples from that period are der Goldfisch (The Goldfish) from 1925, Katze und Vogel (Cat and Bird), from 1928, and Hauptweg und Nebenwege (Main Road and Byways) from 1929. Through variations of the canvas ground and his combined painting techniques Klee created new color effects and picture impressions.\nFrom 1916 to 1925, Klee created 50 hand puppets for his son Felix. The puppets are not mentioned in the Bauhaus catalog of works, since they were intended as private toys from the beginning. Nevertheless, they are an impressive example of Klee's imagery. He not only dealt with puppet shows privately, but also in his artistic work at the Bauhaus.In 1931, Klee transferred to D\u00fcsseldorf to teach at the Akademie; the Nazis shut down the Bauhaus soon after. During this time, Klee illustrated a series of guardian angels. Among these figurations is \"In Engelshut\" (In the Angel's Care). Its overlaying technique evinces the polyphonic character of his drawing method between 1920 and 1932.The 1932 painting Ad Parnassum was also created in the D\u00fcsseldorf period. 100 cm \u00d7 126 cm (39 in \u00d7 50 in) This is one of his largest paintings, as he usually worked with small formats. In this mosaic-like work in the style of pointillism he combined different techniques and compositional principles. Influenced by his trip to Egypt from 1928 to 1929, Klee built a color field from individually stamped dots, surrounded by similarly stamped lines, which results in a pyramid. Above the roof of the \"Parnassus\" there is a sun. The title identifies the picture as the home of Apollo and the Muses. During his 1929 travels through Egypt, Klee developed a sense of connection to the land, described by art historian Olivier Berggruen as a mystical feeling: \"In the desert, the sun's intense rays seemed to envelop all living things, and at night, the movement of the stars felt even more palpable. In the architecture of the ancient funerary moments Klee discovered a sense of proportion and measure in which human beings appeared to establish a convincing relationship with the immensity of the landscape; furthermore, he was drawn to the esoteric numerology that governed the way in which these monuments had been built.\" In 1933, his last year in Germany, he created a range of paintings and drawings; the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 comprised 482 works. The self-portrait in the same year\u2014with the programmatic title von der Liste gestrichen (removed from the list)\u2014provides information about his feeling after losing his professorship. The abstract portrait was painted in dark colors and shows closed eyes and compressed lips, while on the back of his head there is a large \"X\", symbolizing that his art was no longer valued in Germany.\n\n\n=== Last works in Switzerland ===\nIn this period Klee mainly worked on large-sized pictures. After the onset of illness, there were about 25 works in the 1936 catalogue, but his productivity increased in 1937 to 264 pictures, 1938 to 489, and 1939\u2014his most productive year\u2014to 1254. They dealt with ambivalent themes, expressing his personal fate, the political situation and his wit. Examples are the watercolor painting Musiker (musician), a stick-man face with partially serious, partially smiling mouth; and the Revolution des Viadukts (Revolution of the Viadukt), an anti-fascist art. In Viadukt (1937) the bridge arches split from the bank as they refuse to be linked to a chain and are therefore rioting.\nSince 1938, Klee worked more intensively with hieroglyphic-like elements. The painting Insula dulcamara from the same year, which is one of his largest (88 cm \u00d7 176 cm (35 in \u00d7 69 in)), shows a white face in the middle of the elements, symbolizing death with its black-circled eye sockets. Bitterness and sorrow are not rare in much of his works during this time.\n\nKlee created in 1940 a picture which strongly differs from the previous works, leaving it unsigned on the scaffold. The comparatively realistic still life, Ohne Titel, later named as Der Todesengel (Angel of Death), depicts flowers, a green pot, sculpture and an angel. The moon on black ground is separated from these groups. During his 60th birthday Klee was photographed in front of this picture.\n\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\n\n\n=== Contemporary view ===\n\nArt does not reproduce the visible; rather, it makes visible.\n\"Klee's act is very prestigious. In a minimum of one line he can reveal his wisdom. He is everything; profound, gentle and many more of the good things, and this because: he is innovative\", wrote Oskar Schlemmer, Klee's future artist colleague at the Bauhaus, in his September 1916 diary.Novelist and Klee's friend Wilhelm Hausenstein wrote in his work \u00dcber Expressionismus in der Malerei (On Expressionism in Painting), \"Maybe Klee's attitude is in general understandable for musical people\u2014how Klee is one of the most delightsome violinist playing Bach and H\u00e4ndel, who ever walked on earth. [\u2026] For Klee, the German classic painter of the Cubism, the world music became his companion, possibly even a part of his art; the composition, written in notes, seems to be not dissimilar.\"When Klee visited the Paris surrealism exhibition in 1925, Max Ernst was impressed by his work. His partially morbid motifs appealed to the surrealists. Andr\u00e9 Breton helped to develop the surrealism and renamed Klee's 1912 painting Zimmerperspektive mit Einwohnern (Room Perspective with People) to chambre spirit in a catalogue. Critic Ren\u00e9 Crevel called the artist a \"dreamer\" who \"releases a swarm of small lyrical louses from mysterious abysses.\" Paul Klee's confidante Will Grohmann argued in the Cahiers d'art that he \"stands definitely well solid on his feet. He is by no means a dreamer; he is a modern person, who teaches as a professor at the Bauhaus.\" Whereupon Breton, as Joan Mir\u00f3 remembers, was critical of Klee: \"Masson and I have both discovered Paul Klee. Paul \u00c9luard and Crevel are also interested in Klee, and they have even visited him. But Breton despises him.\"The art of mentally ill people inspired Klee as well as Kandinsky and Max Ernst, after Hans Prinzhorns book Bildnerei der Geisteskranken (Artistry of the Mentally Ill) was published in 1922. In 1937, some papers from Prinzhorn's anthology were presented at the National Socialist propaganda exhibition \"Entartete Kunst\" in Munich, with the purpose of defaming the works of Kirchner, Klee, Nolde and other artists by likening them to the works of the insane.In 1949 Marcel Duchamp commented on Paul Klee: \"The first reaction in front of a Klee painting is the very pleasant discovery, what everyone of us could or could have done, to try drawing like in our childhood. Most of his compositions show at the first glance a plain, naive expression, found in children's drawings. [\u2026] At a second analyse one can discover a technique, which takes as a basis a large maturity in thinking. A deep understanding of dealing with watercolors to paint a personal method in oil, structured in decorative shapes, let Klee stand out in the contemporary art and make him incomparable. On the other side, his experiment was adopted in the last 30 years by many other artists as a basis for newer creations in the most different areas in painting. His extreme productivity never shows evidence of repetition, as is usually the case. He had so much to say, that a Klee never became another Klee.\"One of Klee's paintings, Angelus Novus, was the object of an interpretative text by German philosopher and literary critic Walter Benjamin, who purchased the painting in 1921. In his \"Theses on the Philosophy of History\" Benjamin suggests that the angel depicted in the painting might be seen as representing the angel of history.\nAnother aspect of his legacy, and one demonstrating his multi-faceted presence in the modern artistic imagination, is his appeal for those interested in the history of the algorithm as exemplified by Homage to Paul Klee by computer art pioneer Frieder Nake.\n\n\n=== Musical interpretations ===\n\nUnlike his taste for adventurous modern experiment in painting, Klee, though musically talented, was attracted to older traditions of music; he neither appreciated composers of the late 19th century, such as Wagner, Bruckner and Mahler, nor contemporary music. Bach and Mozart were for him the greatest composers; he most enjoyed playing the works by the latter.Klee's work has influenced composers such as Argentinian Roberto Garc\u00eda Morillo in 1943, with Tres pinturas de Paul Klee. Others include the American composer David Diamond in 1958, with the four-part Opus Welt von Paul Klee (World of Paul Klee). Gunther Schuller composed Seven Studies on Themes of Paul Klee in the years 1959/60, consisting of Antique Harmonies, Abstract Trio, Little Blue Devil, Twittering Machine, Arab Village, An Eerie Moment, and Pastorale. The Spanish composer Benet Casablancas wrote Alter Klang, Impromptu for Orchestra after Klee (2006); Casablancas is author also of the Retablo on texts by Paul Klee, Cantata da Camera for Soprano, Mezzo and Piano (2007). In 1950, Giselher Klebe performed his orchestral work Die Zwitschermaschine with the subtitle Metamorphosen \u00fcber das Bild von Paul Klee at the Donaueschinger Musiktage. 8 Pieces on Paul Klee is the title of the debut album by the Ensemble Sortisatio, recorded February and March 2002 in Leipzig and August 2002 in Luzern, Switzerland. The composition \"Wie der Klee vierbl\u00e4ttrig wurde\" (How the clover became four-leaved) was inspired by the watercolor painting Hat Kopf, Hand, Fuss und Herz (1930), Angelus Novus and Hauptweg und Nebenwege.\nIn 1968, a jazz group called The National Gallery featuring composer Chuck Mangione released the album Performing Musical Interpretations of the Paintings of Paul Klee. In 1995 the Greek experimental filmmaker, Kostas Sfikas, created a film based entirely on Paul Klee's paintings. The film is entitled \"Paul Klee's Prophetic Bird of Sorrows\", and draws its title from Klee's Landscape with Yellow Birds. It was made using portions and cutouts from Paul Klee's paintings. Director Vassilis Mazomenos was the production designer of the film.\n\n\n==== Additional musical interpretations ====\nS\u00e1ndor Veress: Hommage \u00e0 Paul Klee (1951), phantasy for two pianos and strings\nPeter Maxwell Davies: Five Klee-Pictures (1962), orchestral\nHarrison Birtwistle: Carmen Arcadiae Mechanicae Perpetuum (The Perpetual Song of Mechanical Arcadia) (1977), for orchestra\nEdison Denisov: Drei Bilder von Paul Klee (Three Pictures of Paul Klee) (1985), for six players (Diana im Herbstwind \u2212 Senecio \u2013 Kind auf der Freitreppe)\nT\u014dru Takemitsu: All in Twilight (1987), for guitar\nJohn Woolrich: The kingdom of dreams (1989), for oboe and piano ('Landscape with Yellow Birds', 'The Bavarian Don Giovanni', 'Tale \u00e0 la Hoffmann', 'Fish Magic')\nLeo Brouwer: Sonata (1990), for guitar\nWalter Steffens: Vier Aquarelle nach Paul Klee (Four Watercolor Pictures to Paul Klee) (1991), op. 63, for recorder(s)\nTan Dun: Death and Fire (1992), Dialogue with Paul Klee, orchestral\nJudith Weir: Heroic Strokes of the Bow (1992), for orchestra\nJean-Luc Darbellay: Ein Garten f\u00fcr Orpheus (A Garden for Orpheus) (1996), for six instruments\nMichael Denhoff: Haupt- und Nebenwege (Main and Sideways) (1998), for strings and piano\nIris Szeghy: Ad parnassum (2005), for strings\nPatrick van Deurzen: Six: a line is a dot that went for a walk (2006), for Flugelhorn, DoubleBass & Percussion\nJim McNeely: Paul Klee (2007), Jazz album written for the Swiss Jazz Orchestra composed of 8 pieces\nJason Wright Wingate: Symphony No. 2: Kleet\u00fcden; Variationen f\u00fcr Orchester nach Paul Klee (Variations for Orchestra after Paul Klee) (2009), for orchestra in 27 movements\nSakanaction: \"Klee\" (2010), from the album Kikuuiki; a song envisioned as a dialogue with Klee's paintings.\nLudger St\u00fchlmeyer: Super flumina Babylonis [An den Wassern zu Babel].

It is located within the art history department, established by Franz-Joachim Verspohl. It encompasses the private library of book collector Rolf Sauerwein which contains nearly 700 works from 30 years composed of monographs about Klee, exhibition catalogues, extensive secondary literature as well as originally illustrated issues, a postcard and a signed photography portrait of Klee.Architect Renzo Piano constructed the Zentrum Paul Klee in June 2005. Located in Bern, the museum exhibits about 150 (of 4000 Klee works overall) in a six-month rotation, as it is impossible to show all of his works at once. Furthermore, his pictures require rest periods; they contain relatively photosensitive colors, inks and papers, which may bleach, change, turn brown and become brittle if exposed to light for too long. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art has a comprehensive Klee collection, donated by Carl Djerassi. Other exhibitions include the Sammlung Rosengart in Luzern, the Albertina in Wien and the Berggruen Museum in Berlin. Schools in Gersthofen, L\u00fcbeck; Klein-Winternheim, Overath; his place of birth M\u00fcnchenbuchsee and D\u00fcsseldorf bear his name.\n\n\n=== Tribute ===\nIn 2018, a Google Doodle was created to celebrate his 139th birthday.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nJardi, Enric (1991).

Swiss law determined citizenship along paternal lines, and thus Paul inherited his father's German citizenship. He served in the German army during World War I. Klee grew up in Berne, Switzerland, and returned there often, even before his final emigration from Germany in 1933.

          "Very famous and certainly interesting but it was in a price frame which we found too high. Nice placevto be and gorgeous building.",
          "Went to this museum on a free Saturday (August 2017 very Saturday is free entry). The building itself is very interesting to look at. Inside are Klee's works from different time periods, so some are more modern than others. It is nice that you can take photos (w/o flash).",
          "I had hoped to visit with my mother, 84, who walks with a stick. We drove around the surrounding countryside looking for a way in but didn't find any. There's a drive way with a bollard for deliveries, but no option for dropping off anyone. In the end, we parked in the car park",
          "The building by Renzo Piano is beautiful, but maybe it's too impressive compared to the usually small sizes of Paul Klee pieces. If you are not an absolute lover of this master maybe it's not a great choice to visit.",
          "Okay, so we went to the Paul Klee Center because it was listed in our guidebooks, we had extra time in Bern, admission was free with our Swiss Pass, and the architecture seems very cool and modern. The building itself it very modern and unique due to its wavy pattern and",
          "It seems European countries tend to build a museum honoring their own artists, in this case, Paul Klee. The famous architect, the ubiquitous Renzo Piano, built this museum. It is a mere short tram ride to get there from Old Town Bern (#12). There were two main exhibits when I",
          "The architecture of Renzo Piano itsel is worth to see ! This is the place where you will see a huge collection of Paul Klee pictures because he was living in Bern and his family gave a lot of paintings to this city, that is why a museum was created (it were before at \"the Kunst",
          "The museum has a great collection of Paul Klee works, and it has children corner where kids can play and create artwork. The building design is unique and I loved the interior as well.",
          "We went there with our company. If you like Paul Klee and his work it is surely a good way to explore his work and life. I would suggest to book a guide too. I was more interested in the architecture of the building ....",
          "The building has fantastic architecture. If you like buildings with interesting architecture, I recommend going. Otherwise, it is probably worth skipping, unless you really like Paul Klee. Not a lot of interesting things on the inside.",
          "Awful museum. They have over 4000 of his paintings and yet the curator will only show 100 or so at a time. What a complete joke. I wonder what Paul Klee would think if he knew a curator was choosing which of his paintings should be shown as if they are the artist. Will never go",
          "Landscape embedded modern architecture that hides but shines on the details. Not monumental but much space for good feelings. The Exhibition is fantastic and the restaurant beside one of the best in the region when you are a fan of local natural food in a cozy local environment.",
          "This museum is very easy to get to on the #12 tram- it's at the end of the line, and with the bus system being clean and efficient, it was a no-brainer to go. The building itself is worth the ride- done in a wave deign, to mimic the Aare River that runs through Bern. At the time",
          "Great architectural building on the outskirts of Bern. The collection itself is rather limited and the temporary exhibition has been the same for over 6 months. Worth a visit for the architecture and a walk outside, not worth the museum ticket unfortunately. We were there once",
          "The Paul Klee Zentrum is spectacularly designed and contains a superb collection of Paul Klee artwork. It is a quiet, serene environment. Well worth a visit.",
          "Lovely exhibit and audio tour is a must. The Museum owns over 4000 pieces of art but only displays 200. Would have liked to have seen more. There was an interesting second exhibit about abstract art and the 'revolution that is not a revolution'. Nice gift shop and cafeteria.",
          "In addition to a small portion of their permanent collection of Klee works that was on display was also an exhibition of work from revolutionary Russia, featuring Kandinsky, Malevich, and others. An airy, modern building that showcases Klee's works nicely.",
          "You have to try to get to this museum (it's not hard, but it does require a but that takes you just outside the city) and I was hoping for more than the effort actually took. The design of the building is interesting, there was lots of Klee, and a nice collection of",
          "I just went to the Paul Klee Center. You can take bus 12 all the way from the train station. It is uphill at the end so the bus is a good idea. The three buildings are interesting. The middle building houses the museum. There are many Klee paintings and drawings on display.",
          "The architecture of the center is very beautiful, but the collection of Paul Klee is quite disappointing. Very few works of Klee are on display in a small room and most of them are drawings",
          "It's a short hop from the old town by the number 12 bus, which stops outside. The building was designed by Renzo Piano, with a beautiful wavy structure. There were two exhibitions on when we visited and our tickets gave us access to the Kunstmuseum as well. It's a great",
          "The Paul Klee museum is an interesting place - not only for its art collection but as well for the architecture of the building integrated in the landscape.",
          "- you only see a very limited selection based on a theme, that changes a couple of times during a year. We really missed a section with a permanent presentation of highlights. The museum welcomes and has specific offers for children.",
          "We particularly enjoyed a wonderful concert with cellist Nicolas Altstaedt and pianist Faisal Say. Good acoustics in the concert hall.",
          "Wasn't sure what to expect from this, but was delighted, especially by the \"angle\" paintings, loved other works too. Set in a parkland setting. Sculpture park nearby, don't miss it",
          "I took the number 12 bus there, which was a nice ride, but the high price for the museum and the audioguide was not worth it. Unless you love Klee and want to see his grave, I would recommend you rather go to the Kunstmuseum, which has some nice Klees, and not take the time to",
          "I was really looking forward to visiting this art gallery. Having admired many of Paul Klee's artworks at other galleries, the prospect of one gallery dedicated to this surrealist artist was something to relish. The building itself is a piece of art in itself. There are three",
          "When I came to visit there was an exhibition that was centered around the theme of Trees. All the art on the upper level was by different artists and downstairs contained the art of Paul Klee. They also have a children's center where they do art activities with the kids. You can",
          "Paul Klee center is housed in a museum with modern architecture contains over 4,000 paintings by Swiss artist Paul Klee. They are organized exhibitions on different themes that change every few months. It can be seen most of the works of Klee.",
          "If you are a surrealist fan this is a must. They have a very large number of paintings sketches and sculptures from this period, as well as informative film clips. Paul Klee is featured of course but there are many other famous artists Miro, Picasso etc. whose work is also",
          "Excellent place to spend a few hours, indoors and out (park with sculptures). Large museum shop, music concerts, paintings and the building itself make it worth a visit. Oh, and the restaurant serves great coffee and Kuchen! Easily accessible by bus.",
          "We loved visiting the gallery! Beautiful modern building, easy to get to on the number 12 bus, it's the last stop on the route. Just the right amount of works on show so that you're not overwhelmed in racing round trying to see everything. A really thoughtful video about his",
          "Go and visit even if you are not a Klee fan or don't want to pay entrance for the exhibition. The building itself and the park around it is worth a visit!",
          "The architecture is already stunning with a wavy roofline echoing the hills and mountains around Bern. The collection of works traces the earliest to his final works and shows his experimentation with different media and techniques. As you see his works you also learn a great",
          "Interesting architecture by Piano. Regardless of what locals say, you CAN walk there easily....actually a nice walk from town, through rose garden to Zentrum. Mostly uphill, but easy. Great museum with lots of Klee history.",
          "The Paul Klee Museum has an incredible architecture, architect Renzo Piano's work. Besides the interesting collection, there is a children inside the museum. The museum shop is an attraction in itself.",
          "We learned a lot, but holy COW is the information poorly organized. Bad labeling on the exhibit areas; so hard to figure out where to go for the next audio program! Even the very courteous guides were befuddled!",
          "A visit is worth even just for the building and the environment, the construction is a master piece of modern architecture. Furthermore the Paul Klee collection is rich and amazing. Overall is a must see museum.",
          "This is a popular museum dedicated to Paul Klee not far from the City center. The exhibits are very well designed for Paul Klee devotees. Not a bad day trip if you have the time. The restaurant is nice and they have a good assortment.",
          "I'll preface this by saying I'm not usually a big art fan, and I had never heard of Paul Klee. I came here because a museum I had planned to visit was unexpectedly closed, and I have the Swiss museum pass, so why not? Usually when I visit an art museum or gallery there are a few",
          "Beside the masterpiece of Paul Klee, this museum has some interactive activities too. We can make some paints on the wall, or on the paper so we can take it home for souvenirs. They have a nice shop that sells unique items. For example, they sell a musical pillow, etc... And",
          "Very nice place, just the building creates a relaxing and Agreable atmosphere. the exhibition of portraits of Paul Klee is very beautiful, although lacking the most beautiful masterpieces. Special mention deserve the workshops of painting and drawing rooms dedicated to",
          "Truly brings out Klee's spirit: from Renzo Piano's wave form building emerging gently from the hillside overlooking corn fields (and the motorway), to the spacious displays that artfully mix the chronological with the thematic, to the participatory opportunities to make one of",
          "Paul Klee is a recent discovery for me. This museum gave me an excellent understanding of the painter, and enabled to follow his development over the years. Very well set out. Take the audio-guide - it adds much to the experience.",
          "First Paul Klee is one of my favorite artists so I am sharing my bias. This collection is exquisite and so educational. Technique is explained, his notebook and sketchbook is described and the collection is breath taking. This is the best of Bern in my opinion. It is expensive",
          "The building is pretty remarkable, and it's worth the 10 minute busride from the bear park just to see it. I'd say visiting the collection works best if you have a one-day Bern museum pass, since the pass is 28 CHF, and just going to the Klee museum is 20 CHF. The audio guide is",
          "We should have allowed more time for our visit - you need a minimum of two hours just for the exhibitions, and allow extra for shopping, coffee and the park. We didn't have children with us but the children's workshop looked impressive. 18CHF + car parking for senior citizens",
          "The buildings are amazing, and the museum is in a lovely area. But much of Paul Klee's work seems simplistic and dated down to this novice and the huge scope of the buildings dwarfs the many small paintings. Don't miss the representation of his studio of you go. So I'm sure it's",
          "The museum is in a wonderful building reachable easily by bus 12 from old city center. Works are arranged by major years and techniques being experimented with by the artist. A reconstruction of his Bern studio also on display",
          "The museum is build as waves, which is connected to the surrounding landscape designed by the ital. architect Renzo Piano. The museum is the home of many artworks by the Bauhaus artist Paul Klee. Klee is showing in a permanent exhibition along sides of other temporary",
          "For art lovers this was a must see gallery. The building sinks into the hillside and is surrounded by a green oasis. Public transport connections to the town centre are frequent.",
          "Really loved the building, it's really different as a museum and very unusual. I visited the collection with my mother as a special time together and we liked it both though the art isn't as surprising as the building itself! We also spent some time at the museum shop which was",
          "Interesting, but not more. The arhetikture of museum building, is beautiful. But the art of, only for understanding people",
          "The Renzo Piano designed building is worth a look, even if you don't go in the museum. It's a stunning piece of architecture. How much you like this museum will depend on whether you like the work of Paul Klee, a native son. The bulk of the work on display being his. I love",
          "Visited here as part of a day in Bern. Free access to the museum with a Swiss Travel Pass. Need to put any large bags in a locker. Lockers are downstairs and need a 1Chf coin to insert into the locker mechanism, which you get back when you remove your stuff from the locker",
          "Everyone in my family loved this museum and we're not huge museum lovers. The art was spectacular and well displayed, the \"complex\" was spacious without feeling empty and the food was nice and reasonably priced. The best part was the the creative children area where the kids",
          "I enjoyed the experience of the Renzo Piano-designed building almost as much as the art. Be sure to walk around the outside and look at the building from different perspectives. Many of the Klee pieces are small, so be prepared to move slowly and peer carefully. While we were",
          "We took advantage of a rainy day and rode the 12 bus to this museum- very easy from the center of town- this was a great museum- the staff was friendly and helpful- the exhibits were interesting and well put together- the design of the building by Renzo Piano was spectacular-",
          "Every one who interested in Arts know Paul Klee. It is a must to do in Bern, like van-gogh museum in Amsterdam or Dali museum in Figueres or... There you can find huge collection of Artist, different works.Also a workshop .It is near to city center by bus, no 12 from downtown.",
          "I visited to experience art on international level and its truly international and got learn see so much. Its a exposure of lifetime for any artist. Do see this on Bern",
          "Great place to bring your kids, it has several workshops in which your kids can engage and learn how to do cool art pieces. Several simple techniques explained that will keep your young ones feeling like professional artists.",
          "A special building with a Klee sculpture in front of it, I found that the exhibition itself was a little cold, maybe my expectations were not right, I did enjoy the visit though and the headphones with the audio explanations were very helpful. I especially enjoyed the",
          "Interesting Museum devoted to Paul Klee. If you are fan and love Art its worth a visit. You need to take a bus over but hen you get to see the Town of Bern and will also discover who Paul Klee was and what he painted!",
          "The center's architecture is very \"Klee\" looking . We visited for more then 3 hours. Even my friend that isn't too keen on art.the Klee exhibit is vey well thought . The audio guide. Informative. I didn't figure out if it is a permanent exhibit. Anyway the one we saw the",
          "besides the whole setting and the architecture of this museum, they also do really great exhibitions. today we went to see the Chinese Whispers, and I would highly recommend it. and making your way out here, it is worth to spend some time for a walk and a lunch or dinner in the",
          "They put on a creative art session as a team building event for my team. We had people from all over the world and we were 'forced' to be creative! The artist who ran it was superb and we even created something quite decent while having alot of fun. Highly recommended and they",
          "Chinese Whispers exhibit represents contemporary Chinese art from the past 15 years or so. Art works collected by Swiss business man and Ambassador over the past years. Very interesting work by mostly younger Chinese artists. The exhibition is also being shown at the Kunst",
          "This museum is set on lovely grounds. I was a bit disappointed in the Klee collection- having seen a wonderful collection of his work at London's Tate Modern. But the Ai Wei Wei and the the rest of the Chinese exhibit was great.",
          "Absolutely worth taking a trip to, not for the art but for the building. You do not need a ticket to see the building, reception area/cafe etc, just to enter the exhibition space which is nothing great (In terms of architecture, the paintings were beautiful)",
          "THe building itself is a top notch art. THe exhibiion is always changing so check the schedule. Been there for the Chinese Whisper, well orgainzed controversial exhibition by politically motivated art.",
          "The building is located a short trolley bus ride outside Bern. Three steel arches rise out of the landscape and it is well worth walking all around the outside to enjoy the different perspectives. Inside, the exhibition was in transition, however we enjoyed what was available",
          "We got to the place quite accidentally. After having finished our walk through the old town we were studying the bus timetable, close to Aare river. We saw a bus departing to Paul Klee Zentrum and we decided to take it. It is actually worth to do so because the bus is climbing",
          "Fantastic building, exterior and interior wise! I didn't expect in Bern such a contemporary building! The loby area and the cafe are very confi and never seem to get too crowded. The exhibition's explanatory \"walkman\" was very thorough and of good quality , very enjoyable.",
          "This is a very special place. Awesome architecture, beautiful spot, nice cafe and the incredible collection of Paul Klee.",
          "Once parked you don't know where is the museum... then you don't know where is the entry... and once inside you don't know where is the cashier. This building actually does not speak to you because - as many modern architectural pieces -it does not care, it is not at your",
          "The collection and chaning special events make this visit worth while, also repeated from time to time. You can make a be^reak with attractive snacks, or if you have more tme and mney eat in the nearby elegant gourmet restaurant",
          "Very nice place to go with kids since there is always something going on and exhibitions change very often. Worth spending a day!",
          "The Paul Klee Center is both a fine art museum and an interesting piece of architecture. Its undulating design makes for a striking effect. The art inside focuses on Paul Klee, a famous Swiss modern artist, and his life in Bern. When I visited the temporary exhibit was on Klee",
          "I didn't visited the exposition due to lack time, however the building is really interesting with three waves shaping the landscape with movement. The building is far away from the center but if you're interested in architecture you shouldn't miss it and be sure to take a peek",
          "Go only if you are deeply interested in art...they have a huge collection..the exterior design is quite exquisite though..",
          "We came here wanting to be inspired by Paul Klee's drawings, and surprisingly the building itself is also very attractive and we took many pictures before and after our art tour inside.",
          "Excellent art activities, changing exhibitions of excellent quality and unique activities for children and art, but do not drink coffee there, really not nice. The shop is also a bit disappointing because of limited postcards on current exhibitions. Nice walk back to town via",
          "Very basic cafe facilities in a lovely building. The work of Paul Klee was not to my taste but you must make your own decision if it is for you. The gallery does have other exhibitions but at the time of our visit this was being changed. Easy to get to by bus.",
          "Set on a generous plot of land at the end of bus #12 is an impressive modern set of three buildings overlooking Bern housing the Paul Klee collection with contributions from Wassily Kaminsky, friend and collaborator of Paul Klee. The art exhibit is housed in the center of the",
          "Visited on Museumsnacht which made it quite busy but it was well worth the trip. It had great activities for kids, a great selection of art for a small museum, & great facilities (food, drink, exhibits, maps, etc.).",
          "We realised we are not fans of Klee. There is a joint exhibition with Kandinsky on at the moment and we much preferred Kandinsky's work. The architecture of the building (by Renzo Piano) is wonderful. There is an amazing glass lift in the museum. Sadly this impressed us more",
          "Easy to get to (short tram journey). Museum architecture is very original, and if it's a fine day the view of the snow-capped mountains in the background is nice. Depends off course if you like Paul Klee, but if you don't know his work and like paintings (especially",
          "Worth a visit, an easy bus ride (no 12) from the station. The architecture is interesting, the exhibition was well curated, and the cafe was useful if a little disorganised.",
          "Beautiful museum and everything you ever wanted to know and see about Paul Klee! Current exhibit was with Klee and Kandinsky. Very interesting, especially with audio, and a wealth of artwork by both.",
          "I find the work of Paul Klee wonderfully quirky and colorful but until my visit to the Paul Klee Center had only seen a few works by this artist in art museums in the USA. What a delight to get to know this artist in more depth with about 40% of his works housed in a beautiful",
          "We visited for the 2nd time now the Paul Klee collection which is the Museum's core exhibit. Enjoyed it again and learnt more about this profound painter's life and work. Then we turned to the exciting parallelism of Klee and Kandinsky, colleagues at Bauhaus, close friends and",
          "For Paul Klee lovers this wonderful museum is well worth a visit. I don't know much about this artist, though the exhibition has good volumes of information in english to learn about him. Good facilities and easy to get to by public transport. Bus to the door and tram a short",
          "an absolute top museum - - beautiful architecture nicely integrated in the environment - - quite - - very well presented collections - - spacious, light, well presented - - friendly staff",
          "Another beautiful and distinctive building by Mr. Piano, which combines site-sensitivity (the rolling hills result in a curved building superstructure) and gallery flexibility. Even the dishes in the small caf\u00e9 replicate the curved style of the building, a cute touch. Along",
          "A great place to go if you appreciate modern architecture and the art of Klee and Kandinsky {of course) . We started with brunch in the cafe, which was OK, not special. The art is well displayed and mostly information in English as well as French and German. We did not take a",
          "I love this quiet little museum. It has the full expanse of Klees work from childhood to the end of his life, and is really quite something to see. An excellent documentation of the evolution not only the art of the period, but of history it self. The buildings architecture is",
          "Wow! They have put together a fabulous exhibit, the best I have seen. If you are a Klee fan you must go. The museum is lovely, easy to reach on #12 bus, free lockers. The audio guide was very helpful. They put so much thought into compiling this exhibit, my hat is off to",
          "Mrs M and I got in on our ICOM cards, but even a modest couple of sandwiches was an expensive lunch. The building by Renzo Piano is spectacular but - if you like Paul Klee, as we do - the contents were the main thing. There are giant rooms downstairs for kids to do their art and",
          "An amazing building in a scenic setting, with a great exhibition (Klee and Kandinsky). Definitely worth the visit.",
          "I recommend three things: (1) purchase an audio guide for the full effect of the exhibits, (2) bring some coins to rent a locker (3) make time to tour the grounds of the museum as well as the indoor exhibits.",
          "The building, created by the famous architect Renzo Piano, is remarkable and it becomes a must to visit when you are in Berne. The exhibition is well done, especially if you like th art of Paul Klee who was living many years in Berne.",
          "I visited the Zentrum Paul Klee in December 2014 and had the privilege of seeing the Antony Gormley sculpture installation. The next day he spoke at the Zentrum, which was a real treat. Keep a look out for new exhibitions. The coffee shop is a stunner, situated in the centre of",
          "I liked the building more than the art inside, but that is just my taste (or lack thereof). As far as museums go it is laid out average, with no clear path to take you through the artist's stages of life and art. There is a small cafe and downstairs is a pretty excellent kids",
          "Modern building fitting very nice in the nature. Good concepts of exposition. Easily reached from main station by public bus Nr. 12",
          "The first thing you notice upon arrival is the unique curving architecture of the building. I've never seen a building quite like it. Klee's work is quite a marvel. For someone who isn't quite read up on expressionist or abstract art, i found the pieces thought provoking.",
          "Went here whilst on a family holiday in Switzerland. The museum itself is easily accessible and we had no trouble finding a parking space in the car park. The building itself is quite striking and is worth seeing - we enjoyed a walk around the grounds. There is a small",
          "We had a lovely time in that museum. Unfortunately we arrived quite late and didn't have time to see all the exhibits as much time as we wanted. While we swathe paintings our kids had a workshop with a lovely girl on one of Klee's works.",
          "If you like expressionism, cubism, and surrealism, Paul Klee is a must. This museum is a short taxi ride out of Berne. Modern and beautiful building and the art inside really worth the visit. I do not like everything he painted but I do not either like all the Beatles songs.",
          "We visited the Paul Klee museum on May16. The Klee works exhibited appear to be random selection of a much larger inventory but did not seem to be a representative selection of his works. The Henry More exposition was a pleasant positve surprise. The museum is clearly worth a",
          "If you want see one of the most important places in Bern, you should visit this place. A combination of art in different manners and for a wide audience.",
          "We visited Bern specifically to visit ZPK. It is one of the finest museums of 20th century art in the world, devoted entirely to the work of Paul Klee. It houses the largest collection of his works anywhere, as well as art classes for children. The building itself, just a",
          "Great building nice collection of Klee pieces - not fantastic. Good temporary Henry Moore exhibition actually better than the Klee exhibition.. I would have rated the Paul Klee Zentrum higher as I was really looking forward to it and I quite enjoyed it. The killer for me was",
          "I am baffled by the negative reviews for this museum. I am a big Klee fan and got so much out of the visit. While it is indeed the case that many of his most famous works may not be on display here, the exhibition about his work is quite extensive. It is nicely organized",
          "We visited this art centre recently, the car park is close to the centre and if you present your ticket when buying your museum ticket you can get a days parking for 7 swiss francs beating the hourly rate of 2 sf. The exhibition itself is in an outstanding modern building with",
          "This beautiful Renzo Piano building displays an excellent set of the works of Paul Klee. Access is not easy, but choosing the right bus trip doesn't take long. The artistic content, however, leaves the feeling of a lack of life to the museum, that should invest in a larger",
          "Located just to the east of the city, but accessible by a direct bus, this is a destination gallery. A wonderful, inspired design, and housing a huge collection of Paul Klee works. Klee is not for every one; his work is cerebral and detailed. But there is no question his talent",
          "The exhibits were good, especially with the help of the audio guide. It is worth the trip on the number 12 bus to view it.",
          "The building was brillant. The actual Paul Klee exhibit was a bit small. We felt like for a building this large, and for his works, he should have more of his stiff there. But what was there was nice. The traveling exhibit was located in a lovely room and had lots of space to",
          "Most of the Paul Klee major works which they sell post cards for were not displayed. Also found the shop staff rude, defensive and dismissive of questions - Would definitely say avoid the place (especially the shop).",
          "The Paul Klee exhibition was very limited and did not have many of his best and most famous works. Very disappointing. Also, when we complained one of the staff was very rude and offensive. Overall not worth visiting.",
          "We wanted to see the museum not only for Paul Klee's works but also for its architecture. The number of Klee's works was a little small, but it was because of a change of exhibition - that was also the reason why we got slightly cheaper tickets (15 CHF instead of 20 CHF). There",
          "Actually we expected to see a large Paul Klee exhibition in the museum which calles itself \"Paul Klee Center\" and has 40% of his works. The futuristic building is large and nice. We expected several hours of experiencing Paul Klee's original pictures walking from room to room...",
          "I love Architecture, so I had to make a stop here and pay tribute to one of my favorite architects, Renzo Piano. You wont't be able to walk here from the Old town/train station. Hop onto a bus to get here, if my memory serves me right, it's probably a 15 minute ride from the",
          "This is a good museum and lots of activities for kids(our child was 5) when we were there- recommend get on the website as you can book art classes. The art was good, and we spent about an hour there. And another hour in the kids area. Its an easy bus drive from Bern.",
          "Zentrum Paul Klee is a wonderful place to spend a nice afternoon, even with small children. There are different workshops for children and a nice area for other creations called \"Creaviva\". The many exhibitions are a nice way to relax and enjoy the great works by Paul Klee. The",

          "I disagree with the person who said it was hard to get to. Just hop on the 12 bus. Go to the end of the line and you are at the paved path leading to the museum. It is fairly expensive to get in. It's a specialized museum which means that the collection is not extensive.",
          "Rather hard to get there and some walking involved..it is not near the center of town so be prepared to spend some money on public transport.",
          "This museum offers great architecture in a lovely setting, but the art within was a disappointment. Apparently much of Klee's greatest works are out on loan. We would have appreciated being advised of this before paying the very hefty admission fee to the museum.",
          "Everything about this gallery is worth seeing. The building itself is an architectural masterpiece, light and airy with great spaces, and the changing collection offers a glimpse of a master. Paul Klee is not the most well known artist but deserves to be seen more. Easy to get",
          "Renzo Piano has created a masterpiece here, and that is why I went. Klee's compositions are not to my taste, although there was plenty of them, and there were many more exhibits from his contemporaries. It is just not my taste. The inside is beautiful and the art is lovingly",
          "The building is amazing so even if you don't visit the exhibition it is worth having a walk around the park and seeing an extraordinary creation. Taking a Line for a Walk was also provocative.",

          "The museum claims to got 4000 paints of Paul Klee whereas we can only see 100... So I was very disappointed. Moreover entrance cost 20 CHF per person and parking is not free. It was a very expensive activity even if some paint or drawing are nice",
          "a center dedicated to Paul Klee with not a permanet collections of works of Klee, so only a few pictures put together without any criteria",
          "We were inspired to visit the Zentrum Paul Klee after the 2013 exhibition at the Tate Modern. The fact that host city, Bern, is amazingly pretty and that the museum was designed by Renzo Piano, are added advantages to get here. The museum itself is by no means dedicated to Paul",
          "Save yourself an inconvenient trip out of the city. We visited June 2014 and after paying about $20 a person, wandered about, looking for the artwork. A couple of exhibits later, we circled back to the information desk to ask where the Klee paintings were and the nice lady",
          "Maybe it's just me, but having a background in art, I found this museum to be lacking. I did find the architecture of the building very modern and interesting though. Your time will be better spent elsewhere.",
          "I've had a number of Klee prints in my home for many years but never really understood what they meant or much about the artist. I've always liked the colours and the lines and that was my initial reason for buying them. Although having recently visited Switzerland to see a",
          "went there last june with my parents. the museum has a very beautiful lobby, and approach is also very interesting. the museum itself was unfortunately closed the day we visited so cannot comment upon the exhibits but the building was very interesting- a bit like a paul klee",
          "Paul Klee is possibly not so well known to UK audiences, although the recent exhibition in London will have helped. I believe there are only 13 or so of his paintings known to be in the UK. He was one of a number of innovative early 20th century artists and this is almost a",
          "It is really easy to reach using the number 12 bus. I went because I was interested in the current exhibition about the journey August Macke, Paul Klee and Moillet took to Tunisia. I loved the colours and the audio guide explaining a bit of the background. Definitely worth",
          "It is easy to find, 10 min from centre and a very beautiful green place. The three buildings of this museum are really interesting, modern and impressive. Collections inside though didn't impress me much, I barely found 3-4 interesting pieces. I am not a big fan of such a modern",
          "One of the best musem I have seen. Good mix of everythinf: museum, temp exhibits, research, cafeteria, shop",
          "Normally art galleries are not my scene, but a recommendation from a friend persuaded me to try it. The centre is easy to reach by public transport, there is a direct bus from the station, or from the bear-pit. The building is modern and well laid-out, with plenty of space. The",
          "Didn't know who Paul Klee was but decided to visit the museum. Not my style but I enjoyed my time there and thought it was worth going to. It was interesting I spent about an hour and a half there. I would not go back again but do recommend visiting one time.",
          "The venue is quite astonishing, with a view of the alps, Bern skyline and suburbs and Bern \"back-stage\" (fields with sheep). You can walk from B\u00e4ren Graben in less than 30 minutes. The museum building is interesting, not breathtaking. The exhibition was very good, with a linear",
          "I love the design, I love Paul Klee, the restaurant is excellent, Creativa, the creative experience room, is really wonderful and the cafetaria a delight. The exhibitions are quite OK, however, the Staff is terribly annoying. They are watching anyone like you're there to damage",
          "The four stars are on a scale comparing it to other museums I've visited. It is a nice museum and not massively overwhelming. I like that they rotate the pictures and have different themes. I really liked that the sections of the museum were divided between the years of his",
          "The Klee collection is the main draw, and worth the visit alone, and the Renzo Piano building is an attraction in its own right. Some of the temporary exhibits are a real added bonus. A little research revealed that the swoopy bus shelter at the train station was built",
          "We loved the Paul Klee museum. It is a wonderful building and space. The display of Paul Klee's work in historical context was very educational as well. Well worth the visit. Highlight of Bern for us!",
          "As an architect, I very much enjoyed visiting the Paul Klee Museum to see Renzo Piano's building that mimics the rolling Swiss hills. Only two exhibits were open. Paul Klee exhibit with about 25 paintings with a very very informative audio guide and an interactive exhibit by",
          "lots of other artists on display- very litte of Paul Klee- we saw a much better showing of his work in Luzern at the Rosengart Museum",
          "Excellent presentation of Klee's work. Guided tour gave us a much better understanding of his particular style.",
          "Full of light and air, emerging from a green hillside on the outskirts of Bern. Fascinating material from one of the great leaders of modernism. Good food and drink in the cafe. Lots of activities for kids in the special rooms reserved for them with a selective of creative",
          "Very modern building which blends beautifully into its surroundings. Check what they are exhibiting first, we saw a exhibition on his caricature work with other artists, whilst interesting we did not see many of his paintings which was a bit disappointing. Well worth a visit If",
          "most of the Paul Klee pictures have moved out of the museum! poor help from staff and only one main picture on display. a great let down and we love this artist and went especially to see his work. closed on Mondays so we had to go twice",
          "I arrived on a free Saturday in the month of August. The spot is lovely, the building interesting, and the life and work of Paul Klee very interesting. Not an art museum for everyone, I'd say.",
          "Disappointed visitors are often those expecting to see Klee's masterpieces. But the ZPK (http://www.zpk.org/) is not about this. It is about better understanding Klee's work, who influenced him, how he was working, what motivated him, ... With that in mind, the visit is great.",
          "We had an interesting -- even challenging -- time at the Zentrum Paul Klee. But as a destination for someone who is curious about the full range of this artist's work, the presentation fell well short of what we had hoped to see. One of the wall legends candidly says that the",
          "Interesting place to stay for a while. Exibition (changing 2-3 times a year), Films about Paul Klee\u00b4s life, Souvenirs, books, explanations, Caf\u00e9 and a special place for kids. Was amazed about it. The whole ground floor for creative kids, really well done. Else as a adult it was",
          "The summer exhibit is just awful as there are only 25-30 paintings, certainly not the nicest ones and most of the museum is not accesible. Not worth the 15 francs. However, BEAUTIFUL museum.",
          "The Paul Klee Centre, in Bern, is well worth at least a half day visit of anybody\u2019s time. Spectacularly housed in the tsunami-wave-inspired building by Renzo Piano, it is unable to display more than a proportion of the thousands of works by Klee and his friends. There are",
          "Beautiful built into the hillside, the center houses an insightful retrospective of Paul Klee's works and rotating exhibitions of contemporary works. It also has concerts and other arts activities. I found it a bit confusing to get there, but it was definitely worth the visit.",
          "It is a wonderful building, undulating to fit in the landscape. And if you do not appreciate Paul Klee, well, what can I say?",
          "Nice location in the deep green fields. We visited the exhibit on Klee and Jadlewsky, and Klee and Japonismus.",
          "The exhibition Klee and Jawlensky will end on may 26th, If you appreciate the works of Klee, you cannot miss it. The two painters met in 1912 and two years later they swaped paintings for the first time. They went on giving each other other paintings, expressing their mutual",
          "Did you know the painter Paul Klee was called \"the Buddha\" by his companions? He was fascinated by Asian art and thought. This temporary exhibit at the Zentrum Paul Klee shows Asian pieces of art, mostly Japanese and Chinese, side-by-side with pieces by Klee. The pairings do not",
          "We loved taking the tram from the center of Bern out to this architecturally interesting building in the dead of winter. The bite sized artist specific museum is a very enjoyable adventure to include in your visit to Bern. Be forewarned that any bag bigger than a small",
          "The stunning building is a masterpiece of the Italian architect Renzo Piano. It is easy to visit, full of light with deep spaces giving a sense of freshness and movement on the different levels. The works of the German artist Paul Klee are displayed in a chronological way. This",
          "i loved it all, although i did not allow much time for visiting the asrt works, next time i will allow at least 2 hours.",
          "i like art so i like this museum. Plus the architecture is cool. They also have a kids program which runs monthly (i think) which is fab for kids.",
          "We found this to be an almost perfect art gallery. It owns an enormous collection of Klee's inspirational works (donated by his family), and it rotates which of these it displays at any one time. This means that on a single visit we appreciated a wonderful selection of his",
          "Even if you are not a fan of Klee's art, the building itself is worth the trip. Someone put a lot of care and effort into getting this right",
          "I really enjoyed this gallery. However... They claim to have the world's most complete collection and 40% of all Paul Klee's art. But unfortunately, and probably not their fault, it's not enough. I want to see more. For such a big-looking building, there actually isn't a whole",
          "If like great architecture, fantastic view to Alps and most of all are a fan of Paul Klee, this place is a must.",
          "One of our reasons for visiting Bern was to see the Klee collection at the Zentrum. The museum is outside the city, but getting there by tram is easy. The museum has very interesting architectural designs by Renzo Piano, so that is an additional feature. There's a special",
          "well designed and bursting with objects dart klee is an amazing artist little heard of but thrilling nevertheless",
          "I consider myself a art lover, but this was not my kind of art. The museum takes quite some space, but it all comes down to two large rooms with lots of small sketches/plaintings. Most to my humble opinion not more than a few lines of sketching. Sorry of all the true Paul Klee",
          "Klee is a well known contempory artist. He was Swiss. Putting those two thoughts together you would think that this museum would have a wow factor as the Swiss seem to do things quite well! There was my error! The building is Interesting to see architecturally, the bistro style",
          "Although the architecture of the Zentrum Paul Klee is interesting and dramatic, entrance is relatively expensive, and there is a disappointingly small museum in only one of the three building sections. If you go there by car, BEWARE OF THE GATE when exiting! The \"Auf",
          "We liked Klee before this visit but really appreciate him now. We've never seen a better museum dedicated to a single artist. Well worth the short trip outside the city center.",
          "Nice staging in a nice building. The pieces of arts are well presented. Mostly contemporary, lots of Klee. Easily reachable with the bus!",
          "A great place to visit but you do have to be at least moderately interested in modern art. I didn't realise the breadth of Klee's work until I visited the exhibition. This was my second visit.",
          "The Center though located in a beautiful building is basically for Paul Klee lovers. Accessible by road the ticket is very steep at CHF 20. The paintings on display are the not-very-well known ones, of basically his initial paintings The audio tour is very well conceptualised",
          "We made a special detour to Bern (by train) to visit. It was easy to reach by tram right outside the station. A beautiful building with a wonderful collection of Klee's works, plus an interesting historical perspective. Lot's of the material was translated into English and",
          "many people get interested because it looks so special from outside; I went during a museum night and was very disappointed because the exhibitions were not interesting",
          "The museum devoted to Paul Klee is a new building, designed by Renzo Piano, on the outskirts of Bern. It can be easily reached by bus (even on Sunday). I am fond of Piano's buildings, and this one does not disappoint: the builsing, in three parts, imitates a metal wave energing",
          "The architecture of the park and the building are only the beginning; the caf\u00e9 / restaurant is highly recommended and at it's best: the painting from Paul Klee and the interactive part of the museum are very impressing. Don't visit Berne, the capital of Switzerland without a",
          "That very well designed museum is a must see in Bern - a little far off but worth the bus ride !",
          "The architecture is very interesting and the collections fabulous.",
          "The Paul Klee Center has hundreds of work by Klee which are rotated through the galleries and supplement the core collection. This keeps exhibits fresh and interesting, and makes it possible to display works that demonstrate the full breadth of Klee's accomplishments. The",
          "A visit here was the reason for our trip to Bern. The building is marvelous, exciting and exuberant yet elegant. Paul Klee is a favorite artist but the curating of the exhibition is confusing, meandering and unsatisfactory.",
          "Why all this fuss about transportation? I am 83 years old and I walked to the Zentrum from the Best Western in under an hour along delightful footpaths marked out with Paul Klee signage. And then walked back through the Rosengarten with roses still in bloom on November 1st. The",
          "Not very easily accessible by public transportation",
          "In Bern main station, hop on bus12 (heading to P Klee Center) and you're on your way, through town, to a pleasant experience at the gallery. Klee was more of an artist than I expected... I thought he was just blobs and childish lines. But his early drawings are the best I've",
          "Art v Architecture and Architecture wins. Great fan of Renzo Piano's work and this building is a triumph. Exhibition of Klee's work is, dare I say it, a little disappointing especially given the entrance fee.",
          "The novel design was spoilt by the lack of attention to weeding the areas next to the building.",
          "We loved the space, use of light and the two shows that were. Up. The setting is beautiful and the town is fun. Great activities for children.",
          "After years of driving past the three buidings that form the Paul Klee museum designed by Renzo Piano, we visited the Cobra and Paul Klee exibition today. The museum is easy to reach by car as it is just parallel of the highway. There was plenty of parkingspace close to the main",
          "Take bus 12 from town centre and in barely 10 minutes you approach this fantastic buidling designed by Renzo Piano. Three great steel and glass waves are built right into the hillside overlooking the town. Inside are two exhibition halls, one of which will have a Klee exhibit",
          "We went to the Klee Centre to see the art and the building (by Renzo Piano). The bus no 12 goes straight from the central station to the gallery, through the picturesque city centre. The building nestles into the hillside, and was showing a special exhibition comparing Klee with",
          "Even if you are not a particular fan of Klee\u2019s work, it is worth heading out there for two reasons. Firstly, the bus ride takes you up and around the hill behind the bear park, with nice views over the river and city, and through genteel suburbs filled with gorgeous houses and",
          "The museum facility designed by Renzo Piano is an evocative building, beautifully tied to its context. And Klee, of course, is a fascinating and important artist. But the Klee museum administration is missing opportunities to market what should be a block-buster attraction and",
          "Just got back from here after my Swiss host here in Bern enthusiastically insisted I visit this new museum to one of their native sons. I used my Swiss pass to get in so I am not sure the actual price of admission. As for the building, it is rather difficult to miss. If you"

        "wiki": "The Museum of Fine Arts Bern (German: Kunstmuseum Bern), established in 1879 in Bern, the capital of Switzerland, is the oldest art museum in Switzerland with a permanent collection.\nIts holdings run from the Middle Ages to the present. It houses works by Paul Klee, Pablo Picasso, Ferdinand Hodler, Meret Oppenheim, Ricco Wassmer and Adolf Wolfli. The collection consists of over 3,000 paintings and sculptures as well as 48,000 drawings, prints, photographs, videos and films.\nIn May 2014, the museum was named sole heir in the will of Cornelius Gurlitt, the German collector associated with the 2012 Munich artworks discovery.\n \nThe authorities had found over 1,400 artworks, many of them suspected to be stolen from European Jews by the Nazis, in Gurlitt's homes in Munich and Salzburg. The museum was given six months to decide whether it would accept the bequest and its terms. The most important proviso required that the museum conduct research into the provenance of the paintings and make restitution where needed to the heirs of the original owners. The museum director, Matthias Frehner, pledged that it would do so if it accepted the bequest. The German government quietly urged the museum to accept the collection in order to provide a neutral place where research into its history could continue. (There was concern that if the collection were dispersed among Gurlitt's distant relatives, there would be no guarantee that they would conduct the research properly.) Determining whether or not to accept required much deliberation on the part of the museum board, work by its legal team, and significant fundraising from Swiss donors, so that the museum would not be reliant on German funding that could taint the neutrality of the provenance research. In November 2014 the board voted to accept the collection.In August 2018, an episode of Fake or Fortune featured the director of the museum Dr Nina Zimmer asking the team to investigate what appears to be the sole British piece of art in the Gurlitt collection.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Kunstmuseum Bern at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial Museum of Fine Arts Bern website \u2014 info on history + collections.\nCredit-suisse.com: Interview with the Director of Bern Museum of Fine Arts",

          "The country's oldest fine arts museum has a wonderful collection including works by Kell, Picasso, Dal\u00ec, Monet and van Gogh. The exhibition of Johannes Itten is excellent.",
          "We only visited the relatively small permanent collection on display and not the other temporary exhibitions, but were very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the art on display. Examples from a wide range of famous artists- Chagall, Picasso, Dali etc, and quite a few",
          "This was amazing to see paintings that aren\u2019t in the rotation of what major museums have. Up close, personal and not crowded.",
          "We were randomly in Bern in August, during which time the main museums are free on Saturdays. We took advantage to see this nicely-designed gallery. The permanent collection on display was smallish but high quality (Picasso, Van Gogh, Gauguin and the unknown-to-us Hodler). Not",
          "I made two trips to Bern specifically to view the two-part Gurlitt exhibit. This exhibit showed the confiscated art that was considered \u2018degenerate\u2019 or looted on behalf of the Nazi regime and ended up stored at the Gurlitt apartment outside of Munich Germany, which by just",
          "I have to be honest: The permanent collection (for which I was there for) is extremely small, and also not very impressive. Furthermore, on their website they state that they have Hodler paintings as part of their permanent collection, but when I went there they said that they",
          "We really enjoyed the part of the permanent collection on display, but found the special exhibition (video art and some random photographs) not very interesting.",
          "It was a rainy day so we decided to do an indoor activity. The Kunstmuseum was our chosen destination. We chose to pay a little extra and buy the ticket which enabled us to see all exhibitions therein. We are pleased we did because if we had restricted ourselves to the permanent",
          "Staffs are really friendly. Upon arrival the museum layout was explained to me. This made it easy for me to decide in what order I want to view the pieces.",
          "The museum is a large beautiful building with just a few old masters. It's ok if you don't have a lot of time in Bern and want to see other sites.",
          "For most, going to Kunstmuseum Bern between now and mid-November 2018 will lead to disappointment and resentment. Disappointment because, at the time of writing, the main draw called \"R\u00e9publique G\u00e9niale\" is a bonafide disaster. Meanwhile, very few of the collection's great",
          "I had read somewhere that the Kunstmuseum had a collection that ranged from old masters up through Jugendstil. It was that latter which drew us in. We arrived late -- within 45 minutes of closing. I had thought 6:00 close, but really 5:00. When we asked about closing time,",
          "While there are some impressive and interesting works here (Picasso's blue period and Impressionists), it is a small museum undergoing some restoration. My wife who loves art did not like the works of Martha Stettler that take up about one third of the exhibit space (July 2018).",
          "A museum with largest collection of works from Paul Klee in world. This also offers nice collection of artist from 20th century",
          "We had decided to go to this museum to see the special exhibition, \"Hahnloser Collection, Van Gogh to Cezanne, Bonnard to Matisse,\" which was very well presented, but were surprised to see that, in addition, there was a special exhibition of art collected by the German art",
          "I haven't been to this museum in ages and was pleasantly surprised, it's lofty and has a nice selection of art that is not big but covers a good range of styles - one reason for me to go to an art museum. Discover something new. This time there was the Gurlitt exhibition that",
          "As previous reviewers have said , this exhibition does rather suffer from bad organisation and lack of space and as I had a brilliant experience at the other half of the exhibition in Bonn Germany , I can make the comparisons. I agree that it\u2019s a big shame that the information",
          "By it's very nature and publicity this should be an event of international caliber. The exhibition includes many descriptions and text based exhibit as wall display. However, the organiser has not deemed relevant to have any of these writing available in a language other than",
          "At the present time there is a special exhibition on featuring the \"Entartete Kunst\" from the NS period in Germany. This is a must visit for travellers to Bern",
          "The museum is the beneficiary of the art collection of Gurlitt. Assembled by his father in the Nazi period and bequeathed this museum. We say part 1 and the next part will soon be on display. The collection suffers from only being in German. French and English is important for",
          "Although I found a little bit expensive the admission ticket, I was delighted with what I saw. The museum inherited the large majority of the works of art of Gurlitt, so what you will see there is art work that has never been on display after the forties. The large majority are",
          "We went through to the museum because they had Einsteins display there. Very interesting but it is a museum.",
          "Kunstmuseum Gurlitt collection of \"Decadent Art\": Interesting but not many big hitters in the collection. Videos showed by contrast the sterile Neoclassical style that the Nazis tried to impose as German Art. Also saw some Paul Klee. Restaurant looks like a cafe but in fact",
          "For starters, I bought our tickets in advance to save time at the museum. Unfortunately, the Kunstmuseum is so poorly organized, that buying tickets in advance gives you no advantage what-so-ever! We had to wait in the long line to exchange our tickets at the cashier desk for a",
          "Since the Gurlitt exhibition the access to the museum is more difficult. In particular it's not possibly if you are supposed to have some emergency medicine or other stuff with you and done want to show these things to everybody and each visitor.",
          "The top floor Hahnloser collection of impressionists was excellent and enjoyable. It contains works by Cezanne, Van Gogh, Pierre Bonnard and many others. This part of our museum trip was the best. The museum is very overheated inside and this prevented us from staying longer.",
          "Considering the admission of CHF 22 (for both the standing and temporary exhibits), there is very little here. Of course there are a few interesting pieces, but in general these are third-rate works, and not many of them at that. Instead of operating this disgrace to its",
          "Small but nice museum, small but nice exhibition of some great masters. I do recommend. The gift shop seems extraordinarily large. *Tip* there is no audio tour available for this show - only the permanent exhibits.",
          "Excellent museum,to be seen at sloe pace and appreciated for each piece of drawing,take a guide ,if you can appreciate the art than you will find time of two hours is also less.Visit only if you have spare time in your budget.",
          "Our 4 hours was insufficient to absorb the wonders of this gallery. While the entrance fee is quite high, the works displayed are wonderous, and the special exhibitions were interesting",
          "The museum has a very good collection of impressionist paintings. There was an impressionist exhibition on there when I visited. It is very centrally located, not far from the train station",
          "I think it was about 22ChF for entry and the current Russian exhibition. There was a fee ?10ChF even for the general museum. Having just been to London where the museums and art galleries are free and have, on the whole, better and larger exhibits , I think we were a little",
          "Although it is not as big as the Kunstmuseum in Basel, this museum holds quite a few masterpieces as well, including medieval paintings to modern ones. The permanent collection was not that extensive when I visited, since they were having an exhibit celebrating 100 years of",
          "When we visited the Art Museum, they had an absolutely spectacular exhibit about the art of the Russion revolution. This was something that one is unlikely to come across, and made a big impression on us. The other artwork is good, but more like one would expect in a national",
          "The museum always has attractive and surprising exhibitions next to their normal collection. A worthwhile visit when it is too hot or too cold or too rainy outside. Go for the Delaunay or the Kirchner or the Giacometti or the Malevich.",
          "A relatively small collection by international standards, but many many gems, especially the Impressionist works. We especially enjoyed the upstairs section of Ancient Art and the explanatory films",
          "Nice way to spend a few hours in Bern. Nice collection of Swiss and European art. Impressionist and Modern. An eclectic mix.",
          "I was actually a bit disappointed by this museum because there were like three exhibits, if I remember correctly. I was under the impression they had a lot more artwork from a larger variety of movements but I spent like 20 minutes searching around for a room I may have missed",
          "This museum has a good collection of Swiss art along with some international art, including Van Gogh and Picasso. There was an exhibition on Russian art when I was there. The museum is easy to get to and is covered by the Swiss travel pass.",
          "The museum is located near the station. They often have additional exhibitions (which cost extra to see) and, in the case of the Russian paintings, split with the Paul Klee museum. It's a shame to split a collection especially when there is such a distance between the two hosts.",
          "If you want to spend two hours on a good art museum, this is a good place to visit. They cover art from medieval religious works (I think good, but that period is not my main interest) to modern installations. I especially like the few, but exquisite works by e.g. Hodler,",
          "This is a very good museum with contents from medieval to modern arts, although some medieval and Renaissance material is in the Historical Museum. The contents are well displayed. The rooms are quiet. Labels are sparse but the museum staff has put books in English and German",
          "I love my art so I couldn't pass up the opportunity to visit the Kunstmuseum in Bern. The permanent exhibition was interesting but not as good as that available in Solothurn.",
          "Not very expensive. Nice audioguide. The permanent collection includes local artists, including some by Klee, and impressionists, including some nice Picassos, as well as some modern art, including Rothko. Afterwards walk across the bridge nearby for a nice view of the Alps.",
          "Although the permanent collection is small, it's worth going to see if you love art. They have many different pieces from famous artists like Picasso and Kandinsky. They also have older pieces in the basement from the Early Italian Renaissance. I thought it was great and really",
          "Although this free, there was a talk going on so we could not see all the exhibition. Renoir, Dali, Rodin all there but we could not see it all and were not told",
          "A great collection of weapons, paintings and Egyptian artifacts. And a great little cafe/restaurant downstairs for a (very large) salad and beer!",
          "This museum is one to see in your life with a good permanent exhibition. And some very good ideas for temporary exhibition. A place to see",
          "Wonderful museum, worth to see. There were so many contemporary works. It is a pity that it was impossible to take a photo.",
          "We enjoyed 2 hours here - they had a funky special exhibition on \"Chinese whispers\" using many modalities of art and a effecting group of works by female Mexican artists. The Picasso / Renoir / Matisse etc were a little disappointing. There was also a room with sketching a by a",
          "One of my reasons for visiting Bern was to see the exhibition \"Modern Masters: Degenerate Art at the Museum of Fine Arts Berne\". I wasn't disappointed. Located in Bern's city center, the museum was a short walk from my hotel. Admission for this exhibition was 12 Swiss francs. A",
          "This is an expensive museum where one is charged a different amount for each Special exhibit We went to the special exhibit on degenerate art . It was interesting but very little information is in English The permanent collection is very small with no much of real interest One",
          "If you don't know swiss artists like Hodler, Giacometti (both), Anker, Segantini, B\u00f6cklin, it is worth having a look at the collection. Of course there are other world-class artists too and a good medieval section. There are always interesting exhibitions going on too.",
          "This Museum is interesting in that you will see alot of History as to how Switzerland was created. One Interesting exhibition that I found a display of Famous People were Swiss Citizens once upon a Time. Interesting and Free if you have the SWISS PASS.",
          "This is a lovely gallery. They have some fine pieces in their own right in an attractive setting, but we also visited the Modern Masters 'Degenerate' exhibition which runs until August 2016. This is well worth a visit. We paid 18.00CHF each to get in to this plus the rest of the",
          "The Chinese Whispers exhibition showcases some of the most socially relevant contemporary art from China in the past decade. Through the artwork and the audioguide which offers great interpretation, you could understand the range of pressing problems faced by the Chinese",
          "the exhibition Chinese Whispers in the Zentrum Paul Klee is only a part of the story, as the Museum of Fine Arts (Kunstmuseum) houses another part, accessible with the same ticket (i.e. no additional entrance fee). While in Klee, the video art is really exiting, here they show",
          "Since the XVIth century, China has exported \"chinoiseries\" to suit Western taste. This collection is the latest example. The catalogue is a splendid example of International Arts English - a vast gyre of sloshing buzzwords,or if you prefer, chow mein. There is more than a whiff",
          "Whilst the gallery itself & the permanent collection is free to enter (bravo Bern!) the specially-staged exhibitions must be paid for...fair enough! Currently there's a must-see..Chinese Whispers. The internationally respected Swiss collector Uli Sigg has donated a very large",
          "The standing exhibition was reduced in size as new exhibitions were being prepared. However there were some of my favourite artists such as Braque, L\u00e9ger, Delauney, Picasso and Chagall on show as well as a beautiful Paul Klee Ad Parnassum (1832). Ferdinand Hodler 1853-1918 The",
          "The Museum of Fine Arts Bern (German: Kunstmuseum Bern), established in 1879 in Bern, is the oldest art museum in Switzerland with a permanent collection. The collection of works from the middle of the 19th century onward is of international significance. High points are",
          "Last time it was a little part of the Stefanini (Winterthur) collection, this time the last minutes of a rich Toulouse-Lautrec exhibit. A long and somewhat tiring activity can be interrupted in their modern but very expensive bar (a poor green tea for 5CHF).One can also go",
          "As an art lover, I enjoyed this museum quite a bit. It has a smaller collection highlighting famous Swiss artists such as Klee, Hodler and Giacometti, as well as art from elsewhere in Europe. There were some lovely impressionist paintings, and as there isn't a large crowd you",
          "For a museum that isn't as well known as some of the other museums in Europe, I found it surprisingly good. Besides several paintings by Switzerland's finest artist Ferdinand Hodler, it contained at least one good painting by other well-known artists. Other artists included",
          "Look at this picture. It says it all. This terribly scuffed floor at Berne's Fine Arts Museum is 2 feet from the Mondrian and 1 yard from the Rothko. I asked the guard how long it has been like that and was told with a shoulder shrug it had been this way for a year or so, but",
          "Great modern art that you can see up close with no interfering glass or other barriers, plus historical art (of less interest to me.) After this there are a lot of nearby places you can go, like seeing the outside of Beyer's old gallery across the street, or the paper museum",
          "The best art museum in Zurich is worth the city that hosts it. The museum permanent collections host a fine selection of works of artists like Giacometti, Chagall, Kokoshka, Matisse, Picasso, Modigliani, Rodin. Modern European art (from the Impressionists to the 1940s) is the",
          "I found this museum disappointing for a number of reasons. Currently two of their major paintings are on loan; the Van Gogh and the E. Manet and there is no signage to indicate this. When you have paintings of this caliber gone and the museum is small, I believe you have an",
          "Was an ideal place to go on a very hot day. Interesting exhibition on Crystals some more Klee pictures but the space felt underused.",
          "This is a very small museum, but with a very special collection. First, you have to know: - it is expensive considering the size. If you decide to go fot it, pay for the collection AND the exhibitions (22.-). It will be extra expensive, but the exhibitions are nice, and since",
          "The museum has an eclectic collection, big on Swiss Expressionists/modernists, but also unexpected well-known impressionist offerings. The type to make you wonder how it was you did not know THAT famous painting lived here!",
          "I really enjoyed the Max Gubler art exhibition in this nice museum close to the Berne train station. The museum is not very big but there are always interesting exhibitions on. The staff is very frienly and I like the nice postcard selection.",
          "Really enjoyed the visit. The audio guide was excellent as was the lady selling the tickets who gave us details of the exhibition.",
          "This is a museum of art with substance; very good collection and fantastic exhibitions. Not a daunting visit, as it is not too big. Nice cafe and bookshop. Essential visit when in Bern.",
          "Out of the many museums I have visited throughout Europe, the Kunstmuseum is one of the smallest. Spread out over three floors and several extra exhibit rooms, the collection has pieces from several famous artists to include Picasso, Paul Klee, Cezanne, and Pollack. Each",
          "When going to Bern, take the time for a stroll thru the museum. Middle-age artists on one floor, however, paintings of Van Gogh, Picasso, Paul Klee, Cezanne, and others on another floor. Plus a couple of local folks (August Gaul and Martin Lauterburg) who are worth-while",
          "I liked the Hodler's and the 1890 to 1930 collection they have. Some fine impressionists too. Very central location.",
          "Plenty of early nineteenth century and early 20th century works from the usual suspects: Picasso, Chagall, Monet, Rodin, Renoir, Degas etc. also the newer works from: Kandinsky, Pollock, Klee. They had a special retrospective for the Italian artist Giacometti which wan nice",
          "This museum is pretty small. We have two well behaved kids but we were followed from room to room by an attendant who obviously felt they were going to get their felt-tips out and draw on the works of art. I couldn't wait to leave.we were going to eat at the cafe but the menu",
          "The museum is walking distance from the main train station, around 6-7 mins. Admission fee is 7CHF, lockers are provided in the basement, need a 2CHF coin to operate, the coin will be return. No photos are allowed, bottles of water must be stored in the lockers. The collection",
          "First of all I really dislike encountering works on art on white walls. They're sterile and detract from the colour of the paintings. However, on the top floor there is a very fine collection of Hoedler, Kandinsky, and many other later 19th and early 20th century painters. On",
          "It wasn't hard to find this museum walking from the main tourist center of Berne. It's not as big and with as many pieces as I thought. It might not be worth the entrance price unless you are a big art fan wanting to see some of the masterpieces. I got in for free with the Swiss",
          "Lots of masterpieces, too bad you have to look for them among lesser art. Do not miss the old masters (Angelico, Botticelli,...) in the basement.",
          "Great museum of Paul Klee works. The building is something to be seen as well. If you're big into other modern art, you will likely see other things you like as well. We're not big modern art people, but we did like the Klee exhibits.",
          "We went 'over the bridge' to find this museum and couldn't find it even though it was right there in front of us on the map. The building was so small, we didn't realize it was a museum! We went on a weekday and it wasn't open, so honestly- we did not get to go inside, but it",
          "We spent about two hours just looking at the wonderful art. Go there it's great. And free. A t the time we visited there was an exhibition of Artist Anker. Holder. Segantini.",
          "The museum is located near the train station. It is rather small but it's good to spend some hours there. They have a nice mix of internationally renowned art (Van Gogh, Coubet) and Swiss art (Paul Klee, Ferdinand Hodler, Adolf Dietrich). The only drawback is a very small and",
          "10.1.14 Kunst Museum Bern What a joy. Such a range of wonderful paintings by many of my favourite artists such as L\u00e9ger, Marc, Gris, Chagall, Kandinsky and of course Klee but also introduced us to some unfamiliar and fascinating artists such as Alexej von Jawlensky, Louis Ren\u00e9",
          "Kunst Museum delighted us by the fact that it was open on the first of January when everything else was closed. The collection of old masters is rather limited, yet there are memorable works, like \u201cLesende Frau\u201d by Felix Vallotton. We were lucky to see a great photo exhibition.",
          "This is the largest museum in Bern, featuring some paintings, sculptures and works on paper. This museum has everything in it, which about the history of Switzerland. The museum is opened till evening, so it is important it before gets close. We found several interesting things",
          "Interesting museum with many things to see.Worths a visit. It is included in the swiss pass. I reccomend it to people who like art.",
          "We went when they were open on a Tuesday night. There was very few people so we had the museum to ourselves. Great art from all the famous European artists. Hire an audio guide to get the history of the various paintings. Cleanest toilets in Europe and they were free!",
          "If you are into modern art and if you wanna see some really nice paintings from Miro, Picasso, Monet, Manet, Renoir, Van Gogh, etc.. and some Bernese painters; definitely go and see the Museum of Fine Arts. There are also exhibitions which are quite interesting. Entrance fees",
          "We passed 2 hours there and we enjoyed to see the peintures of Picasso, Miro, Monet and so many other artists. The visit in the permanent collection costs 7 chf and you should visit the cafe in the first floor...A real must!",
          "I paid my entrance fee for the permanent exhibition and asked for an audio guide, there was none. I asked for a leaflet on where to find what, there was none. I looked around and couldn't really see where to start, or if there was a logical order of visit. After asking twice I",
          "Two exhibitions when we went (Dec. 2012)--\"itten-klee\" and \"Meryl's Sparks.\" Very special and a learning experience. Very informative booklets (multiple languages available) for each room. Take a pleasant break in the nice caf\u00e9, by the way.",
          "This collection is housed according to themes rather than chronology which makes for interesting companions hanging side by side! We found this a refreshing approach and enjoyed it; others may not! There are some excellent works of art here; you just have to find them!!",
          "As we had bought a Swiss Saver Pass, we got in free. This is Switzerland's oldest museum with over 3000 paintings and sculptures. The works range from the Middle Ages to Contemporary art. There was a particularly fine Bieler exhibition on when we visited. We had a light lunch in",
          "Interesting collection, a lot of well known artists and good paintings. Open until 21h on tuesdays which allows you to go later (usually museum closes at 17h).",
          "This three story museum overlooking the Aare river in Bern has a many and varied collection, currently featuring some of the artwork of the author Hermann Hesse. After an hour or so of perusing the collection one is rewarded with some 15 or so really fine works of masters. I",
          "We had free enterance with the Swiss pass We do not know a lot about Swiss art and walked quickly through the permanent displays. The museum had an exibition of art work by Ernest Bi\u00e9ler called \u201cDreamt Reality\u201d. We did not know him but decided to go see the exibition. We loved",
          "The museum is large, but somewhat chaotical inside. The exhibition halls are mixed up and you have to check constantly whether you are in the permanent exhibition hall or looking at the temporary exhibition. The permanent exhibition is poor and scarce, made up for the most part",
          "The Kunstmuseum in Bern holds a collection of international renown and is well worthy of any visitor's attention. The art and paintings range from fourteenth century to present and the permanent collection is arranged in a very interesting manner. Galleries feature thematic"

        "wiki": "Bern [b\u025brn] (listen) (Alemannic German: B\u00e4rn [b\u0325\u00e6\u02d0rn]; French: Berne [b\u025b\u0281n] (listen); Italian: Berna [\u02c8b\u025brna]; Romansh: Berna [\u02c8b\u025brn\u0250] (listen)) is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their \"federal city\", in German Bundesstadt, French ville f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, and Italian citt\u00e0 federale. With a population of about 140,000 (as of 2019), Bern is the fifth-most populous city in Switzerland. The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014. The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000. Bern is also the capital of the canton of Bern, the second-most populous of Switzerland's cantons.\nThe official language in Bern is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the most-spoken language is an Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Bernese German.\nIn 1983, the historic old town (in German: Altstadt) in the centre of Bern became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe etymology of the name \"Bern\" is uncertain. According to the local legend, based on folk etymology, Berchtold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen, the founder of the city of Bern, vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt, and this turned out to be a bear. It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona, which at the time was known as Bern in Middle High German. As a result of the finding of the Bern zinc tablet in the 1980s, it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin, possibly *berna \"cleft\". The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of Bern from at least the 1220s. The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the B\u00e4rengraben dates to the 1440s.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nNo archaeological evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today\u2032s city centre prior to the 12th century has been found so far. In antiquity, a Celtic oppidum stood on the Engehalbinsel (peninsula) north of Bern, fortified since the second century BC (late La T\u00e8ne period), thought to be one of the 12 oppida of the Helvetii mentioned by Caesar. During the Roman era, a Gallo-Roman vicus was on the same site. The Bern zinc tablet has the name Brenodor (\"dwelling of Breno\"). In the Early Middle Ages, a settlement in B\u00fcmpliz, now a city district of Bern, was some 4 km (2 mi) from the medieval city.\nThe medieval city is a foundation of the Z\u00e4hringer ruling family, which rose to power in Upper Burgundy in the 12th century. According to 14th-century historiography (Cronica de Berno, 1309), Bern was founded in 1191 by Berthold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen.\nIn 1218, after Berthold died without an heir, Bern was made a free imperial city by the Goldene Handfeste of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II.\n\n\n=== Old Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nIn 1353, Bern joined the Swiss Confederacy, becoming one of the eight cantons of the formative period of 1353 to 1481.\nBern invaded and conquered Aargau in 1415 and Vaud in 1536, as well as other smaller territories, thereby becoming the largest city-state north of the Alps; by the 18th century, it comprised most of what is today the canton of Bern and the canton of Vaud.\nThe city grew out towards the west of the boundaries of the peninsula formed by the river Aare. The Zytglogge tower marked the western boundary of the city from 1191 until 1256, when the K\u00e4figturm took over this role until 1345. It was, in turn, succeeded by the Christoffelturm (formerly located close to the site of the modern-day railway station) until 1622. During the time of the Thirty Years' War, two new fortifications \u2013 the so-called big and small Schanze (entrenchment) \u2013 were built to protect the whole area of the peninsula.\nAfter a major blaze in 1405, the city's original wooden buildings were gradually replaced by half-timbered houses and subsequently the sandstone buildings which came to be characteristic for the Old Town. Despite the waves of pestilence that hit Europe in the 14th century, the city continued to grow, mainly due to immigration from the surrounding countryside.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nBern was occupied by French troops in 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars, when it was stripped of parts of its territories. It regained control of the Bernese Oberland in 1802, and following the Congress of Vienna of 1814, it newly acquired the Bernese Jura. At this time, it once again became the largest canton of the Confederacy as it stood during the Restoration and until the secession of the canton of Jura in 1979.\nBern was made the Federal City (seat of the Federal Assembly) within the new Swiss federal state in 1848.\nA number of congresses of the socialist First and Second Internationals were held in Bern, particularly during World War I when Switzerland was neutral; see Bern International.\nThe city's population rose from about 5,000 in the 15th century to about 12,000 by 1800 and to above 60,000 by 1900, passing the 100,000 mark during the 1920s.\nPopulation peaked during the 1960s at 165,000 and has since decreased slightly, to below 130,000 by 2000.\nAs of September 2017, the resident population stood at 142,349, of which 100,000 were Swiss citizens and 42,349 (31%) resident foreigners. A further estimated 350,000 people live in the immediate urban agglomeration.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBern lies on the Swiss plateau in the canton of Bern, slightly west of the centre of Switzerland and 20 km (12 mi) north of the Bernese Alps. The countryside around Bern was formed by glaciers during the most recent ice age. The two mountains closest to Bern are Gurten with a height of 864 m (2,835 ft) and Bantiger with a height of 947 m (3,107 ft). The site of the old observatory in Bern is the point of origin of the CH1903 coordinate system at 46\u00b057\u203208.66\u2033N 7\u00b026\u203222.50\u2033E.\nThe city was originally built on a hilly peninsula surrounded by the river Aare, but outgrew natural boundaries by the 19th century. A number of bridges have been built to allow the city to expand beyond the Aare.\nBern is built on very uneven ground. An elevation difference of up to 60 metres exists between the inner city districts on the Aare (Matte, Marzili) and the higher ones (Kirchenfeld, L\u00e4nggasse).\nBern has an area, as of 2009, of 51.62 km2 (19.93 sq mi). Of this area, 9.79 km2 (3.78 sq mi) or 19.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 17.33 km2 (6.69 sq mi) or 33.6% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 23.25 km2 (8.98 sq mi) or 45.0% is settled (buildings or roads), 1.06 km2 (0.41 sq mi) or 2.1% is either rivers or lakes, and 0.16 km2 (0.062 sq mi) or 0.3% is unproductive land.Of the developed area of Bern, 3.6% consists of industrial buildings, 21.7% housing and other buildings, and 12.6% is devoted to transport infrastructure. Power and water infrastructure, as well as other special developed areas, made up 1.1% of the city, while another 6.0% consists of parks, green belts, and sports fields.\nOf Bern's total land area, 32.8% is heavily forested. Of the agricultural land, 14.3% is used for growing crops and 4.0% is designated to be used as pasture. Local rivers and streams provide all the water in the municipality.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification, Bern has a humid continental climate (Dfb) closely bordering on an oceanic climate (Cfb).\nThe closest weather station near Bern is located in the municipality of Zollikofen, about 5 kilometres (3 mi) north of the city centre. The warmest month for Bern is July, with a daily mean temperature of 18.3 \u00b0C (64.9 \u00b0F), and a daily maximum temperature of 24.3 \u00b0C (75.7 \u00b0F). The highest temperature recorded at Bern / Zollikofen is 37.0 \u00b0C (98.6 \u00b0F), recorded in August 2003. On average, a temperature of 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) or above is recorded 40.7 days per year, and 6 days per year with a temperature of 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) or above at Zollikofen, and the warmest day reaches an average of 32.1 \u00b0C (89.8 \u00b0F).There are 103.7 days of air frost, and 22.3 ice days per year at Bern (Zollikofen) for the period of 1981\u20132010, as well as 14.1 days of snowfall, 36.7 days of snow cover per year and the average amount of snow measured per year is 52.6 centimetres (20.7 in). On average, January is the coldest month, with a daily mean temperature of \u22120.4 \u00b0C (31.3 \u00b0F), and a daily minimum temperature of \u22123.6 \u00b0C (25.5 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature ever recorded at Bern (Zollikofen) was \u221223.0 \u00b0C (\u22129.4 \u00b0F), recorded in February 1929, and typically the coldest temperature of the year reaches an average of \u221212.8 \u00b0C (9.0 \u00b0F) for the period of 1981\u20132010.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nThe municipality is administratively subdivided into six districts (Stadtteile), each of which consists of several quarters (Quartiere).\n\n\n=== Government ===\n\nThe Municipal Council (de: Gemeinderat, fr: conseil municipal) constitutes the executive government of the City of Bern and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of five councillors (German: Gemeinderat/-r\u00e4tin, French: conseiller/conseill\u00e8re municipal(e)), each presiding over a directorate (de: Direktion, fr: direction) comprising several departments and bureaus. The president of the executive department acts as mayor (de: Stadtpr\u00e4sident, fr: Le Maire). In the mandate period 2017\u20132020 (Legislatur) the Municipal Council is presided by Stadtpr\u00e4sident Alec von Graffenried. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the City Council are carried by the Municipal Council. The regular election of the Municipal Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. Any resident of Bern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. Contrary to most other municipalities, the executive government in Berne is selected by means of a system of Proporz. The mayor is elected as such as well by public election while the heads of the other directorates are assigned by the collegiate. The executive body holds its meetings in the Erlacherhof, built by architect Albrecht St\u00fcrler after 1747.As of 2017, Bern's Municipal Council is made up of two representatives of the SP (Social Democratic Party), and one each of CVP (Christian Democratic Party), GFL (Gr\u00fcne Freie Liste a.k.a. Green Free List, who is the newly elected mayor since 2017), and GB (Green Alliance of Berne), giving the left parties a very strong majority of four out of five seats. The last regular election was held on 27 November 2016/15 January 2017.\n\nDr. J\u00fcrg Wichtermann is State Chronicler (Staatsschreiber) since 2008. He has been elected by the collegiate.\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\nThe City Council (de: Stadtrat, fr: Conseil de ville) holds legislative power. It is made up of 80 members, with elections held every four years. The City Council decrees regulations and by-laws that are executed by the Municipal Council and the administration. The delegates are selected by means of a system of proportional representation.\nThe sessions of the City Council are public. Unlike members of the Municipal Council, members of the City Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Bern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the City Council. The parliament holds its meetings in the Stadthaus (Town Hall).The last regular election of the City Council was held on 27 November 2016 for the mandate period (German: Legislatur, French: la l\u00e9gislature) from 2017 to 2020. Currently the City Council consist of 24 members of the Social Democratic Party (SP/PS) including 2 members of the junior party JUSO, 9 Green Alliance of Berne (GB), 9 The Liberals (FDP/PLR), 9 Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC), 8 Gr\u00fcne Freie Liste (GFL) (Green Free List), 8 Green Liberal Party (glp/pvl) including one member of its junior party jglp, 3 Conservative Democratic Party (BDP/PBD), 2 Christian Democratic People's Party (CVP/PDC), 2 Evangelical People's Party (EVP/PEV), 2 Junge Alternative (JA!) (or Young Alternatives), 2 Alternative Linke Bern (AL), 1 Gr\u00fcne Partei Bern \u2013 Demokratische Alternative (GPB-DA) (or Green Party Bern \u2013 Democratic Alternative), and 1 Swiss Party of Labour (PdA).\nThe following parties combine their parliamentary power in parliamentary groups (German: Fraktion(en)): AL and GPB-DA and PdA (4), SP and JUSO (24), GB and JA! (11), GFL and EVP (10), glp und jglp (8), BDP and CVP (5), FDP (9), and SVP (9).

It also has an impressive 15th century Gothic cathedral, the M\u00fcnster, and a 15th-century town hall. Thanks to 6 kilometres (4 miles) of arcades, the old town boasts one of the longest covered shopping promenades in Europe.\nSince the 16th century, the city has had a bear pit, the B\u00e4rengraben, at the far end of the Nydeggbr\u00fccke to house its heraldic animals.

Nearly all the 16th-century fountains, except the Z\u00e4hringer fountain, which was created by Hans Hiltbrand, are the work of the Fribourg master Hans Gieng. One of the more interesting fountains is the Kindlifresserbrunnen (Bernese German: Child Eater Fountain), which is claimed to represent a Jew, the Greek god Chronos, or a Fastnacht figure meant to frighten disobedient children.Bern's most recent sight is the set of fountains in front of the Federal Palace.

          "I had to wain in Bern for 3 hrs for my next train, so I went here because it was close to the train station, around 10 min walking (something like that..). It is very small, but I enjoyed the sight. Very good to relax and walk around a little if you have a long wait it in Bern.",

          "We spent most of the day at the Botanical Garden, which is lovely. There are outdoor and indoor exhibits, and a nice variety of blooming plants and trees. Trees and plants are helpfully identified, and there's a wonderful path that parallels the Aare River. If you're looking",

        "wiki": "Bern [b\u025brn] (listen) (Alemannic German: B\u00e4rn [b\u0325\u00e6\u02d0rn]; French: Berne [b\u025b\u0281n] (listen); Italian: Berna [\u02c8b\u025brna]; Romansh: Berna [\u02c8b\u025brn\u0250] (listen)) is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their \"federal city\", in German Bundesstadt, French ville f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, and Italian citt\u00e0 federale. With a population of about 140,000 (as of 2019), Bern is the fifth-most populous city in Switzerland. The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014. The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000. Bern is also the capital of the canton of Bern, the second-most populous of Switzerland's cantons.\nThe official language in Bern is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the most-spoken language is an Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Bernese German.\nIn 1983, the historic old town (in German: Altstadt) in the centre of Bern became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe etymology of the name \"Bern\" is uncertain. According to the local legend, based on folk etymology, Berchtold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen, the founder of the city of Bern, vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt, and this turned out to be a bear. It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona, which at the time was known as Bern in Middle High German. As a result of the finding of the Bern zinc tablet in the 1980s, it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin, possibly *berna \"cleft\". The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of Bern from at least the 1220s. The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the B\u00e4rengraben dates to the 1440s.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nNo archaeological evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today\u2032s city centre prior to the 12th century has been found so far. In antiquity, a Celtic oppidum stood on the Engehalbinsel (peninsula) north of Bern, fortified since the second century BC (late La T\u00e8ne period), thought to be one of the 12 oppida of the Helvetii mentioned by Caesar. During the Roman era, a Gallo-Roman vicus was on the same site. The Bern zinc tablet has the name Brenodor (\"dwelling of Breno\"). In the Early Middle Ages, a settlement in B\u00fcmpliz, now a city district of Bern, was some 4 km (2 mi) from the medieval city.\nThe medieval city is a foundation of the Z\u00e4hringer ruling family, which rose to power in Upper Burgundy in the 12th century. According to 14th-century historiography (Cronica de Berno, 1309), Bern was founded in 1191 by Berthold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen.\nIn 1218, after Berthold died without an heir, Bern was made a free imperial city by the Goldene Handfeste of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II.\n\n\n=== Old Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nIn 1353, Bern joined the Swiss Confederacy, becoming one of the eight cantons of the formative period of 1353 to 1481.\nBern invaded and conquered Aargau in 1415 and Vaud in 1536, as well as other smaller territories, thereby becoming the largest city-state north of the Alps; by the 18th century, it comprised most of what is today the canton of Bern and the canton of Vaud.\nThe city grew out towards the west of the boundaries of the peninsula formed by the river Aare. The Zytglogge tower marked the western boundary of the city from 1191 until 1256, when the K\u00e4figturm took over this role until 1345. It was, in turn, succeeded by the Christoffelturm (formerly located close to the site of the modern-day railway station) until 1622. During the time of the Thirty Years' War, two new fortifications \u2013 the so-called big and small Schanze (entrenchment) \u2013 were built to protect the whole area of the peninsula.\nAfter a major blaze in 1405, the city's original wooden buildings were gradually replaced by half-timbered houses and subsequently the sandstone buildings which came to be characteristic for the Old Town. Despite the waves of pestilence that hit Europe in the 14th century, the city continued to grow, mainly due to immigration from the surrounding countryside.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nBern was occupied by French troops in 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars, when it was stripped of parts of its territories. It regained control of the Bernese Oberland in 1802, and following the Congress of Vienna of 1814, it newly acquired the Bernese Jura. At this time, it once again became the largest canton of the Confederacy as it stood during the Restoration and until the secession of the canton of Jura in 1979.\nBern was made the Federal City (seat of the Federal Assembly) within the new Swiss federal state in 1848.\nA number of congresses of the socialist First and Second Internationals were held in Bern, particularly during World War I when Switzerland was neutral; see Bern International.\nThe city's population rose from about 5,000 in the 15th century to about 12,000 by 1800 and to above 60,000 by 1900, passing the 100,000 mark during the 1920s.\nPopulation peaked during the 1960s at 165,000 and has since decreased slightly, to below 130,000 by 2000.\nAs of September 2017, the resident population stood at 142,349, of which 100,000 were Swiss citizens and 42,349 (31%) resident foreigners. A further estimated 350,000 people live in the immediate urban agglomeration.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBern lies on the Swiss plateau in the canton of Bern, slightly west of the centre of Switzerland and 20 km (12 mi) north of the Bernese Alps. The countryside around Bern was formed by glaciers during the most recent ice age. The two mountains closest to Bern are Gurten with a height of 864 m (2,835 ft) and Bantiger with a height of 947 m (3,107 ft). The site of the old observatory in Bern is the point of origin of the CH1903 coordinate system at 46\u00b057\u203208.66\u2033N 7\u00b026\u203222.50\u2033E.\nThe city was originally built on a hilly peninsula surrounded by the river Aare, but outgrew natural boundaries by the 19th century. A number of bridges have been built to allow the city to expand beyond the Aare.\nBern is built on very uneven ground. An elevation difference of up to 60 metres exists between the inner city districts on the Aare (Matte, Marzili) and the higher ones (Kirchenfeld, L\u00e4nggasse).\nBern has an area, as of 2009, of 51.62 km2 (19.93 sq mi). Of this area, 9.79 km2 (3.78 sq mi) or 19.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 17.33 km2 (6.69 sq mi) or 33.6% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 23.25 km2 (8.98 sq mi) or 45.0% is settled (buildings or roads), 1.06 km2 (0.41 sq mi) or 2.1% is either rivers or lakes, and 0.16 km2 (0.062 sq mi) or 0.3% is unproductive land.Of the developed area of Bern, 3.6% consists of industrial buildings, 21.7% housing and other buildings, and 12.6% is devoted to transport infrastructure. Power and water infrastructure, as well as other special developed areas, made up 1.1% of the city, while another 6.0% consists of parks, green belts, and sports fields.\nOf Bern's total land area, 32.8% is heavily forested. Of the agricultural land, 14.3% is used for growing crops and 4.0% is designated to be used as pasture. Local rivers and streams provide all the water in the municipality.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification, Bern has a humid continental climate (Dfb) closely bordering on an oceanic climate (Cfb).\nThe closest weather station near Bern is located in the municipality of Zollikofen, about 5 kilometres (3 mi) north of the city centre. The warmest month for Bern is July, with a daily mean temperature of 18.3 \u00b0C (64.9 \u00b0F), and a daily maximum temperature of 24.3 \u00b0C (75.7 \u00b0F). The highest temperature recorded at Bern / Zollikofen is 37.0 \u00b0C (98.6 \u00b0F), recorded in August 2003. On average, a temperature of 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) or above is recorded 40.7 days per year, and 6 days per year with a temperature of 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) or above at Zollikofen, and the warmest day reaches an average of 32.1 \u00b0C (89.8 \u00b0F).There are 103.7 days of air frost, and 22.3 ice days per year at Bern (Zollikofen) for the period of 1981\u20132010, as well as 14.1 days of snowfall, 36.7 days of snow cover per year and the average amount of snow measured per year is 52.6 centimetres (20.7 in). On average, January is the coldest month, with a daily mean temperature of \u22120.4 \u00b0C (31.3 \u00b0F), and a daily minimum temperature of \u22123.6 \u00b0C (25.5 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature ever recorded at Bern (Zollikofen) was \u221223.0 \u00b0C (\u22129.4 \u00b0F), recorded in February 1929, and typically the coldest temperature of the year reaches an average of \u221212.8 \u00b0C (9.0 \u00b0F) for the period of 1981\u20132010.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nThe municipality is administratively subdivided into six districts (Stadtteile), each of which consists of several quarters (Quartiere).\n\n\n=== Government ===\n\nThe Municipal Council (de: Gemeinderat, fr: conseil municipal) constitutes the executive government of the City of Bern and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of five councillors (German: Gemeinderat/-r\u00e4tin, French: conseiller/conseill\u00e8re municipal(e)), each presiding over a directorate (de: Direktion, fr: direction) comprising several departments and bureaus. The president of the executive department acts as mayor (de: Stadtpr\u00e4sident, fr: Le Maire). In the mandate period 2017\u20132020 (Legislatur) the Municipal Council is presided by Stadtpr\u00e4sident Alec von Graffenried. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the City Council are carried by the Municipal Council. The regular election of the Municipal Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. Any resident of Bern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. Contrary to most other municipalities, the executive government in Berne is selected by means of a system of Proporz. The mayor is elected as such as well by public election while the heads of the other directorates are assigned by the collegiate. The executive body holds its meetings in the Erlacherhof, built by architect Albrecht St\u00fcrler after 1747.As of 2017, Bern's Municipal Council is made up of two representatives of the SP (Social Democratic Party), and one each of CVP (Christian Democratic Party), GFL (Gr\u00fcne Freie Liste a.k.a. Green Free List, who is the newly elected mayor since 2017), and GB (Green Alliance of Berne), giving the left parties a very strong majority of four out of five seats. The last regular election was held on 27 November 2016/15 January 2017.\n\nDr. J\u00fcrg Wichtermann is State Chronicler (Staatsschreiber) since 2008. He has been elected by the collegiate.\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\nThe City Council (de: Stadtrat, fr: Conseil de ville) holds legislative power. It is made up of 80 members, with elections held every four years. The City Council decrees regulations and by-laws that are executed by the Municipal Council and the administration. The delegates are selected by means of a system of proportional representation.\nThe sessions of the City Council are public. Unlike members of the Municipal Council, members of the City Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Bern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the City Council. The parliament holds its meetings in the Stadthaus (Town Hall).The last regular election of the City Council was held on 27 November 2016 for the mandate period (German: Legislatur, French: la l\u00e9gislature) from 2017 to 2020. Currently the City Council consist of 24 members of the Social Democratic Party (SP/PS) including 2 members of the junior party JUSO, 9 Green Alliance of Berne (GB), 9 The Liberals (FDP/PLR), 9 Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC), 8 Gr\u00fcne Freie Liste (GFL) (Green Free List), 8 Green Liberal Party (glp/pvl) including one member of its junior party jglp, 3 Conservative Democratic Party (BDP/PBD), 2 Christian Democratic People's Party (CVP/PDC), 2 Evangelical People's Party (EVP/PEV), 2 Junge Alternative (JA!) (or Young Alternatives), 2 Alternative Linke Bern (AL), 1 Gr\u00fcne Partei Bern \u2013 Demokratische Alternative (GPB-DA) (or Green Party Bern \u2013 Democratic Alternative), and 1 Swiss Party of Labour (PdA).\nThe following parties combine their parliamentary power in parliamentary groups (German: Fraktion(en)): AL and GPB-DA and PdA (4), SP and JUSO (24), GB and JA! (11), GFL and EVP (10), glp und jglp (8), BDP and CVP (5), FDP (9), and SVP (9). This gives the left parties an absolute majority of 49 seats.\n\n\n=== National elections ===\n\n\n==== National Council ====\nIn the 2019 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the PS which received 28.7% (-5.6) of the vote.

        "wiki": "Bern [b\u025brn] (listen) (Alemannic German: B\u00e4rn [b\u0325\u00e6\u02d0rn]; French: Berne [b\u025b\u0281n] (listen); Italian: Berna [\u02c8b\u025brna]; Romansh: Berna [\u02c8b\u025brn\u0250] (listen)) is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their \"federal city\", in German Bundesstadt, French ville f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, and Italian citt\u00e0 federale. With a population of about 140,000 (as of 2019), Bern is the fifth-most populous city in Switzerland. The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014. The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000. Bern is also the capital of the canton of Bern, the second-most populous of Switzerland's cantons.\nThe official language in Bern is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the most-spoken language is an Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Bernese German.\nIn 1983, the historic old town (in German: Altstadt) in the centre of Bern became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe etymology of the name \"Bern\" is uncertain. According to the local legend, based on folk etymology, Berchtold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen, the founder of the city of Bern, vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt, and this turned out to be a bear. It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona, which at the time was known as Bern in Middle High German. As a result of the finding of the Bern zinc tablet in the 1980s, it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin, possibly *berna \"cleft\". The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of Bern from at least the 1220s. The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the B\u00e4rengraben dates to the 1440s.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nNo archaeological evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today\u2032s city centre prior to the 12th century has been found so far. In antiquity, a Celtic oppidum stood on the Engehalbinsel (peninsula) north of Bern, fortified since the second century BC (late La T\u00e8ne period), thought to be one of the 12 oppida of the Helvetii mentioned by Caesar. During the Roman era, a Gallo-Roman vicus was on the same site. The Bern zinc tablet has the name Brenodor (\"dwelling of Breno\"). In the Early Middle Ages, a settlement in B\u00fcmpliz, now a city district of Bern, was some 4 km (2 mi) from the medieval city.\nThe medieval city is a foundation of the Z\u00e4hringer ruling family, which rose to power in Upper Burgundy in the 12th century. According to 14th-century historiography (Cronica de Berno, 1309), Bern was founded in 1191 by Berthold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen.\nIn 1218, after Berthold died without an heir, Bern was made a free imperial city by the Goldene Handfeste of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II.\n\n\n=== Old Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nIn 1353, Bern joined the Swiss Confederacy, becoming one of the eight cantons of the formative period of 1353 to 1481.\nBern invaded and conquered Aargau in 1415 and Vaud in 1536, as well as other smaller territories, thereby becoming the largest city-state north of the Alps; by the 18th century, it comprised most of what is today the canton of Bern and the canton of Vaud.\nThe city grew out towards the west of the boundaries of the peninsula formed by the river Aare. The Zytglogge tower marked the western boundary of the city from 1191 until 1256, when the K\u00e4figturm took over this role until 1345. It was, in turn, succeeded by the Christoffelturm (formerly located close to the site of the modern-day railway station) until 1622. During the time of the Thirty Years' War, two new fortifications \u2013 the so-called big and small Schanze (entrenchment) \u2013 were built to protect the whole area of the peninsula.\nAfter a major blaze in 1405, the city's original wooden buildings were gradually replaced by half-timbered houses and subsequently the sandstone buildings which came to be characteristic for the Old Town. Despite the waves of pestilence that hit Europe in the 14th century, the city continued to grow, mainly due to immigration from the surrounding countryside.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nBern was occupied by French troops in 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars, when it was stripped of parts of its territories. It regained control of the Bernese Oberland in 1802, and following the Congress of Vienna of 1814, it newly acquired the Bernese Jura. At this time, it once again became the largest canton of the Confederacy as it stood during the Restoration and until the secession of the canton of Jura in 1979.\nBern was made the Federal City (seat of the Federal Assembly) within the new Swiss federal state in 1848.\nA number of congresses of the socialist First and Second Internationals were held in Bern, particularly during World War I when Switzerland was neutral; see Bern International.\nThe city's population rose from about 5,000 in the 15th century to about 12,000 by 1800 and to above 60,000 by 1900, passing the 100,000 mark during the 1920s.\nPopulation peaked during the 1960s at 165,000 and has since decreased slightly, to below 130,000 by 2000.\nAs of September 2017, the resident population stood at 142,349, of which 100,000 were Swiss citizens and 42,349 (31%) resident foreigners.

The countryside around Bern was formed by glaciers during the most recent ice age. The two mountains closest to Bern are Gurten with a height of 864 m (2,835 ft) and Bantiger with a height of 947 m (3,107 ft). The site of the old observatory in Bern is the point of origin of the CH1903 coordinate system at 46\u00b057\u203208.66\u2033N 7\u00b026\u203222.50\u2033E.\nThe city was originally built on a hilly peninsula surrounded by the river Aare, but outgrew natural boundaries by the 19th century. A number of bridges have been built to allow the city to expand beyond the Aare.\nBern is built on very uneven ground. An elevation difference of up to 60 metres exists between the inner city districts on the Aare (Matte, Marzili) and the higher ones (Kirchenfeld, L\u00e4nggasse).\nBern has an area, as of 2009, of 51.62 km2 (19.93 sq mi).

          "I visited the Barenpark in December 2019. I guess I forgot the basic rule that bears hibernate in the winter. It was raining a lot and there were no bears. I managed to read the outdoor exhibit and information about the bears. I suppose this place is a lot better in the",
          "If you google map B\u00e4renPark and B\u00e4rengraben, the B\u00e4renPark is placed at the zoo. I visited the B\u00e4renPark next to the tourist information and the B\u00e4rengraben (the bear pit) which cannot be found specifically on TripAdvisor, but which seems to be the place where other reviewers",
          "I visit it during winter, I was told the Bears were hibernating, so it wasn't available to see them, but the location is great to walk up a little bit and get a view of the old city with the river and the bridge.",
          "After not visiting the bear pit for over 20 years, it is wonderful to see that the bears now has a 6000 square meter park to roam around with the wonderful location by the Aare. The bears can still choose to be in the bear pit as the two areas are connected by a tunnel.",
          "Yesterday we visited Bern and after passing through the old town we reached the bear park, where we did not see bears since they hibernated for the autumn and winter. The park itself is sufficiently large, has pits and pools, but as others mentioned bears should be free and not",
          "This is a usual park next to a river. The only exception is there are bears in which I could see two. They are lonely and I can't understand why people keep the bears in such an environment. They better live in nature.",
          "We were surprised, and a little dismayed, to see bears back in the bear pits again. They have such a lovely, proper outdoor area to be in, why do they need to be in the \u2018medieval\u2019 bear pits?? We did ask, and were told, that they were only there for 1/2 an hour... I\u2019m sure",
          "The bear pit was cool! It overlooked the old town and river which was beautiful! The old custom houses on bridge where interesting",
          "Wife and I visited Bern recently, wow what a beautiful place, located at the lower end of old town, in the river was Barenpark, this park was beautifully set out with 3 grizzly bears located in fenced area. Was awesome to see these bears up close and personal, well worth the",
          "Don\u2019t miss it at the entrance of Bern, a very special park with bears! Just by the river Aar, in a beautiful setting, in the trees, you can see the big bear or even 2, walking eating and sleeping.",
          "This is a hilly, grassy park with good views of brown bears. There is a water area for them to swim and a tunnel to walk through to get to a large pit.",
          "There's 3 and you can see them pretty close up! It's free and they're the emblem of Bern. Also the tourist centre is right there and you can buy a parking card for cheap for 24 hours for all blue street parking. Saved us big time.",
          "As it was quite hot and sunny, the bears were mostly hiding in the bush, but we still managed to see two of them. Although staying on the top made the view of bears a bit far, it was fun to see them.",
          "We walked through the old city from Bern train station to the park. It took us about 30min as we stopped along the way to take picture of the famous clock tower & many, many historic fountains. When we reach the park, the scenic views of the town lifts us up! Today all the 3",
          "It was good to see the old concrete pit bear enclosure and compare it to the much more extensive, wooded and much more natural modern enclosure. We saw two of the three bears, and lots of tourists!!! Obviously a must see sight for many visitors, and certainly a unique experience",
          "great place to visit as you can get close to Bears in their natural habitat free to visit and a good place for children and adults alike",
          "Seeing the real live symbol of Bern, Bear, alongside the fabulous Aare River at the foot of the super Old City main street was the highlight of Bern and Switzerland for me. That said, I was concerned upon watching the bears in Barenpark from the bridge repeatedly wander",
          "Did not enjoy this at all. 3 bears confined in a small space. One of the bears got very distressed wanting to go inside but couldn't because the doors were closed. I am no animal expert but could tell the bears were unhappy. They should be freed and back in the wild. I was",
          "I can\u2019t deny that being able to see bears like this is surprising. And of course we understand why with the bear being the emblem of the town of Bern. But we probably went to the wrong \u2018bear pit\u2019 because I had read how big and spacious the \u2018new\u2019 bear pit was, by the river. And",
          "This is a pleasant riverside park near the old city along the riverside, which provides beautiful views of the Bern city. There is a Bear Pit where visitors can enjoy watching some actions of the adorable bears. Bear has been the symbol of Bern with the local legend which",
          "It is great that this is a free activity !! it is fun to just watch the bears , they seem to come out at all various times, it is easy to access, is there are lots of places to watch it does not get too crowded. we went at 11:30 and all three bears were in the top Pit, this",
          "This is a bear park that's located along the riverfront of Bern. Something children would enjoying watching whilst others will enjoy relaxing down by the river front.",
          "We thought this was a necessity to see one of the famous Bern Bears. We were slightly underwhelmed with the buildings themselves but the scenery and surroundings soon made up for this. We did spot the bears and walked the local paths down to the river. It was nice to visit but",
          "It was fun to see some bears so close to the city, but do keep your expectations low! The contrast between the old \"hole\" and their new habitat is much more interesting, and quite an eye opener!",
          "Oh this is the pride of Bern and again, one of the places always abuzz with people. I just love watching the dainty Aare flow beneath and the view of Bern from here is magnificent.",
          "We had set aside quite some time for this but in reality we were there about 10 minutes tops. As you walk towards the old town there are literally bears down to the side of the road. It's good that you don't have to pay to see or anything but this would be a pleasant 5 minute",
          "I liked the idea that their food is hidden, so they have to hunt around for it. That gives them something to do, rather than simply eating. They seem happy and content. I'm not a big fan of captive animals, but they seem happy.....",
          "The B\u00e4rengraben (the bear grave, or bear pit, or bear park), an easy-to-find park, comes in two parts: one, the original concrete/stone enclosure for the bears to your left, and a more recent, forested environment to your right, which you overlook from a height. Applause to",
          "For some reason we were not really expecting to see any bears, but there they were (well two we could find), going about their business in the undergrowth and flopping around in the water, oblivious to the crowds and looking very contented. They certainly looked in excellent",
          "If you do nothing else you need to make this a priority, it is so unique and different to anything I've seen in the UK. Well worth a visit to go and see, you will enjoy it as well as the scenery.",
          "Visited there during our stay in Bern. Like the way the bears are kept in their natural setting, very accessible friendly and nicely maintained.",
          "This is a must see. The bears are so cute. We watched them play in the water for the longest time. They are such a symbol of Bern that it\u2019s an experience that I recommend everyone should take in.",
          "The place itsself is charming, located right by the beautiful river of Bern. When we were there however there was just one bear present. The attraction is for free. It's worth to go there anyway, because of the beauty of the area.",
          "The original pit at the entrance to the park looks a bit sad and an uninviting first impression for tourists. Not sure if the bears still use this area. Take a walk down to the river front and hopefully you will see them swimming - as I did.",
          "This was a nice beautiful park along the river. However, we were there because we wanted to see the bears. We saw only one bear hidden under the shade of trees only for a minute.",
          "The bears - all three of them - were out and frolicking on the day we visited. It must have been feeding time as there were lots of tomatoes in the center enclosure. Loved watching them! Beautiful views of the city.",
          "We went because it was in line with the other things we\u2019d come to see. Saw the bears (who seemed fine, noting other reviewers concerns). The bus stop is on the corner, there\u2019s some fantastic views from the free park, and an inclinator for those who don\u2019t want to do the steep",
          "Take bus no 12 from the main train station to reach here. It's a cool place to hand out or picnic when you visit Bern. The Bear family is so happy with all the place they have for themselves.",
          "had heard the bears were kept in tiny, dank places ... so didn't have our hopes up. wrong, it is a good sized place on the slope of a hill by the river. the bears have worn some paths from side to side of the enclosure and could sometimes be seen walking along them. day we",
          "Despite some trepidation about bears being kept in captivity, we were pleasantly surprised by the very large enclosure with a mix if habitats alongside the river where the three bears live. We visited twice and were lucky to see all three although for most of the time they",
          "There is a lot of information on the history of bears in Bern, it is clear how the two are linked and why the bear is the symbol of Bern. This is different from other zoos in that the enclosures are built on slopes or are pits made of stone. Only saw one bear. It's a few",
          "Great views of the city over the river Interesting bear facts The lift to The river bank is wonderful. Bears sleeping on our visit",
          "After a walk through the old town, you will arrive at the Barenpark. Trying to look for the bears but they were no where in sight. After a while , we heard children shouting and we guessed they might have found the bears. Yes, they were sleeping under the tree. How adorable.",
          "It is a nice, sunny place with cafes and restaurants, perfect for spending some time with children. However, the bears are caged in an area and probably stressed terribly by the noise and burning sun...",
          "Must do when you are in Bern, children obviously love it as do adults alike. We were lucky enough to see the three bears wandering around, eating and drinking. I think its a better view down the bottom near the lake. The \"Bear keeper\" I dont know what else to call the man",
          "Title says it al... Quite spacious and bears could find shelters but overall the location didn\u2019t seem a great natural environment for these animals...",
          "It was March at the end of the hibernation season and three bears came out to play. Lots to see as they wandered round their park by the river, scratched, rolled and sniffed. Very sweet. My favourite sight in Bern.",
          "Bern's mascot is the bear, which you'll see on flags, buildings and fountains throughout the city. You can get a glimpse of the living mascots Ursina, Bjork and Finn from the view point at the end of the Nydeggbrucke bridge. Here they roam freely in an open air fenced hillside",
          "Bears are the symbol of the city of Bern and a great attraction for tourists. These animals are kept in a nice area on the side of the river Aar. During summertime they also have a splash in the artificial pool beside the river. It's easy to spot them eating, swimming, or",
          "A lovely vantage point to take in the breathtaking views of the old town. Especially on a sunny day, seems like you can see for miles.",
          "Bears have made their home in Berne since 1857; in 2009 they moved into the new and spacious Bear Park.",
          "Yes it is winter yet we still saw a bear!! I can not remember the name but it was awesome!! She came out and got some beautiful sun. It is a great place on the river",
          "The quickest access from the heart of the city would be to take Tram #12 from the main train station directly and exit at Barenpark. There are several spacious areas and pins that the bears are on display with room to roam. Go down to the Barengraben and learn the history of",
          "wonderful view! wished that we could have seen the bears but in winter the bears are sleeping. great to go after a snow as the view is beautiful.",
          "After driving for a while and made the kids anxious to meet the bears, We parked the car to the side of the road and waited for the bears to come out When it suddenly hit me, I remembered it's winter and I would have to wait for long time for the bears to make up... It paid",
          "The Bear is prominent in the insigna of Bern. But poor bears that live in Bern. 3 bears living on a spot and thousands of people are watching them. I\u2019m sure that taken good care of the bears, but I do feel a bit uncomfortable when I see so many people staring at these animals.",
          "My husband and I enjoyed strolling along the water looking for the bears. It\u2019s a scenic and lovely sight. We actually spotted the bears on our way out of the park... as we turned and stopped at a little bridge .. there they were in an obscure corner of the park! Smart bears!",
          "We stopped for lunch at the Old Tram Depot and afterwards stopped to watch the bears. It can get pretty crowded if all the bears are out. They can also be seen along the river and in the water if they are released into that pen. We were lucky enough to see them playing in",
          "Walk down the road well past Einstein's house and you will see the beautiful emerald colour river and the big brown bears. We were lucky to see one of them enjoying a bath!",

          "The bear park was great- a must see. The bears seemed happy enough so it was a pleasure to watch them play and swim in the sun. It is right on the river and free to the public and offers great views across to the cathedral and other sites.",
          "I found it quite uncommon to find in a city-center an area with live bears but that\u2019s it! It was nice to see them running between different areas.",
          "The bear is the \"mascot\" of Bern, so this little bear park right on the water is a cute place to visit while in Bern. It's also right on the water so it's a nice spot. Plus the beats are pretty close so you get to see them.",
          "Bern has always been the city of bears, and formerly hosted their bears in a medieval hole in the ground. It was sad to see the bears trapped in the hole. The city has created a great outdoor area along the river with several layers, trees, open space and access to water. You",
          "There isn't much to see, but I felt like I needed to see the bears if I was in Bern and they were easy to find. Historically, it's a great story to think bears have been there for as long as they have, so it was a fun, short stop on my walk up and down the Kramgrasse.",
          "They're just there chilling, living their best life in the old town of Switzerland's Federal capital. They go to sleep over the Winter so if you catch a glimpse of them before hibernation, recognise your luck. I'm a close neighbour and overall they're pretty quiet, tidy and keep",
          "Yep! We walked over to the Barenpark,and there really are real bears! Walking around and around. I guess their quarters are better than the old pits, but it still looked a little sad to me. But..Bears!!",
          "Visited many times but was recently lucky enough to see the bears from very close. Definitely a must see if you happen to be in Bern. Also awesome for the kids.",

          "My friend had been to the bear pit years ago and thought we should see it during our morning in Bern. The bear were not in the pit. Then we saw them in the adjacent hilly park. I was expecting cute black bears. We saw brown bears instead. The are the same species as my Montana",
          "It is truly a cool experience to see bears in the middle of the city. Really exciting and the bears gave us a show by play fighting and growling. I really hope they are being well taken care of!",
          "This is a pretty sizable enclosure for the bears and they have plenty of room to walk around. It\u2019s really cool to see big live bears in the middle of the city but you can\u2019t help but feel sorry for the, being in captivity.",
          "Free admission to see the old small bear pit that was scraped to allow for more space for the bears the city keeps on display. Easy to find. It\u2019s also an easy walk from the city centre, or take the number 12 bus.",
          "Just so cool to see this park in the city. A definite must see! A little walk down to the river provides a great view of the bears!",
          "This is a small bear enclosure where you can see them from the top or from the river's edge. This park is at the foot of the hill that will lead you to the Rose garden. Its free and a good place to rest and relax and have an ice cream from Eiswerkstatt. Its also at a tram stop.",
          "The bears are in a spacious enclosure and wander happily around. The best view is from the Nydeggbrucke. The enclosure gives them plenty of room and they seem very happy and content. Easy walking distance from the city centre and there is a trolley bus from outside the railway",
          "It really isn\u2019t out of the way to go see the bears. You can walk around the city and get there easily. I walked from my hotel by the train station, passing through the old town in the early evening around 5 PM. I saw one bear in a bush and another one was walking around. It",
          "You've got to go see these bears. They're really big, and fun to watch playing and relaxing in their pools.",
          "Fun park that is historical! The bears were very active when I was visiting - climbing on the rocks in their enclosure. Good for a short visit and a photo opportunity. This is located on the far end of the city center by the Aare River.",
          "Was greatly surprised by the small size of the Bear Park. There were 3 bears on the day we visited and although the enclosure was easily accessible, it was somewhat of a disappointment to see these bears in such a small area. There was a nice view point from the upper area",
          "This review is late but I just wanted to say how amazing the park was and to see the bears interact with each other and the public. It was raining really bad the day my husband and l visited the park.",
          "We stopped in to see the bears as we walked into the old town of Bern from our parking spot. I must say that it really is unbearable....and the area around the sleeping quarters really is grizzly. You might even say that the bears were having a Kodiak moment. No, in all",
          "I don't have a problem with zoos, because I know how much zoos contribute to knowledge and conservation. I'm harder pressed to argue in favour of the Bear Park, where the bears seem to be simply kept because of tradition. True, their enclosure is new adn spacious. Whether",
          "I understand that Bern has a history with bears but, still, it is heartbreaking to see this three bears live in such a small place. I visited in July, and the heat was very high, I do not think it\u2019s going to revert (climate change), so I would advice to transfer the bears to the",
          "This is an ok thing to see if you have not seen bears before. They are in a small enclosed area. Being from the Seattle we are use to seeing bears in the mountains all the time.",
          "If you are going to keep wild animals in captivity, ensuring their habitat is as natural is possible is a great improvement on the old circular pit (which can still be seen next to the new enclosure). By getting there nice and early (approx 8.30am) it was possible to catch a",
          "We were a youth group of 6 teens and 4 adults. Visited the old bear pits, stopped at the very clean free bathrooms, then had our packed lunch on the shady bleacher style steps between the bear park and the river. There is a free funicular/elevator for people with mobility",
          "This popular tourist attraction has bears in their riverside habitat. They are kept here because Bern is named after bears. So their namesake and history is tied to bears.",
          "Another free activity in Bern. While it was a little sad to see the bears in an enclosure, they did have a reasonable amount of space with access to the river and some woodland. The bears themselves looked healthy, and the facilities nearby were of a good standard.",
          "We first visited over 20 years ago and the improvements that have been made to the bears\u2019 enclosure were great to see. We felt a bit sad first time we saw it but they now have so much space and we got to see them swimming too. Lovely place to wander around.",
          "I do understand that the bear is the symbol for Bern, but I do not know whether its really nice for them to be limited to space in the middle of the city. I think they would be much happier in their natural habitat. Apart from that, I think the management has offered a lot of",
          "This was done well. The park is a bit smaller than I had thought it would be, but the bears honestly seemed very comfortable and happy. The walkway had many details about the bears, their lives, habits, and personal details. If you don;t see a bear there, the view is very",
          "I like bears. But not like this. These creatures deserve something better, something bigger, something more natural. This is only a little better than your local zoo. This bear pit is for the comfort of the tourists not the bears. Where\u2019s P.E.T.A when you need them?",
          "The bear is a symbol for Bern so it was great to see a lovely open enclosure for the 3 brown bears. You can watch them from the area above and so not disturb them. They were walking beside the river area, resting under the trees , playing etc. It was great to see them so",
          "The bears got upgraded facilities a few years ago. They now have a great view, a bath and most importantly more space. The kids loved to see them. You get there by just following the main street (Marktgasse, later turns Kramgasse) and cross the Nydegg Bridge. In warm weather you",

          "The inclined elevator closes very early. Some of our family were not able to go down to view the bear park from alongside the river as the elevator had just ended service for the day. The enclosure for the bears is a nice facility.",
          "...but it really is just 3 bears in a zoo like atmosphere. But I can tell the city loves the idea and are proud so that\u2019s fine! Great walk along the river and beautiful view of the city from this park.",
          "What a lovely attraction and centrally placed. We saw the bears being allowed through to the feeding area on 2 occasions. The behaviour of the male bear knocking in the access door was rather worrying at first but he clearly knows when feeding time is. Often the bears disappear",
          "We went to Bern to see the old streets , was surprised to find the Bears . We first saw the old bear pits and felt that were a stark reminder of how they treated the Bears . It was a surprise to see the new enclosure which included different levels trees and a section of the",
          "Well, a bit frustrating going there and not seeing the bears, but I suppose we can't expect them to be always out and about.",
          "As you may read from the guide, Bears are symbols of the city and were kept in the pit from the 16th century or something. Since the city life and wild animals do not come together, in 2009 they were relocated to the place near the bridge in a special \"park\" which is more like a",
          "Since they upgraded from the old bear pit to this new enclosure, not much can be said a part of the fact that it is impressive and touching to see how much bernese people are attached to have the animals of their flag in their city !",
          "I was expecting a proper park where you could walk around and see the bears. What this really is is a bear enclosure next to the river where you can see three bears from afar if you're lucky. If you want to see bears, go to a zoo.",
          "Yes, bears are the city mascot and it\u2019s interesting to be able to see a few (3 I think) lumbering around a city park doing bear things. In a way it\u2019s kind of cool but I also question the limited amount of space these wild creatures have and whether it\u2019s right to confine them for",
          "The kids enjoyed watching the bears roaming around. It was a nice walk down to the river with picturesque views of the old town. We had a lovely dinner at the restaurant beside the park.",
          "I saw some bears. They are looked like happy bears. The bears have a great view of the city from their habitat, which must make them extra happy.",
          "This is a vast improvement on the old Barenpit where the bears were housed at least here they can stretch their legs, more for the bears than the visitor.",
          "Enjoying the fairy tale vibe of this city and what do we find...Bears, of course! Loved it, we saw beautiful bears, just wanted to check them out for a few min. but its hard not to just watch and watch and watch. They are magnificent! The park is wonderful and fun, you should",
          "We were fortunate the bears were out when we visited. After walking away to the Rose garden and came back, the bears had been let out to their \"pasture\" down by the river.",
          "We looked high and then we looked low but couldn\u2019t find any bears. There are large bushes for them to get out of the sun and the public eye. It was the middle of the day and rather hot, so they may have been sleeping. Wish I had been.",
          "Its a nice walk down through he 'Old Town' of Bern to the Bear Park. The Bear park itself is an excellent facility for the care of the cities bears. On the day we visited it was warm and sunny so the three bears we saw were out and about in the pens and seemed to be very well",
          "Had to go see the bears while in Bern and thought it was fun for about 5 minutes. Ended up watching them for about 30 minutes because of my wife. During the entire time one bear laid down in the grass and two others paced back and forth. I\u2019m not sure what I expected but it was",
          "The park is a fantastic piece of open space, that combines Bern\u2019s tradition of bears with the public open space of the city, through this beautiful green park that runs parallel to the river, and opens up to a linear stepped bank. The natural topography of the land creates two",
          "It's a beautiful location by the river. You can get a clear view from above, below and from the bridge. The bears looked happy and the park was very natural. The old bear put it still on display, the contrast is interesting. Worth a visit.",
          "The Bear Pits are an interesting stop. Since 1513 bears have been at home in Bern. The spacious bear park is worth the walk. The history of bears with Bern, makes this a special place.",
          "It was so unusual to see life bears in the city and they living on they own and they looking happy , and it was in the downtown! great place to come with kids. actually bear is an ancient symbol of the City",
          "OMG a bear pit! In the centre of a city!!!! One not too miss. Once you're there enjoy the fantastic views across the aare and over the city from the top terrace. Then take the stairs or lift down the bank to watch the bears frolicking in the water. Fantastic.",
          "The bear place is a cute place to watch bears in Bern city !. Never seen anything like this before. Its also a great place to take a walk around the river.",
          "When I was here in 1979, I thought there was something wrong about the bear pits. It didn't look like the bears belonged here. It wasn't natural. The current bear park is a huge upgrade. The bears have a LOT of room to roam and play and act like bears. If you're in Bern,",
          "The bears have a large very natural habitat along the Aare river. We saw bears on the top of the habitat and then took funicular down to river where we saw the, in the lower habitat. Great for kids",
          "This barenpark is a place you should visit if you visiting Bern. However winter/autumn isn't a good time as the bears were in hibernation. I went in january and it was a bit disapointing.",

          "Bern is supposed to have been named after the bears (one of the versions of the origin of its name). So a bear is the mascot of the city. I think it is really a good idea to actually keep bears in the city to show this connection. I would not approve if the animals were in a",
          "If you visit the City of Bern, you must go see the bears at the bear park, which is across the river from the old city. It is easy walking or take the #12 bus. The habitat is large, so you have to be patient to see the bears. A good photo-op.",
          "Three bears in the keep, and there is no entrance fee. Bring your zoom lens if you want to capture really good pictures of the bears.",
          "Intrigued by this, I learned a bit more. The Bear has been a symbol of the city of Bern for a long time. In the 12th century, a Duke went hunting in a nearby forest and decided to name his new city after the first animal he met on his hunting expedition. The party came across a",

          "The bears have a large area, they are in the bear pit in the morning and go to the area near the river in the afternoon. If you compare the size of this of this 'cage' compared to the ones I have often seen in zoos, this is the biggest living area for bears I have seen. The",
          "This is my city and i never get tired of coming here. You have a great view of the aare and just beside it is a restaurant where you can enjoy the view. Parking is around the corner. Not free though. But once you grab a beer in tramdepot walk down near the water and just enjoy",
          "This is a small park, in my opinion. Worth a quick visit just for a walk and to look at the bears. Nice view to the river.",
          "This park is situated in the D\u00e4hlh\u00f6lzli Tierpark and in a nice looking,well maintained habitat for bears. We saw two of the bears during our visit. It was spectacular to observe them from behind a glass wall in their pool while they were swimming and playing together. A must see",
          "I went to the Barenpark during a visit to Bern, when we first arrived the bears were in the small enclosure being fed. When I returned they were in the larger enclosure, there are three bears. The bears are only out between April and October, otherwise they remain in their den.",
          "My husband loves bears, we were very excited to visit and were not disappointed. A lovely spot to watch the bears roam around, eat and swim! The bears seem happy and have a nice amount of room to move around compared to most zoo enclosures. You can view the bears from the top,",

          "After seeing old Bern, with beautiful facades of buildings, nice wells and towers, and cross the bridge with an amazing view, what else can you wish but seeing some really bears playing. They have a nice landscape near the river, with shelters where they can hide, but there are",
          "Two beautiful bears in the center of Bern. The attraction is very followed. You can see bears from many locations",
          "This is where the city gets its name, fabulous pens with the bears enjoying their days wandering in their enclosures close to the river. well worth a visit.",
          "really nice: one can enjoy nature, view, sun, water and land. and yet so near to the busy center. the walk by the river is great and offers banks all along to sit and rest and enjoy",

          "It was winter so I couldn\u2019t see the bears but it\u2019s a great place to walk. I had a black vanilla ice cream that I didn\u2019t know it excited but it was great I\u2019ll post a photo so yo can see. They also have a restaurant and bar with lots of options and the food was great. They also",

          "I was pleasantly surprised to find that there are real bears here! I was expecting an old bear pit and sad stories about dancing bears in the 19th century. However, what I discovered was a large, modern space for three, very healthy and happy bears to live. I ended up spending",
          "Bern was founded in the late 12century and the first animal caught on the ruling duke\u2019s hunt was a bear so the city was named Bern and the black bear became the symbol of the new city. The first record of bears being kept in the city is from 1513. The bear park dates from 2009.",

          "We\u2019ve heard that bear enclosure has been expanded and went to visit the bears. It was a very sad experience. Indeed, there is more space available to the animals now but it does not change the fact that they are caged and look extremely unhappy. When we visited the bears",
          "The Bern bears were always a treat to see. Overall the space was quite large for the bears to roam and we enjoyed stopping by and seeing them on multiple days. They were often quite active and my daughter loved watching them.",
          "The bears were active even on the super hot day we were there. One bear took a swim in their little pool attached to the river. It was fun watching the bears roaming around their compound, surrounded by the beautiful, ancient walls of the city.",
          "I had to visit a couple of times to se the bears , they were either asleep in the wild bit or in the feeding area . Patience pays off and if you are lucky you will see the bears at play. Interesting to find out how bears are linked to Bern. Out of interest there is a bernese",
          "It takes some luck to get a good view of the bears, either in the original bear pit or in the expanded habitat along the river. Even with that, it's well worth walking to for the great views of the old town looking back across the river. There's also a handy elevator to get",

          "Was a bit worried to hear there were bears in the city, thought the enclosure would be small but it's bigger than they would probably get in any zoo and it looks well laid out. The bears are beautiful and look very healthy. There is a shop, restaurant lots of information points",

          "Nice place to enjoy a view on the city bears. The park is ok, but the location is amazing, right next to the river and below a nice restaurant which brews its own beers!",
          "I wasn't sure about keeping bears even though it is historic. Whilst they can't run free they do have a large area on the river bank to explore, have shade and water to cool off in. The park gives all their names and details and all around there are interesting facts about them.",

          "Very cute!! No price to pay so donations are recommended. The bears are very visible for the majority of the enclosure and a lift will take you from the top to the bottom to view the bears from a different angle. We did wonder if the enclosure is slightly small but I believe",
          "Interesting to see a mini-zoo exhibit on the hillside of a city, but unique to Bern. Read up on the history of why there are bears and enjoy checking them out from a variety of angles both on the same side of the river and opposing it.",
          "The enclosure for bears is well designed with lots of space, trees and pond. However, we spotted only 3 bears who didn't seem to be enjoying their artificial habitat. As a foreign tourist, I had expected a larger bear family. The bear statues have not been maintained at",

          "It is always a joy to see the family just across the bridge from the historic centre of Bern. They look so docile you would think you could pop down and give them a hug. Perhaps not. They are in good condition and there is plenty of shade for them in the warm weather.",
          "I was pleased to see the bears had plenty of room to live their lives but I was horrified at the old space where they had lived. Any animal lover would be horrified that the government have not filled in the old small bear pit. There are many good zoos around the world to see",
          "For years the bear (Bern is derived from bear according to local lore) at het entrance to the old town near the river was the main tourist draw and he was living in a very dismall bear pit, unworthy of a modern countrie's attitude to animal welfare. A couple of years ago the",
          "Basically if you are in Bern --you go see the bears while you are here. Easy parking but lots of tourists busses parked everywhere. Simply we saw 3 bears living in a protected habitat on a hill next to a beautiful river. Very scenic area. I can't imagine driving miles out of",
          "Most fun is if you can find the 3 bears and follow their actions for a while. They're not in the pits anymore, but there's an informative display in one of the original pits. Walk there from the downtown, or take the tram.",
          "I would rate this a 5 but in theory I have an issue about caged animals and being in a \"run\" effectively in the middle of a city, easily seen had me conflicted as I felt so sorry for them. However, given the area used to have bears everywhere and now the locals believe there",
          "All the tourists seem to go over the bridge to this part of the town; there is a bus stop also. Bern means bear, apparently, and the crest of the canton has the bear figure on it. There is a bear fountain right near the clock tower. So, there is a bear park and right beside it",
          "The bear park is at the end of the main street just over the bridge that runs through the old town. The bears seem to have a good environment to live and looked happy. It was a hot day and we saw a bear (Bjork?) lazing in the water and walking around looking for food. Also",
          "They really give the bears a ton of beautiful space to roam around. They can even go in the water if they want. The three or them were hanging out very close to where we were standing at the railing which was great. They also had a viewing of them being fed which was cool.",
          "The Barenpark has historic significance (the bear is on the Bern crest). Still, I cannot believe that the city does not display them in a more humane and dignified fashion.",
          "A free and fun exhibit to find all of the bears on display. Bears roam freely in a beautiful environment, have a fishing area and appear to be very comfortable. A tram is available to those who wish to observe the bears from different levels. There is a beautiful walk along the",
          "the poor bears i caged in this hill that looks like nature cage with much space, but does it make the situation better??!?!?! There are fences and the poor bears are caged no matter how space and food you give them. PLEASE FREE THEM!!!!",
          "Great views. Excellent food. Something for all the family. Dads know what i mean. They brew their own beer here and it is yummy.",
          "Since the bear is such an important symbol in Bern, it's really cool that they still have the bears here to see- you can look at their old cement enclosures behind- cool to see how far they have come. The exhibits are quite large and the bears were easy to see enjoying some deer",
          "We were lucky as it was feeding time when we Went down to the river. 2 of the Bears Went to the water to find their food.",
          "The bears used to be in the small bear pit and not closer to the river in a much bigger location with a much better habit . easy to watch , now nice to watch without thinking its a zoo",
          "There weren't a lot of bears, but it was fun to watch the few that were there. It's also a great spot to get some nice views of Bern and the river.",
          "Shocking that animals would be kept in a cement pit in this day and age. Upsetting to see and no entertainment or educational value whatsoever. Just dreadful.",
          "Nice attraction in Bern, conveniently located at the old city and easy to reach using city Tram. It was really nice to see the Bears at the natural surroundings. There should be several of them but we managed to see only one, which was out in the open. Area surrounding the bear",
          "So good to see these lovely creatures in a much better habitat than when we last visited some 10 years ago. Lovely location, nice to walk along the river and enjoy the scenery as well as the famous bears",
          "The bears are in a more natural environment, have fun near the water - the river is flowing through - and in the bushes",
          "In the heart of Bern, just off the bridge, this is a real attraction. He bears roam free in their big enclosure. We've seen then in the water and running about in the trees, etc. Great views for everyone. No formality and totally free of charge.",
          "Saw 3 of them. One was asleep & the other two were wrestling in the water. Was really interesting to see bears housed in a city. The enclosure is spacious and the bears look very well taken care of.",
          "A must visit on your tour though Bern. Bears, right in the center of town! Very cool experience and a beautiful habitat for them",
          "Of course they can't reach you :) . But at least you can see them not in a zoo, but in public and enjoy watching them taking bath.",
          "situated across the river, out side and at the apex of the hair pin loop of bern city, there is a bear park. the name of the city is after the bears and they bears are very respected in switzerland. even on the roads and water fountains you can see lots of bears wearing army",
          "An enjoyable outing for the whole family. There is some walking of stairs, but an elevator is available for use.",
          "If you are in Bern of course you must see the bears! It is so nice to see that they have more space than the pits from years ago. They are very easy to find if walking away from the famous clock in old Bern.",
          "There was one bear out when we went by. It's a fun stop at the end of the arcades. We very much enjoyed reading the history of the bears and seeing their \" new\" home.",
          "I went to see this place with a friend. It was ok. It's nice to see the bears but nothing special about it. You must be an animal lover or bear lover to enjoy watching them.",
          "Great view over the Aare river! Bears in a natural habitat, near the Rosen Garten. A great restaurant the Altes Tram Depot in near by.",
          "it is a park in the heart of Bern... where three bears live in..... poor bears!!! I understand it is a touristic place, I understand the legend that brought them here but it is unvelieveble. Free these bears! who cares about the legend?",
          "A big pro is that the bears aren't overly confined compared to other animal attractions. The bears just do what they like, usually sleeping. The park is located in a pretty spot for a walk around.",
          "This is a MUST visit when in town. DON'T Miss this one . . . . A very attractive Bear Park with great surroundings and fantastic view to the old part of Bern. Located right at the Aare River. Visit also the Altes Tramdepot behind (Brewery and Restaurant) they make their own",
          "This must be the top attraction in Bern. It is great to see the three bears back. They obviously have a busy life which they make up for by sleeping. They looked very comfortable in their surroundings. Walk along the river and see more of the old town.",
          "Sadly, the bears were not out in the Bear Park when my family visited one Saturday morning. The park, however was open and there was a lot to see. You can learn about how the bears were housed initially for around 350 years and of the tradition as to why the city of Bern keeps",
          "I accept that some people might not like the idea of captive bears but these bears have 5 star facilities!..it was really good to see them and made our trip to the beautiful city of Bern complete!",
          "The 'B\u00e4renpark' is completely free and beautifully located on the river Aare. So here's my tip for anyone visiting Bern on a budget (which is difficult because the city is expensive): On a sunny day, get yourself a packed lunch or take-away food and go down to the Barenpark. On",
          "Barenpark is the perfect place to start a tour of the Bern. Lots of tourist information here and papa, mama and baby bears. It is hard to pull oneself away from watching the bears. A short walk to the rose garden offers an overlook view of the Old Town. Definitely worth the",
          "The barenpark is a MASSIVE upgrade from its \"hole-in-the-ground\" predecessor! It's an absolutely gorgeous three tiered enclosure with lots of greenery for the bears and high visibility for us humans! It's clear that these wonderful animals are very well looked after by the",
          "We loved the city views of Bern from the Bear Park and fortunately for us as we were there early in the morning the Bears were active too.",
          "This free bear zoo in the middle of the city is just an awesome deal; HOWEVER, the BEARS are sleeping right now so don't expect that for now. The views of Bern are very nice from here. I would definitely visit here if it was Summer, Spring or Fall.",
          "It's a lovely little spot in the old town of Bern. It's kind of fun and amusing to see these bears. There is a little beer brewery for fresh beer located just behind the bear park. You have to try it out. Really good beer and very picturesque scenery.",
          "If the bears are outside, playing and having fun, it's amazing to see them! Very nice to get infos about bears.",
          "Dropped by barenpark, hoping to see the bears, but was told they are sleeping and would only come out in February! But the area have a scenic view, at least it was not a very wasted trip!",
          "Written on the notice board: the bears are sleeping. We went at around 2 o'clock. No bear coukd be seen. Only wooden bear sculptures for photo taking and kid bear area for visit ( no real bear, too). But the surrounding environment is so nice and picturesque, you could see the",
          "Unfortunately we were here in late November after the bears had been moved to their winter hibernation spot so there is little to see at the Bear Park. You can walk down to one of the bear pits and see a visual display of the history of the bears in Berne but that's about it.",
          "Bern - the city of bears Comparatively less famous than cities like Zurich or Geneva, Bern however is the capital of Switzerland. Historical and beautiful city with a B\u00e4rengarten where you can see bears. Fun fact: Originally a family of four, a bear was transferred elsewhere",
          "Great Bear-sightings. Area fully accessible with panoramic lift platform! Riverside view were also amazing.",
          "It is very close to the old part of Bern, hence easy to visit. Also wheelchair accessible with a lift. A great way to make a rather boring tour of the city worthwhile for young children. ;-) The fact, that the bears' cage is rather big (5000 square meters) made me feel a bit",
          "You will almost always see a bear in the bear pit. These are remembrances of time past when bears roamed through the area. There are always people here including tour groups. You look down into the \"pit\" to see the bears and also have a good view of the city from here",
          "Went to the Bern Bear park in Switzerland, at the time we were there the bears were enclosed in an area that was mainly concrete which I found to be quite sad as they had nothing to do. However I was informed that they could access an adjacent parkland through a tunnel that gave",
          "Bern is a relatively small city and Barenpark is one of the best 'landmarks' to visit while in town. You can take nice pictures by the river, on the bridge nearby or have a walk next to the water, bears and the sea lions. It is an enjoyable activity for everyone. I really liked",
          "A long time ago, I arrived in Bern by the night train in Summer and before going to my meeting, I went to visit the bears which Bern keeps since the middle age, I found them in a late 19th century zoo setting, now they are in a nearby park where they can either hide or watch",
          "Well worth the visit to see the big brown bears bathing, playing and sleeping - and free to see. Information centre and bar close by for refreshments and food. Across the road is Brasserie Barengraben - very nice for lunch or dinner.",
          "On top of the fact that it was seen in the James Bond film On Her Majestys Secret Service, it is just one of the coolest places Ive ever been. Located just outside the main city section of Bern, you can spend hours sitting and watching the adorable bears swim, play and roll in",
          "It's free and we had a great time. Just take the 12 bus or walk down the Main Street east across the river and they are on the river bank to your right directly after crossing the bridge.",
          "Baren...derived from \"bears\"... one of the most interesting locations in the town. First time I have seen live bears in the centre of the town. Had to go twice to see the bears. When I went in early March, the bears were nowhere to be seen...probably in hibernation. Had to go",
          "The Bear Pit is a justly famous part of Bern. At a very simple level, it is exactly what it claims to be: a large enclosure containing bears for the tourists to watch (or maybe a provider of tourists for the bears to watch). Totally free, too. Set on a steep bank by the River",
          "If you are in Bern, you just have to see them. It is a long walk from the train station, but I was glad we went.",
          "We were in the area, so took a look (at 2 bears in an enclosed park). But I would not suggest making a special trip to this place.",
          "Every tourist in bern must have to see bear park. Located directly on the Aare, with a great restaurant in the river.",
          "If you're not used to seeing large bears, this is a quick place to visit as you cross the bridge into town. The architecture of the old bear exhibit is interesting too.",
          "We were walking in old town and stumbled upon the bear park by the river. It was neat to watch the bears eating and playing in the water. There is a nice bar at the top as well.",
          "For any animal lovers, you will truly enjoy a trip to barenpark. The Bears were out swimming and eating their veggies when we were there a little before noon. Their habitat is right off the river and close to old town Bern.",
          "Never bored seeing these bears running, playing in water, climbing trees, do wrestling with his firends. It is located on the crystal green clear riverside! very nice feeling",
          "The bears look so nice and easy going at this viewer friendly sight. The ranger was there at the time and he had lots of good information. The Bears weigh about 350 kilos and they put on about 40 more to hibernate. Nice setting and we'll worth seeing.",
          "We were visiting Bern with friends who live in the area, and found this to be a neat surprise while exploring the old city of Bern. Bern gets its name because of a bear being spotted near the place the city was founded, so there's a bear park. There's binoculars to watch the",
          "As with all captive animals this was a little sad although the three bears do have access to water to swim in and some trees. The bears are moved into the original pit to feed and access to viewing them is excellent at this point. My husband noticed how the Bears place their",
          "Great that there is no charge to go around the Bear Pits. Lots of notices with details and facts (in English) about the bears. Nice to sit by the river.",
          "Barenpark (Bear park) is a very picturesque location to take in Bern's old town as well as a couple of bears who live on the slope of Aare river. Hence the name and a symbol of the city. The best part is it's free and perfect for children. In addition to the bears, be sure to",
          "Several bears are kept at the park. Visitors can view from two perspectives - eye level or above. The park is simple and pales in comparison to a good zoo.",
          "We almost walked past it and then we noticed a bear. It was truly amazing to find bears in the centre of a capital city. We enjoyed watching the bears in this impressive state of the art enclosure (totally free!) and the view of the city and river was also great. If you're in",
          "There are 3 bears here. It's free to see the bears in their bear park which is huge. You can get a glass lift to the bottom and back up. I was lucky enough to be at the bottom when they were getting fed. One of the bears really likes the attention and they all get",
          "Located by the river Aare, this is an interesting park on the side of a bluff. We almost missed the scene until my wife spotted a brown bear roaming around. We had to look twice to make sure what we were seeing \u201cwas a bear\u201d in Switzerland. The Old Town of Bern is famous for",
          "Like a mini-zoo right by the bridge. One of the bears was out and about so it is an interesting area to see before you cross the bridge in to the old section of town.",
          "It may seem a bit odd (putting it nicely) for visitors that the Bernese built a park for a few bears at a price at which other cities would build an entire zoo. But the people of Berne just absolutely love their bears. Much of the cost of construction was covered by voluntary",
          "We walked through old town to get to the park It was a beautiful day and we did see 2 bears roaming around There were lots of people so I,guess it's a must if you are in Bern",
          "This is related to where Bern reputedly got its name from [Bern/Bear]. Although you are not allowed to feed the Bears, children will love the sight of them.",
          "20 minutes walk from train station Quite interesting to be able to see bears roaming freely Lots of kids There is a restaurant with own brewery beer . Interesting but not a great attraction",
          "While walking to the Rosengarten we walked past the Barenpark. It would be a lovely places to take kids and it is also a lovely view of the old town. So if you want to have a free view of a bear it might be fun for kids.",
          "The Barenpark is located on the bank of the river Aare. It is a nice place, but don't expect it to be a huge attraction.",
          "Our Geneva hosts did not think the famous 'Bear Pit' still existed after civil sensitivities were expressed about such captivity. But, during a day in Bern we made our way down through the old town to the location of the Pit. When we saw a large crowd of people, camera in",
          "Bear is the symbol of Bern and the city has a special beautiful place for live bears just in center. Surprise!! Male and female bears live in open air park near the beautiful river and you can admire their live in almost free space. The name of park and place is Barenpark",
          "We visited the Bern bears this weekend and as the timing just happened to be just before feeding, we easily saw all 3 bears of the family. We also coincidently stood next to a gamekeeper who gave us a lot of fun facts, so all in all very enjoyable and informative. There is an",
          "It was a nice walk towards this park and then seeing the bears up close, we must have seen around 3 bears here, it was drizzling when we visited which added more fun to this visit.",
          "Sad to see the Bears cooped up, but lots better than it used to be. We did see two of the Bears, one big one not feeling well and a young one really enjoying carrots and playing on the hillside. Hardly any crowds when we stopped late afternoon..",
          "I was able to see only 3 bears in the whole park, I liked their elevator which went slanting down towards the bears in the water, the two bears in the water were fun to watch as they were continuously playing with each other, rest the park is well maintained but not worth",
          "The park is at the end of the old town near the Rosegarten. There are three bears here in a large compound.This is as close to bears as you can get. Personally,I dont like to see wild animals in captivity,but here they have a lot of space to wander around in.",
          "Whilst visiting Bern, I was surprised to see that you were able to see actual bears here. It's worth a visit to see how they are kept and it is part of the UN Heritage Site. There's two areas where the bears may be: The first is the bear pit. This is where they are fed so",
          "The Barengraben or Bear Pit is a small compound near the center of the city of bern. The Bear is the symbol of Bern, in in his honor the city built a beautiful little compound near the Aare river just across the Nydegg bridge. The pit is built on a slope ranging from the top of",
          "This was like a zoo for bears.This is probably the closest you will get.We made this our last stop and the fought the bus to train station",
          "We travelled as a family to Bern. Ate at the restaurant next to Barenpark based on a recommendation from our hotel. Best meal we had in 2 weeks of travels. Vegetarian burger was exceptional, beer was great.",

          "Yes, there is a bear pit with real bears right in the middle of Bern! I absolutely enjoyed watching the bears play in the enclosed pit. The view of the River Aare, the majestic bridge, and the colorful houses along the river is amazing! If time is on your side, take the elevator",
          "Soaking in the beautiful views and atmosphere of central Bern was just the beginning, the day we visited was a beautiful sunny day, the streets were quiet and atmosphere quaint. The historic Bearpark a real treat to see, the park itself is along the river, really green and the",

          "Enjoyed the walk along the river to see the Bears but were not overly impressed. There were 3 bears in the enclosure which was quite large but could have been better kept. The Bears were resting but one did move to the enjoyment of the children present. Great attraction for",

          "We walked across the river bridge and just seemed to drop upon the old bear pit. We sat looking over the river enjoying our picnic close to the new bear enclosure then we had the privilege of watching two of the Bears play fighting in their pool. They were so close to us and we",
          "Just across the bridge from the main road is a little park where a family of bears live at the side of the river. It's easy to miss.",
          "Saw three bears roaming around, swimming, basking in the sun. There is a free lift that can take you down to the water's edge to see the bears from below. Nice little break from walking the city.",
          "We enjoyed the bear park today with our 1.5 yr old. We only saw one bear, but their enclosure is quite lovely and large. We also had lunch at the restaurant there, it was tasty and reasonably priced. Continued on to old town afterwards.",
          "A free thing in Switzerland? The sad bear pit remains (it was home to the Bears until an upsetting 2009) but now the Bears have a flash riverside home with a funicular lift (for the visitors). You can park nearby for a couple of francs, but as you can also walk into the city",
          "It is across the bridge. And there are several Bears here. But most people come here to see the old town.",
          "Have been there a couple of times, love observing the bears. Often quite busy and buzzing which is rather nice too.",
          "It is much better now than wht it used to be! I am happy rhe city if Bern made this investment.It is reachable by bus in 10 min or just a 15 min walk from the main station. Once in while there are baby bears.I just love the view in the river Aare and you can visit the",
          "I love bears but care about animal welfare and so am always a bit conflicted, however the bears do have a decent amount of space with a good amount of enrichment and they did not seem distressed (I've seen some awful zoo's in Europe). Overall I would say it is a nice place to",
          "I was very excited to see the beautiful bears up close, and the scenery was absolutely breath taking.",
          "If in Bern don't miss it You can see bears in there habitat in the park take the angular lift down walk in the promenade enjoy the park Thou small it's a must see",
          "Is this really necessary? A small enclosure, at least it has some green areas, which must be terribly boring for the bears. And not much more interesting for their capturers Definitely not worth any special effort to visit",
          "I loved seeing the symbol of Bern, the Burmese Brown Bear. There were two who were very active in the enclosure by the river.",
          "It was nice seeing the bear in the park. There was only one when we visited. Free entrance. Took the lift (free) down to the river side walk and walked all the way to the Einstein Museum and the Museum of communication. Lovely peaceful walk.",
          "Are the bears there becaue Bern sounds like bear? I was quite surprised when I found the place while going to Rosengarten. I could spot 2 bears but they were sleeping. They for sure have more place for themselves than in a zoo but I dont know if it's enough. I wish I could",
          "For so many years the bears languished in their unforgiving, medieval pits, which, I doubt, few (people or bears) could have liked. Now the Bears have exemplary accommodation right next to the river Aare. And it's great to see.",
          "Good viewing from both the bridge and the quay. Fenicular elevator makes it easier to descend. Restaurant above gives good viewing of city skyline.",
          "The bears have been moved out of the dreadful pit they were kept in and have a little more room but it is still an appalling way to treat any animal. Send them to a proper animal sanctuary.",
          "It's hard to imagine a bear park in a city centre but this seems to work well. The Bears have lots of space, seem very relaxed and in great condition. The public love these bears and they watch them for ages. A great surprise",
          "Great tourist attraction and there's no charge to see the Bears! We were lucky to see all three bears in the park and I'd recommend it to anyone visiting Bern - it's a cute attraction to see.",
          "Be Aware in winter there are no bears, they sleep! But in summer sometimes they are very active, swimm, play, klimb, dig in the ground, walk around and sniff in the air. They are cute just to watch, and I know they are tempting...but they are wild animals and nowone should try",
          "Nice location, not far from old town. Bears have a very roomy place to live and their environment looks nice. Also a great view of old town from there. It's free!",
          "I was fortunate to see the bears doing a few laps of their pool and playing with their wooden log toys in the water. It was such a joy! And they weren't bothered a bit by us onlookers.",
          "I came 25 years ago when they were just in a pit... So nice now that they have space to roam. They do like to hide, beautiful riverside walk",
          "A good attraction for tourists.. Baren park .. The bears are lovely but They sleep a lot ..But we enjoyed the beautiful sunset scenery...",
          "I guess I missed the season for this famous park in the heart of bern. Bears are hiding in their dens for the season, but I did enjoy the walk along the river bank.",
          "We saw one of the Bears poke his head out, that was all. But you cannot visit Bern without coming here to where the original Bear pit was. The area is worth a visit, there is a terrace restaurant that is good for a drink overlooking the river. There is a walk along the river",
          "This is for animal's LOVERS - a great pleace where you can see with your eyes BEARS living free in harmony with the nature - remember that in winter is their's lethargy time of the y3ear",

          "I had been here as a kid and was sad for the Bears in the pit. Now they have space and light, trees and water. A relief ! And they do sleep in winter !",
          "Knew that the bears would be hibernating but was interested in seeing their domain. Must be wonderfu how they frolic by the river in spring and summer",
          "Located just across the bridge from Old Town this is easy to get to. As we visited in February the bears were hibernating however, could see where this would be a draw in the spring, summer and fall months. Lots of viewing locations to see the bears in various habitats. The",
          "The park is nice but if you want to go there to see the bear, it's too bad. There's only 2 bears there and they are sleeping all the times.",
          "The Barenpark can be quite simply and a normal bear park, but its proximity with the city and the Aar river turn it in a must visit place! The bears are very calm and very lovely! After visit them you can refresh yourself with the feet in the clean and fresh waters of the Aar!",
          "We went there in December but could not see bears as they were hibernating. Still there were a lot of tourists there looking at the empty bear park trying to get a glimpse of bears without success. The place is nicely done by the river. Suggest go there when bears are awake.",
          "Friendly staff. Great view. The bears are mainly sleeping, but they are real bears, dwelling in beautiful surroundings. Try the pork-sausage, sold within the premises, which is wonderful. Another plus to the Swiss capital!!!!",
          "I was bornd in Switzerland and Bern is a much much underestimated city. Much nicer then Zurich and easy to get around even if it rains. The former Coal passement in the houses are now unique shops. Just love Bern. Check out the days when they have farmers markets in front of the",
          "Beautiful park in an evocative place in the city. You can see the bear live and on-screen video. We will be back.",
          "If you are in Bern, take time and make a visit to the B\u00e4renpark in Bern! It's such a nice place to make a Walk, enjoy the nature and of course to see the Bears !! There you can also taste some great Beers at the restaurant Tramdepot !",
          "This is a small park but it has three live bears living there. We went in October and just saw one lying in the opening if he cave. They think dad is already hibernating. The park does have a nice view of the river and the city. You have to go down by the river usually to see",
          "The bear garden is at the far end of the city, though an easy walk from the city centre. The garden runs alongside the river that runs through Bern. You can view the Bears either from the riverside or from the higher point, having crossed over the bridge and viewing from near",
          "Currently there are 2 bears, and they are really cute! You also profit from a great view of the old city of Berne. A must!",
          "\"Bern\" coming from the name \"B\u00e4ren\" wich means Bears. Of course you have to have some Bears in Bern ! Really cute and funny Bears! You don't pay anything you have also a great view from Bern.",
          "Although I don't like captive animals, these would be worth visiting. The bears have a lot of place to walk around and you can walk around the whole cage.",
          "IF the bears are out, kids will get a kick out of it, but otherwise we go for the general scenery - the area is beautiful. It is a pretty small enclosure and like I said, I feel badly for the bears.",
          "This is a very nice place and a must see for all visitors. Living close if yust want to share that a the moment they are redoing the place very nicely, but it could be that in Summer 2015 there might some things be closed and the Bears are on vacation. But its a nice spot",
          "As the bears were moved away from the park, there were not much to see. Just a few statues of the bears and the bear garden.",
          "One of the main reasons for visiting Bern was to see the bears but the bern tourism office failed to let people know properly that the bear pit was being redeveloped ......",
          "The site has been closed for maintenance works and the bears have been relocated elsewhere. This is poorly announced and many confused visitors arrive at the location only to find empty bear pits. Before the renovation, the site was \"ok\" because I felt that the bears did not",
          "I visited Bern today, asked a few locals the way to see the bears and their directions were accurate and they happily helped me. However, when I got down to the part of the city where the bears live, I was greeted with a message from the bears that they are away on vacation",
          "I'm reviewing the Barengraben (\"bear pits\") in downtown Bern, and the \"Barenpark\" may be something different. I just couldn't find a listing directly for \"Barengraben.\" This unusual attraction lies along the river Aare right in downtown Bern. This famous tourist attraction is",
          "Went to see the Bears at Barenpark. Unfortunately for us but lucky for them, they are away for the summer\ud83d\ude1f, better luck next time.",
          "It is a delightful surprise to see bears as you visit the city. I know there is a discussion around if they should be there or free in the nature. I confess that, as a tourist, I enjoyed the visit and reading about each one\u00b4s life (yes, they have names and life summary",
          "We visited late at night, but as darkness falls it's harder to see. Next morning, we were up again, to catch them for their breakfast. Bears are put into the old smaller pen for feeding. So fun to watch them!",
          "I didn't know it is on construction. It is closed until Septemeber. There is nothing to see about bears. However, the view on the way of going there is awesome. Just walking there to see a beautigul view and going to Rose Garden;)",
          "Will be fantastic once bears return. Glad I knew not to expect them before I visited. The area is very nice however. Looking forward to a return visit.",
          "The bear were gone when i was there, transferrred to another cities, a bit disappointed, i guess if the bears were there, it's fun to have a look at them",
          "The Swiss Tourism is so Strong & Good that One can not expect any in correct Statement . Information from them. This was some time in July 2013. And at the \" I \" Information Centre at the Ben Railway Station ; we went for the Information on what to see in a day , there",
          "Crossing over a cannon like area on foot or car, look down to see where the bears live. It really wasn't all that exciting but fun to see them right in the middle of town, there were probably about 4 bears. You can cross a bridge over the river to see them on one side, then",
          "The Barenpark is the first place I have seen that has a number of bears on display publicly outside a zoo. It is free and at certain times of the day there and depending on the season, there are exhibitions where the bears do tricks! The Barengraben was also a nice way to see",
          "Loved the enclosure.Great to see they thought about all for the animals.Good to walk around and along the aare.Great for picknicks as well.",
          "The bear park is situated past the altstad over a bridge that offers an exquisite view of the river Aare. It seems bizarre to have a family of bears in a capital city but Bern is the antithesis of the typical capital city and somehow it doesn't seem out of place. The Bears stay",
          "Due to construction work the famous bears have been moved to another zoo in Vaud. Looks to be a pleasant area to walk around",
          "This promises to be an interesting attraction once it reopens and the bears return. Shame their temporary home was not in a place we had time to visit",
          "Went to this point but it is on the reconstruction and bears are not there... So wait till October or maybe earlier and try the zoo",
          "Where are my bears! The pit is closed at the moment for much needed renovations. I hope they make it much bigger for them. The bears are currently at a nature facility while maintenance continues. You can, however, visit the gift shop, walk along the river, and see the sheep",
          "The bears now have a nice hillside habitat. It's fun to watch them, and the view of the river is excellent. Just take the number 12 bus across the bridge and you're there!",
          "playful. fun to watch. standing up and play fighting. And right there in a public place, a bear pit. totally unexpected when walking past.",
          "I was not sure what to expect before visiting the Barenpark. I knew the history and was keen to understand how this translated into 2015. We saw three bears who live in a large enclosure just across the river from the old town. They seem to be well catered for...they certainly",
          "Made the trip to a city enjoyable for the kids. Whilst we admired the amazing buildings in this historic place we were able to promise the children we were walking to the bear park! It was odd to see bears in a city but they seemed to have lots of space by the river and it was a",
          "Having lived in Bern 25 years ago as a child I vividly remember the Bears in what is now the closed bear pit. Having just returned for the first time i was pleased on one hand to see the new bear park which is considerably bigger and gives the Bears more space, however",
          "Yep, I said it boring ! One bear and the area where they live is so small. I understand the importance of the bear for the city but honestly ok for 5 minutes to look at them before you head in the tourist information shop and that's about it.",
          "The three bears have a large, terraced, hilly home along the Aare River with a great view of Old City Bern. It was winter, so the bears were hibernating and not out and about.",
          "It's still a nice walk across the river with a quick stop off at the Bear Park even though the bears are hibernating. Stop here along your way up to the Rose Garden at the top of the hill for gorgeous views of Bern any time of year.",
          "Another popular and justly so with kids and adults. You are atop a valley with a secure railing while you can see many bears down under in their near to natural habitat. Its a endearing site to watch a baby bear or a family of them. Kids truly love this site. On a beautiful day",
          "Lovely situation just across the river from the end of the old town. Unfortunately the bears were in hibernation, so only empty bearpits and info boards. I'm sure its lovely when the bears are there.",
          "This is a nice small park with a few bears. River is great to dip tired feet. Located in a cool edge of he old town. Easy access from the city's transport hub.",
          "Always go when I'm in Bern. It's a nice spot - just on the edge of the old town, on the slopes by the river. It's free to see the bears (3-4 of them). They're indoors hibernating in winter, so don't waste your time until they're up. It's ok but nothing special - marked as very",
          "I was here in the winter/cold months. Stood here for a while waiting on the hibernating bears. Needless to say none of them came out(they have compartments kinda tucked against the hill), they don't when it's cold. Nevertheless, the idea of having an 'open zoo' in the middle of",
          "We visited the bear park but they are hibernating at the moment. Bear pit looks a bit sad, maybe that's why they hibernate for 7 months!!",
          "Although a nice area to visit, don't expect to see the bears in winter since they are hibernating in their enclosure. There is a short hike up the nearby hill opposite the Bear Park to get beautiful views of Bern but it was snowing heavily so that deterred us.",
          "If you want to see bears and discover everything about them, it is te place to go. It is free of charge in winter and you can learn a lot. Great with children.",
          "We decided to take a stroll thru this park since the been bear 's where in hibernation . It's a great workout especially if you take the stairs . You'll see plenty of ducks and natural scenery .",
          "Bern is a lovely town and I had a great visit there, but in so-called civilised Switzerland keeping bears in a polluted, noisy town-centre location to be ogled at from above by tourists is a deeply depressing sight. Surely nobody can possibly think this is a suitable habitat for",
          "Given they hibernate winter time locals said I was lucky to see a bear. Yes, if you go to a zoo or visit national parks in the States you'll see bears, but given this is Bern it is worth trying to see their bears. But bears or not if you have walked out of the city centre across",
          "In the past the bears had only a tiny pit where they could hardly move around, in recent years they have moved them to the side of the river where they have now a sort of \"playground\" with a small swimming pool. It is a big improvement for the bears -although I do not believe",
          "I have never seen a bear before so after hearing there is a bear enclosure on the river bank in Bern, I was a bit excited. But I visited Switzerland in November and of course bears hibernate so I didn't see any. Damn you sleepy bears. I can imagine it being a great in summer to",
          "I liked that there was a live-feed camera of the dens (base of the long stretch of concrete stairs) so that you could see the bears when they weren't out. But the images weren't too clear. Saw \"Bjork\" the bear at dusk/twilight (quite dark, well past sunset) come out and graze",
          "what would a visit to Bern be without seeing the famed Bear Pits that house the city's armorial animal, the brown bear. The Bear Pits were established in the 19th century, but it is well known that throughout history the city of Bern kept specimens of these animals as city",
          "There's a nice area with bear sculptures our children enjoyed. We didn't stay too long as it was late in the day. However, it was still quite crowded and the cafe was every busy.",
          "Really only bears pacing around an enclosure. Reminder of historic times. Not really worth seeing unless killing time or passing.",
          "Since the city of Bern is named after the animal \"Bear\", it is fitting that the city keeps a few bears in a bear park or \"bear pit\". It is located across the river from the old city. There is a souvenir shops and cafe nearby. We went because it was part of our tour.",
          "They have done an incredible job with the bear park. I mean first of all the fact that there is a bear park in the old town is amazing. The bears are always walking around and playing. There are a nice restaurant at the top or you can grab some ice cream and spend some time",
          "Nothing much except some brown bear there, a gift shop surrounded by the river. Relaxing walk from the town.",
          "Yes I do like bears so I was very excited to see them. The park has two section, a pit and a slope with river. You can see the bears eating fruits (apples, watermelons, etc), swimming and running around. I suppose you won't find any bears in winter because they will be",
          "I found this pain in my heart when saw the bears, surely they need more then few meters of play area open to everybody's eyes... Well so sad to me and I do not understand why... But on the other side, they claim they actually saved the bears from nature as orphans so they would",
          "I travelled in December 2013 and I was hoping I could see some bears. However, I went there in the morning and to my dismay there was not even one bear. One thing though, the views to the mirror the at that time, the clocks too rung with cheered me up. One tip, try not to go too",
          "Nice first stop after you get into Bern. Simply hop on tram 12. A trio of ambling bears in the evening, the bridge here is a nice backdrop for evening photos. Its great to run along the river in the morning too. Check out the brewery restaurant for a hearty meal.",
          "The famous Bears from Bern got a few years ago a very nice park, an attraction for the wohle family. A must !",
          "the bears looked happy, not bored. they had treats buried along the banks as well s scattered around. We watched them for an hour. They did not pace as if they were bored. They frolicked along the banks of the river and were happy to go into the pit in the late afternoon. Lovey",
          "The Bear Park is something that you must see, even if on a short visit to Bern. It's a lovely stroll through Old Town from the train station, and then across a beautiful bridge with the clear waters of the Aare river flowing below. The bears lounge on the hillside, so you can",
          "We had one of my business associates that was born in Bern, show us the attractions. This was one he said you should not miss. We loved it. Nice breeze on a hot summer day and many activities and views for people of all ages.",
          "The bears were playful and were just fun to watch. It is a cute area with a barrier where the bears and people can roam free to enjoy the scenery. The steps lead down to the river where you can sit with your feet in the fast flowing river.",
          "Just walking 200 meters you can enjoy several shops, restaurants, historical places, and everything with the traditional order and cool atmosphere of Switzerland.",
          "It's a free one species zoo. The bears seemed happy and healthy, but that's it - 3 bears in a big pit (or enclosure) doing what bears do in captivity. That's it.",
          "Enjoyed seeing the bears at the end of our old city walk. We did not take the stairs down for a closer look but they were fun to see.",
          "The bears are great, they are without doubt well cared for and have a good environment to play, swim and climb. Are they a suitable 21st century attraction? Perhaps not. I just kept feeling they would be happier in the wild where they belong.",
          "Definitely worth a visit when in Bern. It's lovely to see the bears strolling around a more natural environment and swimming in their river and gives a real sense of the importance of these creatures to the locals in the statues and flags seen around. It's totally free to stand",
          "As Canadians bears are nothing new but I still marvel at these massive giants and how amusing they can be.",
          "I saw the bears originally about 20 years ago when they were in a cement pit, which is right next to the new place. To the new place, I give kudos to the town for creating a more humane environment for the bears. As far as it really being an \"attraction\" I would say that it",
          "Until 2009, a small enclosure served as home to the four bears of Bern. After a concerted effort, and many donations, the large Bear Park was built on the hillside facing the Aare River. With significant foilage, acerage, and a swimming pool, the four bears of Bern are much",
          "it is situated in the old city of bern.originally the bears were kept in pits,n later with rules coming in another area adjacent to it was made for them .this newer area is bigger,has natural surroundings,n a cleaner more hospitable environment for the bears.it is adjacent to",
          "We had hoped to see more bears, but we only saw two. We felt that the overall experience was underwhelming, but easy to see on your way to visit the Rosengarten.",
          "There were only three bears, souvenir shop with toilet. The place was below of rose garden. The place should be good for rendezvous point but I could not spend long time to see only bears.",
          "We had read that the Bear Park had been renovated and the enclosures made bigger and more hospitable for the bears. But when we went there, there were still bears in the older enclosures and they looked quite small for such big creatures. The newer areas were bigger and more",
          "The bears here are happy in their environment. It's beautiful place to sit and relax and watch their antics. There are rangers around who are very informative. Many places around for a picnic. Parking can be tricky. Best times are early in the day. They usually have some",
          "Yes, there are bears here and yes, you will likely see them at play. Very cool to watch them splash around and forage. Their enclosure is right next to the Aare River, which is also neat to see.",
          "You see bears on just about everything in Bern, so though there isn't that much to it, I guess if you go to Bern you ought to go see the bears. The location is right at one of the old town of Bern and also quite close to the Rosengarten so you could make a nice afternoon either",
          "My twelve year old loved watching the bears (we came twice during our stay). There are three bears and we were fortunate enough to see them sleep, eat, swim and even wrestle a bit with eachother. It is an easy walk across the bridge from the Altstadt, and you can catch tram",
          "We had so much fun watching the bears at the Barenpark! The park is quite large and the three bears have lots of room to roam as well as swim. They were very active while we were there and one played with a coconut until he decided to crack it open and then carefully remove",
          "The 3 bears were cute but the park was slightly boring. Maybe kids would love it. It is a large open air enclosure, easy to get to via tram. They did have interesting facts on the bears around the park, other than that.. Nothing wow-worthy.",
          "it is very small park. and i'm so surprised that it has total 2 bears. Maybe due to history of this park and the donation/fund raising nature for this park, it's quite famous. but to be frank, nothing worth seeing here except the view oversigh old town.",
          "The barengraben is a fenced in area next to a tram stop and across the bridge from the Olde Town. It's a good spot for people who want to see brown bears at a close but safe distance in a fairly small area, but on two separate visits I have to say that I felt bad for the bears.",
          "and a lot of fun, they feed them in the morning in the old bear pit, and the three bears then wander the park on the hill by the river, in the glass enclosed section plenty of photo ops for bears up close.",
          "This riverside park is a beautiful place for the bears to reside. They have an amazing view and must be very content with it all. Unfortunately we have visited twice and only seen one bear for a very short time! It was quite a warm day so perhaps they were under cover to keep",
          "We went the the bear park on a very sunny day,we found the bears very entertaining they were on the move most of the time wander up and down their fairly large enclosure they seemed comfortable in their environment and quite happy. We took lots of pictures. Well worth a visit.",
          "I found this kind of amazing. It's basically a small, enclosed, park located right along the river that has live bears. You can go and watch them do bear things, buy bear related memorabilia, pretend you're a bear yourself, whatever strikes your fancy and everything but the",
          "I anticipated this would be a sad place for the bears, but the renovation of several years ago, make it a fairly nice place for them. Plus, it offers visitors multiple places to observe them from a close distance, without being obtrusive. For a good view of the river & Old",
          "Though it is the symbol of Bern, the Bear park is nothing more than a sad spot for 3 bears that don't seem to enjoy being there. All tourists want to see this uninteresting place; I don't understand why.",
          "Visiting the Bears in Bern is a must. We visited with our two young children who thoroughly enjoyed it. You can buy vegetables to feed them fir a nominal fee. It is also a good place to start your walking tour of the city.",
          "I keep coming back. I first visited in 1989 when the bears lived in the pit and came back several times last year. They have a wonderful new home and I am sure they love it. I was delighted on this last visit to see one of the bears swimming! He/she was happily and leisurely",
          "Loved seeing bears in the park. Loved their little river enclosure too, but was sad to see some of the glass had been smashed (maybe from May Day?)",
          "On the bottom of the park, there are seating areas for visitors to eat, relax and enjoy the view of the running river. The interesting part is that the colour of the water changes according to the weather reflection! I totally love them when it's a bit cloudy :D",
          "The Barengarben is located just across the river to the east from the Altstadt of Bern and walkable (~20 mins) from the Bern bahnhof. It is also accessible by taking No.12 bus and get off right at the entrance. The enclosure is much bigger than expected. The \"pit\" you'd see",
          "This is a nice location over the bridge from the central district and offers a close a view as you would like from the brown bears. Open all day. Berne is inseparably linked with bears. According to legend the city\u2019s founder, Duke Berchtold V von Z\u00e4hringen, named the city after",
          "It was a surprise to see some live bears. We saw 3 different ones and they seem to have a great habitat.",
          "The bear park is cool because of it's ties to the history of the town but that's about it. It's a basic best exhibit and nothing too special. It's worth going to but we didn't spend more than 10 minutes there.",
          "Nice enclosure, slight shame you cant get closer but the bears seem happy and a great spot to grab lunch and is near to quite a few other sights and museums.",
          "When I lived in London there was an old myth that if the Ravens ever left the Tower of London then London would collapse. There is a similar story about the bears in Bern. The story starts with the fact that the founder of the city said that he would name it after the first",
          "We stopped here with our kids for a short visit on our drive through Bern. We all enjoyed the visit. I had visited here 20+ years ago before the park had been expanded - they've really made it look nice, and comfortable for the bears. -- We drove our car and were able to",
          "Lovely place with cool bears, cool restaurant and nice street where you can buy a stone and your name will be written on it! love this idea! This park is recommended for kids and adults!",
          "The legend of Bern, its name, and the resident bears is both unusual and fascinating. The only objection I have is that the space available to the bears is rather small, considering 3 of them must live together. The construction of the park in addition to the traditional \"pit\"",
          "There were two bears that were out grazing in the grass. It looked like a male and a female. It was enjoyable watching them forage for the roots in the ground around their enclousure.",
          "this bear park lay on a hillside dawn to river aare. I WHAs here in january so the bear WHAs sleeping, but it WHAs a very Clear tracks after they. it WHAs olso a tablets on the wall in a house there it WHAs wtitten about the bear, and it WHAs a Movie about the bear",
          "If you are visiting in winter, don't be disappointed as the bears are in hibernation now. In summer, you will see them roaming around their large enclosure and - on a hot day - having a dip in the water. In winter, you can go see the \"Bern Show\" (access through entry to",
          "I reached Bear Park when the counter was closed, so I did not get into it. However, I can see that there are two bears were wandering outside. One bear was walking back and forth appears on the same route, and the other bears were sleeping in the visible wooden beams. The Bear",

          "the bear park in bern is a very nice place to visit, as long as the weather is good! the best way to get there is by bike. there are heaps of places in bern where you can rent a bike for free. it takes you about 10mins from the city center to the bear park. the park itself is",
          "It was nice to finally see the famous bears of Bern, and their enclosure is impressive. However at the time of my visit 2 of the bears were already hibernating, which is to be expected. So if you really want to see the bears don't come in the middle of Winter!",
          "I regularly visit the Bear Pit and enjoy it more now than when they were in the old bear pit. Even now the being winter the Bears are very content and a joy to watch.",
          "The Bears although out of their normal environment look so peaceful. A good view on way to tramdepot",
          "Brown bears are part of Bern's culture. This enclosure on the river bank provides a good setting for people to view the bears. The cafe is worth visiting.",
          "This where the old gates to the medieval town of berne. The old and the new bear park are a great site. Enjoy bern's best beer in the local brewery here and have a walk ether to the rosengarten or to the fischerm\u00e4tteli.",
          "When I visited Bern years ago, I felt sad for the bears in the small pit. Today, they have a lovely home with enough space to frolic in. It is nice to see wild animals in the city. They add to the charm of Vern.",
          "Not something I particularly agree upon, but the bears seem happy, they have a lot of space at their disposal now, the location is fantastic, grounds are well kept. They are so beautiful.",
          "If you are visiting Bern and have the time it is an easy walk across the bridge from the old town to get to Bear Park. On our visit we saw three brown bears in the new, much improved enclosure. But it really is nothing special. There are a few place in the area for buying a",
          "When I lived in Bern I used to be so saddened by the old bear pits. They are now fabulous - lots of room for the bears to roam, things for them to do and of course an area for them to swim in. Well done Bern",
          "Living arrangements are better than they had been. Sometimes the bears are out of public view but a walk way round their park allows good scope to see them. There were three bears when we visited.",
          "Next to the river and the old tram depot, there's a bear enclosure! Something different, and worth a look before or after enjoying a beer in the old tram depot.",
          "This is a nice thing to do if you're looking for something free and entertaining. It's basically a free walk along the river where you can see some brown bears. Nothing crazy that you should go out of your way to see, but if you're in the area and have some time, it a nice",
          "We really appreciated the habitat that was built for Bern's famous bears. It was fun for the kids to bike ride across a bridge and suddenly see bears lumbering around the hillside.",
          "I last visited Bern 5 years ago and the conditions were terrible as I recall. It was dirty and quite dark, and the bears mostly hid from public view, defeating the purpose of having visitors to the bear pit. After a recent renovation, the bears have a much more 'green'",
          "I worked in bern 36 years ago and in those days the poor old bears were in a horrible smelly pit called the baren graben. Now they have a lovely park on the banks of the beautiful blue, fast flowing river Aarer to play in. There are four happy fat brown bears in residence. They",
          "To have 3 brown bears in the middle of a city is great. This attraction is also free which makes it even better. The bears seem to really enjoy putting on a show for the people admiring them. You have to make a stop here while in Bern.",
          "well, for me it's something different to see an animal enclosure in a city. The bears however looked bored and sick though. hopefully they are well taken care of.",
          "Someone has put prison sentence !!! They didn't look like that to me. When we got there they were playing about and then play about in the water.... They looked far from bored to me. Given they are a national icon and are on the flags.... To get rid of them would be silly . Go",
          "A life prison sentence for these bears who spend most of their time sleeping because they are so bored & depressed. It should be closed down in my opinion. There are no wild bears in Switzerland. these bears do not belongThis is a cruel tourists trap",
          "We arrived at the Barenplatz at about 10 o'clock just as the bears were emerging from their den. Fruit had been scattered all over the enclosure and in the water canals and we had a wonderful time watching the bears hunting for their \"breakfast\" and getting into the water to",
          "A visit to Bern should not exclude a trip to see the bears! The new Bear Park was under maintenance when we arrived so the bears stayed in the original bear pit. It was still fun though as we were able to see them play and swim in close proximity, although I wished they were out",
          "We decided that this would be a nice way to start off our visit in Bern and we really liked it! We spent some time sitting by the river and eating lunch and then watched one of the bears swim around in the water in it's enclosure. They seem to have a decent amount of space and",
          "A lovely and very spacious park along the Aare River so I needn't have worried about feeling sorry for captive animals. They have lots of area to roam and can even swim in a fenced in area of the river and roam among trees and retreat to a cave. A pair of adults and their two",
          "well in bern do visit the old town on foot and then the bear park....where the bears can be seen in there natural habitat closely and also in bern do visit gunterkulm, a little known attraction, how to reach there do research on the net ......it is very easy just take a bus from",
          "I enjoyed visiting the park, the entrance is free and there are several signs with well written information on the bears' habits. The park also offers very nice views over the river. It is worth a visit!",
          "The bears are not easy to see if you can't walk down very steep stairs. However, it is still a fun place to visit, with a lovely view of the river from the bridge that you have to cross to approach the Bear Park.",
          "I really enjoy walking by the bear pit in Bern once in a while - it provides a nice and relaxing environment and the combination of the often lazy bears and the flow of the river is an almost perfect background for a casual stroll. If the sun is shining why not sit by the river",
          "We didn\u2019t expect much from this but it was actually a really nice (and free) place to go. There were a few adult bears and a few adorable baby bears. You can see them very well and they have a lot of room in the exhibit. We were lucky that they were running around and having",
          "It was just fun to see the bears in the Bear Pit after walking through Altstadt Bern and across the river. Even for \"seniors\" like us.",
          "I am not a fan of zoos and do not advocate caging animals but at the Bear pits the keepers seem to to be trying to do their best for the bears here. They have done all they can to give the bears as much space as possible. The old bear pits are now connected to a large area on",
          "The new bear enclosure provides a better life for the bears. You can watch them roam and play. Seems a shame to have the bears in captivity to satisfy some historical vanity though.",
          "I am not necessarily a fan of keeping animals in captivity but here the keepers seem to have done all they can to give the bears as much space as possible. The old bear pits are now connected to a large area on the river bank allowing the bears to wander around a much greater,",
          "The surroundings of this park are beautiful and well worth the walk as the surrounding streets are filled with beautiful architecture. It is free!! As Swityerland is very expensive it is well worth a visit, must see!",
          "Much better than staring down into a pit, the bears tumbled and played all alongside the river. You can see them from any angle",
          "The new Bear Park offers a nice place for the Bears. Visitors can see - if they are lucky - the Bears from the Bridge. Visiting Bear park is not a must, but nice for a short visit if you are close anyway.",
          "The bears have a very large area covering several acres. It certainly gives the feeling of freedom for the bears. They seem well looked after.",
          "We had a fantastic experience of visiting Bear Park. It's a beautiful big park with Bear family roaming freely and enjoying themselves ! 1. First, the park is open for 24 hrs.!!.and entry is FREE !...so you can visit it any time convenient to you. 2. One can walk from central",
          "We have been in Bern for years and have been used to the old \"B\u00e4rengraben\" but today... we enjoyed the new opened B\u00e4renpark, the bears got so much space now and you can see them from the bridge or from the water, what a nice feeling and a great view!!!",
          "We spent a day in Berne Switzerland. One of the \"attractions\" was the Bear Park. We had no idea what to expect but it was a charming hillside, along the Aare River, which was home to a bear family. Spectators could watch from above the hillside or below, as mother, father and",
          "We saw a couple of bears. They were lovely but it's not really a big park with anything else to see. It's just on the side of the river where you get watch the bear from a distance. The view from the river is nice. Overall, if you have extra time in the city it's nice to go",
          "This is a pit full of bears, where people can look down at them. I didn't like it. They did have a cave they could go into, but it seemed cruel.",
          "The new bear park is built on an a terraced embankment right alongside the River Aare. During the spring and summer thousands come here to see the four brown bears they currently have. Sometimes they just walk on the hillside or play but they certainly are cute and worth",
          "The bear park is a must see when visiting Bern. We were fortunate that the bears where out and swimming. Timing is key to see the bears. The weather can be deterring, but there are things to do while waiting for the bears to come out and entertain. A very family friendly place",
          "For many years the bears were caged in the pits, on concrete floors, surrounded by stone walls. What a pitiful existence! The visitors threw carrots down to them but there was no 'contact' possible. Now visitors can be at the same level (still separated by fences and a moat) and",
          "I was really looking forward to seeing the Bern bears and was a bit disappointed. Bern boasts the new enclosure that they have made for the bears, but it seemed weedy and unkempt to me. There were three bears out, which was great, but absolutely no history about the bears was",
          "A well maintained park close to the city center. When we got there, the bears (3) were in the water. It was really amazing watching those huge creatures swimming with such ease. You can easily spend 1 hour there. No fee.",
          "Rather sad looking environment for the bears, but everyone including the children like to look at them.",
          "Having years ago seen the Bears of Bern in their original pit. This new enclosure on the side of the river was wonderful. There is space for the bears to wander without looking pitiful. Trees to climb , places to hide from the public. It is now a pleasure to see these symbols of",
          "Great set up for the bears. Shame it was winter & the bears didn't come out (can't blame them, it was snowing).",
          "From the top of the Bear Park near the old Bear Pits, I had a good view of 2 of the Brown Bears. The big Brown Bear was digging some hole and the smaller bear would walk around the parameter and then look on at the larger Brown Bear digging the hole. This park is much better",
          "The attraction is free, but could only see 4 bears and it is quite far away! No real clear view of the bears. It was ok for a one time visit. The restuarant near the bear park was a better choice where they brewed their own beer and it was quite good!",
          "This could be a nice place, but unfortunately in the middle of winter, all bears are hibernating. Better to save it for another time of the year!",
          "I think this could be a nice place, but it's useless to go to in the middle of winter, as all bears are hibernating. Better to save it for some other time of the year!",
          "Every major city has it's own unique distinctive trademarks, and it's nice to see in Bern that they have live bears as theirs! A nice break from all the towers and monuments all over the rest of Europe! When we visited it looked like the bears were active and having fun, and",
          "Unfortunately we chose December to visit so the bears (naturally) had gone into hibernation. There was a little about the history of the bears and a lovely spot to view parts of the river and old city",
          "Comparing the new Bear Park to the old one is like two different Worlds! The old one is small, depressing, dark and no place for the Bears to go and play. The new one is down the Hill to the River, its big (ok, its \"bigger\"), has Trees, Water, Caves and lots of things to explore",
          "It is interesting to see three big brown bears in a city, however, I don't quite understanding the reason for it from tourism point of view. No matter how, it attracts many visitors like myself. It is not easy to spot the bears behind the wires. I am happy to say, they seem",
          "Well, I love Bears, beeing able to see them on such a beautiful location, is amazing. The park is free, and it never closes. I love it",
          "Random bears in the middle of Berne is enough reason to visit this place. Is just so random. And is close to Old Town and on the way to a summit point to see breath-taking views of the city. One of the tourist centers is located there as well.",
          "The hillside rivers cape is beautiful and the brewery next to it is great! It's absolutely worth the trip",
          "If you are lucky there will also be little baby bears around. The place is really beautiful near the city and the river. There is even a spa for bears.",
          "The bear park was build to house some bears which were offered by other zoos. Currently it houses 3 bears who have become a great attraction for the visitors.",
          "It was good to see the bear just going about doing their thing on the edge of the river. The largest bear was digging a holes in the embankment and the other two were just doing bear things, climbing trees, wondering around looking cute. We were able to see three (3) bears. I",
          "The bears live on the bank of the river and have access to several areas including a swimming area. There are four currently (mom, dad, 2 daughters) living there as bums. Live is good.",
          "the breas are symbol for bern ,,, you should visit the park on side of the river... and you would be lucky if they feed them while you are there... nice thing to see :D",
          "No trip to Bern is complete without a visit to see the famous bears. Happy to see that they brought some of the bears back to the old enclosures, while keeping others in the new park on the hill along the river. Great fun to watch.",
          "So on the river bank at the very tip of the old town is a free to visit bear park with free roaming bears",
          "after having to live for a long time in the bear pit the animals that are used to roam around have now a better place to live and it's a great attraction for the tourists.",
          "This is not only a place for families or children, but also for adults and younger people! Perfect positioned with a magnificent view over the old town, this area provides a marvellous terrace and a few shops. We found it really amazing to watch at bears playing and bathing in",
          "These bears have a love of life which is obvious when watching them. They should, given their entire hillside of prime real estate in the city center. What a huge upgrade from the old bear pits. I'm not sure any bears in Switzerland have it so good. They even enclosed part",
          "The bears are lovely! They can be seen from the bridge over the river or up close, from the path next to their enclosure. On a good day you could spend hours here! They play, swim in the pool and play with the logs in it, eat, lounge around, etc. It all seems quite",
          "You're very near from the bears' family and can see them play, fight, eat... You can spend hours there, especially when it's sunny, you can sit on the riverside and enjoy the peaceful environment. When we visited Bern, there were always a lot of tourists around, so that can be",
          "You can see the bears from a quite close distance and they seems to be at their natural habitat... It's funny to just stay looking at them playing...",
          "The bears can be viewed from multiple locations. I liked the view from the nearby bridge the best. The juvenile bears are constantly playing and wrestling around. The bears can be viewed for free. The new enclosure appears to be much more enjoyable for the bears than the",
          "Was driving from Luzern back to Geneva, thought it is a good stop over for young kids to stretch their legs and have a quick lunch. A few bears walking in the enclosure on the slope. Right below was the running river. We saw a man actually float on it! And he was waving to all",
          "the bears looked happy enough in there enclosure. walk up river along river path you will pass through some woods with red squirels. carry on until you reach the bridge cross the road to the lido.then back up the hill to the parliament buildings",
          "It's fun to watch bears, it just is. I thought to myself, 'why watch bears, can't we do something else?' but once you get into the fence leaning and doing a running commentary on the bears with whoever you're there with, it really is quite enjoyable to watch these big teddy-bear"

        "wiki": "The Natural History Museum of Bern (German: Naturhistorisches Museum Bern) is a museum in Bern, Switzerland.  In its teaching and research it cooperates closely with the University of Bern.  It is visited by around 131,000 people yearly.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe museum is owned by the Burgergemeinde of Bern, so it is also known as Naturhistorisches Museum der Burgergemeinde Bern.  It was officially founded in 1832.  It is located on Bernastrasse, in the Kirchenfeld quarter, in a building that was erected between 1932 and 1934, opened in 1936 and expanded several times since then.  Previously the exhibits were kept in a building on Hodlerstrasse built from 1878\u201381 and demolished in 1936; and earlier still, in the library gallery of a former college building. In 2016, the museum was visited by around 131,000 people.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nThe museum is known for its set of over 220 life-sized dioramas, featuring preserved animals from Switzerland, Africa and Asia; it also owns a collection of minerals from the Alpine region, samples of gold discovered at various locations in Switzerland, meteorites, a large stock of invertebrates, and Switzerland's largest collection of animal skeletons and bones.\n\n\n=== Mammal dioramas ===\n\nThe dioramas originate from a collection of big game animals from Africa, bagged by the London-based Bernese painter and game hunter Bernhard von Wattenwyl (together with his daughter Vivienne) during an expedition in 1923\u201324.  A total of 130 of these animals are on display, in 33 dioramas along two darkened corridors.  The dioramas are designed and furnished according to the animals' natural habitat.\nThere is a further section displaying native birds and mammals, with over 600 animals in 164 dioramas.  This section was previously on display in the Heimatmuseum, opened around the outbreak of World War II.\nThe upper basement contains five dioramas of Asian animals threatened with extinction: snow leopards, orangutans, giant pandas, Indian rhinoceroses, and tigers.\nA fourth section called \"Nordic Animals\" features stuffed bears, muskoxen, seals, moose and birds, in nine dioramas containing 66 individual animals.\nOne of the museum's biggest attractions is the stuffed hide of Barry, the St. Bernard who is said to have saved the lives of over 40 people.  A special exhibit dedicated to him was held in 2001.\n\n\n=== C'est la Vie ===\nThe museum's largest exhibit draws on the four million items to explore the biological and psychological facets of live. Visitors are invited to use sight, smell and sound to discover the world's tremendous biodiversity and its greater implications in human existence. Films, tactile and audio installations attempt to not only present scientific answers to these basic questions, but illustrate philosophy into the metaphysics of studying life.\nThe exhibit's first section repeats the phrase \"There is no life without death.\" Part of the exhibition's definition of life is that all living things die, and through their decomposition stimulate more life. This section presents the life inside a pig carcass (paradisaically living off of the pig's demise), the oldest living animal (the Antarctic glass sponge) and the human fascination with death (featuring many art installations including H.R. Geiger's original mask for the film Alien.) The museum is, in essence, a repository for dead animals, and this section pays homage to their collectors and exhibits. Visitors look onto treasures through a transparent floor in somewhat of a meta-mission: the museum too was founded on a fascination with the death of the world around us.\nThe second section discusses gender and sexuality. Thus, the exhibit expands its definition to note that all living things must reproduce and pass along their traits. Avian mating displays show the advantages and disadvantages of this system: the decorated male bird may attract predators as well as an appreciative female and his elaborate plumage may make it hard to fly. Over in the corner, a life-sized blue whale head and an oversized sea turtle represent r/K selection theory. This cycle of risk and benefit hinders even human childbirth. Larger brains give humans a clear advantage, but complicate biophysical matters with an enlarged braincase. \nThe \"World in the Head\" section looks at the senses, the brain and the idea of consciousness. A Gertrude Stein quote and small animatronic display illustrates the senses that humans do not have. A mirrored room metaphorically takes the visitor into an infinity and asks if vision requires an infinite amount of brain activity.\n\n\n=== Die Grosse Knochenschau ===\nThe largest collection of animal skeletons and bones in Switzerland is displayed under the name \"The Big Bone Show\" (Die grosse Knochenschau).  This room exhibits over 300 skeletons, including those of a fin whale and an Asian elephant.  Eight of the larger skeletons sit upon a continually revolving carousel.  The display cabinets contain numerous further exhibits, including 518 individual bones.\n\n\n=== Albert Heim Foundation ===\nThe Albert Heim Foundation for the promotion of cynological research is based at the museum, and possesses the world's largest collection of canine skulls.\n\n\n== World Spider Catalog ==\n\nIn 2014 the Natural History Museum of Bern took over the World Spider Catalog, created in 2000 by Norman I. Platnick of the American Museum of Natural History, converting it to a relational database.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\n\"Vom \"Naturalienkabinett\" zum modernen wissenschaftlichen Museum\" [From \"natural history collection\" to modern science museum] (in German).

          "I have always had an interest in Einstein, so when I decided to go to Bern I had to go to this museum. I was not disappointed. I got the audio tour, and I listened to every single stop in the museum. Einstein was working in Bern when he wrote his original theory of relativity",

          "Quite simply one of the best Museums I have visited. I enjoyed it far more than the Swiss National Museum in Zurich. The building itself is a sight to see. All the exhibits are very well presented and explained. I had to come back again the next day to finish seeing it all!",

          "I'm writing a review because the Tourist Info center in Bern advised us not to visit this museum unless we speak German, but we went anyway because we were in the area and it was raining outside. The TI could not have been more wrong; there were definitely a few exhibits that",

          "This is a must see. Much of this is dedicated to Einsteins life and what he did during the Hitler reign. Take time to read all of the information available. It provides some insights into what he was doing during that time and his regrets and what he did for many of the Jews.",
          "The Einstein Museum is on the top floor of the Bern Historical Museum and requires a separate entry ticket. At CHF13 per adult it is not cheap when you consider that much of what is on display relates to the era in which Einstein lives and not specifically about him or his life.",

          "This museum is one of the best I have been to. It's uncluttered and has a variety of different themes from storage to the present. The history of Bern is well set out and you understand how Switzerland became the unique country it is today",
          "The historical sections on the lower floors are a very good introduction to the history of Bern. This is what I was most interested in. The head and feet of the giant wooden gate statue are not to be missed. I knew a lot of Einstein biographical information but the museum",

          "Go to this museum if it the only one you see in Bern. Wonderful exhibits -well laid out with English translations. We missed out the floor on Einstein as we had spent time on him in his own house. The modern section was evasive on the war years which was a shame as there is",
          "We were worried the museum might not be worth the quite high entry price. We needn't have worried; it was worth every penny. If only all museums were done this well. We went to the Einstein exhibition and we learned far more than could have expected about Einstein, Switerland",
          "What motivated me and my brother, both science geeks, to visit this museum was the Einstein exhibition, of course. In the end, we stayed there for more than 3 hours. We would have stayed maybe even more, but it was closing time. Great exhibitions, many interesting historical",

          "After we purchased our tickets the advice was to start at the top and work our way down. Each floor welcomed you to more and more exciting things. Very few people come be found that made it nice to slowly enjoy your visit. The displays were very clean and I noticed a guard",

          "Visited the Einstein section of the Bern Historical Museum on a recent trip to CH. It was a suggestion by a (male) friend to entertain my science-minded husband, and I admit I expected to be baffled, bored or both! However - I have to say that the life story of Albert Einstein",
          "We skipped the Einstein museum. Getting to the display areas of the rest of the museum difficult. Upstairs, downstairs. Not laid out for handicapped. Wide variety of displays. Most interesting was the 20th Century - year by year - highlighting locals achievements.",
          "The historical museum in Bern is a great place to spend a few hours of free time. My highlight of the visit to the museum is the Einstein exhibition. You can learn so much about the science and the world, and of course on the life of Mr. Einstein. The Hiroshima area and Marlene",

          "From start to finish this museum does not disappoint. We went mainly for the Einstein exhibit however, enjoyed they other exhibits as well. The Einstein exhibit was extremely well done. It takes you through Albert's life - what a life he lead. Learned about him, his family,",
          "The museum contains a wide range of historical exhibits but the main attraction for most will be the 3rd floor which is dedicated to the life of Albert Einstein who lived in Bern at the start of his career and famously worked in the Bern patent office. The museum tells the story",
          "We have been to Bern many times but had never visited this museum. We were completely surprised how great the Einstein Museum is on the 2nd floor. Please do not confuse this with the Einstein apartment found on Kramgasse in the center of the city. This is an excellent biography",
          "We were attracted by pictures of the funny glass wall on the web. It is really worth to come and see it by ourselves. We didn't go inside and spent approx. 1 hr to take pictures of the building only.",
          "If you are a scientist or not this a super exhibition about Einstein, it is really putting together personality and also history what happens in the world and how it influences Einstein life. Great job!",
          "You know a museum is good when it wows you before you even enter properly. I only went to the exhibition on Einstein and boy I was impressed. It had a mixture of media that should fascinate anybody. A word of the wise: the stuff on World War 2 is potentially upsetting.",
          "Fascinating building and insights into Bern. The exhibit on the town plans was fascinating. The curators are helpful and friendly. The Einstein museum is brilliant, with one of the most impressive entrances I've ever seen",
          "A great museum - no one could be bored here! It also feels very well done and well financed, unlike some museums. I went on a quiet Sunday and was alone in some of the exhibition halls. The models are so realistic and the lighting is so perfectly dimmed, that I got freaked out!",

          "Note that this review relates ONLY to the Einstein exhibition. There's a lot more to see but we didn't have time for anything else. This museum has a huge collection of items and original documents from and relating to Einstein's life. To give just one example, they have the",
          "I went to Bern with the intention of paying respect to this great man and the musuem is superbly arranged showing events of the 20th century parallel to Einstein's life - please do visit even if maths and physics is not your thing. This museum is a great biography rather than",
          "Several reviewers said earlier that it is an average museum - I agree. Due to limited time on my hands, I needed to prioritize and only wanted to see the Einstein Museum but was disappointed to learn that you cannot separately buy the ticket. Permanent exhibits cost 13 CHF and",
          "Initially not very excited about visiting this museum... Admittedly lacking in curiosity about Swiss-german history, I enjoyed the exhibits which helped to put some parts of Swiss history, and its social history, into perspective. Interesting building too.",

          "well appointed in a neo-historical building dating from the 1910's located near the United States embassy. Having Bernese roots this was a must see for us. The exhibits range from the neolithic era to the Celtic, Roman, Alemanic periods, to the founding of Bern in the 12th",
          "Loved this museum and spent ages in the Einstein section. Whole place was enjoyable and informative - particularly Millefleur tapestry and relics from the Konigsfeldon monastery. We thought the entrance fees were worthwhile.",

          "The exhibition is a good 2 hours worth spending. Also, they have a nice little shop. It's well done and you can learn a lot if you do not have previous knowledge. It's a good mix of videos, archeological findings and cultural knowledge. However, in my opinion it's a bit",

          "I just paid a visit there to see the Einstein exhibition and did not check the others. It was very thorough beginning from Einstains childhood, walking through his life and explaining the most of his ideas in a way everybody can understand them. I also liked the fact that there",

          "The Qin exhibition was good. The Audio guide added some extra information and was worth the 5 CHF. The service in the restaurant has improved slightly from that given by a previous reviewer. waiting time is now down to about 30 minutes! Unfortunately the museum has not thought",
          "This special exhibit is definitely worth seeing if you will be in Bern during 2013. Plan to spend about an hour or more to see it in its entirety. We opted to skip the audio guides and just browse and read the information as we went. There are some interesting videos",
          "Oh , what a delight to view this exhibition in Berns Historical Museum. Although only a relativly small exhibition compared to the Chinese one it is superb and gives the visitor , who may never go to China more than an insight to life then. Tickets are easily booked on line ,",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Gerechtigkeitsbrunnen (Fountain of Justice) is a 16th-century fountain in the Gerechtigkeitsgasse in the Old City of Bern, Switzerland. It is the only Bernese fountain to retain all original design elements, and is listed as a cultural heritage of national significance.Thanks to its namesake figure, Hans Gieng's famous statue of Lady Justice, the Gerechtigkeitsbrunnen surpasses all other Bernese fountains in artistic merit. The iconic figure was copied throughout Switzerland up until the middle of the 17th century. The statue is a copy of the original, which was largely destroyed by vandals in 1986.\n\n\n== Fountain ==\n\nThe fountain consists of an octagonal main basin and two smaller spillover basins. The main basin, made out of unadorned limestone plates held together with an iron ring, bears the date of one of the renovations, MDCCCXLV. In the centre of the main basin, bronze tubes emerge from the central pedestal, which was replaced in 1949. Atop it stands a narrow, festooned stone pillar decorated by an acanthus frieze.\n\n\n== Statue ==\nThe life-sized statue on the pillar is Iustitia, \"Lady Justice\", the personification of justice. She is portrayed standing in gracious counterpoise holding her traditional attributes\u2014sword of justice in her right hand, a balance in her left hand and a blindfold over her eyes.  Her costume is fashioned in an antique manner, with sandaled feet, one knee bared, wearing a decorative golden suit of armour adorned with bas-relief arabesques over her blue robes.\nAt the feet of Justice, four smaller busts crowd the pedestal: a Pope, an Emperor, a Sultan and a Schultheiss, whose golden chain of office is believed to have originally borne the Bernese arms. All figures have closed their eyes as in submission. They represent the Four Earthly Powers, the four forms of government according to Renaissance humanism: theocracy (the Pope), monarchy (the Emperor), autocracy (the Sultan) and the republic (the Schultheiss).\n\n\n=== Symbolism ===\n\nThe ensemble represents the supremacy of Justice over all Earthly authorities; a variant of the medieval pictorial formula of virtue defeating vice. The contemporary belief in the divine nature of Justice is made more apparent in a 1558 Bernese drawing for a stained-glass window by Hans Rudolf Manuel; there, a winged Justice strides over the heads of princes whose symbols of power are broken. Divine Justice was a frequent element of political discourse in Reformation-era Bern. In the view of the reformators, doing justice according to God's word was the highest duty of all authority, superseding feudal rights. Such arguments were used, among others, to justify Bern's conquest of Vaud in 1536 from the dukes of Savoy.While the sword and scales are traditional attributes of Iustitia, the Bernese statue's blindfold is a novelty; only later did it become a common element in personifications of Justice and a general symbol for the principle of equality before the law. The blindfold implies that justice ought to be done without respect to rank or standing; that a just verdict is arrived at through introspection rather than with a view to outward looks. Gieng's Iustitia is a symbol of republican justice, and was a forceful public reminder of the Bernese Republic's authority through law.\n\n\n=== Influence ===\n\nGieng's Iustitia was greatly influential on fountain designers up until the middle of the 17th century. In Switzerland alone, eleven \"fountains of Justice\" remain, and several others have probably been destroyed. Direct copies exist in Solothurn (1561), Lausanne (1585), Boudry, Cudrefin and Neuch\u00e2tel; designs influenced by the Bernese statue are found in Aarau (1643), Biel, Burgdorf, Brugg, Z\u00fcrich and Luzern.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe fountain was constructed in 1543, essentially in its current state, to complement an older well at the Nydegg. Its current name is first recorded in 1687. Renovations are recorded in 1584, 1589, 1668 and 1687. The sword and balance were removed, allegedly by the invading French, in 1798 and disappeared for many years; they and the figures' other paraphernalia have frequently been replaced. The figure was repainted in 1890 by Christian B\u00fchler and in 1925 by Victor Surbek. In 1949, parts of the pedestal were replaced.\n\n\n=== Vandalism ===\n\nAfter having stood in place for 443 years, the statue was torn down after midnight on 13 October 1986 by means of a rope and tackle. It was largely destroyed by the fall. The act was not claimed by anyone, but was generally attributed to the Groupe B\u00e9lier, a militant youth organisation advocating Jurassic separatism. At that time, the B\u00e9liers frequently engaged in acts of vandalism to express the Jurassian separatists' outrage over allegations of irregularities in the plebiscites of 1974\u201375 that caused the Bernese Jura to not join the canton of Jura; and over what was, according to the separatists, a cover-up of these irregularities by the Bernese and federal authorities.Only one person was ever implicated in the destruction of the statue. Pascal H\u00eache, a 29-year-old mechanic and B\u00e9lier, retracted his initial confession and pleaded not guilty to having participated in the attack. The Bernese courts sentenced him to 22 months' confinement and to the payment of CHF 200,000 in damages; the judgment was upheld by the Federal Supreme Court in 1991 and 1992.Since the attack, the damaged statue has been in the process of restoration at the city's historical museum. The statue in place since 1988 is a copy.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCaviezel, Zita; Herzog, Georges; Keller, J\u00fcrg A.

        "wiki": "Bern [b\u025brn] (listen) (Alemannic German: B\u00e4rn [b\u0325\u00e6\u02d0rn]; French: Berne [b\u025b\u0281n] (listen); Italian: Berna [\u02c8b\u025brna]; Romansh: Berna [\u02c8b\u025brn\u0250] (listen)) is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their \"federal city\", in German Bundesstadt, French ville f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, and Italian citt\u00e0 federale. With a population of about 140,000 (as of 2019), Bern is the fifth-most populous city in Switzerland. The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014. The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000. Bern is also the capital of the canton of Bern, the second-most populous of Switzerland's cantons.\nThe official language in Bern is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the most-spoken language is an Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Bernese German.\nIn 1983, the historic old town (in German: Altstadt) in the centre of Bern became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe etymology of the name \"Bern\" is uncertain. According to the local legend, based on folk etymology, Berchtold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen, the founder of the city of Bern, vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt, and this turned out to be a bear. It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona, which at the time was known as Bern in Middle High German. As a result of the finding of the Bern zinc tablet in the 1980s, it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin, possibly *berna \"cleft\". The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of Bern from at least the 1220s. The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the B\u00e4rengraben dates to the 1440s.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nNo archaeological evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today\u2032s city centre prior to the 12th century has been found so far. In antiquity, a Celtic oppidum stood on the Engehalbinsel (peninsula) north of Bern, fortified since the second century BC (late La T\u00e8ne period), thought to be one of the 12 oppida of the Helvetii mentioned by Caesar. During the Roman era, a Gallo-Roman vicus was on the same site. The Bern zinc tablet has the name Brenodor (\"dwelling of Breno\"). In the Early Middle Ages, a settlement in B\u00fcmpliz, now a city district of Bern, was some 4 km (2 mi) from the medieval city.\nThe medieval city is a foundation of the Z\u00e4hringer ruling family, which rose to power in Upper Burgundy in the 12th century. According to 14th-century historiography (Cronica de Berno, 1309), Bern was founded in 1191 by Berthold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen.\nIn 1218, after Berthold died without an heir, Bern was made a free imperial city by the Goldene Handfeste of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II.\n\n\n=== Old Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nIn 1353, Bern joined the Swiss Confederacy, becoming one of the eight cantons of the formative period of 1353 to 1481.\nBern invaded and conquered Aargau in 1415 and Vaud in 1536, as well as other smaller territories, thereby becoming the largest city-state north of the Alps; by the 18th century, it comprised most of what is today the canton of Bern and the canton of Vaud.\nThe city grew out towards the west of the boundaries of the peninsula formed by the river Aare. The Zytglogge tower marked the western boundary of the city from 1191 until 1256, when the K\u00e4figturm took over this role until 1345. It was, in turn, succeeded by the Christoffelturm (formerly located close to the site of the modern-day railway station) until 1622. During the time of the Thirty Years' War, two new fortifications \u2013 the so-called big and small Schanze (entrenchment) \u2013 were built to protect the whole area of the peninsula.\nAfter a major blaze in 1405, the city's original wooden buildings were gradually replaced by half-timbered houses and subsequently the sandstone buildings which came to be characteristic for the Old Town. Despite the waves of pestilence that hit Europe in the 14th century, the city continued to grow, mainly due to immigration from the surrounding countryside.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nBern was occupied by French troops in 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars, when it was stripped of parts of its territories. It regained control of the Bernese Oberland in 1802, and following the Congress of Vienna of 1814, it newly acquired the Bernese Jura. At this time, it once again became the largest canton of the Confederacy as it stood during the Restoration and until the secession of the canton of Jura in 1979.\nBern was made the Federal City (seat of the Federal Assembly) within the new Swiss federal state in 1848.\nA number of congresses of the socialist First and Second Internationals were held in Bern, particularly during World War I when Switzerland was neutral; see Bern International.\nThe city's population rose from about 5,000 in the 15th century to about 12,000 by 1800 and to above 60,000 by 1900, passing the 100,000 mark during the 1920s.\nPopulation peaked during the 1960s at 165,000 and has since decreased slightly, to below 130,000 by 2000.\nAs of September 2017, the resident population stood at 142,349, of which 100,000 were Swiss citizens and 42,349 (31%) resident foreigners. A further estimated 350,000 people live in the immediate urban agglomeration.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBern lies on the Swiss plateau in the canton of Bern, slightly west of the centre of Switzerland and 20 km (12 mi) north of the Bernese Alps. The countryside around Bern was formed by glaciers during the most recent ice age. The two mountains closest to Bern are Gurten with a height of 864 m (2,835 ft) and Bantiger with a height of 947 m (3,107 ft). The site of the old observatory in Bern is the point of origin of the CH1903 coordinate system at 46\u00b057\u203208.66\u2033N 7\u00b026\u203222.50\u2033E.\nThe city was originally built on a hilly peninsula surrounded by the river Aare, but outgrew natural boundaries by the 19th century. A number of bridges have been built to allow the city to expand beyond the Aare.\nBern is built on very uneven ground. An elevation difference of up to 60 metres exists between the inner city districts on the Aare (Matte, Marzili) and the higher ones (Kirchenfeld, L\u00e4nggasse).\nBern has an area, as of 2009, of 51.62 km2 (19.93 sq mi). Of this area, 9.79 km2 (3.78 sq mi) or 19.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 17.33 km2 (6.69 sq mi) or 33.6% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 23.25 km2 (8.98 sq mi) or 45.0% is settled (buildings or roads), 1.06 km2 (0.41 sq mi) or 2.1% is either rivers or lakes, and 0.16 km2 (0.062 sq mi) or 0.3% is unproductive land.Of the developed area of Bern, 3.6% consists of industrial buildings, 21.7% housing and other buildings, and 12.6% is devoted to transport infrastructure. Power and water infrastructure, as well as other special developed areas, made up 1.1% of the city, while another 6.0% consists of parks, green belts, and sports fields.\nOf Bern's total land area, 32.8% is heavily forested. Of the agricultural land, 14.3% is used for growing crops and 4.0% is designated to be used as pasture. Local rivers and streams provide all the water in the municipality.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification, Bern has a humid continental climate (Dfb) closely bordering on an oceanic climate (Cfb).\nThe closest weather station near Bern is located in the municipality of Zollikofen, about 5 kilometres (3 mi) north of the city centre. The warmest month for Bern is July, with a daily mean temperature of 18.3 \u00b0C (64.9 \u00b0F), and a daily maximum temperature of 24.3 \u00b0C (75.7 \u00b0F). The highest temperature recorded at Bern / Zollikofen is 37.0 \u00b0C (98.6 \u00b0F), recorded in August 2003. On average, a temperature of 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) or above is recorded 40.7 days per year, and 6 days per year with a temperature of 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) or above at Zollikofen, and the warmest day reaches an average of 32.1 \u00b0C (89.8 \u00b0F).There are 103.7 days of air frost, and 22.3 ice days per year at Bern (Zollikofen) for the period of 1981\u20132010, as well as 14.1 days of snowfall, 36.7 days of snow cover per year and the average amount of snow measured per year is 52.6 centimetres (20.7 in). On average, January is the coldest month, with a daily mean temperature of \u22120.4 \u00b0C (31.3 \u00b0F), and a daily minimum temperature of \u22123.6 \u00b0C (25.5 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature ever recorded at Bern (Zollikofen) was \u221223.0 \u00b0C (\u22129.4 \u00b0F), recorded in February 1929, and typically the coldest temperature of the year reaches an average of \u221212.8 \u00b0C (9.0 \u00b0F) for the period of 1981\u20132010.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nThe municipality is administratively subdivided into six districts (Stadtteile), each of which consists of several quarters (Quartiere).\n\n\n=== Government ===\n\nThe Municipal Council (de: Gemeinderat, fr: conseil municipal) constitutes the executive government of the City of Bern and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of five councillors (German: Gemeinderat/-r\u00e4tin, French: conseiller/conseill\u00e8re municipal(e)), each presiding over a directorate (de: Direktion, fr: direction) comprising several departments and bureaus. The president of the executive department acts as mayor (de: Stadtpr\u00e4sident, fr: Le Maire). In the mandate period 2017\u20132020 (Legislatur) the Municipal Council is presided by Stadtpr\u00e4sident Alec von Graffenried. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the City Council are carried by the Municipal Council. The regular election of the Municipal Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. Any resident of Bern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. Contrary to most other municipalities, the executive government in Berne is selected by means of a system of Proporz. The mayor is elected as such as well by public election while the heads of the other directorates are assigned by the collegiate. The executive body holds its meetings in the Erlacherhof, built by architect Albrecht St\u00fcrler after 1747.As of 2017, Bern's Municipal Council is made up of two representatives of the SP (Social Democratic Party), and one each of CVP (Christian Democratic Party), GFL (Gr\u00fcne Freie Liste a.k.a. Green Free List, who is the newly elected mayor since 2017), and GB (Green Alliance of Berne), giving the left parties a very strong majority of four out of five seats. The last regular election was held on 27 November 2016/15 January 2017.\n\nDr. J\u00fcrg Wichtermann is State Chronicler (Staatsschreiber) since 2008.

Unlike members of the Municipal Council, members of the City Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Bern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the City Council. The parliament holds its meetings in the Stadthaus (Town Hall).The last regular election of the City Council was held on 27 November 2016 for the mandate period (German: Legislatur, French: la l\u00e9gislature) from 2017 to 2020.

The statue is a bear in full armor, with another bear cub at his feet. The bear represents the bear that, according to legend, Berchtold shot on the Aare peninsula as he was searching for a site to build a city.  The armored bear carries a shield and a banner, both emblazoned with the Z\u00e4hringen lion.The basin below the fountain bore the date 1542 until 1889 when the entire basin was replaced.  At the same time the column and figure were repainted.  The old basin was octagonal.  On one face it had the inscription Protege Nos Domine and on another Soli Deo Gloria.  Another face had the date 1542 in Roman numerals and the fourth had an inscription that was unreadable in the 19th century.  The current basin is an exact replica of the Pfeiferbrunnen's basin.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Z\u00e4hringerbrunnen (Hans Hiltprand 1535) at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "Bern Minster (German: Berner M\u00fcnster) is a Swiss Reformed cathedral, (or minster) in the old city of Bern, Switzerland. Built in the Gothic style, its construction started in 1421. Its tower, with a height of 100.6 m (330 ft), was only completed in 1893. It is the tallest cathedral in Switzerland and is a Cultural Property of National Significance.\n\n\n== The building ==\n\nThe Minster of Bern is located on the southern side of the Aare peninsula. The cathedral is oriented east and west like the rest of the Old City of Bern. To the north, M\u00fcnstergasse runs along the side of the building. The west fa\u00e7ade of the M\u00fcnster dominates M\u00fcnsterplatz. On the south side of the cathedral is the M\u00fcnsterplattform.\nIt is a three nave basilica without a transept. The entire cathedral is 84.2 meters (276 ft) long and 33.68 m (110.5 ft) wide. The central nave is 39.37 m (129.2 ft) long by 11.10 m (36.4 ft) wide and is 20.70 m (67.9 ft) high. The two side naves are very similar in dimensions, the north nave is 52.50 m (172.2 ft) long, while the southern one is slightly longer at 52.72 m (173.0 ft). They are both 6.45 m (21.2 ft) wide and 10.40 m (34.1 ft) high. The altar house and choir together are 25.20 m (82.7 ft) long, 10.92 m (35.8 ft) wide and 19.40 m (63.6 ft) high. The cathedral has a single tower in the west, which is 100.60 m (330.1 ft) high. Below the tower, there is a 10.15 m (33.3 ft) long by 10.46 m (34.3 ft) wide, tower hall.There are a total of ten bays in the building. The central nave has five of these bays. Each of the side naves has two bays, with side chapels built against the exterior walls. The last bay is within the choir.The central nave walls are supported by fourteen flying buttresses. Each buttress starts at a decorated column which rises above the roof of the side naves and side chapels. The buttresses rise at an angle of 43\u00b0 30\u2019. The lower side of the buttresses are decorated with egg-shaped cut outs, with vesica piscis and spandrel designs.The majority of the building is built from local sandstone. The vaults are built of brick. In the 18th Century, limestone sheathing was added to the pillars. Most of the sandstone came from a quarry at Ostermundingen. Additional material came from three other quarries, each with differing color and quality. The various stone types were used more or less randomly throughout the entire building. The pillar bases, capitals, windows and sculptures are all from the highest quality, blue sandstone from the Gurten quarry, south of Bern. During reconstruction projects in the 19th and 20th Centuries, several other sandstone types were used.\n\n\n=== West fa\u00e7ade and tower ===\n\nThe three west entrances of the cathedral are located at the back of three large portals. Each of the portals is a different height and differently shaped and decorated. The central portal is decorated with a series of statues that represent the Last Judgment in Christian theology.\nThe bell tower grew in several stages. The lower, rectangular tower was the original tower. The octagonal upper tower was added in the 19th Century. The lower tower is flanked by two round towers and eight pillars. To the north and south, it is supported by buttresses that rise above the northern and southern main portals. The west face of the tower rises above a gallery above the central, west portal. The east face is supported by the central nave. The decoration on the western face of the tower has changed several times over the centuries. The lower, western window is quite short but wide.\nThe upper section of the rectangular tower rises above a second gallery. It has a 12 m (39 ft) high, but narrow window directly above the gallery. The decorations of this section are the work of two master stonemasons, Erhart K\u00fcng and Burkhart Engelberg This section shows much less variation in the design as it was built completely under the direction of these two men. The original tower was capped with a pyramidal roof, elements of which still exist.\nThe two small, stairway towers were built as part of the tower, but were completely rebuilt in the 17th and 18th Centuries.The lower octagonal tower was built in the 16th Century. It has eight, round arch windows. Two hexagonal staircase towers are built outside the tower near the northeast and southeast windows. The small towers are completely self-supporting.The upper octagonal tower was built in the 19th Century in a gothic style. However, some of the ornamentation is based on early 15th Century designs and stands out against the 16th Century lower octagonal tower.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first church on this site probably was a small chapel built during the founding of Bern (1191). The first church of Bern was a romanesque building which was probably built between 1155\u20131160, but is first mentioned in 1224. This church was outside the city walls, near what is now Kreuzgasse. The nave of the first church was about 16.5 m (54 ft) long by 6 m (20 ft) wide.In 1276, Bern broke away from the parish of K\u00f6niz to become an independent parish. For this new role, a larger church would have been necessary. It appears likely that construction on the second church began immediately. However, it isn't mentioned until 1289 in writings of Bishop Benvenutus von Eugubio. This new church was a three nave building, with a length of 29.5 m (97 ft), a width of 24.5 m (80 ft) of which the middle nave was 11.1 m (36 ft) wide. The bell tower was located in the middle of the northern side nave, and filled part of the central nave.\nThe 1356 Basel earthquake caused extensive damage to the church walls, arches, and tower. Repairs proceeded slowly. The choir was rebuilt in 1359 and the roof was rebuilt in 1378\u201380. During the early stages of construction of the Minster, this church was still being used. The nave was finally demolished between 1449\u201351 and the tower remained until 1493.By the 15th Century, Bern had expanded and become a major city-state north of the Alps. To celebrate their growing power and wealth, plans were made to build a new and larger church. On 11 March 1421 construction began on the cathedral under the direction of the Strasbourg master builder Matth\u00e4us Ensinger, who had already built three other cathedrals. During construction, services were held in the old chapel while the new cathedral was built up around it. During the 1440s the unvaulted choir was used for services after a simple roof was built and stained glass windows were installed. After the Old Z\u00fcrich War 1440\u20131446 the nave of the old chapel was removed and work began on the nave and west end, under the chief masons Stefan Hurder and then Niklaus Birenvogt.\nIn 1483 Erhart K\u00fcng (who carved the statues of the Last Judgement) became the master mason. Under his direction the nave walls were raised and the tower was built to the lower octagon. Construction on the lower rectangular tower began in 1481 or 1483 and continued until 1489. The upper rectangular section was built between 1489 and 1518. Following K\u00fcng's death in 1506, Peter Pfister lead the construction and finished the vaulting in the choir. The lower octagonal tower and roof were finished between 1518 and 1521. In 1571 Daniel Heintz was brought in as master mason to finish vaulting the nave and finish the work. The central nave was finished by 1575 and at this point, construction stopped for almost three centuries. The organ was installed in three stages between 1727 and 1783. The bell tower, with the largest bell in Switzerland, wasn't completed until 1893.\n\n\n=== The Reformation in Bern ===\n\nIn 1515, Thomas Wyttenbach, Huldrych Zwingli's teacher, became a priest at the Minster of Bern. In the latter part of Wyttenbach's stay in Bern, a local priest, Berchtold Haller, lived with him. Around the time that Wyttenbach left Bern in 1520 to become a Reformer of his birthplace, Biel, Haller was elected a canon of the cathedral. In 1521, he became friends with Zwingli in Zurich and began to preach more Protestant sermons. In February, 1522, two Fastnacht plays were given at Bern, which attacked the Catholic Church. Due to the rising reformist sentiment, in June 1523, the city council ordered that the words of the Bible should be preached. By 20 November of that year, the nuns left the convent in Bern. But in 1524 the priest Meier, who sympathized with Haller, was compelled to leave Bern. That left Haller the only Protestant among the priests. Then, on 7 April 1525, the council issued a new decree restoring the Catholic worship, though with a few changes.\nIn the following year, the plague came to Bern. The deaths due to the plague converted many of the citizens to the Reformation. In 1527 the Reformed party gained the control of the great council, and it ordered that the new faith should be preached. Still there was a conflict about the mass, as some congregations still observed it. It was decided that there should be a religious disputation at Bern, on 6 January 1528, to settle these questions.\nOn 27 January 1528, the council ordered that throughout the city, all masses should be stopped and all icons should be cast out. On 7 February 1528, it ordered the same for the whole canton. In April 1528, a Protestant service was first celebrated in the Minster. Today's congregation forms part of the Reformed Churches of the Canton Bern-Jura-Solothurn.\n\n\n== The Last Judgement ==\n\nOver the main portal is one of the most complete Late Gothic sculpture collections in Europe. This collection represents the Christian belief in a Last Judgment where the wicked will be separated from the righteous. This sculpture shows the wicked naked on the right, while the righteous stand clothed in white on the left. In the center is Justice, with Saints and the wise and foolish virgins around her. In the centre stands Michael the Archangel with a raised sword.\nThe sculptures of the Last Judgement were the only statues in the Minster to survive the iconoclasm of the Protestant Reformation. The 47 large free-standing statues are replicas (the originals are in Bern History Museum), and the 170 smaller figures are all original. The Last Judgement was the work of one sculptor, Erhard K\u00fcng from Stadtlohn, Westphalia, which gives the collection a unity of design. The Justice sculpture is the only one that was done by another artist. It is signed by Daniel Heintz, who was the master builder after 1571. The rest of the statues were carved some time between 1460 and 1501, most likely between 1460 and 1480.The trumeau to each side and between the doors has thirteen life-size figures. The middle figure and the two figures on each side of the door are raised by about half their height above the other figures. The figures on the left of the door represent the five Foolish Virgins while the ones on the right are the Wise Virgins. Below the outer two Wise Virgins and the two Foolish Virgins, two faces peer out of the wall on each side. On the wise side, they represent the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon. On the foolish side, they represent Zephaniah and, maybe, Isaiah. In the center, between the two doors, is Justice flanked by two angels. Below Justice and the angels is a scroll commemorating the laying of the cornerstone in 1421.The archivolt features three rows of figures. The inner two rows are attached to the wall and lay at an angle which follows the curve of the portal. The outer, third row features statues that stand upright on individual platforms. The inner row contains five angels with the instruments of the Passion. The second row contains eight Old Testament prophets. The outer row is Jesus, Mary and the Apostles, including John the Baptist and Paul, but not Judas Iscariot.The tympanum is 4.75 m (15.6 ft) wide at the base. It is made up of thirteen individual sections. The bottom row is made up of three plates located about 10 cm (3.9 in) above the lintel. It is 38 cm (15 in) deep and about 50\u201360 cm (20\u201324 in) high. On the left side of the tympanum, it contains two rows of figures and on the right, three. The lower figures are nearly fully three-dimensional, while the upper figures are mostly carved in relief, with only the head and shoulders projecting out of the stone. Above these three plates, the remaining ten plates are arraigned in three rows. The bottom row is made up of four plates which rest on a 30\u201340 cm (12\u201316 in) high base. The plates are high relief carvings, each about 38 cm (15 in) deep and an average of about 1 m (3.3 ft) high. The figures were all carved with a rock pick. In the center of the tympanum is the Archangel Michael. He stands on his platform which is projected forward from the rest of the figures. The entire tympanum represents Heaven and Hell in the Last Judgment.\n\n\n== Interior ==\n\nThe Minster was built by the city of Bern as a symbol of the growing power of this city-state. The interior was therefore designed to awe the citizens as well as foreign visitors. The central nave was built in a lacy gothic style with enormous stained glass windows and numerous altars in side chapels. The Gothic style allowed a taller central nave and larger windows than had been possible before, creating an impressive and (for the time) light and airy structure.\n\n\n=== Altars ===\nMany altars were financed by local families, creating a wealth of art and sculpture in the cathedral. However, in 1528 all 43 side altars were removed during the iconoclasm of the Protestant Reformation. Nearly all the interior paintings and decorations were removed and dumped in the neighboring M\u00fcnsterplattform. The empty chapels were filled with extra pews, creating three naves. Since that time, the interior of the cathedral has remained relatively empty and austere.\n\n\n=== Stained glass ===\n\nThe stained glass windows of the cathedral are considered the most valuable in Switzerland. The some of the windows date from 1441\u20131450. The right hand windows were damaged during a hailstorm in 1520 and replaced in 1868. Many of the windows include both heraldic symbols and religious images placed side by side. The windows are 2.92 m (9 ft 7 in) wide in the middle and 13.15 m (43 ft 2 in) high. Most of the windows have twenty lower panels, each 61 cm (24 in) by 92 cm (36 in), and twenty upper panels, each 61 cm (24 in) by 105 cm (41 in).There are seven windows in the choir of the Minster. Some of the panels have been moved or replaced since the windows were originally built. Facing the choir, from left to right, the current windows are: Hostienm\u00fchle, Three Kings, Bible scenes, Passion/Ten thousand martyrs, Christ, Stephanus and Coat of Arms windows. Only portions of the Passion and Ten thousand martyrs windows remain, so they were combined into a single window. The Christ window was added to replace the damaged Ten thousand martyrs window. The Stephanus and Coat of Arms windows replaced earlier, unknown windows.The Hostienm\u00fchle window was built between 1448\u20131453 and was funded by the city of Bern. The Three Kings window was built between 1447 and 1455 for Rudolf von Ringoltingen, possibly in Constance or the Oberrhein region. The Bible scenes window was originally supposed to be just of the young Christ, but was changed after 1447. It was built between 1448 and 1451 and was funded by three members of the Gesellschaft zum Mittell\u00f6wen. The Passion window was built between 1438 and 1441. Only 21 panels of the original window remain. It was built for the city through the Schulthei\u00df by Hans Acker in Ulm. The Ten thousand martyrs window was originally supposed to be of the Resurrection of Jesus, but that was changed after 1447. It was built between 1447 and 1449 and was funded by donations from the citizens of Bern. It was built by Master Painter Bernhart and glazier Niklaus Magerfritz in Bern. The Ten thousand martyrs window was replaced in 1868 by the Christ window. The Stephanus window replaced an earlier window in 1868. The theme of the original window is unknown but it was built in 1449\u20131451 for Kaspar von Scharnachtal, probably by Niklaus Magerfritz in Bern. The Coat of Arms window was built in 1820\u201330 to replace an earlier, unknown window.\n\nOne very interesting window is the \"Dance of Death\" window located near the choir on the south side nave. The first Dance of Death plays originated during the Black Death of the 14th Century and remained popular during the 14th and 15th Century. By 1425, the figures from the plays appeared in the cemetery of the Church of the Holy Innocents in Paris. The figures on the M\u00fcnster window were done by Niklaus Manuel between 1516 and 1519. The stained glass window in the Cathedral is an excellent example of this theme. The window shows death, in the form of a skeleton, claiming people from every station in life. The Dance of Death served to remind the viewer that death will happen to everyone regardless of station or wealth.\n\n\n=== Choir stalls ===\n\nThe Choir, in the eastern side of the Cathedral between the nave and the sanctuary, houses the first Renaissance Choir Stalls in Switzerland. There are 21 seats on the Evangelisten side and 27 on the Epistel side. The stalls are richly carved with both animals and images of daily life.\nIn 1517, the town council hired Bernhard Burenfind from Solothurn to build the stalls. He began selecting and cutting oak wood for the stalls. However, for an unknown reason, he did not complete the work and was not asked to complete any other projects in Bern. On 26 September 1522, Bern tried to hire a master carpenter from Schaffhausen for 30 pounds. In the same year, Niklaus Manuel and three others were sent to Geneva to examine the choir stalls there. On 5 December 1522, Jacob Ruess and Heini Seewagen from Schaffhausen were hired to complete the work on the stalls. They were paid much more than the 30 pounds that Bern had wanted to pay. They were paid 300 pounds in 1522, followed by 150 in the next year, 300 in 1524. They finished the work in 1525. The original stalls were repaired and renovated in 1863\u201364 and the carvings were repaired in 1897.\n\n\n=== Organ ===\n\nThe first organ in the Cathedral was built nearly 200 years after construction was completed. The first great organ was built in 1726\u201330. The town council voted to have the organ built on 5 June 1726. They hired Gottlieb Leuw from Bremgarten in September 1726. By January 1730 his work was nearly finished and the town began searching for an organist. While the main organ was finished in 1730, the ornamentation and finish work continued until 1736. This first organ had 38 organ stops, with a breast and back work as well as an echo work with pedals.In 1746, the council decided that the organ needed to be rebuilt. On 16 September 1748, they reached an agreement with Victor Ferdinard Bossart to do so. On 1 June 1752, they signed a contract with Johann August Nahl to do the exterior decoration on the new organ. The rebuilt organ had 43 organ stops, and was built in a late-baroque style. It was renovated in 1827.When the new organ balcony and screen were built in 1845\u201348 above the western entrance by Beat Rudolf von Sinner, the organ was completely rebuilt and was known as the second organ. The organ builder Friedrich Haas from Winterthur increased the number of stops to 55. The number of consoles was changed to three.The third organ was built in 1903/04 by Friedrich Groll from Lucerne. While the exterior remained virtually untouched, the interior was rebuilt. Pneumatic tubes, slider chests and a mechanical action were added to the organ. However, the sound produced by this new organ was unpleasant. The interior of the organ was completely rebuilt in 1930.The 1930 organ is the current one in the cathedral. It was restored in 1998\u20131999. The organ is currently used for a series of concerts throughout the year.\n\n\n== Bell tower ==\nThe tower is open to the public, for a small fee. The lower viewing platform requires a climb up 254 steps and provides a view over Bern and perhaps as far as the Alps. The upper spire is also accessible by climbing an additional 90 steps from the lower platform.The largest bell in the tower is a 10.5 ton bell which was cast in 1611. It is the largest bell in Switzerland. The bells in the tower are rung daily at noon and at 6 p.m. It is possible to stand near the bells when they are rung, but it is necessary to cover one's ears to prevent hearing damage.\n\n\n== M\u00fcnsterplattform (Minster Terrace) ==\nThe Minster Terrace (in German: M\u00fcnsterplattform) was built during 1334 and the mid 15th Century as a large churchyard. During the Protestant Reformation the paintings and statues of the Cathedral altars were dumped in the churchyard. Some of the art work has been found in archeological digs conducted on the terrace. During the 20th century, the terrace was changed from a graveyard to an open plaza. Lime and chestnut trees were planted and pathways were laid out, providing a pleasant park in the old city. The terrace towers over the Matte section of the old city and the Aare.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArchitecture of Switzerland\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOld Cathedral Photograph\nOverall Cathedral View\nCathedral Organ\nBern Tourism: M\u00fcnster Cathedral\u2014short description\nbernermuenster.ch (in German)\nTravelogue of Bern Cathedral \u2013 via YouTube\nA history of Berne Munster",

          "I visited the Cathedral at Munsterplatz (Munster Kirche) in December 2019. The weather was very rainy. I went inside and had a quick look. The cathedral was undergoing renovation so it was not convenient to spend a lot of time here. You can get a good photo of the cathedral",
          "If you're in Old City, you may as well stop by and see the beautiful architecture and hear the bells ring. There is a cheese & misc. food market right next to it on Saturdays as well.",
          "Beautiful cathedral currently undergoing some renovation. You can enter for free but a guided tour will set you back a few CHF, May it be noted that photos and videos (even with your mobile phone) is not permitted inside.",
          "We took the challenge to walk up 300+ steps up for the breathtaking view of Bern city \ud83e\udd13 tiring but rewarding as the views up there was beautiful and many spots to take photos of the city. Nobody to rush you except your partner \ud83d\ude0b",
          "We didn\u2019t get to see much of the cathedral as large parts of it were roped off for repairs or renovations. Very pretty from the outside but there are other more impressive churches in the area I think.",
          "The charming Gothic Berner M\u00fcnster is the country's tallest cathedral. After the plague came to Bern in 1526, many citizens converted to Reformation and by 1528 masses were stopped and icons cast out and the church became a reformation church.",
          "The cathedral is a work of art, in its architecture, stained glass windows, and little sculptures at the entrance. It's also a nice place to sit in peace for a few minutes.",
          "Living in bern for one year and I never peeked inside the Munster! Pretty nice I interior much like the rest of Europe. We paid 5 Franks for a ticket to walk to the top... after climbing 300+ very narrow and winding stairs a We get to the top and it was so worth it! Amazing",
          "Yesterday we were visiting the cathedral in Bern, which has some really beautifully carved chairs and benches and stained-glass windows, but the highlight is the tower (ticket fee 5chf),from where you have a beautiful 360-degree view over the entire city. This was the best",
          "It took some walk to get to this cathedral from train station. The art work at the entrance is magnificent. Looking from inside were those beautifully colour stained windows. The chairs looked ancient and classical. Many have been designated to people of certain position",
          "We decided to stop at this cathedral after visiting the Kunst Art Gallery. I sat in a pew and looked at the beautiful stained glass windows.",
          "An exhilarating climb up ~340 steps to the top, but the views are well worthwhile. Cost is reasonable, really enjoyed the experience.",
          "An absolutely beautiful Cathedral set in the center of town. You can see it set prominently from almost anywhere. Style in a Gothic architectural design. Very stunning. They are doing a lot of construction repairs on the building and were unable to go inside. Very sorry to have",
          "We didn't make it inside before the church closed, but even from the outside you can tell it's stunning! Sculpting above the doorway shows what I believe is heaven and hell I'm vivid colours.",
          "This impressive cathedral, set in its own platz is a contrast to say, Basel's Munster, which is red. This cathedral with its white/grey stone and impressive tower is visible all over Bern. The usual breathtaking interior and wonderful carved porch are an entree to the 344 steps",
          "The two best parts of this, another big church, to me was the side court park with a great beautiful Aare River view and the front entry depiction. Bring gold, enter. Bad gets you tother. 'nouff said. Oh, and the architecture is nice if only its funding didn't detract from",
          "The Cathedral at Munsterplatz is situated not far from Budesplatz, the Zytglogge Clock Tower and is adjacent to the famous Kramgasse Street and the Einstein House. Construction began around 1421; its tower and spires are easily recognizable from many points around Bern. The",
          "This is a gothic church near the old city of Bern, built in 15th century. It is also part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site in the old city. Behind the church is Munsterplatform where is a park with trees and benches. It is a viewing platform of the Bern city from different",
          "Well, if you are in Bern to enjoy the beautiful monuments and views then I would recommend one of two, you either go all the way up this cathedral and enjoy the view of the city, or you would have a walk nearby the cathedral and enjoy looking at the cathedral and taking pictures",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral with a storied past. Which you can look up in any guidebook or Google search. They are VERY enthusiastic about their no picture/video policy at the Munster Kirche. I am abjectly obedient when it comes to this sort of thing, but I do enjoy,",
          "So many things to do in Bern but this is a must to walk up the 260 steps to the top and view the city from up their amazing great photos to take also view the bells fascinating as so old .",
          "Though this cathedral is not spectacular, it is a nice Gothic church and the tallest church in Switzerland and has its largest bell. There is some interesting stained glass and the statues of saints on the ceiling are unusual. The best part, however, is the view of Bern and the",
          "Rising over the old town, The Cathedral of Bern stands as the tallest cathedral in Switzerland. This is a great church, in a beautiful city, with phenomenal views. There is a fee to climb the stairs to view Bern and the surrounding region from the top of the building. It is",
          "As your basic cathedral goes, this one is fairly typical and not outstanding. You can take the spiral steps up the leak of the tower, but requires a lot of effort, easier ways to see the view.",
          "I didn't have the opportunity to see the cathedral from the inside. It's a beautiful building with a nice platform on the back (M\u00fcnsterplattform) that has a perfect view of the Aare river from above.",
          "My nephew is atheletic and eager to climb stairs. With about 300 steps upward, we were able to see the city of Bern, and the Zytglogge. On the way down, the bell was ringing. It was very load but we could peek the bell in action.",
          "The frieze at the entry to this Cathedral is amazing, and worth searching out an explanation of its meaning. While inside it is a little plainer than many big churches, the stained glass and organ stand out. It is worth spending the extra 5chf to climb to the highest point",
          "lovely stone architecture and main portal decor with the foolish and wise virgins on both sides of the door. check out the artwork over the main entry. we were there Sunday morning, planned to get back to go inside ... never did make it back... maybe next time.",
          "You literally can't miss it, and you shouldn't. From almost any vantage point in the Old City the cathedral claims the skyline. The gothic architecture was rightfully located at one of the higher points in the Old City overlooking the Aare river.",
          "This place is beautiful. The attention to detail is out of this world. The stained glass all 9f the stone work wow you can't miss seeing this cathedral.",
          "It is being refurbished in the outside, but the building is still beautiful. The views inside are impressive and the entrance is free",
          "This Cathedral is impressive inside and out. WHile the Stain Glass Windwos are more impressive at the Lausanne Cathedral, the view is more impressive here! It is well worth the price to walk up the 312 steps to the top of the Bell Tower. The view of Bern is beautiful! One cannot",
          "The entrance to the church is free but a fee to walk to the top of the church. Inside there's beautiful stained glass window and a hugh wind instrument on the second floor. It would be nice to come in and have a look.",
          "I had so little time. I almost run inside it. Every angle I saw astonished me. I want to visit many more times and have more time to live the energy of it. Feel the auro of it to the fullest.",
          "It partly looks like it is of roman style, but has details that are rather gothic. Apparently built in many stages at different times in history.",
          "We arrived a few minutes before the church needed to be closed for a wedding, but the exterior carvings are beautiful and intricate. Be sure to walk around to the beautiful, relaxing park behind the munster for incredible views of the North side of the river and to catch the",
          "This Cathedral is really well preserved. I like Gothic and really this place is an example of this kind of architecture. The park in front and the view on the river are really beautiful.",
          "Reminded me of York Minster. Impressive on the outside (the inside was closed) and lovely garden around the back to admire views over the river.",
          "Not only the cathedral is impressive, the tower is as well. A bit work to climb up the stairs, but absolutely worth it: you have the occasion to see the town in all directions, watch the Alps and also experince the biggest bell of Switzerland.",
          "Construction of Switzerland's largest church began in 1421; the spire was completed in 1893. One of the most significant aspects is the Last Judgment, which shows the naked wicked on the right, while the righteous stand clothed on the left.",
          "The cathedral itself is not a particularly unique or awe inspiring piece of architecture, assuming you have seen other European cathedrals. It is a well adorned gothic cathedral that is a unique piece of Bern's history. The real excitement at Munsterplatz, however, is the trip",
          "We sat for 20 min. And rested from the walking and the noise of touring. Lovely church with beautiful carving in wood and in stone. No charge for entry.",
          "The Cathedral at Munsterplatz is open daily hours vary and entrance is free. One can walk up the stairs to tour the tower (5CHF). This cathedral is the tallest in all of Switzerland! As you walk in, make a note to look above all the doors at the front of the cathedral and",
          "A splendid cathedral to explore but the true gem is the view from the top. Worth the climb but you need to be fairly fit to do it. If you\u2019re into geocaching then there\u2019s a nice reward at the top of you ask for it!",
          "In a word - wow! Amazing old church with an interesting history and some of the most beautiful, intricate stained glass windows I\u2019ve ever seen. Definitely worth stopping in if in Bern old town.",
          "The interior of the cathedral is free entrance and worth visiting...then, you have the opportunity to go up what is the tallest cathedral in Switzerland and to enjoy the 360 degr\u00e9s view. Enjoy.",
          "The church itself is average but the church gardens have nice views of the aare river and the mountains.",
          "Beautiful church that affords the tallest view in Switzerland ( building). Over 300 steps to the top. No need to go to the gym the day you visit.",
          "You can't miss it... you can see it from almost everywhere in old city. It is one of the many Gothic churches that can be found around Europe. Beutifully lighted in the evening... it is nice to see it from the opposite bank of the river.... it adds a lot to the magical views",
          "A nice coffee in the \"platz\" (albeit expensive) with a beautiful view. I come here everytime i go to Berne.",
          "It costs 2 CHF to climb the spire and it\u2019s well worth it. The views from the top are amazing and I swear it feels like you can reach out and touch the alps. In front of the church is a small square where they build a \u201cpop up\u201d market in the winter time. They also serve",
          "A beautiful cathedral on the edge of the Alstadt. It sits right next to a pretty park about the river. The is also a nice square at the front",
          "Started in the 15th century with the top of its tower completed at the end of the 19th--in fact, a teenage Klee drew the \"M\u00fcnster\u201d without its spire. A colorful Last Judgement crowning the main portal shows a little devil applying a pair of pliers to a sinner's most sensitive",
          "I got som pictures from there, it was really nice. Last time I was there in Bern, they\u2019re renovating many places including this Cathedral. \ud83d\ude0a",
          "You cannot miss this imposing Cathedral in the Bern old Town. It belongs to the Swiss Reformed church. The highlight is that you can climb the 220+ steps to go up the bell tower and get a magnificent 360 degree view of the city and the alps in the far distance. You can if you",
          "We did read any travel guide but just headed toward the Munster haus. Walking around we came across the park behind it built up on the walls of Old town. Well worth it the church itself is spectacular and spire is beautiful",
          "This cathedral is very large and has a very prominent location in the city. There is a large courtyard in front of the cathedral. They were having a wedding while we were touring the area.",
          "When you visit Old Town Bern - you must visit the beautiful cathedral and admire its marvelous internal and external architecture. You can relax in the verdant cathedral garden and enjoy the lovely view of Aare River.",
          "The garden behind the church was my favourite part, as well as leaving. Just another gothic church..",
          "The munster is visible from all over in Bern, because it is the heights point in the old city. It is a sort of guide, that drives you in the right direction. The place is absolutely amazing from outside. There is a big square, where normally is empty or occupied during special",
          "We were very disappointed that we were unable to go inside as there was a private concert occurring. But just being able to stand outside and admire and appreciate the amazing statuary and sculpture about and around the one old entry door that is no longer in use was joy enough!",
          "Disabled parking close by. Ramps for wheelchair. Inside stunning and highly recommended. Lovely views walking around the grounds.",
          "The Bern Munster Cathedral in Old Town Bern is a very imposing Gothic church. It can easily be spotted and architecturally very pretty. Don't miss it if you are in Bern.",
          "The Munster itself is not that big, work starting in the 1400's and a lot of the work was only completed in the 1800's but the depictions of heaven & hell at the main doors and the views from the parapets over Bern are well worth the 5 Francs. The adjacent Gardens next to the",
          "The Munster Kirche in Bern is a lovely cathedral however what I found to be the most impressive part was the entrance. The intricate carvings of heaven and hell were incredible. It was wonderful to see how well preserved they are as they have a large overhang which protects",
          "This cathedral is an integral part of old Bern and it is located in a very nice square with other great buildings. Cathedral is quite impressive inside as well",
          "A gorgeous old church that is worth the visit! :) There are tours you can take. I love the plattform behind the church where you can simply hang out, have a coffee or take some wonderful photos of the city.",
          "The largest cathedral of Bern, located in the centre of old town. Spare 30 mins at least to explore it and take bell tower steps if have time. This offers bird's eye view of entire Bern town.",
          "The guide gave us the whole history o the Chapel and understanding of the picture on the Church. from there on we walked to the bear garden and rose garden. We spent some quality time n Bern.",
          "In the main entrance above the door is a hand carved story of heaven and hell...take a moment to absorbed it. You can climb the bell tower and the view from the top over the rooftops of the old town will take your breath away. The bell tower took four centuries to raise to its",
          "This Gothic style cathedral, dating back to 15th century is well worth the visit. You can only photograph the outside, but not the insides of the cathedral.",
          "This was the highlight of my trip to Bern. The church exterior and interior were beautiful. The glass-stained windows were beautiful. The carvings on the exterior walls were intricate. Someone was playing the organ when we visited, which I thought was a bonus. The music was",
          "You can't help but not to go in, the church's fa\u00e7ade is amazing and obviously tells a story of good and evil, heaven and hell. You just have to go in to see the inside and it is very beautiful, the stained glass alone is incredible. I thought this was a very beautiful church",
          "This is very unique Church! Besides that his so beautiful inside, you can have a chance only for 5 franks to climb to the top! and it is very good experience! this is highest building in the city, and from the top you can find and amazing view, and it is very very high! but",
          "Seen a lot of cathedral and churches in Europe. This is impressive. Didn't have enough time to see the inside.",
          "Tall & impressive, the location of the cathedral in a lovely part of the city makes it all the more attractive..",
          "Marvellous ceiling paintings and a top view over Matten quarter in the Swiss capital. No fear of heights? Go for it!",
          "The cathedral is a grand building, especially the tower stands out due to its extreme height. The entrance is richly decorated, therefore the interior is quite a surprise. It is adorned with slender gothic arches forming a beautiful ceiling, but that is about it. Practically no",
          "Not a lot to see inside, but you can climb the tower for about 5 Swiss francs. The church is Gothic. Be sure to see the sculpted figures outside the entrance doors, and the gargoyles above.",
          "Growing up looking at the Cathedral every day one gets a good sense of history knowing that this tower has been built over centuries. Living in the US one of the things I miss the most are the bells ringing on weekends and holidays. They are absolutely beautiful and with a",
          "This is a very nice place with lots of space and chairs and tables to sit around. Nice restaurants and bars in nearby streets.",
          "I was amazed to see the cathedral this old. Massive. Very old that I have seen for long time. Must visit place",
          "Beautiful cathedral, being restored externally, but very beautiful inside. You can climb the bell tower.",
          "This cathedral is not located in an obvious place and one has to look for it a bit. The most impressive feature is the restored fa\u00e7ade with its sculptures. Like many other cathedrals that turned to protestant houses of worship, the interior is bare. The stained glass windows",
          "It was, to say the least, a rigorous climb, and honestly I rested four times along the way and the peepholes near the top are genuinely scary to look down through. Yet the view up is breathtaking, showing all of the Alstadt, the Aare and the alps afar. Note that there is a",
          "The cathedral in the Old Town is a must visit when in Bern. The beautiful and elegant building dominates the skyline of the historical part of Bern. The interior is impressive and a bit solemn at the same time, with beautiful old wooden prayer benches. The ceiling is exquisitely",
          "Very impressive architecture the main entrance has a mural very detailed and interesting. Inside the church is an explanation of the mural and a painting so you can admire all the detail up close.",
          "I visited this cathedral on Sunday noon and it was extraordinary to me that a sight like this wasn't crowded with tourists. It is really beautiful and has a great story in its sculptures.",
          "The construction of the cathedral started in 1421 and took generations to complete. The end result is one of the most beautiful cathedrals I\u2019ve visited. Too bad there was some restoration work with scaffolds. The tower is 100 meters high and worth the steps and small fee.",
          "Tremendous beauty of the towering gothic spires. In addition is the statue of St Peter in the square. Unfortunately there were scaffolding in side that prevents an objective view of the inside.",
          "The beautiful Cathedral is definitely worth visiting with a nice square in front and a lovely park to the side. The interior is stunning but get yourself up those steps for that view, well worth the small amount it costs.",
          "Interesting stained glass, and a modern aeolian organ. Plenty of choice in the shop, The M\u00fcnster Christmas market was a step in quality above the general market in the town, more hand craft work.",
          "One of most beautiful cathedrals i ever see... its one of attractions you must see at Bern ...if you do t then you really do big mistake",
          "Finally: the scaffolding is gone ! For decades Berns Cathedral was hidden behind renovation works now finally the tower with 100m height is unpacked. Xmas galore !...",
          "This red sandstone cathedral is awesome (in the old and new sense) - the sculpted pulpit is a work of art, the medieval tombstones of local knights very evocative - the armour and even the swords are carved in precise details",
          "Beautiful church. Make sure you walk to the top for wonderful views of the city and mountains. The church itself is very beautiful...but they charge to go in! They also do not allow photos.",
          "A beautiful cathedral, Munsterplatz is also a look back in time. The climb to the very top is worth it, if you can handle steep stairs and high places! The view is incredible, you can see the Alps on a good day. The guides said that morning is best for views, before the clouds",
          "The view of of the exterior is breathtaking.Kudos to the architects and the artisans for building such a marvelous monument.Admire the intricate details.",
          "Very excellent tower climb. So different as half of the climb is open air because of the unique design of the tower. Beautiful view of the city from two viewing decks.",
          "We had a delightful little tour of the old town in Bern taking in the many delights of this fascinating capital city of Switzerland,culminating in a visit to this lovely cathedral. It was quite different to many other large churches,and the outside was probably more interesting",
          "The Cathedral itself is like pretty much like every other one, although as it is free to visit it is worth the time. But if you go and you can manage 352 steps up then for 5 swiss francs you can go up the tower. This will afford you one of the best views in Bern as you have a",
          "The front archway showed on one half a good person going to heaven, and a bad person going to hell, this was to convince people to be good and follow the right path with god. Inside you were not allowed to take photos but the amazing decor & stain glass windows some dating back",
          "I especially enjoy cathedrals which provide the opportunity to climb to the top of the towers and Bern is in that category. Just 5 Swiss Francs, great views from the highest vantage point in Bern. The various sculptural decorations and details are interesting to see, including",
          "The outside is very beautiful. The inside is nice to see, but there isn't that much to look at. Unfortunately we were there in a torrential downpour, so we didn't go up the tower.",
          "Climb to the bell tower, it is free and is great view of the town. The glass windows were great and the ceiling",
          "Great Cathedral and if able, do he climb all the way up the bell tower. They are one direction staircases so that is easier with the kids.",
          "Someone was playing the big organ when we stopped in. It was very impressive. Climbed the tower for views of town and a closer look at high stone work. Definitely worth the effort. Could even see Alps in the hazy distance. Also liked the statuary at the entrance.",
          "We went up the tower, it costs a few francs, but is worth it if you are up for 400 stairs each way to the top. The view is brilliant and you can go into the bell chambers. If you have a lot of spare energy and fancy seeing the city from above - go!",
          "The church is a nice. It's a great way to get out of the sun or heat whiIe walking around Bern. They have it set up so that you can buy a ticket up the tower at the entrance and walk through the church on your way down, or you can just go into the church. It's just under 400",
          "The Bern Munster is not the most beautiful cathedral I\u2019ve seen but it is worth visiting to see the stained glass windows and the Last Judgement sculpture above the main entrance. The Munsterplattform to the side of the Munster is a nice place to sit and and admire the view.",
          "Wonderful place to spend some time in Old Town. Beautiful alcoves and stained glass. A must see while in Bern.",
          "We went in May 2017. The original statues for the last judgement were in the Bern historical Museum. I was happy to see they still had a version on the church. We were able to walk in and walk around. My husband climbed the towers. I think when it's busier, you probably need",

          "Beautiful church, there is a garden by the side of the church. In and outside very detailed built beautifully.",
          "An older church with a breathtaking view at the top. Climbing to the top is worth the view. It is a smaller spiral staircase to the top, so be aware if you are not a fan of \"tighter\" places.",
          "Good to see this around the outside for the ornate stone sculptures / carvings. The last judgement over the main arch is a must. There was too much building works going on inside to really appreciate the full majesty of the building but we did pay 5 francs each to go climb the",
          "The cost of going up the tower is CHF5.00. Its totally worth it. You can see 360 of Bern old town, including the river Aare. I went at 10am and there were little tourist. So, i get to spend a little more time. You may get a little dizzy on the way up and down. They have railings",
          "Beautiful and tall cathedral that is worth finding a distant view of. Only disappointment from this week's visit is the ton of scaffolding everywhere.",

          "Explore the most magnificent views of Bern for a small fee and burn some calories. There are no elevators here but a series of spiral steps to take you to spectacular 360 degree views of the city. If you are a photographer this is a must add to the list when visiting Bern.",
          "The most interesting thing about this church is the outside. Inside the church has some stained glass windows. The alter is being remodeled. There is not much to see inside and other churches in Europe are more interesting.",
          "Europe is filled with old churches. This is one in Switzerland that while in Bern should be visited. No admission, definitely worthwhile to visit.",

          "Great View of Bern from its gothic cathedral's tower top! No elevatot some 400 steps on a spiralling stairs. Amazing gothic architecture.",

          "Unlike its Catholic equivalents, the inside of the Munster is very austere although it boasts some beautiful stained glass. The exterior is stunning with amazingly detailed carvings above the main entrance.",
          "If you have been to other European Cathedrals, you will notice how bare and minimal the inside of this cathedral is. On a glance it might not even appear to be worth a visit compared to the splendor and brilliance of other cathedrals. Yet, the true story here is driven by what",

          "There are quite a lot of steps before you get to the top however the view once there is well worth it. Being the highest build was great to look down on the surrounding streets and roof tops. At only 5 franc's is also good value",
          "But worth it for the views from the top, especially on a clear day. The views of the distant mountains are stunning, and it's fabulous to see the rest of the town from the top of the cathedral.",
          "As of March 2017, the choir and apse with their fine vaulted ceiling, the best stained glass, and the famous sculpted choir stalls are under restoration and not open to the public, but you can still see the impressive nave, the organ, and the facade sculpture showing the Last",

          "If you're scared of heights then going to the top of this cathedral definitely isn't for you. We are normally ok with being up high, but there is something about an old building which challenged us mentally. The views were amazing, and it was a gorgeous example of this kind of",
          "This church has a very unique architectural design. It is a must see when in Bern. Beside the church is a park overlooking the senic riverside.",
          "The main doors of the cathedral are very ornate and well worth approaching. The platform behind/south of the cathedral also offers wonderful views and could be easily missed, go and seek it out!",
          "There was scaffolding up when I went, so no great pictures of the cathedral, but then I went up the stairs. What a view! You must be okay with a LOT of stairs but the view is worth it! There are a few places to stop on the way up and each stop provides another cool spot to",
          "While we were able to get a good view of the entrance door from the outside, unfortunately major renovation works inside meant that much was hidden by scaffolding. It is a little disappointing that no photos are allowed inside; not sure why ?",
          "The Cathedral is a must see in Bern. The inside of the church is less impressive than those unused to protestant churches might expect. But reformation in the middle ages got rid of most of the Catholic splendor. Nevertheless it is am impressive Cathedral not least because of",
          "From the platform you can enjoy the view to the river Aare with the Schwellenm\u00e4tteli and down to the small City district Matte. Down there you have spoken Matten - Gib mer e Ligu Lem - Give me a piece of bread. On the tower sweeps your views over the city and the Alps.",

          "This is a really neat cathedral, and when we went it was undergoing some maintenance/cleaning of the sandstone walls and surfaces of the structure, so we didn't see as much as I was hoping. However, our friends and hosts suggested a picnic in the adjacent park, which was a nice",
          "There are some impressive churches in Europe, so it makes sense to talk in terms of what stands out about a particular church. They are all enormous, ornate, and took years to build. This one in particular is known for its impressive \"portal\" at the front. The organ is also",

          "The interior of the Bern Cathedral is nice enough, if a little plain apart from its lovely stained glass. The really special part, however, is the cathedral's front portal (the area around the main door). It has ornate carvings of the Last Judgment with all the figures painted",

          "Even on a rainy day, the time spent inside the church and then the climb up over 250 steps was worth the effort. Unlike other cathedrals in Western Europe, the climb up allows you ascending views at various stages through rectangular windows. While you catch your breath, soak in",

          "After half a millennium, this cathedral is still under construction, meaning that scaffolding mars the view of and from the tower. Only a small bits of the late gothic decorative program survived protestant iconoclasm, but the last judgement scene at the west portal is",
          "Well, let's say you need to be slightly in good shape to walk all the stairs up but I can guarantee you that the view is definitely a reward! There is no way one could stop taking a picture after another. So good. Bern's roofs and the smoke fuming out the chimneys seem coming",
          "We couldn't see enough of the outside to know fully what it is like due to restoration work, and the interior was marred by loud baning from workmen erecting scaffolding. However, we could see the wonderful 15th century glass that survived disastrous Reformation iconoclasm. The",

          "Berne is not an attractive city, and the cathedral keeps that form going. Its in a very dull plain square, nothing to draw you to it, its rather a plain red block of a building, and nothing interesting inside. Better off trying to find something of interest as you wander around,",

          "The cathedral was very nice. Pictures were not allowed. I had to buy a couple of post cards to take home a memory which is probably their intent. However, what won me over was when the organ started playing. I love the sound of pipe organs, so we sat and listened to the",
          "I we were not disappointed with the Cathedral, we expect another thing in so beautiful city.- In spite of this review which seems negative I recommend the visitors to take a look at the Cathedral.- It is located in the center of the city and will take you a few minutes walking",

          "We had the most amazing experience as our son was invited following his confirmation to see the bell tower in the Munster Kirche. Now we're per say church tourists but this is something that reawakened my interest. The church is the tallest in Switzerland 100meters and has",
          "I didn't go to to the top, but the inside was really cool. The decorations, for the time period, are beautiful and restrained. If you walk to the front, you can see all the funny faces on the ceiling. Very cool old choir stalls too. Neat experience.",
          "I happened to catch the Munster on a particularly slow day for tourism, so for a while, I had the place nearly to myself. It's one of the most beautiful churches I've visited \u2014 and hard not to have a spiritual experience here, even if you're not religious. It's also adorned",

          "Beautiful church with stained glass windows to rival any others we have seen. We were lucky enough to hear someone playing the pipe organ, which is enormous. Just don't understand why you are not allowed to take flashless photos in some churches. This was one of them and had",

          "The exterior of the Cathedral has some of the most beautifully restored and painted figures I've ever seen, and is worth a look even if the Cathedral itself is closed. The setting is also terrific: one one side it fronts a gorgeous medieval square, with a quaint fountain. And",

          "So like many churches in Switzerland, the insides are a little plan, and this is no different. However, if you like heights or a bit of an adrenaline rush walk up the stairs to the tower. Its so fun and scary. My legs were jelly. So fun. And when you reach the top you will have",

          "It is interesting to see the work that is being completed on the restoration of the cathedral. The completed works, juxtaposed with the yet to be completed works really shows the effort that the restoration team is putting in. IT is going to look stunning when completed. While",

          "The problem, sometimes, with Reformed churches in places like Switzerland is that they don't have much of real interest for the tourist: whatever you think about Catholicism, for example, their churches on the Continent often have many artistic pleasures to explore. Bern M\u00fcnster",
          "Great exterior of church, and free to enter. Able to climb to get good view of town and square. But, Europe has so many churches, you become pretty laid back about visiting them.",
          "This cathedral was unique in its brightly painted 3D scenes above the entrances as well as on ceilings. The church, in most ways, is less ornate than what you'd see in other countries, but still beautiful in its own way, including Sainte-Chappelle-style stained glass. While",
          "Worth spending time to look at the marvel of the great church and then the intricate carvings above the door. The story of the carvings is very depictive of the time. The whole square of the church is very peaceful and a highlight of Bern.",
          "The cathedral has a classic Gothic architecture and feel. But somehow, the current renovation/restoration/scaffolding ruins a good photo.",
          "This stunning building in the old town is the tallest cathedral in Switzerland. The Munsterplatz area to the south of the Catheral offers superb views over the south side of the city and the Aare river. The Cathedral itself has superb stained glass features and a small charge",

          "This church can be seen from every part of the old city. At June 2012 some parts and the tower was covered scaffolding and could not be seen. The exterior of the building has many sculptures and details you can admire. Interior of the building made myself feel that I was inside",

          "Worth a visit! I found the inter-design is quite typical of a cathedral, but rather the external architect of the site is quite spectacular.",
          "This is seemingly perpetually in scaffolding on one side or another. The carvings on the front are impressive, and there are great views over the Aare from the garden behind the Cathedral.",
          "Apart from the bell tower and spire which were added in the 18th century, the Bern Cathedral dates from the 15th and 16th centuries. The Last Judgment sculptures above the main entrance have been cleaned and beautifully restored. The stained glass is some of the oldest and",
          "The cathedral is a must see if you are visiting Bern. Free (of course) to see the main church which is impressive in and of itself. Additional charge (CHF 5 if memory serves) to climb the tower. I took my guidebook's advice and asked when the bell would be rung next to",
          "Going up the tower is worth the effort as Bern is such a pretty city from above. The entrance portal is very beautiful and worth a look. Not an amazing cathedral, but it has some nice distinctive parts like the portal that make it special.",

          "This is a very impressive building (as most cathedrals of the age), and your bound to pass by walking through Bern, so stop in and take a look. As mentioned by the other review the statuettes over the doorway are really impressive, but do go in and look at the rest of it. I did",
          "We visited this cathedral last week and with the aid of the Switzerland iphone app (free), we were given a good insight to the carving at the front door- The Last Judgement. One side had those going to heaven who are clothed and the other side is the damned, with no clothes.",

        "wiki": "The Mosesbrunnen (Moses Fountain) is a fountain on M\u00fcnsterplatz in the Old City of Bern, Switzerland.  It is a Swiss Cultural Property of National Significance and is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Old City of Bern.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe statue dates from 1544. After storm damage it was rebuilt in 1790-1791. The Louis XVI style basin was designed by Niklaus Spr\u00fcngli. The statue represents Moses bringing the Ten Commandments to the Tribes of Israel. Moses is portrayed with two rays of light projecting from his head, which represent Exodus 34:29-35 which tells that after meeting with God the skin of Moses' face became radiant. The twin rays of light come from a longstanding tradition that Moses instead grew horns.\nMost commentators have simply said that Jerome mistranslated \u05e7\u05b8\u05e8\u05b7\u0594\u05df (q\u0101ran) as \u201chorned\u201d rather than  \u201cradiant.\u201d  But Bena Elisha Medjuck, a McGill University Department of Jewish Studies graduate student, offered a more complex explanation in his 1988 thesis \u201cExodus 34:29-35: Moses\u2019 \u2018Horns\u2019 in Early Bible Translation and Interpretation.\u201d[1]  Medjuck explains that Jerome was well-acquainted both with the variant meanings of q\u0101ran and with the prevailing translation of his contemporary Jewish scholars \u2013 with whom he consulted!   Jerome chose the \u201chorned\u201d translation as metaphor faithful to the text: a depiction of Moses\u2019 strength and authority, and a glorification of the Lord!  Jerome even explained this in his accompanying commentary! Horns were almost universally viewed by ancient civilizations as symbols of power, not as the negative or demonic symbols they became for Christians thousands of years later. For example, both Alexander the Great and Attila the Hun were described as wearing horns.  Mellinkoff reminds us that horned helmets were often worn by priests and kings, with the horns connoting that divine power and authority had been bestowed upon them.\nThe correct interpretation of these two words is that Moses was enlightened, that \"the skin of his face shone\" (as with a gloriole), as the KJV has it.The Septuagint correctly translates the Hebrew phrase as \u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03cc\u03be\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u1f21 \u1f44\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2, \"his face was glorified\"; but Jerome translated the phrase into Latin as cornuta esset facies sua \"his face was horned\".With apparent Biblical authority, and the added convenience of giving Moses a unique and easily identifiable visual attribute (something the other Old Testament prophets notably lacked), it remained standard in Western art to depict Moses with small horns until well after the mistranslation was realized in the Renaissance. In this depiction of Moses, the error has been identified but the artist has chosen to place horns of light on Moses head to aid in identification.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Mosesbrunnen (Bern) at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "Bern [b\u025brn] (listen) (Alemannic German: B\u00e4rn [b\u0325\u00e6\u02d0rn]; French: Berne [b\u025b\u0281n] (listen); Italian: Berna [\u02c8b\u025brna]; Romansh: Berna [\u02c8b\u025brn\u0250] (listen)) is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their \"federal city\", in German Bundesstadt, French ville f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, and Italian citt\u00e0 federale. With a population of about 140,000 (as of 2019), Bern is the fifth-most populous city in Switzerland. The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014. The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000. Bern is also the capital of the canton of Bern, the second-most populous of Switzerland's cantons.\nThe official language in Bern is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the most-spoken language is an Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Bernese German.\nIn 1983, the historic old town (in German: Altstadt) in the centre of Bern became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe etymology of the name \"Bern\" is uncertain. According to the local legend, based on folk etymology, Berchtold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen, the founder of the city of Bern, vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt, and this turned out to be a bear. It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona, which at the time was known as Bern in Middle High German. As a result of the finding of the Bern zinc tablet in the 1980s, it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin, possibly *berna \"cleft\". The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of Bern from at least the 1220s. The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the B\u00e4rengraben dates to the 1440s.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nNo archaeological evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today\u2032s city centre prior to the 12th century has been found so far. In antiquity, a Celtic oppidum stood on the Engehalbinsel (peninsula) north of Bern, fortified since the second century BC (late La T\u00e8ne period), thought to be one of the 12 oppida of the Helvetii mentioned by Caesar. During the Roman era, a Gallo-Roman vicus was on the same site. The Bern zinc tablet has the name Brenodor (\"dwelling of Breno\"). In the Early Middle Ages, a settlement in B\u00fcmpliz, now a city district of Bern, was some 4 km (2 mi) from the medieval city.\nThe medieval city is a foundation of the Z\u00e4hringer ruling family, which rose to power in Upper Burgundy in the 12th century. According to 14th-century historiography (Cronica de Berno, 1309), Bern was founded in 1191 by Berthold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen.\nIn 1218, after Berthold died without an heir, Bern was made a free imperial city by the Goldene Handfeste of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II.\n\n\n=== Old Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nIn 1353, Bern joined the Swiss Confederacy, becoming one of the eight cantons of the formative period of 1353 to 1481.\nBern invaded and conquered Aargau in 1415 and Vaud in 1536, as well as other smaller territories, thereby becoming the largest city-state north of the Alps; by the 18th century, it comprised most of what is today the canton of Bern and the canton of Vaud.\nThe city grew out towards the west of the boundaries of the peninsula formed by the river Aare. The Zytglogge tower marked the western boundary of the city from 1191 until 1256, when the K\u00e4figturm took over this role until 1345. It was, in turn, succeeded by the Christoffelturm (formerly located close to the site of the modern-day railway station) until 1622. During the time of the Thirty Years' War, two new fortifications \u2013 the so-called big and small Schanze (entrenchment) \u2013 were built to protect the whole area of the peninsula.\nAfter a major blaze in 1405, the city's original wooden buildings were gradually replaced by half-timbered houses and subsequently the sandstone buildings which came to be characteristic for the Old Town. Despite the waves of pestilence that hit Europe in the 14th century, the city continued to grow, mainly due to immigration from the surrounding countryside.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nBern was occupied by French troops in 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars, when it was stripped of parts of its territories. It regained control of the Bernese Oberland in 1802, and following the Congress of Vienna of 1814, it newly acquired the Bernese Jura. At this time, it once again became the largest canton of the Confederacy as it stood during the Restoration and until the secession of the canton of Jura in 1979.\nBern was made the Federal City (seat of the Federal Assembly) within the new Swiss federal state in 1848.\nA number of congresses of the socialist First and Second Internationals were held in Bern, particularly during World War I when Switzerland was neutral; see Bern International.\nThe city's population rose from about 5,000 in the 15th century to about 12,000 by 1800 and to above 60,000 by 1900, passing the 100,000 mark during the 1920s.\nPopulation peaked during the 1960s at 165,000 and has since decreased slightly, to below 130,000 by 2000.\nAs of September 2017, the resident population stood at 142,349, of which 100,000 were Swiss citizens and 42,349 (31%) resident foreigners.

The countryside around Bern was formed by glaciers during the most recent ice age. The two mountains closest to Bern are Gurten with a height of 864 m (2,835 ft) and Bantiger with a height of 947 m (3,107 ft). The site of the old observatory in Bern is the point of origin of the CH1903 coordinate system at 46\u00b057\u203208.66\u2033N 7\u00b026\u203222.50\u2033E.\nThe city was originally built on a hilly peninsula surrounded by the river Aare, but outgrew natural boundaries by the 19th century. A number of bridges have been built to allow the city to expand beyond the Aare.\nBern is built on very uneven ground. An elevation difference of up to 60 metres exists between the inner city districts on the Aare (Matte, Marzili) and the higher ones (Kirchenfeld, L\u00e4nggasse).\nBern has an area, as of 2009, of 51.62 km2 (19.93 sq mi).

        "wiki": "Bern [b\u025brn] (listen) (Alemannic German: B\u00e4rn [b\u0325\u00e6\u02d0rn]; French: Berne [b\u025b\u0281n] (listen); Italian: Berna [\u02c8b\u025brna]; Romansh: Berna [\u02c8b\u025brn\u0250] (listen)) is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their \"federal city\", in German Bundesstadt, French ville f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, and Italian citt\u00e0 federale. With a population of about 140,000 (as of 2019), Bern is the fifth-most populous city in Switzerland. The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014. The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000. Bern is also the capital of the canton of Bern, the second-most populous of Switzerland's cantons.\nThe official language in Bern is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the most-spoken language is an Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Bernese German.\nIn 1983, the historic old town (in German: Altstadt) in the centre of Bern became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe etymology of the name \"Bern\" is uncertain. According to the local legend, based on folk etymology, Berchtold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen, the founder of the city of Bern, vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt, and this turned out to be a bear. It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona, which at the time was known as Bern in Middle High German. As a result of the finding of the Bern zinc tablet in the 1980s, it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin, possibly *berna \"cleft\". The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of Bern from at least the 1220s. The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the B\u00e4rengraben dates to the 1440s.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nNo archaeological evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today\u2032s city centre prior to the 12th century has been found so far. In antiquity, a Celtic oppidum stood on the Engehalbinsel (peninsula) north of Bern, fortified since the second century BC (late La T\u00e8ne period), thought to be one of the 12 oppida of the Helvetii mentioned by Caesar. During the Roman era, a Gallo-Roman vicus was on the same site. The Bern zinc tablet has the name Brenodor (\"dwelling of Breno\"). In the Early Middle Ages, a settlement in B\u00fcmpliz, now a city district of Bern, was some 4 km (2 mi) from the medieval city.\nThe medieval city is a foundation of the Z\u00e4hringer ruling family, which rose to power in Upper Burgundy in the 12th century. According to 14th-century historiography (Cronica de Berno, 1309), Bern was founded in 1191 by Berthold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen.\nIn 1218, after Berthold died without an heir, Bern was made a free imperial city by the Goldene Handfeste of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II.\n\n\n=== Old Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nIn 1353, Bern joined the Swiss Confederacy, becoming one of the eight cantons of the formative period of 1353 to 1481.\nBern invaded and conquered Aargau in 1415 and Vaud in 1536, as well as other smaller territories, thereby becoming the largest city-state north of the Alps; by the 18th century, it comprised most of what is today the canton of Bern and the canton of Vaud.\nThe city grew out towards the west of the boundaries of the peninsula formed by the river Aare. The Zytglogge tower marked the western boundary of the city from 1191 until 1256, when the K\u00e4figturm took over this role until 1345. It was, in turn, succeeded by the Christoffelturm (formerly located close to the site of the modern-day railway station) until 1622. During the time of the Thirty Years' War, two new fortifications \u2013 the so-called big and small Schanze (entrenchment) \u2013 were built to protect the whole area of the peninsula.\nAfter a major blaze in 1405, the city's original wooden buildings were gradually replaced by half-timbered houses and subsequently the sandstone buildings which came to be characteristic for the Old Town. Despite the waves of pestilence that hit Europe in the 14th century, the city continued to grow, mainly due to immigration from the surrounding countryside.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nBern was occupied by French troops in 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars, when it was stripped of parts of its territories. It regained control of the Bernese Oberland in 1802, and following the Congress of Vienna of 1814, it newly acquired the Bernese Jura. At this time, it once again became the largest canton of the Confederacy as it stood during the Restoration and until the secession of the canton of Jura in 1979.\nBern was made the Federal City (seat of the Federal Assembly) within the new Swiss federal state in 1848.\nA number of congresses of the socialist First and Second Internationals were held in Bern, particularly during World War I when Switzerland was neutral; see Bern International.\nThe city's population rose from about 5,000 in the 15th century to about 12,000 by 1800 and to above 60,000 by 1900, passing the 100,000 mark during the 1920s.\nPopulation peaked during the 1960s at 165,000 and has since decreased slightly, to below 130,000 by 2000.\nAs of September 2017, the resident population stood at 142,349, of which 100,000 were Swiss citizens and 42,349 (31%) resident foreigners. A further estimated 350,000 people live in the immediate urban agglomeration.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBern lies on the Swiss plateau in the canton of Bern, slightly west of the centre of Switzerland and 20 km (12 mi) north of the Bernese Alps. The countryside around Bern was formed by glaciers during the most recent ice age. The two mountains closest to Bern are Gurten with a height of 864 m (2,835 ft) and Bantiger with a height of 947 m (3,107 ft). The site of the old observatory in Bern is the point of origin of the CH1903 coordinate system at 46\u00b057\u203208.66\u2033N 7\u00b026\u203222.50\u2033E.\nThe city was originally built on a hilly peninsula surrounded by the river Aare, but outgrew natural boundaries by the 19th century. A number of bridges have been built to allow the city to expand beyond the Aare.\nBern is built on very uneven ground. An elevation difference of up to 60 metres exists between the inner city districts on the Aare (Matte, Marzili) and the higher ones (Kirchenfeld, L\u00e4nggasse).\nBern has an area, as of 2009, of 51.62 km2 (19.93 sq mi). Of this area, 9.79 km2 (3.78 sq mi) or 19.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 17.33 km2 (6.69 sq mi) or 33.6% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 23.25 km2 (8.98 sq mi) or 45.0% is settled (buildings or roads), 1.06 km2 (0.41 sq mi) or 2.1% is either rivers or lakes, and 0.16 km2 (0.062 sq mi) or 0.3% is unproductive land.Of the developed area of Bern, 3.6% consists of industrial buildings, 21.7% housing and other buildings, and 12.6% is devoted to transport infrastructure. Power and water infrastructure, as well as other special developed areas, made up 1.1% of the city, while another 6.0% consists of parks, green belts, and sports fields.\nOf Bern's total land area, 32.8% is heavily forested. Of the agricultural land, 14.3% is used for growing crops and 4.0% is designated to be used as pasture. Local rivers and streams provide all the water in the municipality.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification, Bern has a humid continental climate (Dfb) closely bordering on an oceanic climate (Cfb).\nThe closest weather station near Bern is located in the municipality of Zollikofen, about 5 kilometres (3 mi) north of the city centre. The warmest month for Bern is July, with a daily mean temperature of 18.3 \u00b0C (64.9 \u00b0F), and a daily maximum temperature of 24.3 \u00b0C (75.7 \u00b0F). The highest temperature recorded at Bern / Zollikofen is 37.0 \u00b0C (98.6 \u00b0F), recorded in August 2003. On average, a temperature of 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) or above is recorded 40.7 days per year, and 6 days per year with a temperature of 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) or above at Zollikofen, and the warmest day reaches an average of 32.1 \u00b0C (89.8 \u00b0F).There are 103.7 days of air frost, and 22.3 ice days per year at Bern (Zollikofen) for the period of 1981\u20132010, as well as 14.1 days of snowfall, 36.7 days of snow cover per year and the average amount of snow measured per year is 52.6 centimetres (20.7 in). On average, January is the coldest month, with a daily mean temperature of \u22120.4 \u00b0C (31.3 \u00b0F), and a daily minimum temperature of \u22123.6 \u00b0C (25.5 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature ever recorded at Bern (Zollikofen) was \u221223.0 \u00b0C (\u22129.4 \u00b0F), recorded in February 1929, and typically the coldest temperature of the year reaches an average of \u221212.8 \u00b0C (9.0 \u00b0F) for the period of 1981\u20132010.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nThe municipality is administratively subdivided into six districts (Stadtteile), each of which consists of several quarters (Quartiere).\n\n\n=== Government ===\n\nThe Municipal Council (de: Gemeinderat, fr: conseil municipal) constitutes the executive government of the City of Bern and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of five councillors (German: Gemeinderat/-r\u00e4tin, French: conseiller/conseill\u00e8re municipal(e)), each presiding over a directorate (de: Direktion, fr: direction) comprising several departments and bureaus. The president of the executive department acts as mayor (de: Stadtpr\u00e4sident, fr: Le Maire). In the mandate period 2017\u20132020 (Legislatur) the Municipal Council is presided by Stadtpr\u00e4sident Alec von Graffenried. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the City Council are carried by the Municipal Council. The regular election of the Municipal Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. Any resident of Bern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. Contrary to most other municipalities, the executive government in Berne is selected by means of a system of Proporz.

          "We really enjoyed our walk and time in the rose garden. It\u2019s been there a long time and is a gem in the area. It was a beautiful day and the time spend outdoors was perfect. Many roses still in bloom in October along with lots of other flowers.",

          "From what seems to be an upscale restaurant from the menu and pricing, it\u2019s more like a glorified snack bar offering decent food at high rate prices. I cannot bash the food it was great. The view was spectacular, the servers were friendly but typically inattentive when it came",

          "It's a beautiful roses garden but to be honest, nothing spectacular. I would expected more flowers, although they are beautiful and we'll cared. The view of old town Bern from the garden (very high ground) is impressive and must be seen. Prepare for a uphill walk or take",

          "Over-rated. Just a \"been there, done that\" thing to do. There was nothing much to do in Bern anyway. So If you don't mind a little hiking exercise (steep stone pathway walk up the hill) to see Bern from the top of the hill, you can still go to this place. Rose garden wasn't",

          "By the end of August the roses were past their best but still provided a little colour. The main reason for visiting are the views over the city and river, the walk up isn't long and it is a good path, but it is uphill. We didn't visit the restaurant at the top, but it appeared",
          "The walk up was a tad tiring but worth it for the view of the city. We definitely took the opportunity for a photo shoot up there especially since it was such a clear, nice day. I was a bit confused about the 'rose garden' part since I guess I was expecting more roses, but",
          "We walked up to the rose garden on a steep cobblestoned path. Hard going but well worth the effort. The roses had basically finished but the view was fantastic. The is a restaurant in the gardens that has sit down lunch and also some take away. An excellent view of the Swiss",

          "It is a kind of park rather than a rose garden, so don't expect to see too many roses (well, there are some). It gives you a nice view of the city if you like taking pictures.",
          "The Rosengarten is not breathtaking by any stretch but it is a lovely garden. It also offers a very nice view overlooking Old Town. As you would expect, the cafe is a bit pricey but it may be convenient or fun to have a drink or lunch there.",
          "It was one of the main attraction of the town but when i reached there I found it to be really over hyped. The views of old town Bern are good but not mesmerizing. The garden is small and have roses planted but that also is not much. It is good for locals to hangout but nothing",

          "We were feeling rather tired after walking through the old town when we decided to take the bus to the view point through rosengarten. That was a very good decision. We arrived at this garden that has rose beds throughout the park. We wlalked through to the view point. Fantastic",
          "Top location. Famous on it's Roses. During the Summer time, it is perfect for picnic or meet ups with family and friends. The view of Bern's Old City fascinate mostly of the visitors. It has as well restaurant and playground for the children. I like as well during the Cherry",
          "The Rose Garden is a neatly done park, especially if you love roses in all varieties. Young people relax or play a game on the lawns. The highlight, however, is clearly the spectacular view of the city, or better its layout. Just below on the left is the Bear Park. On the",
          "This is truly spectacular rose garden, but pardon the expression - the view really gilds the lily. The panoramic view is quite breathtaking. The adjacent playground made me wish I were a kid again so I could climb around on it with my friends.",
          "I was taking here as a guest a few times - beautiful food and wine with breathtaking views of Bern. Excellent service and ambience.",
          "While the rose garden itself will most certainly not blow you away, it's still a nice place to go. Chairs can be dragged to the shade plus there are some fountains that make it a relaxing place on a hot summer day. The view of old town (\"Altstadt\") from the rose garden is hard",
          "I highly recommend going when its not busy. It was a pretty hot day when I visited and I loved it. If you love taking photos...its a great place to experiment with your camera. There is a restaurant overlooking the old town and river and a beautiful park for a picnic with",
          "The Rose Garden occupies a large are uphill and is definitely a vantage point for overlooking the Old Town apart from viewing beautiful roses while in bloom. At leisure, you can have a cup of tea in the cafe inside the garden while watching others walking around with children",
          "A beautiful and peacefull place to admire the old Bern. Nice photo opportunities from there. The garden itself is very well maintain. Just few hundreds meters from the bears enclosure",

          "Great view of Bern & Aare curve. Disappointing gardens but neat variety of flowers. Ideal fountain but not as nicely maintained as you would expect for Switzerland. Quite a hike up from Bear Pit but easy access from Ostermundigen side. Fancy restaurant w/ great service but make",
          "A really popular restaurant with wonderful view over Bern. You really must make a reservation or miss out. We ate a very good Rogan Josh and a beef carpaccio while enjoying the scenery and listening to the town bells tolling.",

          "This Park & Restaurant is the Best Place for Sunset Dinner on a summer evening overlooking the City of Bern. It is worth arriving early to spend some time before dinner in the Beautiful adjacent Park & Rose Gardens... Then have a a table at the open windows for a Fantastic",

          "This place is a must! Most pictures you see of Bern are either taken from a helicopter or from Rosengarten. It is also a nice park to spend a day off or evening. If you go there in the morning you have the city in the morning sun, in the evening you have a nice sunset. Be aware",
          "You can enjoy great sunshine and good view over there. Many people have picnics there. Quite comfortable.",

          "The Rose Garden is a hidden treasure in Bern. The garden is beautiful and is located on a hill that provides amazing views of old town Bern!",
          "It is well worth a walk up for the views alone (not in 34\u00b0c heat as we did ) .The rose gardens are nice but not the finest you colud see also they seemed a little poorly kept.",
          "The restaurant is not cheap and the service is just over \"ok\" but the views are stunning and the salads make up for it. Next to the seating area is a playground for children, which is great for families with children up to 8-9 years.",
          "Almost skipped this place but thankfully I did not do so. The garden is beautifully decorated with different types of roses and flowers. There is lots of space to have picnics or just to simply laze around. Alternatively, you can visit the restaurant there where you can chill",
          "We came here in late July and although there were some flowers many of them had wilted and died (maybe due to the recent heat wave). The garden also has a nice view overlooking the old town. Be prepared to take a steep walk up or alternatively you could get the bus.",
          "Rosengarten or the rose garden is not be missed if you happen to be in Bern. The garden is beautifully maintained and offers absolutely stunning views of the old city. The rose garden itself is gorgeous with many varieties of roses. The view of the old city from the garden is",
          "We arrived at the beautiful Rosengarten Park in late afternoon. Let\u2019s just say that while here my wife and I felt that we had found Heaven. The park in spring was filled with adults, teens, and children who seemed to be having the time of their lives, whether on the plentiful",
          "The view from the Rose Garden (Rosengarten) over Berne is probably the best you can get in town (except from the roof of the cathedral). Hence, don't be surprised by the crowd trying to get the best spots on the \"seat bench\" turned wall. The Restaurant in the park has a nice",
          "It's a steep climb up to the Rosengarten from the old bear pit but the views are worth it. Good panorama of the city and nice gardens to sit in. There's also a restaurant too which looks out across the city.",
          "My wife and I visited the Rosengarten in early July. Its a moderately steep climb up to the Rose garden, but once there, it is all worth it. There are fantastic views of Bern on the hill. The gardens are a very tranquil place to visit and re-charge your batteries. We had a late",
          "We visited them yesterday and decided to visit the restaurant after a long day to relax and unwind... We asked a waiter for a table as most of the tables were reserved. After which they asked us to be seated inside. The lady gave us a menu in Swiss and we asked her to replace",
          "Great place for a piknik. Well worth the hike up the hill. If you cannot walk take the bus nr 10. Service in the restaurant is sloooooow so don't go there if you're in a hurry.",
          "Go there in the beginning of summer as the Roses have flowers! The restaurant there is also a good place to have the daydish. Do not forget to reserve before... the place is crowded!",

          "Perfect spot to meet friends and family (also with kids, as there us a big playground) or for a romantic date. You can walk around and learn the names of the various roses, enjoy the view on the old town or just sit in the shadow. If you are hungry you can bring your own picnic.",
          "The attraction is the view of the old Bern town from the Rose garden, with the river winding around it. Take in the view, snap a photo, and take a walk downhill towards the town for your next sightseeing",
          "As I was in Switzerland this winter with some friends, we decided to visit one of the most famous places in the capital of Switzerland, Bern. It's a georgeous garden named Rosengarten or Rose Garden. This garden is in the old part of the town. It was redesigned many times and it",

          "Great variety of roses. A great place for family or couples to relax and have a wonderful view of the Bern city. Also a wonderful place for taking photos. Kids would love the playground. It's just up the slope from the Bear pit and the Altes Tramdepot restaurant.",
          "I went there on a sunny day. I have some drinks at tea time. People can have a great view of the Bern city at this garden. The rose itself is not attractive to me.",
          "The variety and number of roses was amazing. They were stunning and well cared for . The views of and from the garden make this a great little stop on a visit to Bern.",
          "Nice and relaxing with a gorgeus view. Highly recommended walk. Do not forget to bring with you a nice camera.",
          "I visited the Rose Garden in December 2014. The winter landscape made for another perspective entirely. And coffee at the Bistro overlooking the city finished off the walk wonderfully. How lovely to see so many people out and about, even in the cold. I look forward to seeing the",
          "Sitting on the wall, looking at the sun go down over Bern, life could be worse! This cute park is a perfect place to sit with a few beers and enjoy the sunshine. The large open grass spaces are great for playing on, with well maintained lawns and neat flower borders. Great",

          "High up on a hill, the rose garden gives you a great view of the sites of Bern. The climb is tough but worth it for the view. The garden is well kept and was in high bloom towards the end of June.",
          "Heading there in a sunny day when you can enjoy the view from the top. The garden itself very beautiful and clean. You can find many kind of flowers with little signs which state their names, which was very helpful recognize them -brilliant. Heading there just after the bear",

          "First off did you know that if you wanted to take in the views of the old city of Bern from a high viewpoint the terrace at Rosengarten would be the best (I think)? At least it is accessible by foot and bus, and free of charge. It was worth the climb from the Bear Garden site.",
          "Vantage location of this very well maintained garden overlooking the historic city of Berne. Great place to relax with family, specially when the Sun is out. You can get your drinks at the small cafe at the top. Kids enjoy the swings and also some sand pits..",

          "everything was breathtaking! happy youngsters perfect location hours of enjoyment may go on forever Perhaps not enough seats or benches",
          "There's an easier, more flat access to the garden! Check Google map for the route behind the garden, rather than taking the route directly from the old town and the bear garden. There are a couple of benches outside the restaurant, which means it's actually a free spot to get",

          "Nice challenge... especially if you r not working out :D :P It is placed on the top of a little hill... so you must breathe deep, smog your forces and don't give up on the half of the way on those benche's.... the view from up there is worth every drop of sweat :)",
          "It is a bit of a steep hike up to the Rose Garden, which was covered with snow while visiting, but could see there are a ton of different rose plant varieties. The Rose Garden offers a great view of Old City Bern, well worth the hike up the hill to sit on a bench and enjoy the",
          "I love roses and gardens so this place was for me. It smelled amazing and the roses were so beautiful. If you like that kind of thing, this was a great place. It's at the top of a hill and it was a long walk up but there were great views all along the way and a spectacular view",
          "Although not in flower during our visit, one could see by the planting arrangements that it would be quite a site when the roses were in full bloom. It's other main feature is the view from the garden back across the river to the \"Old Town\". Magnificent.",
          "We walked up to the Rose Garden and the view of Bern was definitely worth the trip uphill. Try to go up on a clearer day. You can visit this and the Bear park on the same short walk. A definite must if you go to Bern!",

          "This is well worth the uphill trek, the views are unbelievable! Going in autumn was great- the paths were covered in leaves and everything looked so picture perfect! But the downfall is there weren't many roses in bloom. There is one cafe at the top which doesn't have much",

          "Take the cog rail up to this park with your full day tram and bus pass. Lots of trails but I wasn't sure where they went. Was a good break from the city though. Could see a farmer cutting hay, and climb a tower for great views of the city.",

          "Taking the funicular up to Gurten is an experience in itself. Try to be seated at the front if possible to get the view of Bern disappearing and becoming smaller in front of your eyes. The view is fantastic. My children (6 and 4) really enjoyed the mini train ride and insisted",
          "This provides amazing views of Bern and the mountains on a clear day. The 1/2 price card can be used for tickets on the funicular which makes it a reasonable price for multiple trips. The viewing point is great on a clear day and at the opposite end (behind the restaurants)",
          "Great place, lots to do. Nice park, small pond for kids, little train rides. beautiful view and nice restaurant. We just love to hang out there. A must see for families. You can also BBQ there and have nice walks. They also have 2 playgrounds.",
          "We took the funicular car up to Gurten, primarily to go to a function at the restaurant. However, we lingered in the lovely park at the top, enjoying the views one way over Bern and the other way over the Alps. It is a real gem of a place and well worth the visit. If you have",
          "This mountain is a pride for Bernese people. With a rail or hiking you can reach the upper part and enjoy an amazing view of the city and alps. It's a real paradise for children, with playgrounds, real baby trains, games etc. Once a year they do a very popular music festival",

          "Just 10 min away from Bern station, you take a cable car to go up & it's a beautiful view of the Alps & the entire city of Bern from up there. If its a a nice sunny day you can have a lovely walk around & there's a really nice play area for the kids. It's a great place to do",
          "We went in our hire car a few days ago, when there had been heavy snow, and there was thick fog, but it was still just magical! Something about the space & the snow on the trees, as well as the fact that we could see hardly anything at all was just magical! On the way back down",
          "We went in winter and there was not much to do except walk. The paths were well kept and the views wonderful! Certainly worth a visit. Staff at the funicilar was very friendly and helpful, but staff at the self-service restaurant on the mountain was rude and unfriendly.",
          "Went here using my Libero ticket (area ticket valid for certain zones in the Bern area). Lovely cable car up the hill and then beautiful walks with stunning views across Bern and over to the Matterhorn. Great play and activity area for kids to have fun in. Lovely",

          "Only 10min from Bern main station you can get in teh cable car which Children willbe fascinated by the very big playground up un the Gurten. Adults will like the view from Jura until the Alps and you can perfectly see the whole town of Bern. Don't miss the Gurten Festival in",
          "Easily accessible from Bern, with an exciting trip up there is sufficient place for children to play in the large playgrounds, but also enough place to get away from all the kids and enjoy a quiet walk or just sit on the grass and enjoy the sunshine. There is a fantastic view",
          "We loved Gurten! We had to look for the place to start (do not type in Gurten in your GPS System in your Car!!) you go to the station in Wabern. There is a Parkhaus/Parking place there. From there you can hike up, or (as we did) take the special train up. It`s lovely to wald",

          "A spectacular view of the city Bern, and the Alps from a place 800meter from the city.. Nice playing area for children and few shops as well. For Elders just relax on lush green sloppy grass and view the whole of city. No rush except in the festival days",

          "I visited Gurtenpark with a couple of friends, and totally loved it. If you have children you can't miss this attraction, plenty of attractions for the little ones. You can climb a few stairs to go up in a tower that gives you a complete and outstanding view of Bern. There's a",
          "The location and the views are great. But the food is just average. It is still worth going there.",
          "I've been here many times on my trips to Switzerland. Not a tourist trap, a genuinely lovely park used by the residents of Bern. Playgrounds and a little train ride and lots of open areas for picnicing at the top.",
          "This makes a bracing walk up (dodge the sledgers) or you can use the funicular railway. It is walkable from the city centre but you can get the tram. There are good views from the top and make sure you climb the tower even if it is -20 degrees C!",
          "Lovely park area with view over the city of Berne. Plenty to keep children amused with numerous play areas. A nice trip.",
          "Easy to get to (a tram drops you right down the street from the station). Small train for the kids to ride on at the top. Nice walking trails. Restaurant is good (according to friends - haven't been there myself). Hosts concerts in the summer that are packed with people.",
          "The views from the top of the observation tower was good. The paths around the top central area were wellmaintained. We took our own picnic lunch. The mosy commonly used walking track down was unexciting, and poorly signed at the end, leading to an interesting 3km diversion.",
          "The Gurten is a hilltop recreation area just outside of Bern. You go up via cable car (Gurtenbahn), which is easily reached via the #9 tram from Bern. If you have a Swiss Rail Pass you can get a discounted fare. You can buy a one way and walk down, if you are so inclined. At",

        "wiki": "The Waisenhausplatz (Orphanage Plaza) is a plaza in the Old City of Bern, the medieval city center of Bern, Switzerland.  It is on the edge of the Innere Neustadt which was built during the second expansion from 1255 to 1260, though the plaza was not built until later.  It is on the north of the peninsula, and divided from B\u00e4renplatz by Marktgasse.  It is part of the UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site that encompasses the Old City.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nWaisenhausplatz was first used to describe three formerly separate plazas in the 19th Century.  The southern portion (Nr. 2-14) was built over the ditch in front of the second city wall in the 16th Century.  Originally known as Viehmarkt (Cattle Market), then Holzmarkt (Wood Market), later as Weinplatz (Wine Plaza) and finally in the 18th and 19th Centuries as Schweinemarkt (Pork Market).  The middle section of Waisenhausplatz (Nr. 16-28) was also built over the protective ditch, the Tachnaglergraben, and was known as Zeughausplatz (Armory Plaza).  The northern section (Nr. 29/30) was built in 1784 and was always known as Waisenhausplatz.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Reformed Nydeggkirche (from the Bernese German expression for \"Lower corner\") is located on the eastern edge of the Old City of Bern, in the Nydegg section.\n\n\n== The castle Nydegg ==\nThe old town is situated on a peninsula in a loop of the Aare and developed in several expansion stages. The first occurred in 1191, as an existing settlement was expanded in the area of Nydeggkirche to the Clock Tower (Zytglogge).  In 1190 Duke Berchtold V von Z\u00e4hringen had built the castle Nydegg.  After the extinction of the House of Z\u00e4hringen, it came under the control of the city and was razed in 1266-73 by the inhabitants of Bern, in order to develop the Nydegg section. It possessed four corner towers and was located about where the current choir of the church stands.\n\n\n== The Church ==\n\nThe original small church was built from 1341 to 1346 to replace the old fortress.  It was first sanctified in March 1344, followed by a second on 23 May 1346.  This early church featured a bell tower.  On 12 January 1469 the city asked the Teutonic Order to donate the Nydegg chapel to the Mary Magdalene Brotherhood and to allow them to use the money paid to the chapel to rebuild the building.  However, the city had to wait until the end of the Burgundian Wars (1472-1476) to begin the project. From 1480 to 1483 the city added a tower and from 1493 to 1504, a new nave was added.  After the Protestant Reformation in 1529, the Nydeggkirche was transformed into a warehouse for barrels, timber and grain, but in 1566 again served as worship space.  Beginning in 1566 it was cleaned out and minor renovations made to the windows and walls.  However, in 1568 the bell tower roof caught fire and was destroyed.  The new roof was finished and the damaged clock work repaired by the end of May 1571.  The large wrought iron cross which tops the main spire was built by Caspar Br\u00fckessel during the same time.  The current tower's appearance mostly dates back to the 1571 reconstruction.  The later changes to the tower were fairly minor.  For example, in 1625 four small embrasures or firing slits were broken out of the tower to help defend the city gate and in 1631 eight copper waterspouts were added to the roof.Until 1721 it was a branch church of the M\u00fcnster of Bern. Today's congregation forms part of the Reformed Churches of the Canton Bern-Jura-Solothurn.\nIn 1863, the church was extended to the west and an entrance from the Nydeggbr\u00fccke (Nydegg Bridge) was added.  Then, from 1951 to 1953 a total renovation happened.  During the renovation, bronze reliefs by Marcel Perincioli were added to the main entrance at Nydeggh\u00f6fli and the entrance to the bridge.\nThe Nydeggh\u00f6flibrunnen or Stalden fountain was added to a niche under Nydegggasse at Nydeggh\u00f6fli in 1857.  Then, in 1968, the Z\u00e4hringer monument at Nydeggh\u00f6fli was erected, which had previously been on the Munster platform.\n\n\n== The bronze reliefs ==\n\nIn 1956, bronze reliefs by Perincioli were inspired by medieval role models in front of San Zeno in Verona and the Cathedral of Hildesheim.\nOn the main door, you can see scenes from the life and work of Jesus, on the left wing, from top to bottom:\n\nThe announcement of the birth of Jesus to the shepherds (Luke 2:8-14)\nThe baptism of Jesus (Mark 1:1-11)\nSermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7)\nThe healing of a paralytic (Mark 2:1-12)and on the right wing:\n\nThe birth of Jesus in the stable at Bethlehem (Luke 2)\nThe temptation of Jesus (Mark 1:12 f.)\nThe miraculous feeding (Mark 6:30-44)\nThe Raising of Lazarus (John 11:17 ff)On the Br\u00fcckent\u00fcre are on the left wing, from top to bottom are following scenes:\n\nThe women come to the grave of Jesus (Mark 16:1-8)\nJesus before Pontius Pilate (Mark 15:1-5)\nThe foot washing (John 13:1-20)\nThe anointing at Bethany (John 12:1-10)and on the right wing:\n\nThe risen Christ on the Sea of Galilee (John 21:1-14)\nThe burial of Jesus (John 19:38-42)\nJesus in Gethsemane (Mark 14:32-42)\nThe entrance to Jerusalem (John 12:12-19)\n\n\n== Notable Pastors ==\nWorked as a chaplain at the Nydeggkirche\n\nJeremiah Lorza (from 1800 to 1832)\nEdward Guedes (from 1855)\nKurt Marti (from 1961 to 1983)On 8 July 1995, the pastor of Nydeggkirche, B\u00e4umlin Klaus (born 1938), caused a media storm following his offering of a blessing service for same-sex couple for Stephan Diggelmann and Bareld Storm.\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNydegg.ch: Parish Nydegg Bern website\nNydegg.ch: Photos of the bronze reliefs\nNydeggkirche chapter in Volume 5 of the artistic monuments of the canton of Bern\nSermon series by Klaus B\u00e4umlin: the Lord's Prayer\nBlessing service in the Nydeggkirche (1995)\n Media related to Nydeggkirche at Wikimedia Commons",

          "I cannot recommend Element Ski School enough. As a family of five, ranging in ages 4 to 30 and with differing skiing abilities, we had an excellent three days of skiing in Verbier with Jake. Jake was a fantastic instructor, and the way that he interacted with the children made",
          "This was my first time back on the slopes as had my confidence knocked a few years back. Jake was very patient. He quickly identified my technique was wrong and this was why I was finding it so hard in the past. My 3 hour lesson helped restored faith again and I'm looking",

          "I took two Element women courses by Emma Cairns and her company Element Coaching School. The first a 5 day womens course where we learned technique on piste to go off piste and do bumps. Our group was 6, was great. I have absolutely changed the way I ski, feeling more confident",

          "We used Element because their pricing was very competitive and because they are a small company with English instructors. We weren't disappointed as Guy is a very likeable and informative chap and we really enjoyed his company for the day. and learnt a lot about the 4 values",

          "My 14 year old son is a good skier and wants to learn all manner of things at speed! I and am a tad less ambitous and the joy of skiing with Emma is she gave us both the confidence to throuroughly enjoy our time on the slopes. Her knowledge of the area ment that we skiied in",

        "wiki": "Bern [b\u025brn] (listen) (Alemannic German: B\u00e4rn [b\u0325\u00e6\u02d0rn]; French: Berne [b\u025b\u0281n] (listen); Italian: Berna [\u02c8b\u025brna]; Romansh: Berna [\u02c8b\u025brn\u0250] (listen)) is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their \"federal city\", in German Bundesstadt, French ville f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, and Italian citt\u00e0 federale. With a population of about 140,000 (as of 2019), Bern is the fifth-most populous city in Switzerland. The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014. The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000. Bern is also the capital of the canton of Bern, the second-most populous of Switzerland's cantons.\nThe official language in Bern is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the most-spoken language is an Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Bernese German.\nIn 1983, the historic old town (in German: Altstadt) in the centre of Bern became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe etymology of the name \"Bern\" is uncertain. According to the local legend, based on folk etymology, Berchtold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen, the founder of the city of Bern, vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt, and this turned out to be a bear. It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona, which at the time was known as Bern in Middle High German. As a result of the finding of the Bern zinc tablet in the 1980s, it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin, possibly *berna \"cleft\". The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of Bern from at least the 1220s. The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the B\u00e4rengraben dates to the 1440s.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nNo archaeological evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today\u2032s city centre prior to the 12th century has been found so far. In antiquity, a Celtic oppidum stood on the Engehalbinsel (peninsula) north of Bern, fortified since the second century BC (late La T\u00e8ne period), thought to be one of the 12 oppida of the Helvetii mentioned by Caesar. During the Roman era, a Gallo-Roman vicus was on the same site. The Bern zinc tablet has the name Brenodor (\"dwelling of Breno\"). In the Early Middle Ages, a settlement in B\u00fcmpliz, now a city district of Bern, was some 4 km (2 mi) from the medieval city.\nThe medieval city is a foundation of the Z\u00e4hringer ruling family, which rose to power in Upper Burgundy in the 12th century. According to 14th-century historiography (Cronica de Berno, 1309), Bern was founded in 1191 by Berthold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen.\nIn 1218, after Berthold died without an heir, Bern was made a free imperial city by the Goldene Handfeste of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II.\n\n\n=== Old Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nIn 1353, Bern joined the Swiss Confederacy, becoming one of the eight cantons of the formative period of 1353 to 1481.\nBern invaded and conquered Aargau in 1415 and Vaud in 1536, as well as other smaller territories, thereby becoming the largest city-state north of the Alps; by the 18th century, it comprised most of what is today the canton of Bern and the canton of Vaud.\nThe city grew out towards the west of the boundaries of the peninsula formed by the river Aare. The Zytglogge tower marked the western boundary of the city from 1191 until 1256, when the K\u00e4figturm took over this role until 1345. It was, in turn, succeeded by the Christoffelturm (formerly located close to the site of the modern-day railway station) until 1622. During the time of the Thirty Years' War, two new fortifications \u2013 the so-called big and small Schanze (entrenchment) \u2013 were built to protect the whole area of the peninsula.\nAfter a major blaze in 1405, the city's original wooden buildings were gradually replaced by half-timbered houses and subsequently the sandstone buildings which came to be characteristic for the Old Town. Despite the waves of pestilence that hit Europe in the 14th century, the city continued to grow, mainly due to immigration from the surrounding countryside.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nBern was occupied by French troops in 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars, when it was stripped of parts of its territories. It regained control of the Bernese Oberland in 1802, and following the Congress of Vienna of 1814, it newly acquired the Bernese Jura. At this time, it once again became the largest canton of the Confederacy as it stood during the Restoration and until the secession of the canton of Jura in 1979.\nBern was made the Federal City (seat of the Federal Assembly) within the new Swiss federal state in 1848.\nA number of congresses of the socialist First and Second Internationals were held in Bern, particularly during World War I when Switzerland was neutral; see Bern International.\nThe city's population rose from about 5,000 in the 15th century to about 12,000 by 1800 and to above 60,000 by 1900, passing the 100,000 mark during the 1920s.\nPopulation peaked during the 1960s at 165,000 and has since decreased slightly, to below 130,000 by 2000.\nAs of September 2017, the resident population stood at 142,349, of which 100,000 were Swiss citizens and 42,349 (31%) resident foreigners. A further estimated 350,000 people live in the immediate urban agglomeration.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBern lies on the Swiss plateau in the canton of Bern, slightly west of the centre of Switzerland and 20 km (12 mi) north of the Bernese Alps. The countryside around Bern was formed by glaciers during the most recent ice age. The two mountains closest to Bern are Gurten with a height of 864 m (2,835 ft) and Bantiger with a height of 947 m (3,107 ft). The site of the old observatory in Bern is the point of origin of the CH1903 coordinate system at 46\u00b057\u203208.66\u2033N 7\u00b026\u203222.50\u2033E.\nThe city was originally built on a hilly peninsula surrounded by the river Aare, but outgrew natural boundaries by the 19th century. A number of bridges have been built to allow the city to expand beyond the Aare.\nBern is built on very uneven ground. An elevation difference of up to 60 metres exists between the inner city districts on the Aare (Matte, Marzili) and the higher ones (Kirchenfeld, L\u00e4nggasse).\nBern has an area, as of 2009, of 51.62 km2 (19.93 sq mi). Of this area, 9.79 km2 (3.78 sq mi) or 19.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 17.33 km2 (6.69 sq mi) or 33.6% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 23.25 km2 (8.98 sq mi) or 45.0% is settled (buildings or roads), 1.06 km2 (0.41 sq mi) or 2.1% is either rivers or lakes, and 0.16 km2 (0.062 sq mi) or 0.3% is unproductive land.Of the developed area of Bern, 3.6% consists of industrial buildings, 21.7% housing and other buildings, and 12.6% is devoted to transport infrastructure. Power and water infrastructure, as well as other special developed areas, made up 1.1% of the city, while another 6.0% consists of parks, green belts, and sports fields.\nOf Bern's total land area, 32.8% is heavily forested. Of the agricultural land, 14.3% is used for growing crops and 4.0% is designated to be used as pasture.

          "A bit expansive, but this museum boasts interactive and very informative exhibits on the mountain realm. The museography benefits from scientists from the Geography Department of the University of Bern.",

          "I visited a few years ago when there was a permanent exhibition which because I was in a group we were rushed a bit. So I came back expecting the same exhibition and I could finish going round. Now it has changed and there's this new video exhibition which tells no story and is",

          "Once this was a nice classical museum without a lot of pretensions, it had a nice permanent exhibition. The development of tourism in Switzerland was very well illustrated. But it has been `modernised` around 2012. It lost the old charm and in stead it is very `wannabe` now.",
          "Yes, I did have expectation for this museum. Looking on the Bern map alone, I came across this \"Alpines Museum\". I wondered at first why nobody mentioned this place in any guide book or internet review of attractions. I insisted on going on one morning expecting to see",
          "I visited the museum during the Museum-night 2015 - and was wholeheartedly disappointed. I may have had wrong expectations, but a couple of large prints of people climbing Mt. Everest, and 2-3 big TVs showing some short movies were sure not what I expected. The whole exhibition",

          "On the day we visited (14 feb,2014) the only exhibit was a brief history of the Swiss alpine Club and climbing in switzerland; we had understood the museum to display the flora, fauna, geology etc of the Swiss alps,thus quite a let down. Evidently it runs exhibtions throughout",

        "wiki": "Bern [b\u025brn] (listen) (Alemannic German: B\u00e4rn [b\u0325\u00e6\u02d0rn]; French: Berne [b\u025b\u0281n] (listen); Italian: Berna [\u02c8b\u025brna]; Romansh: Berna [\u02c8b\u025brn\u0250] (listen)) is the de facto capital of Switzerland, referred to by the Swiss as their \"federal city\", in German Bundesstadt, French ville f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, and Italian citt\u00e0 federale. With a population of about 140,000 (as of 2019), Bern is the fifth-most populous city in Switzerland. The Bern agglomeration, which includes 36 municipalities, had a population of 406,900 in 2014. The metropolitan area had a population of 660,000 in 2000. Bern is also the capital of the canton of Bern, the second-most populous of Switzerland's cantons.\nThe official language in Bern is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the most-spoken language is an Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Bernese German.\nIn 1983, the historic old town (in German: Altstadt) in the centre of Bern became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe etymology of the name \"Bern\" is uncertain. According to the local legend, based on folk etymology, Berchtold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen, the founder of the city of Bern, vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt, and this turned out to be a bear. It has long been considered likely that the city was named after the Italian city of Verona, which at the time was known as Bern in Middle High German. As a result of the finding of the Bern zinc tablet in the 1980s, it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of Celtic origin, possibly *berna \"cleft\". The bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of Bern from at least the 1220s. The earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the B\u00e4rengraben dates to the 1440s.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nNo archaeological evidence that indicates a settlement on the site of today\u2032s city centre prior to the 12th century has been found so far. In antiquity, a Celtic oppidum stood on the Engehalbinsel (peninsula) north of Bern, fortified since the second century BC (late La T\u00e8ne period), thought to be one of the 12 oppida of the Helvetii mentioned by Caesar. During the Roman era, a Gallo-Roman vicus was on the same site. The Bern zinc tablet has the name Brenodor (\"dwelling of Breno\"). In the Early Middle Ages, a settlement in B\u00fcmpliz, now a city district of Bern, was some 4 km (2 mi) from the medieval city.\nThe medieval city is a foundation of the Z\u00e4hringer ruling family, which rose to power in Upper Burgundy in the 12th century. According to 14th-century historiography (Cronica de Berno, 1309), Bern was founded in 1191 by Berthold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen.\nIn 1218, after Berthold died without an heir, Bern was made a free imperial city by the Goldene Handfeste of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II.\n\n\n=== Old Swiss Confederacy ===\n\nIn 1353, Bern joined the Swiss Confederacy, becoming one of the eight cantons of the formative period of 1353 to 1481.\nBern invaded and conquered Aargau in 1415 and Vaud in 1536, as well as other smaller territories, thereby becoming the largest city-state north of the Alps; by the 18th century, it comprised most of what is today the canton of Bern and the canton of Vaud.\nThe city grew out towards the west of the boundaries of the peninsula formed by the river Aare. The Zytglogge tower marked the western boundary of the city from 1191 until 1256, when the K\u00e4figturm took over this role until 1345. It was, in turn, succeeded by the Christoffelturm (formerly located close to the site of the modern-day railway station) until 1622. During the time of the Thirty Years' War, two new fortifications \u2013 the so-called big and small Schanze (entrenchment) \u2013 were built to protect the whole area of the peninsula.\nAfter a major blaze in 1405, the city's original wooden buildings were gradually replaced by half-timbered houses and subsequently the sandstone buildings which came to be characteristic for the Old Town. Despite the waves of pestilence that hit Europe in the 14th century, the city continued to grow, mainly due to immigration from the surrounding countryside.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nBern was occupied by French troops in 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars, when it was stripped of parts of its territories. It regained control of the Bernese Oberland in 1802, and following the Congress of Vienna of 1814, it newly acquired the Bernese Jura. At this time, it once again became the largest canton of the Confederacy as it stood during the Restoration and until the secession of the canton of Jura in 1979.\nBern was made the Federal City (seat of the Federal Assembly) within the new Swiss federal state in 1848.\nA number of congresses of the socialist First and Second Internationals were held in Bern, particularly during World War I when Switzerland was neutral; see Bern International.\nThe city's population rose from about 5,000 in the 15th century to about 12,000 by 1800 and to above 60,000 by 1900, passing the 100,000 mark during the 1920s.\nPopulation peaked during the 1960s at 165,000 and has since decreased slightly, to below 130,000 by 2000.\nAs of September 2017, the resident population stood at 142,349, of which 100,000 were Swiss citizens and 42,349 (31%) resident foreigners. A further estimated 350,000 people live in the immediate urban agglomeration.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBern lies on the Swiss plateau in the canton of Bern, slightly west of the centre of Switzerland and 20 km (12 mi) north of the Bernese Alps. The countryside around Bern was formed by glaciers during the most recent ice age. The two mountains closest to Bern are Gurten with a height of 864 m (2,835 ft) and Bantiger with a height of 947 m (3,107 ft). The site of the old observatory in Bern is the point of origin of the CH1903 coordinate system at 46\u00b057\u203208.66\u2033N 7\u00b026\u203222.50\u2033E.\nThe city was originally built on a hilly peninsula surrounded by the river Aare, but outgrew natural boundaries by the 19th century. A number of bridges have been built to allow the city to expand beyond the Aare.\nBern is built on very uneven ground. An elevation difference of up to 60 metres exists between the inner city districts on the Aare (Matte, Marzili) and the higher ones (Kirchenfeld, L\u00e4nggasse).\nBern has an area, as of 2009, of 51.62 km2 (19.93 sq mi). Of this area, 9.79 km2 (3.78 sq mi) or 19.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 17.33 km2 (6.69 sq mi) or 33.6% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 23.25 km2 (8.98 sq mi) or 45.0% is settled (buildings or roads), 1.06 km2 (0.41 sq mi) or 2.1% is either rivers or lakes, and 0.16 km2 (0.062 sq mi) or 0.3% is unproductive land.Of the developed area of Bern, 3.6% consists of industrial buildings, 21.7% housing and other buildings, and 12.6% is devoted to transport infrastructure. Power and water infrastructure, as well as other special developed areas, made up 1.1% of the city, while another 6.0% consists of parks, green belts, and sports fields.\nOf Bern's total land area, 32.8% is heavily forested. Of the agricultural land, 14.3% is used for growing crops and 4.0% is designated to be used as pasture. Local rivers and streams provide all the water in the municipality.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification, Bern has a humid continental climate (Dfb) closely bordering on an oceanic climate (Cfb).\nThe closest weather station near Bern is located in the municipality of Zollikofen, about 5 kilometres (3 mi) north of the city centre. The warmest month for Bern is July, with a daily mean temperature of 18.3 \u00b0C (64.9 \u00b0F), and a daily maximum temperature of 24.3 \u00b0C (75.7 \u00b0F). The highest temperature recorded at Bern / Zollikofen is 37.0 \u00b0C (98.6 \u00b0F), recorded in August 2003. On average, a temperature of 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) or above is recorded 40.7 days per year, and 6 days per year with a temperature of 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) or above at Zollikofen, and the warmest day reaches an average of 32.1 \u00b0C (89.8 \u00b0F).There are 103.7 days of air frost, and 22.3 ice days per year at Bern (Zollikofen) for the period of 1981\u20132010, as well as 14.1 days of snowfall, 36.7 days of snow cover per year and the average amount of snow measured per year is 52.6 centimetres (20.7 in). On average, January is the coldest month, with a daily mean temperature of \u22120.4 \u00b0C (31.3 \u00b0F), and a daily minimum temperature of \u22123.6 \u00b0C (25.5 \u00b0F). The lowest temperature ever recorded at Bern (Zollikofen) was \u221223.0 \u00b0C (\u22129.4 \u00b0F), recorded in February 1929, and typically the coldest temperature of the year reaches an average of \u221212.8 \u00b0C (9.0 \u00b0F) for the period of 1981\u20132010.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nThe municipality is administratively subdivided into six districts (Stadtteile), each of which consists of several quarters (Quartiere).\n\n\n=== Government ===\n\nThe Municipal Council (de: Gemeinderat, fr: conseil municipal) constitutes the executive government of the City of Bern and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of five councillors (German: Gemeinderat/-r\u00e4tin, French: conseiller/conseill\u00e8re municipal(e)), each presiding over a directorate (de: Direktion, fr: direction) comprising several departments and bureaus. The president of the executive department acts as mayor (de: Stadtpr\u00e4sident, fr: Le Maire). In the mandate period 2017\u20132020 (Legislatur) the Municipal Council is presided by Stadtpr\u00e4sident Alec von Graffenried. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the City Council are carried by the Municipal Council. The regular election of the Municipal Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. Any resident of Bern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. Contrary to most other municipalities, the executive government in Berne is selected by means of a system of Proporz. The mayor is elected as such as well by public election while the heads of the other directorates are assigned by the collegiate. The executive body holds its meetings in the Erlacherhof, built by architect Albrecht St\u00fcrler after 1747.As of 2017, Bern's Municipal Council is made up of two representatives of the SP (Social Democratic Party), and one each of CVP (Christian Democratic Party), GFL (Gr\u00fcne Freie Liste a.k.a. Green Free List, who is the newly elected mayor since 2017), and GB (Green Alliance of Berne), giving the left parties a very strong majority of four out of five seats. The last regular election was held on 27 November 2016/15 January 2017.\n\nDr. J\u00fcrg Wichtermann is State Chronicler (Staatsschreiber) since 2008. He has been elected by the collegiate.\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\nThe City Council (de: Stadtrat, fr: Conseil de ville) holds legislative power. It is made up of 80 members, with elections held every four years. The City Council decrees regulations and by-laws that are executed by the Municipal Council and the administration. The delegates are selected by means of a system of proportional representation.\nThe sessions of the City Council are public. Unlike members of the Municipal Council, members of the City Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance.

          "At the junction of Monument Street & Fish Street. Offers a spectacular view of the city. There is no lift , so you have to take stairs",
          "One way up and one way down. You have to fight the people on the stairs going the opposite way to you. Of going up you get stuck behind someone who stops every 5 steps it can be frustrating. On top it\u2019s a good view but again you push through everyone else up there.",
          "Nestled among taller buildings, between London Bridge and Monument Station, the monument is easy to miss and ignore - but don't. The large plaque and carvings on the external wall of the monument are important in relation to the fire and if you just want to read the history and",
          "We arrived 30 seconds before the last admission and quickly had to decide: race to the top or return later? We raced to the top! We had great fun climbing the 311 stairs. The views of London were really good. And, we learned that the Monument was originally intended to serve",
          "Visited as a family with my 8, 6 and 1 year old. Staff allowed us to leave the buggy and a bags by the entrance, which was great. The views from the top are really incredible. The top area is completely enclosed with wire mesh, which makes it feel very safe for the children, but",

          "Great day out. A long climb to the top, but worth the effort. The 360 degree views across London are amazing - you can see most of the main attractions too - Tower Bridge, St. Paul's and so on. The kids loved it and entrance fees are very reasonable indeed. You even get a",
          "Stumbled upon this getting off of the underground and were an hour early for where we were going, so decided to climb the 311 steps to the top. So glad we did. Fabulous views from the top, amazing staff.",
          "Got to the top, what a workout, 311 steps from bottom to top. Needed a breather when I got to the top, but what a view",
          "We were ready for a quick break when we stopped at The Monument! We were also motivated by the certificate you receive after you have completed the 211 stair climb! Plus there is a great little cafe in the same square that serves pastries, coffees and ummm - has a nice clean",
          "I've visited The Monument sever times. It's well worth the climb for the view. The Monument commemorates the Great Fire of London in 1666 which was blamed on the Catholics. Whether the Catholics were responsible or not I do not know. However, the Catholics certainly has cause",
          "We always see the monument as we walk past but this time we decided to do the 300+ steps to the top. It was well worth it for the views were splendid. Actually the climb up was not that bad, a good heart thumper but okay.",
          "We came across this monument unexpectedly en route to St. Pauls Cathedral. It denotes a major event in London. We took time to read the various plaques but were surprised that none of them indicated the impact to lives lost in the fire. We had to ask an attendant for that",
          "Remembering the great fire of London in 1666. Standing tall and very dominant in its location close to London Bridge. You can get to the top but watch opening hours.",
          "Definitely worth the trek up the 311 winding stairs for an excellent view of London! We went on the hottest day of the year and it really was fun! We had a great time. Fair price for what it is and whole thing takes less than an hour! I like that it\u2019s not overcrowded with tons",
          "Walked up the 311 steps today, could hardly breathe at the top. The hubby and kids seemed fine though, so must be me! Payed half price with the LNER 241 offers using train ticket. Don\u2019t think it would have been worth \u00a35 each. \u00a310 for four of us was enough as it\u2019s a long climb to",
          "Bit of a trek up 311 steps (& down again) but worth it for the view. We bought the twin attraction ticket with Tower Bridge on line, not expensive. There is no lift & the staircase is an internal spiral so not suitable for everyone. The platform at the top is caged in.",
          "The Monument is the Fire Memorial, recalling the tragic great fire from the year 1666, which destroyed 2/3 of London City. The Monument is situated on Fish Street Hill, and is accessible from Underground Lines Circle, or District, Monument Station. The Monument was built",
          "I visited the monument with my 7 year old, who learned about the Great Fire in school this year. It took us maybe 5-7 minutes to climb the stairs (the steps are little). There was almost no one there, so that made it easier, as it gets a little narrow towards the top. The views",

          "This is exactly what it advertises itself to be: a monument where you climb up a bunch of steps to have a wonderful view of London. That being said, it is quite a nice view and the age of the monument in impressive.",
          "There are more stairs than you think. The stairwell is very narrow, so it\u2019s good to go just before closing when it\u2019s not too busy. The staff are very friendly and the views of the Thames, Tower Bridge etc are great. It\u2019s quite surreal to realise what the monument is for. Once",
          "It was quite a trek up the 311 steps to the top but totally worth it for the views. Went at opening and only 2 other people there.",
          "Not on the top of every tourists to do list, but certainly should be. For just \u00a35, climbing the Great Fire of London Monument is a challenge within itself, but rewarded with fantastic views across London, coupled with a great sense of achievement. With 311 narrow spiral steps,",
          "Visite The Monumet on a very hot day, probably not the best day to climb the steps inside the Monument? There are 311 very narrow spiral steps, meaning a big squeeze when you have to pass someone going the opposite way to you. But, aftre climbing the steps there are great",
          "311 steps but worth the climb. Had to carry the dog most of the way. Cheap entry. Go for it. Fantastic views. You can see over central London.",
          "Although there are many steps and it gets a little tiring, the views were absolutely beautiful at the top! Well worth all the stairs. It was one of my favorite views from our entire stay in London. It was very inexpensive. I think it was 5 pounds per person. And they even give",
          "Me and my sister climbed this..early morning as soon as it opened! Definitely worth doing to see the view of London! It\u2019s only 311 steps! You get given a little printed certificate to prove you climbed it..nice little touch. Also, need to mention the staff that were there (27th",
          "Providing you don't have a heart attack on the way up, the viewing platform provides wonderful 360 views of London. It wasn't too bad, but the steps are uneven and steep in places - fortunately my friends as just as unfit as I am so we stopped regularly to catch our breath!! For",
          "We made the visit to the Monument after being told about it on a hop on hop off tour (The Original Tour Bus) - We paid \u00a35 each to climb all 311 steps to the top and were not disappointed with the amazing views. On completion of our trip up and down the monument, we were",
          "We stumbled upon the monument en route to the Monument tube station (it\u2019s right next to it) and found no line on a Saturday afternoon. Senior pricing made it affordable to climb (look back down the center of the spiral staircase if you dare!). You get a certificate at the exit",
          "Visited with 2 of my Grandsons, the 4 year old went up the stairs like the proverbial rat up a drainpipe. Great views from the top although many of the more recent buildings overshadow it now. Not too expensive. Well worth a visit and doesn't take too long, we followed up by",
          "The monument itself is pretty amazing to see up close. Climbing the staircase inside is a bit of a trek and there's nothing to really see inside. Once at the top there are some lovely views of the city, though the fencing partially blocks the views.",
          "Really embarrassed that I knew nothing about the monument to the Great Fire of London; just got off the tube at monument station and there it is 200 foot of Portland stone. Cheap to get in and walk up the 300 steps to the viewing platform; a great tribute to a tragic event.",
          "I had been on the tour buses and whizzed past this spot quite a few times but never actually visited it on foot. A marvellous monument.",
          "A really nice view, after climbing around 216 stairs, it's a nice start for a sightseeing day, recommend if you're ok with going a big amount of stairs. A Nice view, that's about it.",
          "As a UK resident who visits London annually for sightseeing, I am embarrassed to admit didn\u2019t even know there was a monument to the Great Fire of London. It cost hardly anything to walk up the many, many steps! The view at the top was amazing and worth the climb!",
          "The BA flight from Phoenix to London and return using a Jumbo Jet needs some work. I know that Jumbos are nearing the end of their lifespan, but this doesn\u2019t excuse the plane being cleaned badly or the video system in quite a few seats not working. On the plus side, my low",

          "Used a bus tour to get here to visit London Bridge and borough market. Stopped off at the monument as I teach this at school and took some photos! Didn\u2019t go up as not a fan of heights! Loved seeing pudding lane as well!",
          "I visited this with 2 of my sons. It\u2019s a fair climb up at 311 steps though doesn\u2019t take too long. Great views from the top so well worth it. Good value too at a fiver for me and a bit less for them as students. Probably not for the very unfit or claustrophobic. You even get a",
          "Lovely staff. This attraction is not suitable for people who have mobility problems. Many many stairs winding up to the top. But once you get there the views are stunning so take a camera. You can stay as long as you want to, to admire the view.",
          "Big enough not to miss but unless you walk all the around it you could miss the entrance as we nearly did, long way up but I think the view was worth the \u00a35 entrance fee lol, not for the faint hearted very high and a lot of steps up and down. Nice little finish to our day in",
          "This is a great secret. It\u2019s not easy to find but once you are here you\u2019ll be glad you got here. It\u2019s only \u00a35 to get in and you get to climb the circular stairs to the viewing platform at the top. It\u2019s a great climb as you check out your surrounds and the slim windows and",
          "Worth the climb. It is included in the London pass and our kids studied about the great london fire. They loved it. Nice view up top. Right across from the entrance is a plaque where the fire started.",
          "Having done touristy things abroad, I decided to pick something touristy when in London for a gig. I picked the Monument as until recently I didn't even know you could climb up inside! I was lucky as I picked a time with no queues. it's all very tight for space, so I can't",
          "There are 331 steps in a spiral staircase with no landing however it is well worth the exercise to get to the top - the view across London is well worth the effort! You can stay as long as you like at the top - the way down is the same staircase as the way up! I would not",
          "This was a steep climb but worth it for the views. Came with our 7 and 9 year olds who whizzed up the 311 steps but not for the faint hearted!! The views are really good, and this is a lot cheaper than the shard plus the history behind it is interesting. Make sure you get your",
          "Health warning! There are a lot of steps!.....but definitely worth the climb. I have visited London many times but never done this before. The Monument to the great fire of London is a great memorial to commemorate what was lost. The entrance price is 5 pounds for an adult and",
          "We had a combo ticket to here and Tower Bridge. The tube pops out quite close to this monument, so it was an easy stop. There are so many steps to climb on the spiral staircase, but we knocked them out and were rewarded with great city views.",
          "Started working in this area recently and never realised it was here. Now I understand why monument station is called monument station! Nice memento of a fire 'accidentally started' Would be tempted to start one myself to get a statue.. any one know how to remove the battery",
          "We decided to ascend the Monument on the spur of the moment on a cold but sunny Saturday afternoon. \u00a35 per adult was well worth the experience. The steps are shallow, even and easy to climb and there are recesses every so often where you can hole up and wait for people",
          "On a break with teens we enjoyed climbing the monument to look at the fabulous view, and were pleased with our certificates of achievement too! It\u2019s a lot of steps, and pretty scary at the top, but worth doing.",
          "We went on a really sunny day, initially thought of going up the Shard for a good view but it is too expensive so found this immediately after stepping off the the tube. Only \u00a35 and the views were amazing in addition to the forced exercise going up over 300 steps, learning the",
          "I arrived five minutes before the 9:30am opening, so I was at the front of the quue to buy a ticket. This proved fortuitous as soon after two large groups of schoolchildren arrived. Luckily the number of people allowed inside at any one time is limited so that the viewing",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed our trip. Definitely recommend along with other things if you\u2019re in the area. Exit 2 from Monument tube and it\u2019s impressive and impossible to miss the imposing Monument. You can\u2019t pre book time slotted tickets but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a need to. I understand",
          "Took me a while to do all the spiral stairs, but worth it for the view at the top. Only \u00a35 (and you get a certificate to say you've achieved the climb!) You can walk right round the top and take photos of all of the major places/attractions of London. The staff are lovely and",

          "We went to see the Monument on 24 March and climbed the 311 steps to the top. Hard work but resulting in a spectacular 360 degree view of London. Not an expensive visitor attraction but one with great history behind it and well worth the effort to climb the stairs.",
          "If, like us, you love climbing towers in cities, then The Monument is a definite attraction to visit. It\u2019s cheap to enter and offers great views over London. Plus the queues aren\u2019t long and it\u2019s situated right next to the Underground. Just do it :-)",
          "This is a wonderful monument to the fire of London. Situated near the site of the fire. We did not attempt the steps to the top. Worth a visit.",
          "Going as 2 adults and 2 children, we had a great experience. Very nice people helping us and very tiring! There are 311 steps to the top! The view from the top is outstanding with all main London sights in sight. Very safe at the top as you are in a complete cage. Be wary as it",
          "It was a clear day and my wife and I decided to visit the Monument to the Great Fire of London. We were lucky as we did not have to queue to get in, after a security check we went straight on up. The steps are well maintained and it is a steady climb to the top. From the top",
          "A really interesting little nugget of history. Kind of there on the way to elsewhere. A good quad strengthening climb to the top rewarded by a fantastic view. Probably one of the most cost effective london vistas if budget is tight. Worth a little of your time.",

          "Visited this for the first time yesterday. It\u2019s a lot of steps but worth the climb to see the fantastic view at the top!",
          "Definitely worth a visit, if only for the point in history it represents and commemorates. Great to see the other more modern landmarks towering nearby but the manual ascent via 311 steps makes for a energetic change. Time your visit to save on queuing and repetitive passing",
          "i have been going to The Monument for over 40 years with family and friends. If you only have time for one thing in London - you won't be disappointed. Arrive early to avoid the crowds and on top you'll get a fantastic view of London. A bargain at just \u00a35 for adults - puts the",

          "No disrespect to what the Monument represents, but I was miffed not to be let in with a tripod and DSLR. I knew they had a rule about bulky bags but I wasn't expecting to be turned away for a thin folded up bit of metal and a camera. The old woman at the door didn't even look me",
          "This is a great experience. Climbing the 311 steps felt like we were actually going back in time. Amazed at how it was built. We kept going round and round the viewing deck. It was one of those activities that we will positively remember.",

          "To climb a spiral staircase built in 1200's proved to be a worthwhile experience with a decent view from the top. Only takes 30 mins for the full experience and if in the area, a worthwhile activity.",

          "Ok so the monument is no longer the tallest building in London and is now surrounded by a lot more buildings then it was when I was a kid but the view of the river on a sunny day is quite something. Winding spiral staircase which gets a bit narrower at the top is a little",
          "The tower itself is impressive and my son who is 7 was desperate to visit after learning about it at school. However there is no interpretation to look at to find out more about the tower, how it was built etc or about the fire itself. The stairs aren\u2019t for the faint hearted and",

          "I don't know what the people who have given poor reviews were expecting, but it is a tall monument to commemorate the Great Fire of London. You obviously need to be fit to climb over 300 steps to the top, but it is well worth it, and you get a great view from the top. Pudding",

          "As a tribute to The Fire of London this stands proudly near Tower Bridge. This monument is a Doric column and is tucked in between other more modern pieces of architecture. A fitting tribute to the fire of London and a must see if you\u2019re wanting the History behind London.",
          "It's hard to believe that this was once one of the tallest structures in London. It is a stately classic column topped by a brilliant gold sculpture. And the whole thing has historical significance as a monument to the tragic London fire of the 1600's. It is wedged around",
          "After the day I had, climbing the Monument to the Great Fire was probably not the best idea but I did it. The climb is over 300 steps and there is not a lot of space to move around. I assume the view use to be phenomenal before all the newer buildings went up around it, but now",

Cost a lady Godiva (\u00a35) entry and they give you a certificate on exit! It\u2019s such a fantastic historic",
          "Thought we would go to the top all 311 stairs, worth it as views are good, would say if you are in the area do it",
          "A great monunent to this Historic event. Pointed out by our Tour guide and worth a little visit to see the area and inscriptions.",
          "Situated near to where the Great Fire of London started, if it was laid on the ground the top would be on the actual spot in Bakehouse Lane. Near to the Tower of London you can enter and climb the 311 steps to the top for a fantastic view. The steps are steep so if you are not",
          "With 311 steps to the top it\u2019s quite a climb to reach the top of the monument but it\u2019s worth it Not only are you climbing a piece of history but the views once up there are amazing and worth the effor",
          "Never knew this was here, the monument is well worth a visit! The staircase is quite tight but what an amazing view at the top and experience. Excellent and only \u00a35 (only takes cash).",
          "I am very glad I made room for this stop. It is a long way up some very narrow stairs but at the top you are met with a very lovely view of the city and I am now the proud owner of a certificate of achievement. Lol they give you this certificate it actually very nice. When I",
          "This is a spectacular column and a must see if you are visiting the City. The steps are narrow but the view from the top is excellent although you mainly see the surrounding skyscrapers which I find impressive.",
          "Didn't know about this until we visited tower bridge, where we bought the tickets to go here as well as the bridge. Really fasinating history I didn't know about. The circular steps are pretty tiring to climb, but it is worth it & it is a good view from there as well. Enjoyed",
          "its a long way up and short down. been working and living in London all my life and this was a first. do it for a short 45 minutes and doesn't cost much",
          "311 steps up a spiral staircase and even though much has been built since the Monument, the view remains fantastic - St Pauls and Tower Bridge in particular!",
          "Took my son and nephew to climb the steps of the monument, my son who's is 8 has climbed the stairs three times now. It was a first for my nephew who's 11, a cheap history lesson a brilliant view of london and a certificate when you reach the bottom Kids loved it",
          "This monument was built in 1677 to celebrate the rebuilding of London after the Great Fire of London. It was inspiring then and although it is somewhat obscured by the many buildings in the City of London that surround it, it is still impressive and inspiring. For only a few",
          "Yes , half way up you'll say is it worth it, well when youv'e got to step 311 and walk out into the fresh air you will be glad persevered . Stunning views across London.",
          "Interesting monument built as a symbol of resurrection of the CIty of London afer the great fire. Hidden between multiple blocks of office complexes, it provides a nice view of London once you go to the top",
          "Don't be put off by 311 ever decreasing width of steps to the top. It's amazing. We stumbled across this purely by mistake. My middle boy wanted to go to the top. So we did and WOW. Well worth the effort. The view is stunning. Then there is the 311 ever increasing in width steps",
          "I didn't know about this tourist spot until we just walked past it and read the signs. Then we realised quickly that it was built for the great fire of London! Decent price, we have student discount and was too long to que for. We had a bit of time to kill so this was great!",
          "I was taught about the Great Fire of London some 50 years ago in School..so to visit Pudding Lane and to see the Monument to where it all started added the last missing piece of the jigsaw for me..",
          "311 steps to a great view of the London. Enjoyed the climb up. Very friendly ladies at the till. We went on a Sunday afternoon and there was no line up or people waiting. We were able to spend some time at the top to look from all sides at the dramatic difference of historic",
          "The building lacks any comforts , coming down stairs too fast your likely to feel dizzy as stupid lighting and poor steps size will make you likely to misjudge steps as your moving in a spiral motion coming down. Best not to rush decent and to take as much time as possible .The",
          "I am a view guy so this was a must-see! It wasn\u00b4t easy to climb the steps, there was not much space for more people, but the view was stunning! I also recieved a small gift (diploma) after all... \u2665",
          "Great find when wandering around town. 311 steps to the top of the column for great views and only \u00a35 per person, or \u00a35 for two if you get the London 2 for 1 book. The staircase is spiral and gets thinner at top but the views are great over London. Probably not a good adventure",
          "Being scared of heights we weren't sure if I would be able to get up, but after a long walk up some very steep steps with nowhere to stop along the way the views were totally worth it. You get a student discount for entry but it's such a great way to see the city from another",
          "We went to visit the Monument as we had received a 2 for 1 ticket with the Tower Bridge experience. We were left a little disappointed as we had to wait around 30 minutes before we could get in and then it\u2019s just one staircase up and the same one down. It\u2019s a long narrow",
          "I hadn't eaten and was extremely thirsty when I came across the monument, good thing that the smart side of me took over and decided to... Exactly! Climb the staircase anyway! Halfway I did regret my decision (mainly because of the lack of water) but the view makes up for it!",
          "Children and I thoroughly enjoyed our time at the monmument in London. Got some fantastic pictures from the top but there is NO lift, the only way up is to walk and you have to breathe in as people might be coming down as your going up but everybody laughs and has a bit of",
          "331 steps up to the top of this iconic building, but what views. I'm not a fan of heights so kept away from the edge! If you plan on doing other sightseeing activities, you can get a discount if you book the two together.",
          "I was amazed by this as signifying such a momentous event for London - is still quite an imposing sight among many new buildings. In a vibrant area with lots of public transport and easy to get to.",
          "The Monument is adjacent to the Monument underground station. The kids loved the challenge of climbing 311 steps on a narrow stone spiral staircase built 340 years ago. The view is still magnificent although not as good as in the past as new tall office blocks now limit the",
          "We went to the Monument for the Great fire of London, nice view from top after climbing 311 steps you get a certificate for your effort cost \u00a35 pound.",
          "Climb the tower for a good view of the surround area. Informative plaques and nic spot to sit for a few minutes to regroup.",
          "It's a monument with a 311 step spiral stair case. Not too much to do. Walking up gives a great view and you get a certificate for making it.",
          "It's a nice monument that commemorates the great fire of 1666. I didn't spend much time there nor cared to pay to go all the way up. If you like history, give it a try, it will be a better experience that it was for me.",
          "You gotta be fit!!!! It is an ever turning staircase climb to get to the top but the end result is well worth it. The views are breath taking but these days I guess you can get the same views from some of the high rise office blocks, except that this old lady has been here for",
          "Nice looking doric column commemorating the great fire of 2 September 1666. When I visited on a Friday there were many people spilling out of the local bars onto the sidewalks drinking a beer to celebrate Friday all around the base of the column.",
          "Everyone knows the Great Fire of London 1666.. well if they don\u2019t, or never cared much for history, this is a good place to start. See where this fire started on Pudding Lane that destroyed so any homes and businesses... and understand why a densely packed city like London",
          "This is a very tall monument that could do with a good clean. However on reading the rather large plaque it is a very moving tribute to the great fire of London. Not far from London bridge. It is a free attraction.",
          "Used a 2 for 1 voucher to gain entry for the 311 step climb up the tower for lovely views over the city. It is quite a narrow spiral staircase so you need to be reasonably fit but is worth the climb. You get a certificate when you leave.",
          "310 steps to the top, my legs were beginning to turn to Jelly towards the top but I am 63 after all, the views from the top are still excellent though diminishing all the time by the sky-scraping buildings that appear in more numbers each time I visit. \u00a38.50 for the two of us",
          "Some of the best views in London, it's a relentless slightly surreal climb. It spirals round round and I felt quite dizzy. Go for it worth the energy and it's \u00a35. Apparently the staff have to climb it four times a day",
          "The monument is a 200 ft column in memorial to the great fire of London, situated within yards of the seat of the fire. It was designed and built by sir Christopher wren and Robert Hooke. It costs \u00a35 per person to ascend the 311 steps, to reach the top, offering wonderful views",
          "We walked from Tower Bridge to St Paul's Cathedral via The Monument. It is tucked away an engulfed by the buildings surrounding it. It was late in the day and we were running out of time so we skipped walking up. Entry is included with the London Pass. From reading other reviews",
          "Having climbed the monument a few times with family members who are studying the Great Fire, it never ceases to impress me. The steps seem never ending as they wind tighter and tighter towards the top, but once outside, the views are impressive. There has been a lot of",
          "I saw an and on the train and thought it was a good idea to go there with my foreign friends. We had to pay to get inside but it was a small price to pay. We walked up the stairs, which was pretty hard but definitely worth it in the end. The view was amazing, I highly recommend.",
          "The stairs are steep and long, but they look fantastic. In the top part it is more narrow so do mind people going on the other direction. The view is great from the top, but to me it was the staircase that made this visit.",
          "Impressive monument and a steep climb to the top! Worth it for the views though. Probably not for those who are infirm or unfit though! If you don\u2019t fancy the climb it\u2019s still worth looking at from the outside.",
          "Entrance fee: We used 7day Travelcard issued by National Rail, so we could use offered 2for1 discount (you just need to print the voucher ahaed). Visit: Around 300 steps on spiral staircase and nice view - nothing more, nothing less. What I appreciate is that they control the",
          "I really enjoyed climbing the stairs to the top - it\u2019s narrow! View at the top is great, but obviously overshadowed by taller buildings in some directions. Good view of the Shard. Note that the top is enclosed with a kind of mesh, so photography was tricky. You can also purchase",
          "Marks the site of the great fire of London. Located at a small intersection it is too high to see the sculpture clearly but you get the feeling of flames. Several plaques on the base explain the monument. Interesting reading. The great fire gave London a chance to rebuild and",
          "We climbed this tower as complimentary tour to the Tower Bridge, and got a certificate of the 311 steps up and down. The balcony on the top is protected with a wire mesh, but you can see the Tower Bridge on one side and on the other side how the new modern centre is closing in",
          "Breakfast at the Plaza on the River was yummy... yummy. See pictures. LOVED the honey on the comb. \ud83d\ude0b So I did some sight-seeing. Took Bus87 from the Vauxhall line. Painted the town RED at Trafalgar Square. Souvenir Gift shops GALORE there! Visited the Tate Museum,",
          "Something worth seeing in both daylight and night time . Also you can go inside and upstairs. See photo for details.",
          "The Monument was built to commemorate the Great Fire of London in 1666, which we have to thank for much of the city's modern look. The event was a landmark in city history, but the monument has been swallowed up and overshadowed by larger structures around it. Still, it is well",
          "I was lucky to choose a very quiet Friday pm to visit and climb. I\u2019d been years before but it\u2019s nice to take time to remember an important part of London\u2019s history from almost 350 years back. Because London\u2019s skyline is constantly changing, so are the views and a few buildings",
          "We visited the monument with 3 of our children aged 5,8&12 as part of our youngest\u2019s Great Fire of London project at School. It was easy to get to from the tube and entry was fairly lowly priced for London, around \u00a310 for 4 of them and 5 and unders go free. It\u2019s 312 steps to the",
          "A seldom visited but wonderful piece of history. Make the effort and walk up. The fact that it marks a event that everybody knows about but itself is virtually unknown is a good enough reason to see it. But the walk up and the view from the top is wonderful. Eponymous tube stop",
          "Well worth the effort to climb to the top, the views are spectacular. The Monument was built between 1671 and 1677, to commemorate the Great Fire of London and to celebrate the rebuilding of the City. The Monument is 202 feet (61 metres) high - the exact distance between it and",
          "Ok, this was really not on my radar in all of the times I've visited London, but I should have done it earlier, sure there are a lot of steps but you get a great view, a little workout and a certificate at the end. I might do it again, hopefully on a warmer day!",
          "This monument was erected to mark the great fire of London which started in a bakery in pudding lane. It's ironic that the first person to commit suicide by throwing them selves off the top of this structure was a baker, John Cradock 1788. Great view from the top,",
          "We arrived with the underground and stepped out just in front of the Monument. Around 60m high. We paid \u00a35 each to go up the stairs to the top of the Monument Where there were an amazing view over London. Pay the \u00a35 and go to the top it's worth it.",
          "We went there on Saturday morning, much quieter as in the week, but just another monument. Nothing spectacular. The story about the fire is much more interesting. It may be worth it to climb the stair to the top. As it was raining we decided to just visit.",
          "The monument, of course, memorializes the Great Fire that changed the cityscape of London. When you climb to the top -- not for those wary of heights (but it's far better than being on top of the Eye!!) -- you are rewarded with great views of London.",
          "My 7 year old son had just learnt about the Great Fire of London at school, so we decided to go and scale the Monument with his 5 year old sister. I would suggest getting there early as there is a limit to the number of people who can be inside at once. The stairs are",
          "We got there about 30 minutes before it closed and we had the place to ourselves. We are all in pretty good shape so it was not difficult getting to the top. Once there, it presented us with great views of the city. When you get down they give you a certificate that tells",
          "\u00a312 for adult and three children. Price about right for fun climb and views all you could ask for. Could remain looking at view without limit and completely safe throughout.",
          "An interesting monument near the London Bridge. I think this is where the big fire started. You can get to the top.",
          "It's a good climb to the top and a pretty scary experience. Not for anyone who is scared of heights. Excellent views across London .",
          "Get a bird's eye view of London from here, where the Great Fire began. Be warned, there are 311 steps and you will most likely feel winded by the time you are halfway up. Slow and steady. But definitely worth the climb up to the top, especially if the day is clear.",
          "The Monument to the Great Fire of London is an interesting stop while exploring the City of London. It is a brief one but worth the time.",
          "Single spiral stone steps take you up for a terrific view of the Thames, Tower of London, St. Paul\u2019s etc. We went quite early in case it got busy and there was no queue.",
          "This was the start in pudding lane of the great fire. Great monument with a most impressive top in gold. You need to be fit to climb over 300 steps up.",
          "Great view from the top, but you must be able to climb the 311 steps to get to see it. But it is absolutely worth the climbing!",
          "The Monument is a the perfect end point on a walking tour of traditional London! Use the tube (District or Circle Line) to get to the tube station \"Temple\". From there one goes to the Royal Courts of Justice. \"Sightseeing value\" is maybe not as high as the more famous landmarks,",
          "An astonishing piece of history with amazing views. It is a tough climb and narrow at the top, be brave, you'll be glad you did!",
          "We found this monument by accident, and decided to pay the 5 pounds to climb it after the host told us about it. They finished building it in 1677 (!!!) to commemorate the great fire of London in 1666. We climbed all 311 steps to the top, which gives you great views of the",
          "The Monument to the Great Fire of London is quite a nice piece of work. It was in fact designed by two great people, one of whom was Christopher Wren, the man responsible for the design of that magnificent edifice, St Paul's Cathedral. So you can't go wrong. It's a beautiful",
          "We just happened to stumble upon the Monument during a walk in the snow (we were visiting from Boston which loves a good column monument). It's a beautiful piece of art that is an great memorial to the Great Fire. You can climb up for a small fee, the space is very small thought",
          "Despite having used the Monument tube station lots of times for work, I had no idea that your could climb the Monument...until that is our 5yo bothered to walk round to the other side as we were doing our tourist thing! \u00a312.50 and 311 steps later were were stood at the top - a",
          "Definitely need to be in good health to climb the 311 steps. No where to stop for a sit down! The view was fantastic. Glad I did it on my birthday, just to prove that I am still young enough...",
          "Very good and cheap. Be advised though there is a lot of steps so only go if you are fit and healthy.",
          "I last visited the Monument as a child. The climb is hard, but well worth it! Great river Thames and St Paul's views in all directions. We visited as it opened at 9.30am and had it to ourselves. You receive a certificate when you return to the bottom. Don't visit here if yo",
          "So many people are rushing to go up the tall buildings such as the Shard, and paying a lot for the privilege, but you actually get the best views a bit lower down. This is something I learned in Shanghai and Hong Kong. The best views are from halfway up the towers and the best",
          "We only had time to stop and reflect, but it was a must whilst we were in the area, like I'm sure every child at primary school knows. We didn't have time to wait and climb to the top, so we waved at those that did !",
          "The monument is in recognition of the great fire of London. It is surrounded by relatively modern build so not easily visible but generates a real wow factor when you are there. Lovely and a striking monument. If you have time it is worth the small cost to climb to the top.",
          "The Monument is a must to get a unique view of London. Every visitor gets a certificate after climbing the stairs which is a lovely souvenir. There was a short wait to get in as it is not possible that too many people can climb the tower at the same time but the view at the",
          "We visited during half term and had a bit of a wait in the queue. The view at the top was worth it for the small price (student!!) It is definitely a hidden gem that doesn't get the recognition it should.",
          "This monument is tucked away in between tall modern office buildings so is easy to miss but is a short walk from the Tower of London. Had to queue for about 20 minutes but the wait was worth it as you get a great view of the Thames and further afield from the top. Try and choose",
          "Sometimes to know the history of such monuments is pretty interesting. This monument was built in 1666 to commemorate the great fire that burned in London from 2-5 September and destroyed two-thirds of the city. We passed by this place on the way to London Bridge area and did",
          "We visited here and decided not to go to the top as there was quite a queue of people already waiting to go inside and climb to the top. it was still lovely to go to the monument and read all about the fire on the bottom of the monument, summarized version. It is very near to",
          "We decided to visit as it's on the list of things to do that obviously requires a degree of physical fitness, so we decided to go before we get much older \ud83d\ude02 It was so worth the climb amazing views over the city and a certificate of achievement. I needed to pause a few times in",
          "It is worth the visit even if you do not go up. Easy to find and connected via tube. It is an impressive doric column that commemorates the great fire that destroyed 2/3 parts of London centuries ago. You can find the summarized story engraved in the base of the monument. As",
          "Worth the climb !!!! 311 steps!!! And this is free if you have LONDON pass. Great experience!!!!! The place was not too crowded when I went. Go there in the morning. I\u2019m not that fit but I made it to the top. You can take your time climbing up. If you have bags it\u2019s best to",
          "I\u2019ve been to London maybe 100 times and I didn\u2019t know this monument existed! Stumbled upon it by accident when I went for a walk and decided to go up for a look. Entry fee was \u00a35 but well worth the great views of London. Be warned, the 311 step climb is hard work! Real gem of a",
          "The monument is a commemorative pillar and a scientific laboratory designed by Wren and Hooke, two founding members of the Royal Society in the 1660s. It\u2019s worth waiting to ascend the monument on a fine, clear Winter\u2019s day. The lower sun will throw the great jumble of buildings",
          "A place everyone should go to visiting London. A place of great history and you can also go to the very top. Many steps to climb and not for the faint hearted who don\u2019t like heights but getting to the top is definitely worth the views.",
          "There is quite a lot of steps but well worth it when you get to the top. Best to get there early in the morning in order to miss waiting in line.",
          "Can't believe I'd never been before. Step out of the station and prepare to be awed by this megalith. Holding its own amidst the modern buildings the Monument is a must see in any weather. I went on a fairly dreary Weds afternoon and had the place almost to myself. For \u00a35",
          "You feel those 311 steps by the top but it is a cracking view from up there. I am very un fit but I made it. You get a certificate on leaving included in price. The steps are narrow and it is up and down so probably gets congested in the summer.",
          "Never have visited Monument so made a point of paying the \u00a35 in and walking up the 300 steps! Fantastic views however made me very weak at the knees! I\u2019d certainly recommend it, I felt it was worth the visit if your in the area and have some free time!",
          "Lucky was not crowded during my visit. Went up and enjoy the scenery! Really beautiful on that sunny day. And was given the certificate after you came down.",
          "Wow a proper little gem. Hidden amongst all the modern buildings this is a real slice of history. If you're in the area it's well worth the effort. The view from top is stunning. But make sure you have a decent coat in winter, it was freezing at the top!",
          "I just passed by it, read the story and went away. There are probably better views in London that you can pay for like St. Paul, or Shard. Even in Sky Garden or Tate Modern which are for free.",
          "This is worth every one of the 311 steps to get to the top of the increasingly claustrophobic spiral staircase. The reward is not just the view, but the satisfaction of having climbed the tallest free standing monument in the world. We recommend buying the combined ticket for",
          "Lovely to visit and entry wasn't too expensive either. The staircase to the top was quite narrow and a bit cramped when people are going in the other direction. Views were good at the top though, so worth a visit.",
          "What a great memorial to the Great Fire of London there is over 320 stairs to climb but it is well worth it when you get to the top with great views. Also there is a Golden Goblet on top of the Monument.",
          "An interesting monument to the Great Fire of London. The building is quite difficult to find in modern London. It\u2019s a large building but is nowadays dwarfed by the skyscrapers which surround it. The actual Pudding Lane is a few meters away from the monument.",
          "Great sight to come across when walking around the City of London. Stunning golden goblet on the top of this magnificent erection which commemorates the great fire.",
          "The Monument is a Christopher Wren's memorial to the Great Fire Of London located in the City Of London. This massive Doric column is over 200 feet tall and wide enough to walk to the top via a internal staircase. The placement of this Monument is to remember the exact spot",
          "go at sunset and see the city in the night lights. this was one of our favorite parts of the trip to london. takes about an hour to go up, visit the terrace then return down",
          "Don't bother reading the low ratings, 'not worth the climb, 'no view'. When climbing 205 ft this is the tallest free standing stone column in the world.",
          "Impressive old stone structure to commemorate the Great fire of London. Apparently this is the tallest stone structure in Europe. With over 300 steps in a narrow winding staircase, this is not for those who are even slightly physically unfit as it's more taxing than it looks.",
          "Went here after going to the London Bridge and learned the history of the fire of London including the importance of this monument and what it represents.",
          "A good thing to do, if your legs agree! Monument with more than 300 steps offers a beautiful view of London, and it's not expensive (\u00a35 for one adult) Try to go on the top a just open your eyes!",
          "This is quite a climb (311 stairs to the top) but the view from the top is incredible. This is a monument to the Great Fire of London, designed by Christopher Wren. It is a bit of a challenging climb as it is a narrow spiral staircase and tight when you are meeting people going",
          "Pudding lane and the monument are worth the trip. You can get a combined ticket for the tower bridge which makes it good value. It was quite steep and the Children scampered up. Very pleased with their photos and the view is exceptional - they also liked the certificate. Except",
          "Views from the top of the steps is definitely worth the lung-busting, thigh-burning trek up to the top of the tower. A certificate of completion, along with a the history of the tower, is included with the price. Staff are very friendly. Definitely recommend buying tickets",
          "Built 100m from the start of the Great Fire of London in Pudding Lane, this monument as a steep winding staircase with rail which is manageable. Nice view from the top. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.",
          "It\u2019s irritating that Trip Advisor insists on calling this building \u201cThe Monument to the Great Fire of London\u201d because to Londoners for the past 350 years it has been simply The Monument. In fact the Great Fire of 1666 that raged for days and consumed much of the medieval city",
          "If you have the energy & don't mind heights then this is worth the 300+ steps up to see the great views that welcome you at the top of this lovely monument.",
          "This was one of my favorite things to see in London. That said, it's not easy. I went in with my 12 and 15 year olds. They flew up the 300+ steps to the top like it was nothing. I am in good shape, but after walking around the city all day my legs were burning. But it was",
          "Christopher Wren designed this simple monument to the victims of the Great Fire of 1666 that devastated London. The challenge is to walk the 300+ steps for the view at the top over Central London. Fascinating to me to compare the scale of the monument versus the huge skyscrapers",
          "Wow, what a view. Stumbled upon this monument, by chance, but we did not regret we went for a walk up there.",
          "You need to be fairly fit to go up and down this attraction. It\u2019s a very interesting piece of engineering and a rather poignant memorial to the great fire. It\u2019s a shame there isn\u2019t a visitors centre explaining the good that the fire did. Such as clearing the city of rats,",
          "Cheap, Cheerful, Healthy and worth it for the veiw. I'm asthmatic and even I made it to the top. Not much of a veiw the day I did it as it was a dull grey wet November day. But I imagine that on a really nice day the veiws would be impressive. Photo below is of tower bridge from",
          "i totally agree with all the comments it is well worth the climb and was very cheap really for something to visit in London I was taking my grandson of 5 there (who is mad keen on the Great Fire from school lessons at the moment) to help him understand about the fire and",
          "Great views over London! The 311 steps are most definitely a good work out but once your up, it's worth it for the views! Cheap and just a good as The Shard! Would do it again!",
          "Pros Joint ticket with Tower Bridge reduces cost Amazing spiral staircase Great views Cons Need to be moderately fit Can be cramped when passing people on stairs",
          "Whilst on a secret London tour with friends we opted to visit and climb The Monument and whilst it costs \u00a35 per person and the ascent is dizzying and arduous, the climb is well worth it when you reach the top and take in wonderful 360 views of London and its landmarks,",
          "As a monument,not very impressive...just a column with a golden urn on the top.But its observation platform offers wonderful views of the London.So it worth the effort to climb the 311 steps to the top.Talking about the climb:pretty difficult,as long as to get to the top you",
          "\u00a35 entry but the views are worth it. It took under 10 minutes to walk the 311 steps but it is absolutely worth it for the view. That being said, make sure you go on a nice, clear, sunny day. You could see Tower Bridge, the Shard, etc. Very lovely. I wouldn't recommend this for",
          "I would describe my self as reasonably fit. 311 stairs to the top was a good challenge and I thoroughly enjoyed it, sore legs at the top and only slightly short of breath. Alex not so much. He was having a harder time than myself and he is active but not very active. He was",
          "The Monument to the Great Fire of London is definitely one of London\u2019s most famous landmarks and is very much worth visiting. Closest station: Monument.",
          "This monument is enormous, striking and quite a powerful reminder of the past. We visited on a weekday and had no lines and enjoyed reading the script and admiring the stonework. We had a short timeline so didn\u2019t climb the stairs, but I wish we did. Easy to find and worth",
          "Han Be climbed the London Monument today. I have to walk with a walking stick but I made the 311 steps to the top. And the view was worth it. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and when you come out at the bottom you are given a certificate to say you have climb it see",
          "The Fire of London monument is a massive structure nestled between buildings, visible upon exiting the Tube close by. You can climb to the top for an amazing view.",
          "As long as you can cope with the 311 steps up the spiral staircase, the views from the top are superb. Numbers are limited so you might have to wait at the bottom for a few minutes, but it is definitely worth the wait.",
          "Definitely worth a visit as well as learning the history surrounding it you also get great views of London at a very reasonable price. Worth walking the 311 narrow steps to the top, unless of course you are trying to get past someone who is slightly overweight.....",
          "This imposing 340-year old column was built to commemorate the Great Fire of London and is located just a block north of London Bridge on Monument Street. While simple in design, it is a worthy piece of history even though it doesn\u2019t quit stand out with the many tall buildings",
          "This is definitely worth the 311 steps and is so cheap, only 4 pounds!! The view is absolutely amazing and in a way better than the view from the shard since you are able to look out onto it and get a great view of London without blowing your budget. This is a must for anyone",
          "I had heard of the monument and that you could climb it, it was not on our list this time but too good miss this as we walked past. It is well worth the effort and the views are fantastic, it also shows how much London has changed in the last 100 years.",
          "One of those places people know about, but tend not to visit. It is well worth climbing the 311 steps. A good piece of the history of London, an impressive spiral staircase and surprisingly good views across the whole of London. Good that it is on the 2for1 scheme if you travel",
          "After visiting the Sky Garden we walked on down here to view this Monument not realising what it was, but found out it was to the \"Great Fire of London\" This was taught to us in primary school history & was great to see it in all its glory. This Monument is well worth a visit &",
          "Lots of spiral steps up a very pretty little column to see a view which includes Tower Bridge and the Thames, but also gives a real sense of the different building styles and scale over time in the city and over on the south bank. Excellent value for money, with some history",
          "I have visited this place many times since the 1970's when i was a kid, it used to be free to enter in th old days. It's a great view from the top when you've climbed the 311 steps on the narrow stairs and has a great history attached to it as well",
          "It took a while to climb the stairs but its worth it. The history is well explained by the hand out given to me, the view of that part of London is exceptional.",
          "Worth the 311 steps to get to the top for the view. It is a tight staircase and will take a good 10 mins to get to the top (depending on personal fitness and people in front of you) and there is very little room to move around the top so be prepared. Would do it again! You also",
          "Pleasantly came across this attraction when walking around and I am so happy we did! relatively priced compared to other expensive attractions. Once you don't mind walking the >300 steps to the top for the views of the city.",
          "A very worthwhile activity and very good value for money. Very friendly staff. Small queue to get in because they try not to overcrowd the stairs and once in you can see why. The 311 steps to the top are a a lot of steps for little legs but our kids both managed it and we were",
          "Myself, my brother and my young children both thoroughly enjoyed going to the top of the monument. The children loved the challenge of the steps and getting a certificate at the end was a lovely touch. The views were great and the staff friendly and helpful. Also not overly",
          "We had been for a long walk along the Southbank and had crossed the River Thames via London Bridge. This gave us the opportunity to once again view the Monument to the Great Fire of London. We had seen the monument for the first time while enjoying a previous visit to London.",
          "Monument for the great fire of London is a very cool monument. Climbing to the top you get an excellent view of the surrounding area. Plus to be at the place where the fire started is cool. To be at the place that totally changed the layout of the city. Note, you have to take",
          "We've been to London many times and lived there for two years but we'd never done the climb up the Monument. We finally did it this year. I was not so keen originally because I had chickened out on these sort of things in Europe when the climb up becomes too steep and narrow.",
          "This is a cool place for views near Tower of London. London Pass covers the cost otherwise I believe the cost is 5 pounds. We used our Pass and it was brutal after just walking up the steps at St. Paul\u2019s but it was worth it. Small and tight at top.",
          "I wanted to climb this tower the last time I was in London a couple of years ago but time didn't permit. I was determined to do it this last visit. My husband was going to sit this one out, we had been out sightseeing all day, but at the last minute, changed his mind and joined",
          "Found The Monument by chance and wow, absolutely amazing piece of architecture and the history is quite overwhelming.",
          "We really enjoyed this challenge. It's over 300 stone steps so not for the faint hearted. No lift or ramps, so just able bodies for this one. Seemly endless spirals, but enjoyable too. Handles to hold and passes places in the form of windows/ lookouts. The spiral gets narrower",
          "If you are in the mood of a little exercise, one needs to climb more than 300 steps to reach the top from where one has a worthwhile view of major London attractions including the skyscrapers Shard, Wakie Takie, and others",
          "Breathtaking views, breathtaking climb but definitely worth it. The views are absolutely stunning and definitely worth the climb",
          "I hadn't realised you could climb up inside! 311 steps up a fairly small spiral staircase - it is a long climb but well worth it for the view! A great view of the river ,Tower Bridge and the Shard and very reasonable at \u00a35 which includes a certificate to say you did it! The only",
          "There are a lot easier ways to see the views of the city than climb 300 steps to the top. Memorial is very cool and the history is important. Your showed us the homes that they leveled to prevent the fire from spreading. Very interesting.",
          "Over 300 steps to the top so not for the faint hearted but well worth it for the views. The steps are uniform and reasonably easy to climb!! The staff on the door only allow so many people at one time to ascend so patience is required to navigate the very loosely organised",
          "This was a most enjoyable visit. There are a lot of steps and you can feel quite dizzy going up. The views are good on a fine day. This is a very reasonably priced and low key, which makes it all the better.",
          "Easy to miss in London\u2019s built up streets the Monument is a tall column built in the 1660\u2019s to commemorate the great fore of London. Take a moment to look at the inscription before climbing. Only \u00a35 to climb (less for children) there is a single spiral staircase to the top. Some",
          "This is highly recommended and if you are going to Sky Garden this is a 5-10 minute walk away. A winding staircase will get you up the more than 300 steps and 60 meters. Even surrounded by office buildings you will still get a good view",
          "Apart from all the giant attractions that take 3+ hours, visiting the historic Monument was a short and sweet activity. Going up the 311-step winding staircase was fun and the view was fantastic. I do not recommend for people with any fears of heights. There's not much wiggle",
          "A striking memorial to a disastrous fire in London's history. We partially stumbled upon it knowing it was somewhere in the area. Our two kids (12 and 8) had no trouble climbing the stairs with us, and we all enjoyed the view and chatting with other visitors on the someone",
          "We were convinced we would easily spot the 202 ft (62 m) tall Monument to the Great Fire of London (simply called \u2018Monument\u2019) from afar but it is surrounded by so many tall buildings we didn\u2019t see it and had to look for \u2018Monument Street\u2019 on our map. Taking a picture was also",
          "This is a fine monument to the Great Fire of London near Bank/ Monument tube. It's quite hemmed in by streets and not a lot of tall skyscrapers insecure the views it once offered.",

          "We paid the 5\u00a3 fee and climbed the 300 plus spiraling steps to the top for s spectacular 360 degree views of the City. Luckily it was a clear day and we had great views of the Tower Bridge and City skyline. Upon descent, they hand you a certificate to commemorate your",
          "This monument is tucked away in-between high-rise buildings but is worth seeking out. Informative inscriptions tell the story of how the Great Fire of London started at this point.",
          "a couple of years ago was in London and having been to the Monument when I was a school boy wanted to come back and climb the tower. well did just that and must say that the view from the top is some what remarkable.....just the steps are never ending and had this young fellow",
          "The view from the top is pretty cool and the monument is something to be seen. Due to its location it is pretty easy to miss is you are not looking up. Just be aware of the stairs..... lots of them!",
          "This might sound a contradiction in terms, but the Great Fire of London was exactly that - \"A BENEFICIAL CALAMITY\" and The Monument is a memorial to it. Designed by Sir Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke, it stands at the junction of Fish St. Hill and Monument Street as a",
          "The monument commemorates the great fire of London in 1666. It is 62 metres (200 feet) high and you are able to ascend to the top where there is an outside veiwing gallery, fantastic experience.",
          "Try not to go on the weekend. Super packed. And get the ticket from the Tower Bridge same times, I believed cheaper if you buy them together. Might want to consider bring some water, it's a long way up, I forgot how many steps, but the height it's equal to 16-18 story building.",
          "we accidentally passed by the monument on our way to the tower of London. it is where the Great Fire began. we didn't know it was about 311 steps but they were worth it! amazing view from the top of the monument. 360 view over London!!",
          "An impressive monument in quite an enclosed space due to the surrounding buildings, which I think adds to it.",
          "Took the kids here to climb up and down the stairs (and burn off energy) and to see London from another viewpoint. The stairs are narrow, but people seem to know to take turns letting others pass. There are some places along the way to stop and take a rest if you aren't in the",
          "The climb is quite steep so not for the faint hearted. (God knows how I made it!). The steps are well worn so slightly slippery. I'm not trying to say it was a bad experience, anything but! I loved it. The views from the top were very nice. Now of course the skyline is",
          "We stumbled upon by accident coming out the Monument tube station, but look up and it\u2019s right there! Beautifully maintained tall column monument with gold statue on top, and plaques on nearby walls indicating where the great fire of 1666 started. A walk up to the top would be",
          "We travelled bank holiday Monday. Got the tube to bank station . Got off. It isn't very well signposted but look up and you will see it. Pudding lane is behind the entry to the monument . A little bit of history achieved and something ticked off my bucket list",
          "It's a monument that you go inside, walk up lots of stone spiral steps and then reach the top with views of London. Very simple but also a nice experience and something to say that you've done. As long as you're not expecting more than that they you'll be happy!",
          "311 steps up with no places to pause The top gives you some great views across the city. Came here with a joint ticket with tower bridge. On its own its \u00a35 (they only take cash). You may have to queue if there are a few of you waiting. You queue outside. Would be nice to have",
          "What a beautiful landscape! 311 steps to the top, so be patient and go slowly to the top! At the end of your visit you received a certificate cause you completed 311 steps. The ticket is usually jointed to the visit to Tower Bridge (I had before a visit in Tower Bridge and then",
          "Everyone panic at the look of 311 steps up. But it was awesome if you go up early. No one to snatch taking picture with you. No one to wait or let the ppl go up or down the stairs. A pretty quick steps up. But the area was fence up due to some sucidial previously hence it was a",
          "After buying tickets for Tower bridge and Monument we were ready to climb the 311 steps to the top of the monument. Yes it was hard on the legs but the top provided a great view across London. Definitely worth the effort!",
          "We were too old to walk to the top, but this is a bit of London history I have missed after many trips to London. Built in 1666 after the fire and still impressive. It is now fairly well hidden by all of the large office buildings. A very short walk from the Monument station",
          "A minute walk from London Bridge on the North side, we finally plucked up the courage to tackle the 311 steps. Only 33 people are allowed in at 1 time but it never seems to have many people waiting to go up! The spiral stair case can be a bit of a squeeze for 2 adults so expect",
          "We bought the combination Tower Bridge and The Monument ticket. After ascending the Tower Bridge (by lift) we took the short 15 minute stroll from the Tower Bridge to The Monument. My wife decided to skip the walk and went to the very nice pub right at the base and ordered",

          "We climbed the Monument this morning... 311 steps up a spiral staircase! Don't look down! Great views over London and it's great to compare the old with the new. The platform at the top is not very wide at all but is completely 'caged' in so you're safe. Worth doing and it only",
          "Standing tall, even among the modern skyscrapers, the Monument provides a defiant memorial to London's past. When first built the Monument was one of the tallest structures in the city. Though this is no longer the case, the structure makes for an interesting comparison between",
          "This monument is history at its finest. Great to whip out the camera and take some pics. An integral part of Londons history and identity.",

          "311 steps to the top, awesome view. Only \u00a35 for adults and \u00a32.50 for kids so excellent value if you want to go somewhere to get a great view over London. The structure itself is fascinating and well worth a visit.",
          "For only \u00a35 you can go to the top of the monument. All you have to do is climb the 311 stairs to reach the 61m high top. The stairs are small but safe, and the top is completely guarded with fences. It offers a great view with only small part of the price of the London Eye.",
          "If you are going to visit Tower Bridge you can get a combo ticket for the Monument. If not, at the Monument it is 5 pounds and they only take cash. So as we were using credit card only on this trip we just enjoyed the view from the ground. Very nice people there. Oh yes; no",
          "When you arrive there are two people on duty here. One to sell tickets/gifts and the other to only let so many people in at a time. So there may be a couple of minutes wait before you are allowed up. Staff were really friendly and took the time to answer my questions about the",

          "Came here with my 6 year old as part of a school project. We climbed the 311 winding steps to the top and it was well worth it. Views were lovely and we bought a children's guide which showed us exactly what we were viewing. My son loved it and was so interested in what he could",
          "Make sure your fit before you try this one. Lots of steps up and down. Worth it.Amazing views from the top, under the flame that is.This is real history and worth the visit. Built as a reminder of the great fire of London.",
          "At the top of the 311 steps you get a full 360\u00b0 view of London. You can see the Thames, the gherkin, the shard. The prices are: Adults \u00a34.50 Children (aged 5-15) \u00a32.30 There is a tiny gift shop at the bottom where you pay. Everything is a bit pricey but not too over priced",

          "Worth a look if you're in the area but I wouldn't make a special trip to see it. We were staying near by so we walked past it daily. We didn't climb it but I'm sure the views would be fantastic.",
          "After climbing a long, stone, spiral staircase to the top of the monument, you are rewarded with a nice view. The trip to the top, which is about 300 steps or so, could be challenging for some visitors, but we were pleasantly surprised with the experience. Looking at it from",

          "Not a place that stands out in London. Hidden behind tall buildings on the north east side of London Bridge. Best place for a photo is as you come off London Bridge and look down the cobbled street. If you love history then it's worth a visit. If you feel energetic then you ca",
          "If you don't like heights or don't have strong thighs to climb the 311 step spiral staircase don't go. Also make sure you get the 2 for 1 tickets online as I wouldn't say it is worth \u00a35 each but \u00a32.50 is very reasonable. It's not very big so can get a bit crowded on the stairs",

          "We came across this by accident on our way to borough market, what a find! The history behind the monument is great and our 12 year old son loved it. The climb is not for the unfit but there are places to rest if needed on the way up. The views are amazing and the entrance fee",
          "We climbed all 311 spiral stairs with two stops to take a breath. Great views from the tiny platform on the top! You get a certificate for your achievement when you come downstairs. This is a one-time experience. Give a try if you are in the area.",

          "It takes a bit of effort to climb, no doubt. It's a really interesting monument, with a lovely view at the top. Being in a lookout that was lower than a lot of the buildings was nice! It made for nice pictures! You have to put your camera up next to/slightly through the fencing",
          "This is a historic landmark and the climb is worth it - the stairs get narrower towards the top. The climb is worth it as you get some good views of the Thames as well as the City. Well worth a visit.",

          "This is the second time I've been up The Monument and I thoroughly enjoyed it once again. It's definitely worth the 311 steps up to see the the sights at the top. You can see the Tower of London, Tower Bridge, the Shard, the London eye and its right next to the Walkie Talkie",
          "My daughter and I climbed the 311 steps to the top of the monument and the views were fantastic and very worth the climb! It is a small circular staircase all the way, but there is plenty of room to let people pass if you need to stop for a breath (we stopped about 3 times!) You",
          "One of Londons most interesting memorials. Easy to get to from London Bridge and a great link with the great fire of London (it started a distance equal to the height of the monument). However the viewing platform is pretty small and my wife was not a fan at all of the enclosed",

          "The Monument was a lovely experience. Nice climb and you also gain a certificate when you once you've climbed the 311 steps. It's tucked away in between buildings but It's worth giving it a go as you get to see a lovely view of the City of London.",
          "After a tiring day at the ZSL we had a 311 stairs to climb!! And it was raining. I managed to climb somehow but it was all worthwhile. The feeling you get after climbing THE Monument is satisfying! My 4yr old climbed up and down on her own very happily.",
          "The once great monument now looks small against the city skyline. However it still remains a monument not only to the losses in the fire but also to the rebirth of the City.",
          "The views from the top of the Monument are so stunning that it's worth the 311 steps up to the top (plus you get a certificate at the end !) You can see a full 360 degree view of places such as Tower Bridge, The Shard, The Gherkin, The Cheese Grater, The Walkie Talkie etc etc",
          "Get some great views of London high up !! Great price at 5 pound for adults and nice to do it the old school way of climbing the 311 steps would recommend . Also would highly recommend ask for a dual ticket with the tower bridge exhibition seriously good value 25 pound for 2",
          "The Monument stands at the junction of Monument Street and Fish Street Hill, near the Northern end of London Bridge. A permanent reminder of the Great Fire of 1666, the Monument commemorates one of the most famous events in London's history. The top of the Monument is reached",
          "The Monument to The Great Fire of London is an imposing sight and well worth a visit. A couple of days ago my wife and I were walking around after breakfast at our Hotel in nearby Blackfriars. Despite the drizzle we walked up to the edifice to admire the work. It was closed as",

          "The monument commemorates the great fire and begs you to climb the 311 steps to enjoy a nice view of London. Not being a tall tower, the views are good, but not competing with the Tower Bridge or other tall buildings' vistas. Due to the heightened security, you cannot bring",

          "Sitting at the bottom of Pudding lane symbolising the Great Fire of London. You can climb the 311 steps to the top and get a little certificate once you've completed it. The views from the top are good. If you are in the area and have lots of time it's worth a visit, otherwise",
          "We lucked out finding this special place. This tower was put up for the lost of the great fire in London. If you cannot climb stairs, stay away. We had free admission from the London Pass. The views of London are amazing.",
          "When I booked the Sky Garden I noticed that monument was only a 3 minute walk away. On our approach we saw Sir Christopher Wren! He was addressing a group of school children. Their enthusiasm was infectious. Entrance fee is \u00a35, concessions \u00a33.50. To reach the viewing platform",
          "Visited with my 10 year old son. This was a cheap & interesting thing for us to do together as he had been learning about the great fire. It is what it is, a monument with internal spiraling staircase to a viewing platform at the top, we did get a printed certificate when we",
          "A decade ago this was quite a secret place. Now it is known by the tourists and being mentioned by the guide books. But still... you need to climb a lot of stairs inside a very narrow and tall tower what looks like a column outdoor. Not every people undertake it. This a good",
          "Visited the Monument using our London Pass. The climb was really tiring but we eventually did it with a lot of heavy breathing. The view was worth it, offering 360 degrees of London. Not as high as the Shard or even the Sky Garden, but high enough to get some good pictures. You",
          "Long queue even in the cold weather but well worth a visit. Very reasonable price, esp, with 241 voucher. No guided tours available but information on monument. Very steep steps and can be tricky to pass other guests on the stairs. Can make you feel slightly dizzy and would",
          "This historic monument looks dwarfed now that the City has grown around it, but once you climb the 311 steps to the top, the panoramic views including all the skyscrapers is quite something. A simple but beautiful tribute to a historic event that changed the face of London",
          "This is an inexpensive spot with a great view, if you are able to climb those about 300 stairs. This free workout comes with the ticket. You might want to buy the combined ticket with the London Bridge. Disadvantage is the closing hour at 18.00h",
          "We have been meaning to go up the spiral staircase of the Monument for years and finally did so on a sunny day. Others have mentioned the tight squeeze up and down but everyone is good humoured so it's not a problem. Many stop for a rest also and it's easy to pass. The views are",

          "Given the price of the entrance fee and the height of the monument, i was surprised by the great views available at the top of the platform. It was my first time in London and so it was great fun trying to spot all the main attractions and nice to have the natural breeze from",
          "We made it up the steps without any problems and were impressed with the lovely views. It isnt is high as Sky Garden, but you do get good views of the City (Gherkin) and especially the Shard. Contrast with the new City buildings is interesting and it is good that the monument",
          "Having walked past the Monument to the Great Fire Of London many, many times on the way to and from London Bridge station it was a strange experience to finally enter and climb the 311 steps to the viewing platform. Not for the mobility impaired or unfit the climb is well worth",
          "When I was at school we were taken to London to see oliver twist and in the afternoon before the show taken to the monument. Now every time visiting London I have wanted to find the tower. After much looking it was only on a ferry ride to Greenwich did I see it and took note of",
          "We were walking by it on our way to Tower of London with a small line. we decided to do it as it is free entry with the London Museum pass. 322 steps (which you get a certificate when you come out. There isn't much information about the monument within the attraction it self so",
          "If in London this is a must see. There are 311 steps to the top (no lift) and by the time you get there your legs will burn, especially of you are the first there and intend to run to the top- yes I have done this a few times. The views from the top are good ,but over time these",
          "With fantastic views of the London skyline this was a well priced trip up a historic landmark. It cost \u00a37.50 for me and my daughter to climb the tower, and there is a certificate for everyone who climbs the tower. It's worth a visit and you are not far from the home of the Bank",
          "If you want a challenge that ends with a spectacular view then you must attempt this. In saying that I would recommend not doing what we did and wore thermals! Mind you it was March and quite cold......... the steps are steep and seemingly endless and you just want to die",
          "Great views over London. Buy the combo ticket with Tower Bridge and you'll be able to get in 7 days after buying the ticket. Well worth the climb up!",
          "The children have been learning about the fire of London at school so I decided to take them to the monument whilst visiting London. It cost just \u00a310 for the 3 of us to climb to the top. It wasn't too challenging (and I was on crutches). The views were very good at the top.",
          "I have been to London many times and truthfully did not realise that this monument was here. I think that it is a great shame that the tall buildings around it seem to swallow it up to an extent. I can imagine that it was a great tribute when it was built and although the views",
          "Honestly if you get a chance to walk up the monument DO IT!! It's one of my favorite things in London, it's also pretty cheap compared to other high buildings (or wheels) that I could mention and on a fine day has views which are just as spectacular. And very conveniently",
          "Stopped here for a climb to the top. Historical monument to the great fire designed by the same man who designed St Paul's.",
          "Not as many tourist visits, \"The Monument\" while in London. Love that it's not expensive, and if you have the, \"London Pass\" it's free. Even the outside of the Monument is worth the visit. Like many others I agree the 311 steps can be a challenge. Having said that you don't need",
          "Walked round a corner and saw this monument with a sign saying you could go up. Well worth the few pounds and steps to get to the top and see along the Thames.",
          "Had to Q for quite a while even though we had joint tickets for this & Tower Bridge. Realized why once inside, single stone spiral stairs used by all! Make sure you are fit for the number of stairs!! Worth the effort though! Wonderful views.",
          "A great view and a lot of steps to the top. No seats involved. Take a drink for when you get to the top. you can buy a joint ticket with the Tower bridge experience and it is easy walking distance. Not that many people there, so no queses.",
          "You had better be fit enough to climb the 311 steps here. Most people end up being quite out of breath by the time they reach the top. But it is quite rewarding as you can enjoy a 360 degree view of London.",
          "Maybe not such a touristic spot, but the view you gain after many many stairs is great. P.ex tower bridge. The fee is petty like 3\u00a3. The historical symbolism of the monument is also worth knowing it",
          "I often visit London and had only discovered the previous day that it was possible to go up the monument. This was part of a ticket which also included going up tower bridge, another thing I had only just heard about. The queue to go up the monument is long but when you go up",
          "In the heart of the City of London, the views from the top are definitely worth the climb. I went up in 2017 to reproduce a photo I took back in 1963. I was expecting the views to have been blocked any the modern high-rise London, but no. The view from 50+ years ago of Tower",
          "It's 311 steps in a winding staircase. You need to be fit enough to do the steps. Even though there are some stopping points it's still quite cosy. The view is very good, you can see St. Paul's, The Gherkin, The Shard, Tower Bridge to name a few. It is much cheaper than going up",
          "What it says on the tin...a 311 spiral step climb to the top of the monument for fab views of London landmarks. My 8yo son loved it. Not sure I'd enjoy it as much climbing on a hot crowded summer day but was great in late afternoon on a clear spring day.",
          "A really interesting little find....but you have to be fit to get up nearly 400 steps inside if you want to get to the top! I had to stop several times, but it's worth it. You get a certificate when you come down with a bit of the history written on the back - nice touch!",
          "We stumbled upon the Monument and loved every step it took to reach the top. The gentleman who stood outside was very knowledgeable and gave you a certificate upon your completion. The views were beautiful of the Tower Bridge.",
          "In the heart of the City this Wren designed monument is quite stunning. It is well worth the effort of climbing the spiral stair case to take the views from the top. Really quite impressive and a fitting monument to part of the history of London.",
          "I have been up here a few times but not for maybe 25 years. There are 311 steps to climb and they get narrower as you ascend but the view is lovely. The view is much more impressive now due to the skyscrapers that have been built since I last visited. The viewing platform is now",
          "This is one massive monument in amongst the hotch porch of old and modern glass buildings. Very impressive.",
          "I took my parents (in their 60s) to the monument as a surprise on a day trip to London. They looked mildly horrified at the thought of climbing up it but managed much better than they anticipated and they both loved the views from the top. The staircase inside is fairly narrow",
          "This is one of those places where you might not necessarily set off on a mission to go there, it's more of a spontaneous find, but interesting. It's a good place to spend 15 minutes of your time when you're in the City.",
          "It was kind of a cool, off-the-beaten-path kind of thing to see and experience. A good stop for history buffs.",
          "A breathtaking monument to the day that forever changed London. Historical column nestled in the heart of the city. Not the best known attraction in London but I couldn't recommend it more. Nice sense of achievement when you get to the top of those steps.",
          "This is cool- you get to walk up 311 steps to the top. Not for those who looking to take it easy. Views are good. Buy the ticket deal for both The Monument & Tower Bridge tour.",
          "Well worth the money (\u00a39 for 1 adult and 2 children). If you are scared of heights the staircase may be a challenge. The views at the top are fantastic and the kids loved the whole experience.",
          "It is a steep spiral staircase to the top of the monument - but you do get great views. It also wasn't hugely expensive - a few \u00a3s. It was a fun thing to do to pass some time in London! There isn't a huge amount of room at the top so go early before it gets too busy -",
          "Another little gem in London, well worth climbing 311 stairs for the views, amazing! Can't wait to share my pictures with my class when we learn about the Great Fire of London.",
          "Great view for little money..its possible to use 1+1 ticket and then you also get certificat for your visit...its a nice present from London.",
          "After climbing up the 311 steps you are greeted by a breath taking view over all of London, Looking over Docklands,Tower Bridge and over to the PO Tower. St Paul's and the city, a great experience.",
          "Very good, hard work going up but when up views are brilliant. Coming down is easier. There is 311 steps to climb. There's not alot of space on the stairs especially when got people going up and down. You get a certificate if can complete the stairs and get to the top and down",
          "The Monument is well worth the climb for the stunning views but my partner and I were relieved not to have taken our children with us .There are two gents who work there one on the till ,the other supposedly organising visitors who after pushing two young lads through the door",
          "So often we fail to visit some of the wonderful attractions in our own cities so being near London Bridge and with some time to kill we decided on a whim to go visit a tourist attraction. The monument was built to commemorate the Great Fire of London, inside is a narrow spiral",
          "Very good value for money with being just \u00a34.50 each or if with a voucher from national rail gives you 2 for 1! A amazing view from the top being able to see many of Londons highlights such as the shard the gherkin tower bridge and the tower of london! Very high with the 311",
          "The Monument is a colossal stone column located at the junction of Monument street and Fish street hill. The nearest tube station is Monument on the District or Circle lines. It commemorates the Great Fire of London in 1666 You have to climb 311 steps to enjoy a spectacular"

        "wiki": "The Vetterli rifles were a series of Swiss army service rifles in use from 1869 to 1889, when they were replaced with Schmidt\u2013Rubin rifles. Modified Vetterlis were also used by the Italian Army.\nThe Swiss Vetterli rifles combined the American Winchester Model 1866's tubular magazine with a regular bolt featuring for the first time two opposed rear locking lugs. This novel type of bolt was a major improvement over the simpler Dreyse and Chassepot bolt actions.  The Vetterli was  also the first repeating bolt-action rifle to feature a self-cocking action and a small caliber bore.\nDue to the Swiss Federal Council's early 1866 decision to equip the army with a breechloading repeating rifle, the Vetterli rifles were, at the time of their introduction, the most advanced military rifles in Europe. The Vetterli was the replacement for the Eidgen\u00f6ssischer Stutzer 1851, an Amsler-Milbank metallic cartridge conversion from previous Swiss muzzle-loading rifles.\n\n\n== Repetiergewehr Vetterli, Modell 1867 ==\nThe model 1867 was the first iteration of Vetterli rifles.  It was accepted into service in February 1868.  The model 1867, like its successors, featured a 12-round under barrel tubular magazine and bolt action feed system.  The primary distinguishing feature of the Model 1867 was the external hammer.\n\n\n== Repetiergewehr Vetterli, Modell 1868 ==\nBefore the Model 1867 was put into full production, the rifle designer, Johann Friedrich Vetterli, updated the rifle by replacing the external hammer with an internal cocking bolt spring, rounded front barrel band and placing the cleaning rod on the left side of the rifle.  It was discovered soon after that the cleaning rod in its current placement was easily damaged and was subsequently moved to the under-barrel position.  The model was designated the Model 1869.\n\n\n== Repetiergewehr Vetterli, Modell 1869, 69/71 ==\n\nThe 1869 Repetiergewehr Vetterli (English: repeating rifle, Vetterli) was the first iteration of Vetterli rifles to go into full mass production. It was designed by Johann-Friedrich Vetterli (1822\u20131882), a Swiss riflemaker, who worked in France and England before becoming director of the Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft's armament factory in Neuhausen Switzerland. He also adapted his rifle into a single-shot centerfire variant procured by the Italian Army. In 1871 the Model 1869 was updated by removing the loading gate and magazine cutoff switch.  This change was designated the Model 1869/71\n\n\n== Repetiergewehr Vetterli, Modell 1871 ==\nEven while manufacture of the M1869/71 was underway, a new 1871 model was put into production. It omitted some redundant parts and featured a modified sight as well as a stronger barrel and stronger iron hoops.\n\n\n== Repetierstutzer Vetterli, Modell 1871 ==\nThe Stutzer (carbine) variant of the 1871 rifle was used to equip the Scharfsch\u00fctzen (sniper) companies of the army. The Stutzer were equipped with a sensitive Stecher (double set trigger) action and featured a shorter barrel.\n\n\n== Kavallerie-Repetierkarabiner Vetterli, Modell 1871 ==\nThe Kavallerie-Repetierkarabiner (English: cavalry repeating carbine) was another shortened variant of the 1871 rifle for use by the cavalry, which at that time was still armed with percussion pistols.\n\n\n== Repetiergewehr and -stutzer Vetterli, Modell 1878 and 1881 ==\nTo accelerate the sluggish production of the Vetterli rifles, the federal authorities built a new arms factory in Berne, the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Waffenfabrik (W+F), in 1875. That factory produced the 1878 variant of the Vetterli rifle. Its some 25 improvements included a new bayonet and lug, improved sights and a finger hook on the trigger guard. A Stutzer variant with a Stecher action, but otherwise identical to the rifle, was also produced.\n\n\n== M1870 Italian Vetterli ==\n\nThe Italian Army adopted a modified Vetterli design, however as a single-shot, in 1870. Unlike the Swiss model, it was chambered for a centrefire cartridge, the 10.35\u00d747mmR.\n\n\n=== M1870/87 Italian Vetterli-Vitali ===\nIn 1887, the Italian military updated its single-shot Model 1870 Vetterli rifles with a four-round Vitali box magazine.\n\n\n=== M1870/87/15 Italian Vetterli ===\nDuring World War I, like many nations Italy faced a shortage of modern infantry rifles. As a stop-gap measure, hundreds of thousands of Vetterli-Vitali rifles and a few carbines and musquetoons were converted in Rome and Gardone to fire the 6.5x52mm Carcano round, by adding a 6.5mm barrel liner and a Carcano-style magazine. These conversions were never meant for extended firing with standard 6.5x52mm loads, as the smokeless powder 6.5\u00d752mm cartridge generates higher pressure than the black powder 10.35\u00d747mmR, but have withstood modern CIP proof firing without difficulty.\n\n\n== Civilian use ==\nSurplus Vetterli rifles were used in \"surprising number\" by civilians in the U.S. for hunting deer through 1972.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nErnst Hostettler (1987).

          "The Wikipedia article about this statue gives my options for the symbolism expressed here - you can take your pick, but I think the expression on the ogres face reflects the tummy ache he\u2019s going to get after eating all those children in one sitting I\u2019m always partial to a",
          "I wouldn\u2019t actually consider this a monument, or a tourists attraction, it was -along side with many other statues in the same street- adding a lot of beauty and culture to the street but there wasn\u2019t something special about this fountain the calls for a particular visit!",

          "This has to be, hands down, the most bizarre, strange, unsettling, mind provoking fountain I can ever remember seeing. At the top, it seems to be some sort of an ogre eating naked children with even more lined up in his arm. At the base of the fountain is a circle or bears going",

          "If for no other reason I had to see the fountain that some knucklehead wrote a scathing 1-star review of, describing the statue as an \u201ceyesore\u201d. It\u2019s a statue FFS.

The great thing about all the fountains in Bern is you can drink the water from them meaning you\u2019re",

          "One of the most interesting of the medieval fountains, conjuring up curious ideas of how medieval families gave their children nightmares. But all the fountain statues are worth seeing - Moses by the M\u00fcnster, Justice in the lower old town. But if you only have leisure to linger",

          "There are so many fountains in old city of Bern and each has many stories attach to it.. this one is the most strange ...",
          "The theme is Obnoxious. Nobody actually seems to know why this monument was created. It is misfit in the fountain culture of Bern but may be that makes it more intresting.",
          "What a great fairy tale city.....beware little ones, if you misbehave you will have to answer to Kindlefresser. LOL...lots of unique fountains and this one was one of the more unique fairy tale ones. if your in Bern, you should check it out, super famous!...nom nom...LOL",

          "The child eater statue is interesting! We were right under it and didn't even realize it. It is not a large as one might expect, but very detailed and colorful. The water was quite refreshing on the very hot day. Many people refilled watr bottles at the city fountains throughout",
          "Historic fountains are common in Europe and there are over a dozen in Bern alone, but this one is pretty unique. It depicts an ogre eating small children, which I'd imagine is from a fairy tale that parents long ago used to keep their children behaving well. It's definitely",
          "The statue is pretty high up so it is difficult to see in detail, unless you know it is there you would just walk past (the are many statues/fountains around Bern). This just warrants a quick snap if you have a zoom, that's about it.",
          "We were told the myth at the information centre about the devouring of children and this fountain certainly depicts that. Really great legend.",
          "Make sure you observe the various water fountains as you wander old town Bern. Each had a diferent sponsor, and so the theme varies, but most impart some sort of moral message. I guess the message here is \"be good kids, or somebody will eat you\". BTW the water from",

          "All fountains in old town have a colorful statue spewing water. This particular statue is by itself for good reason. It is very brightly painted, but a man eating babies is strange to say the least. It is worth seeing .",
          "This is the most famous of the many statues/fountains in Bern, as the man is eating a child with many potential children to eat clinging to him. I encourage you to look up the various myths, legends, and far fetched tales on Wikipedia for lots of interesting takes on what this",
          "A funny monument in the centre of Bern, spend five minutes on checking it out and taking a photo of it.",
          "Not sure what to think of this? Quite a detailed and macabre sculpture/ fountain from 1545. Noticed that lots of people were drinking from the fountain so I suppose it must be some sort of \"fountain of youth\".",
          "Not really sure how I feel about the Kindlifresserbrunnen. I was glad that I saw it with my own eyes. Nothing like seeing a guy eating kids. One of the most unique statues I've ever seen. It was created in 1545/6. Check out it's wikipedia page for more info on it.",
          "The story of the Kindlifresser is fairly unique, but there are many other, equally interesting fountains to view in old town Bern.",
          "This macabre fountain, which is located along Kornhaus street, and built in 1546, is one of the oldest in Bern. It portrays a red and green ogre (based on a carnival figure) eating a naked child. Several other children can be seen in a bag at his side. There are at least four",
          "There are a lot of statues in old Town Bern but this one is really very different. Must be some kind of history for it I guess.",
          "We read about this statue online and had to have a quick look at it while we were in Bern! It's rather harrowing, yes, but it's also really funny and unique! It was easy to find and definitely lived up to our expectations!",
          "A literal translation of the name Kindlifresserbrunnen therefore would be \"Fountain of the Eater of Little Children\". in the middle of swiss capital bern and just beside the famous clock tower [ just at the clock tower tram and bus station!] there is this 500 years old water",
          "It is an interesting and weird fountain, but I think children can found it terrifying. It is located near the Zytglogge, so it is worth to go there to check it out.",
          "This is the most famous of Bern's medieval fountains and shows a giant eating a child. It's a beautiful carving and well worth seeking out. It right by Kornhaus and the Stadttheatre",

          "We really enjoyed strolling through the city and looking at all the different allegorical statues at each fountain including the famous child eater. It's part of the history of Bern and very fascinating.",
          "Within the city centre there are perhaps 10 similar fountains worth seeing as you walk the predominantly pedestrian streets. Each one is of a completely different design but all are a similar style; certainly worth stopping to see..",
          "It\u2019s too late for the child already in the ogre\u2019s mouth. But those other children? Jump! Maybe the bears will save you? Yeah, those bears look friendly\u2026.",

          "If you have a limited amount of time in Bern then this is not worth going to see. However, it is located near other attractions so you'll probably walk past it at least once.",
          "There's a collection of these fountain statues throughout the main street of Bern's old town, but this one is the 'piece de resistence' and the easiest to see (being right by the clocktower). Very amusing to see the child eating giant - there must be a good story here but I",
          "...but wouldn't go out of my way to see. There are a lot of fun, unusual fountains in Bern and this is one of them.",
          "Peculiar statue. Ogre eating children. I wouldn't go out of my way to see it. However, look up if you are near the Kornhaus and you may see it.",
          "We walked by the statue a couple of times and didn't notice it at first. It's funny to see the statue and curious as to how it was acceptable to build back in the 1600s. I recommend reading up on the history of it",
          "Very centrally located, this landmark deserves a quick peek. It's hard to see the details in the dark (if you ever visit at night), but the concept of a Child Eating monster is... uniquely interesting.",
          "Talk about something to give your children nightmares, this statute makes you do a double take when you first see it as you can't believe your eyes. Apparently, there are a number of different theories Re the background of the subject matter, all of which are not really",
          "There are many Statues on the street. I almost take photos for all of them. Full of stories for these statues.",

          "This is in front of the old Greenery and it's very colorful and the children just love it. It's a great place to also have a sit down and a coffee.",
          "Visit while you waiting for your tram. Take a photo. Move on. Lots of other things to do in the Kornhausplatz.",
          "And then after reading about it found it right next door at the trolley and tram stop. Interesting story. Must keep the Swiss children in line.",
          "It seems that fountains are everywhere in Europe. This Fountain is located at the middle of the road.",
          "Lots of different stories abound about the statue so it is tough to know the real origins but it is certainly strange enough. It is only a couple of meters high and you need to be next to it to see the detail (as with others dotted around the city) but it is worth going to if",
          "Well it is a spooky monument,but I kind of actually really like it!It certainly is something you don't get to see everyday, so the creepiness stays with you long after,making you remember it really Good- which is rare!",

          "This fountain is weird but it is fun to here all the theories for this creepy statue! It's a small fountain and is not pretty by any means but if the intent is to make you look and think then it is very well done.",
          "This is one of many fountains in Bern. It is a little disturbing as the man is eating a child. There is a old story behind it concerning Zeus so it becomes interesting.",
          "Being cleaned when we visited but there are many fountains throughout the city, all of which were lovely. I personally thought the Child eater fountain could frighten young children",
          "Colourful one of a number of similar fountains in Bern. Situated in the centre of the street in Bern. Great to photgraph.",
          "Likely on of the quirkiest statues you'll see anywhere in Europe. It is always interesting to see if the guests we bring to see this statue are amused or horrified, invariably the kids think it is funny.",
          "What an eyesore of a fountain! The Zahringer Fountain on the other hand is much nobler and chivalrous. What has this imp actually done? What a waste of money erecting this stupid statue and fountain - you might as well just built a Harry Potter statue here instead (and I'm not",
          "The old town Bern is adorned with fountains here and there. They are beautiful collectively as the add to the charm of the old town. This fountain can be spotted and was actually the first we spotted as we came from the Kursaal area. Its right in front of the clock tower.",

          "In the middle of old town this fountain built in 1546, indeed is frightening and annoying, but this statue eating a baby is really weird and interested. Is this statue Kronos, the Greek god, eating his children?Is just the boogie man who frightens small children? No one knows",
          "This is one of the most intricate of all of the Bern water fountains. This statue depicts the Ogre eating young children in a quite grotesque manner. There are two legends that surround this fountain. First, this statue represents Chronos, one of the original Titans who ate",
          "It is a lovely fountain and worth seeing and taking a photograph of. You can even fill up your water bottle here as nearly all Swiss fountains are safe to drink from. You'll find this fearsome fountain across the road from the Zytglogge next to the number 9 Tram stop.",
          "Magnificently grotesque. If you like unusual monuments you'll love this! I walked past it at first as we were on our way to another fountain. I was stopped in my tracks, couldn't believe the man was eating children!!",
          "Finally a way to use mean girls infamous gruel. Here I mean gruesome but cool. It's an ogre eating a baby. I could have lived my life without seeing it, but that being said if you're in Bern it's worth seeing",
          "The fountain itself is easy to find (quite central), and the whole of the old town of Bern is just lovely (highly recommend a walk through its many alleys and streets). But the fountain is smaller and taller than I thought, and probably wouldn't have been too difficult to",
          "I used the visit to put some discipline into my children. I did tell them it was mythology and not true. However, articulation of the sculpting hands were apparent. And it exhumed a eery vibe. However, it is worth contemplating for 5-10 minutes before enjoying the other",
          "The colours really stand out on a sunny day on this hilariously portrayed statue over the fountain. Love it! Pop by for a quick photo opposite the mcdonalds when walking up the main road that the clock towers stand on",

        "wiki": "The four national languages of Switzerland are German, French, Italian and Romansh. All but Romansh maintain equal status as official languages at the national level within the Federal Administration of the Swiss Confederation.  In some situations, Latin is used, particularly as a single language to denote the country.\nIn 2017, the population of Switzerland was 62.6% native speakers of German (58.5% speak Swiss German and/or 11.1% Standard German at home); 22.9% French (mostly Swiss French, but including some Arpitan dialects); 8.2% Italian (mostly Swiss Italian, but including Lombard dialects); and 0.5% Romansh.  The German region (Deutschschweiz) is roughly in the east, north and center; the French part (la Romandie) in the west and the Italian area (Svizzera italiana) in the south. There remains a small Romansh-speaking native population in Graub\u00fcnden in the east. The cantons of Fribourg, Bern and Valais are officially bilingual; the canton of Graub\u00fcnden is officially trilingual.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe main languages of Swiss residents from 1950 to 2015, in percentages, were as follows:\nIn 2012, for the first time, respondents could indicate more than one language, causing the percentages to exceed 100%.\n\n\n== National languages and linguistic regions ==\n\n\n=== German ===\n\nThe German-speaking part of Switzerland (German: Deutschschweiz, French: Suisse al\u00e9manique, Italian: Svizzera tedesca, Romansh: Svizra tudestga) constitutes about 65% of Switzerland (North Western Switzerland, Eastern Switzerland, Central Switzerland, most of the Swiss Plateau and the greater part of the Swiss Alps).\nIn seventeen of the Swiss cantons, German is the only official language (Aargau, Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Appenzell Innerrhoden, Basel-Stadt, Basel-Landschaft, Glarus, Luzern, Nidwalden, Obwalden, Schaffhausen, Schwyz, Solothurn, St. Gallen, Thurgau, Uri, Zug, and Z\u00fcrich).In the cantons of Bern, Fribourg and Valais, French is co-official; in the trilingual canton of Graub\u00fcnden, more than half of the population speaks German, while the rest speak Romansh or Italian. In each case, all languages are official languages of the respective canton.\nWhile the French-speaking Swiss prefer to call themselves Romands and their part of the country is the Romandy, the German-speaking Swiss used to (and, colloquially, still do) refer to the French-speaking Swiss as \"Welsche\", and to their area as Welschland, which has the same etymology as the English Welsh (see Walha). In Germany Welsch and Welschland refer to Italy; there, the term is antiquated, rarely used, and somewhat disparaging. Research shows, that individuals with a French-sounding name in the German-speaking part suffer from social discrimination.  Nevertheless, in 2017, 11.1%, or about 920,600 of the Swiss residents speak Standard German (\"Hochdeutsch\") at home, but this statistic is probably mainly due to German (and Austrian) immigrants.By the Middle Ages, a marked difference had developed within the German-speaking part of Switzerland between the rural cantons (Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Glarus, Zug, Appenzell, Schaffhausen) and the city cantons (Lucerne, Berne, Zurich, Solothurn, Fribourg, Basel, St. Gallen), divided by views about trade and commerce. After the Reformation, all cantons were either Catholic or Protestant, and the denominational influences on culture added to the differences. Even today, when all cantons are somewhat denominationally mixed, the different historical denominations can be seen in the mountain villages, where Roman Catholic Central Switzerland abounds with chapels and statues of saints, and the farm houses in the very similar landscape of the Protestant Bernese Oberland show Bible verses carved on the housefronts instead.\nIn addition to this more widespread notion of Swiss German dialect, there is also Walser German, another Highest Alemannic speech brought by Walser emigrants from Valais.\n\n\n=== French ===\n\nRomandy (French: Romandie, la Suisse romande, German: Romandie, Welschland, Welschschweiz, or in some contexts: Westschweiz, Italian: Svizzera romanda) is the French-speaking part of Switzerland. It covers the area of the cantons of Geneva, Vaud, Neuch\u00e2tel, and Jura as well as the French-speaking parts of the cantons of Bern (German-speaking majority), Valais (French-speaking majority), and Fribourg (French-speaking majority). 1.9 million people (or 24.4% of the Swiss population) live in Romandy.Standard Swiss French and the French of France are the same language, with some differences. For example, like some other regions of the French-speaking world, Swiss people (as well as most Francophone Belgians) use septante (seventy) instead of soixante-dix (literally, \"sixty ten\") and nonante (ninety) instead of \"quatre-vingt-dix\" (\"four twenties and ten\"). In the cantons of Vaud, Valais and Fribourg, speakers use huitante (eighty) instead of the Standard French \"quatre-vingts\" (four twenties). \"Sou\" is used throughout Romandy for a 5-centime coin, as is \"tune\" (or \"thune\") when referring to a 5-Swiss-franc piece.\nHistorically, the vernacular language used by inhabitants of most parts of Romandy was Franco-Proven\u00e7al. Franco-Proven\u00e7al (also called Arpitan) is a language sometimes considered to be halfway between the langue d'o\u00efl (the historical language of northern France and ancestor of French) and Occitan (the langue d'oc, spoken in southern France). Standard French and Franco-Proven\u00e7al/Arpitan, linguistically, are distinct and mutual intelligibility is limited. Increasingly, Franco-Proven\u00e7al/Arpitan is used only by members of the older generations.The term Romandy does not formally exist in the political system, but is used to distinguish and unify the French-speaking population of Switzerland. The television channel T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Suisse Romande (TSR) serves the Romande community across Switzerland, is syndicated to TV5 and CanalSat Romande.\n\n\n=== Italian ===\n\nItalian Switzerland (Italian: Svizzera italiana, Romansh: Svizra taliana, French: Suisse italienne, German: italienische Schweiz) is the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, which includes the canton of Ticino and the southern part of Graub\u00fcnden. Italian is also spoken in the Gondo Valley (leading to the Simplon Pass, on the southern part of the watershed) in Valais.\nThe linguistic region covers an area approximately 3,500 km\u00b2 and has a total population of around 350,000 inhabitants, with the number of Italophones residing in Switzerland being 545,274 (about 7% of the Swiss population).The proportion of Italian-speaking inhabitants had been decreasing since the 1970s, after reaching a high of 12% of the population during the same decade. This was entirely because of the reduced number of immigrants from Italy to Switzerland, but gained again during the last decade.\n\n\n=== Romansh ===\n\nOn the cantonal level, Romansh is an official language only in the trilingual canton of Graub\u00fcnden, where the municipalities in turn are free to specify their own official languages.\nSignificant communities of Romansh speakers remain in the Surselva, the Surs\u00e9s/Oberhalbstein, the lower Engadin and the Val M\u00fcstair.\nRomansh has been recognized as one of four \"national languages\" by the Swiss Federal Constitution since 1938. It was also declared an \"official language\" of the Confederation in 1996, meaning that Romansh speakers may use their language for correspondence with the federal government and expect to receive a Romansh response. (Although Romansh is split into several dialects, the federal authorities use the standardized version (\"Romansh Grischun\") exclusively.)\n\n\n== Other languages ==\nBesides the national languages and the many varieties of Swiss German, several regional Romance languages are spoken natively in Switzerland: Franco-Proven\u00e7al and Lombard. About 20,000 Romani speak Sinte, an Indic language. Five sign languages are used: Swiss-German, French, Italian, Austrian, and German.\n\n\n== Neo-Latin ==\n\nTo avoid having to translate the name of Switzerland in the four national languages, Latin is used on the coins of the Swiss franc (Helvetia or Confoederatio Helvetica) and on Swiss stamps (Helvetia). The country code top-level domain for Switzerland on the internet is .ch, the abbreviation of the Latin name, Confoederatio Helvetica (Swiss Confederation); similarly, the International vehicle registration code for Swiss automobiles is \"CH\". The Federal Palace of Switzerland bears the inscription Curia Confoederationis Helveticae.To have a unique name across the country (without favoring German or English), several Swiss foundations and associations have Latin names, such as Pro Helvetia, Pro Infirmis, Pro Juventute, Pro Natura, Pro Patria, Pro Senectute, Pro Specie Rara, etc.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSwiss people\nDemographics of Switzerland\nR\u00f6stigraben, referring to the asserted difference in mentality between German Swiss and the French-speaking Romands\nSwiss literature\nList of multilingual countries and regions\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSwiss German\nA quick guide to the Swiss German language\nCharacteristics of Swiss German dialects\nswiss-linguistics.com Information portal on current linguistic research in Switzerland\nsieps.ch Information Services on Swiss Private Schools and Universities\nPimsleur Swiss German Pimsleur Swiss German Course",

          "The views from the top of the observation tower was good. The paths around the top central area were wellmaintained. We took our own picnic lunch. The mosy commonly used walking track down was unexciting, and poorly signed at the end, leading to an interesting 3km diversion."

It is a Swiss Cultural Property of National Significance and is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Old City of Bern.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe fountain, located at the upper end of Marktgasse memorializes the founder of the first hospital in Bern. Anna Seiler is represented by a woman in a blue dress, pouring water into a small dish. She stands on a pillar brought from the Roman town of Aventicum (modern Avenches). On 29 November 1354 in her will she asked the city to help found a hospital in her house which today stands on Zeughausgasse. The hospital initially had 13 beds and 2 attendants and was to be an ewiges Spital or a perpetual hospital. When Anna died around 1360 the hospital was renamed the Seilerin Spital. In 1531 the hospital moved to the empty Dominican Order monastery St. Michaels Insel (St. Michael's Island) and was then known as the Inselspital, which still exists over 650 years after Anna Seiler founded it. The modern Inselspital has about 6,000 employees and treats about 220,000 individuals per year.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Anna-Seiler-Brunnen (Hans Gieng 1545) at Wikimedia Commons",

Southwest planned to renovate the motel structure and add a 14-story addition with 518 rooms. Fred Harvey Company would serve as the operator of the hotel, its restaurants, and other areas of the resort. Fred Harvey had previously opened hotels in other parts of the United States under the Airport Marina name. Southwest also planned to construct a 28,400 sq ft (2,640 m2) casino that would operate separately from Fred Harvey.The 700-room Marina, located at 3805 South Las Vegas Boulevard, was built by Wiesner Investment Company and was opened in 1975. In 1989, Wiesner and his partners sold the Marina to Kirk Kerkorian, who also bought the Tropicana Country Club, located behind the Marina and across Tropicana Avenue from the Tropicana and San R\u00e9mo hotels to obtain the site that would become the home of the MGM Grand. Kerkorian saw the Marina as a stable and solidly built resort, and decided not to destroy the hotel, but to build around it. During that time, the Marina was known as the MGM-Marina Hotel.The Marina closed on November 30, 1990, and ground was broken for the new casino hotel complex on October 7, 1991. The Marina hotel building still exists as the west wing of the main hotel building.\n\n\n=== MGM Grand (1993\u2013present) ===\nWhen the latest MGM Grand opened on December 18, 1993, it was owned by MGM Grand Inc. At that time it had an extensive Wizard of Oz theme, including the green \"Emerald City\" color of the building and the decorative use of Wizard of Oz memorabilia. After entering the casino's main entrance, one would find themselves in the Oz Casino facing Emerald City. Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion were seen in front of the city. The Emerald City attraction featured an elaborate yellow brick road walk-through, complete with the cornfield, apple orchard, and haunted forest, as well as audio-animatronic figures of Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the Wicked Witch of the West. It would end at the door of the city, leading inside for a performance of \"The Wizard's Secrets\". When MGM Grand began its extensive refurbishment in 1996, the Oz Casino was the first to go. The Emerald City was completely demolished, and the Emerald City Gift Shop was moved to a new shopping section of the casino. The store remained open until early 2003.\nWhen the MGM Grand opened, the intention was to create a destination hotel in the Las Vegas area by including the MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park behind the casino. The plan was to make the Las Vegas Strip more family friendly by providing activities for those too young to linger inside the casino. The theme park performed poorly and did not reopen for the 2001 season. The site was redeveloped as a luxury condominium and hotel complex called The Signature at MGM Grand, opened in 2006.\nThe resort's original entrance consisted of a giant lion head, made of fiberglass and blocky in appearance, with visitors entering through the lion's mouth. The lion was a cartoon-like version of MGM's logo, Leo the Lion.  The MGM Grand performed unusually poorly with Asian gamblers in its first years of existence; a study by the management found that many Chinese patrons found it bad luck to walk through the jaws of a lion and avoided the hotel as a result, part of why the entrance was renovated to remove this feature.The Las Vegas Monorail was built to connect MGM Grand to the Bally's hotel-casino in 1995. The coming-out party for the monorail, on behalf of Bally's, consisted of showgirls and guys from Bally's famed show, Jubilee!, helping groups to the monorail. Characters from The Wizard of Oz greeted the groups on the MGM side. The track was later updated to become the southernmost section of the Las Vegas Monorail. The MGM Grand station was refurbished, the trains were replaced with Bombardier M-VI's, and the track was extended beyond the southern station to provide for track switching for the trains, as well as a starting point for a potential future southern extension to the monorail line.\n\nIn May 1996, MGM Grand Inc. announced a 30-month, four-phase renovation of the resort that would cost more than $250 million. The project would include replacing the property's lion entrance with a six-story gold lion structure. The first phase was to begin in June 1996, and would focus on the resort's restaurant, food court and arcade area, with the addition of several new restaurants. The second phase would include the $15 million reconstruction of the lion entrance. Other changes would include a 300,000 sq ft (28,000 m2) convention center, to be built at a cost of $60 million; a $60 million retail and entertainment complex, including theme restaurants and nightclubs, to be built adjacent to the theme park; a new entrance, to be built along Koval Lane at a cost of $5 million, scheduled to begin in mid-1997; a $30 million renovation of 52 suites on the penthouse level; and $11 million to upgrade parts of the casino. The final phase would incorporate a $17 million entertainment theme at the resort's vehicle entrance on Tropicana Avenue. Other changes would include a $15 million renovation of the resort's Emerald City entertainment area, and an additional 2,000 parking spaces to be added at a cost of $13 million, for a new total of 11,000 spaces. Terrence Lanni, the chairman of MGM Grand Inc., said he wanted customers to \"feel like guests coming to a premiere of one of the world's greatest movies. When we're completed, every aspect of this property will bespeak entertainment.\" The former restaurant, retail and arcade area was redesigned into the Studio Walk, an area resembling a Hollywood sound stage and featuring various restaurants and shops.\n\nDemolition of the lion entrance began on May 13, 1997, and was expected to take two weeks, while the $250 million renovation project was expected to be finished by late 1998. The new facade was expected to cost $40 million to construct. In November 1997, the property installed 18 promotional and entertainment LED screens, including 15 outside the resort. Installation of the lion statue was underway in December 1997, with the addition of a 5,000-pound paw. Assembly of the 100,000-pound statue was expected to be finished later that month. The statue weighs 50 tons, and at 45 feet (14 m) tall, on a 25-foot pedestal, is the largest bronze statue in the U.S. The new facade also included 11 statues of winged Atlas-like men holding 16-foot diameter bowls. The statues were made of bronze-finished fiberglass and accompanied the lion statue, along with LED screens and water fountains. Work on the statue and accompanying fountains was expected to be finished in February 1998. The resort's 380,000 sq ft (35,000 m2) conference center opened in April 1998. The conference center, a pool, and a spa were constructed on 15 acres of land previously occupied by a portion of the theme park and a parking lot.\n \nIn 2000, in an attempt to appeal to a more \"mature\" clientele, the hotel underwent a major renovation, and almost all traces of the Oz theme were removed. The theme is now more of the Art Deco era of classic Hollywood, and the hotel started billing itself as The City of Entertainment. More recently, the resort has used the phrase \"Maximum Vegas\", referring to the vast amount of activities MGM Grand offers its guests.\nOn April 26, 2000, MGM opened a new satellite registration/hotel check-in center at McCarran International Airport. This was the first of its kind opened by a hotel company at any United States airport.  However, this airport check-in center appears to have closed in late 2013.\nIn 2005, MGM opened the West Wing, a renovation of the original Marina Hotel rooms.\nIn October 2011, MGM began a renovation in which all of its rooms and suites in the main tower were fully renovated, along with the casino floor and other public areas. This has provided the hotel with a more contemporary room design. The work was completed in September 2012.\nIn June 2017, MGM Resorts International held a groundbreaking for a 250,000 sq ft (23,000 m2) expansion of the resort's convention conference center, for a total of 850,000 sq ft (79,000 m2) upon completion. The expanded conference center was topped off in January 2018, and was opened in January 2019. It was built at a cost of $130 million. At the time, the hotel had a 90 percent occupancy rate. That month, plans were announced by MGM Resorts to eventually redevelop the resort's entrance on Las Vegas Boulevard to provide easier pedestrian access. The redeveloped area would include restaurants and retail space accessible to pedestrians, but was not expected to begin construction during 2019. MGM Resorts also planned to eventually redevelop the hotel's entrance on Tropicana Avenue in the years to come.In January 2020, MGM Resorts announced that it would sell the resort to a joint venture consisting of MGM Growth Properties and The Blackstone Group. MGM would own 50.1 percent of the joint venture, and Blackstone would own the remainder. The MGM Grand would be leased to MGM Resorts, which would continue to operate the resort. The deal was finalized a month later.\n\n\n== Film history ==\nThe MGM Grand was featured prominently in the 1996 boxing comedy The Great White Hype.\nThe MGM Grand was one of the casinos that Danny Ocean and his crew robbed in the 2001 film Ocean's Eleven. A staged title unification match between heavyweight boxing champions Lennox Lewis and Wladimir Klitschko was prominently featured in the film.\nClark Griswold (Chevy Chase) and his family play a game of Keno in the final scenes of Vegas Vacation alongside a character played by Sid Caesar. Keno is no longer offered at the casino. The exterior shot of the casino featured the former lion head entrance as well.\nThe MGM Grand's Wizard of Oz theme is referenced in the 1996 film Swingers as the friend of the waitress that Trent picks up works as \"a Dorothy\".\nThe MGM Grand, with its old entrance, was featured at the close of Casino as an example of the \"new\" Las Vegas.\nThe MGM Grand was featured in The Amazing Race 15 and The Amazing Race 24.\n\n\n== Media ==\nA parody of the MGM Grand was featured in the BMX video game Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX 2.

He was reported to be watching the Bruce Seldon vs Mike Tyson boxing match with his collective members including Suge Knight.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\n\nMGM Grand featured a glass-sided lion habitat inside the casino area, in which up to six lions were shown daily since 1999. A see-through tunnel ran through the habitat for close-up viewing, where the lions would frequently lounge on top of the glass, allowing visitors to walk under them. The lions were owned by Keith Evans, a trainer of exotic animals, and did not live at the habitat, but at his ranch 12 miles (19 km) outside Las Vegas. The lion habitat closed permanently in February 2012 as part of MGM Grand's renovation.\nCSI: The Experience opened in the Studio Walk in September 2009. Here, guests try to solve one of three murder cases interactively, guided by touchscreen stations, cast member videos, and realistic recreated evidence. The first stop is a debriefing room where Gil Grissom introduces the \"new recruits\" to their assigned cases. After observing the evidence at the crime scene, visitors go to lab areas where they analyze the gathered evidence. They then present their findings in Grissom's office, answering a test based on their analysis of the evidence. Finally, visitors receive a case summary and a CSI diploma.\nTopGolf: Built on the former site of MGM Grand Adventures theme park, opened in May 2016.\n\n\n== Gaming ==\nThe MGM Grand has one of the largest gaming floors in all of Las Vegas, measuring 171,500 square feet (15,930 m2).

It is on the edge of the Z\u00e4hringerstadt which was built during the founding of the city in 1191, though the plaza wasn't built until later.  It is located near the Kornhausbr\u00fccke (Kornhaus bridge) and the Zytglogge clock tower.  It is part of the UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site that encompasses the Old City.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKornhausplatz was originally the ditch around the first city wall.  Following the Great Fire of 1405 the ditch (known as the Steininbr\u00fcgg-Graben) was filled in to form a plaza.  For about three centuries, it was known as Platz (literally: plaza or place). In 1545 or 1546 the Kindlifresserbrunnen (Bernese German for Child Eater Fountain) was built by Hans Gieng in place of a wooden fountain on the Platz.  Originally it was known as Platzbrunnen (Place Fountain), though the current name was used first in 1666.\nIn 1711-1715 the Kornhaus (German for granary) was built on the western side of the Platz.  Following construction of the Kornhaus, the Platz was known as Kornhausplatz or Kornmarkt (Grain market).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Meret (or M\u00e9ret) Elisabeth Oppenheim (6 October 1913 \u2013 15 November 1985) was a German-born Swiss Surrealist artist and photographer. Besides creating art objects, Oppenheim appeared as a model for photographs by Man Ray, most notably a series of nude shots of her interacting with a printing press.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMeret Oppenheim was born on 6 October 1913 in Berlin. She was named after Meretlein, a wild child who lives in the woods, from the novel Green Henry by Gottfried Keller. Oppenheim had two siblings, a sister Kristin (born 1915), and a brother Burkhard (born 1919). Her father, a German-Jewish doctor, was conscripted into the army at the outbreak of war in 1914.  Consequently, Oppenheim and her mother, who was Swiss, moved to live with Oppenheim's maternal grandparents in Del\u00e9mont, Switzerland. In Switzerland, Oppenheim was exposed to a plethora of art and artists from a young age. Oppenheim was also inspired by her aunt, Ruth Wenger, especially by Wenger's devotion to art and her modern lifestyle. During the late 1920s, Oppenheim was further exposed to different artworks connected to Modernism, Expressionism, Fauvism, and Cubism.By 1928, Oppenheim was introduced to the writings of Carl Jung through her father and was inspired to record her dreams. Oppenheim was interested in Jung's analytical approach, particularly his animus-anima theory. Throughout her life, Oppenheim carefully analyzed her own dreams and transcribed them in detail in her writings. She attempted to use them when addressing \u201cfundamental life questions.\u201d Likewise, Oppenheim used iconography and motifs from Jung's archetypes within her work throughout the years; typical motifs Oppenheim used include spirals and snakes. Oppenheim renounced the term \u201cfeminine art\u201d and adopted Jung's ideal androgynous creativity in her art in which masculine and feminine aspects worked simultaneously.The work of Paul Klee, the focus of a retrospective at the Kunsthalle Basel in 1929, provided another strong influence on Oppenheim, arousing her to the possibilities of abstraction.\nIn May 1932, at the age of 18, Oppenheim moved to Paris from Basel, Switzerland and sporadically attended the Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re to study painting. Her first studio was a hotel room at Montparnasse Hotel in Paris. At this time she produced mainly paintings and drawings. In 1933, Oppenheim met Hans Arp and Alberto Giacometti. After visiting her studio and seeing her work, Arp and Giacometti invited her to participate in the Surrealist exhibition in the \u201cSalon des Surind\u00e9pendants,\u201d held in Paris between 27 October and 26 November. Oppenheim later met Andr\u00e9 Breton and began to participate in meetings at the Caf\u00e9 de la Place Blanche with the Surrealist circle. She impressed the surrealists with her uninhibited behavior. Shortly after she began to attend meetings regularly with Breton and other acquaintances, Oppenheim's circle was joined by other Surrealist artists such as Marcel Duchamp, Max Ernst, and Man Ray. The conceptual approach favored by Marcel Duchamp, Max Ernst, and Francis Picabia became important to her work.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1936, Meret Oppenheim had her first solo exhibition in Basel, Switzerland, at the Galerie Schulthess. She continued to contribute to Surrealist exhibitions until 1960. Many of her pieces consisted of everyday objects arranged to allude to female sexuality and feminine exploitation by the opposite sex. Oppenheim's paintings focused on the same themes. Her abundant strength of character and her self-assurance informed each work she created, conveying a certain comfortable confrontation with life and death. Her originality and audacity established her as a leading figure in the Surrealist movement. In Oppenheim: Object she was described as having embodied and \"personified male Surrealism's ideal of the 'femme-enfant.'Oppenheim's first one-woman exhibition in the Galerie Schulthess, Basel (1936) featured surrealist objects. In 1937, Oppenheim returned to Basel and this marked the start of her artistic block. She struggled after she met success and worried about her development as an artist. Oppenheim usually worked in spontaneous bursts and at times destroyed her work. Oppenheim took a hiatus from her artistic career in 1939 after an exhibition at the Galerie Ren\u00e9 Drouin started by Rene Drouin in Paris. In the exhibition she was featured alongside many artists, including Leonor Fini and Max Ernst. She did not share any art with the public again until the 1950s. Oppenheim then reverted to her \"original style\" and based her new artworks on old sketches and earlier works and creations.Oppenheim's best known artwork is Object (Le D\u00e9jeuner en fourrure) [Object (Breakfast in Fur)] (1936). Oppenheim's Object consists of a teacup, saucer and spoon that she covered with fur from a Chinese gazelle. The fur represents an affluent woman; the cup, hollow yet round, can evoke female genitalia; the spoon, with its phallic shape, further eroticizes the hairy object. Originally spurred by a conversation Oppenheim had with Pablo Picasso and his lover Dora Maar in caf\u00e9 Deux Magots about a fur bracelet she was wearing, Oppenheim created Object to liberate the saucer, spoon, and teacup from their original functions as consumer objects. Viewers are thus able to feel emotions of joy and wonder when observing Object while also questioning the functionality of each of its components. The artwork's title, developed by Breton, was inspired by both Leopold Sacher-Masoch's novel Venus in Fur and Edouard Manet's Dejeuner sur l\u2019herbe. During the same year of its creation, Object was purchased by Alfred Barr for the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York and was included in the museum's first Surrealist exhibition titled Fantastic Art: Dada and Surrealism. Oppenheim was willing to sell her artwork for one thousand francs, but Barr only offered her $50 and she accepted. This was the first Surrealist artwork that the museum acquired, and Oppenheim became known as the First Lady of MoMA.Oppenheim's Object would be one of the main forces that led to her lengthy artistic crisis due to its spiking increase in popularity after being displayed by Barr in New York. Although it brought Oppenheim a large amount of fame, Object reinforced the public's belief that Oppenheim only practiced Surrealism which she found hindered her freedom of artistic expression and exploration of other artistic styles. In fact, Object became so widely known that many misconceptions about Oppenheim and her art were created because of it. For example, many incorrectly believed that Oppenheim mainly created objects in fur. Being known as the artist of Object, Oppenheim was bounded to Surrealism from public expectation, a connection she was trying to avoid. Decades later, in 1972, she artistically commented on its dominance of her career by producing a number of \"souvenirs\" of Le D\u00e9jeuner en fourrure. Object has also been widely interpreted through a Freudian lens, and has been seen in a symbolic sense as a female sexual reference.Throughout her life, Oppenheim has been willing to pose for photographers. Her most popular photo-shoot with Man Ray deeply depicts her personal stance on femininity. Contrary to the discretion about the gender of Le D\u00e9jeuner 's creator, the photographs provided an unmistakable monument to her femininity and a testimony to her unwillingness to expose it.In 1937, Oppenheim returned to Basel, training as an art conservator in order to ensure her financial stability. This marked the beginning of a creative crisis that lasted until 1954. Although she maintained some contact with her friends in Paris, she created very little and destroyed or failed to finish much of what she created. In Basel she became a member of the Gruppe 33 and participated in their group shows, 1945 in the Kunstmuseum Basel.Oppenheim began working as an art conservator in 1944 during an eighteen year long depressive episode. Oppenheim was known for struggling with her awareness of the oppression of women in society. Oppenheim was also impacted when her father had to flee to Switzerland before World War II due to his Jewish surname; his credentials and training as a doctor were also discredited, leaving him unemployed. As a result, Oppenheim needed to do conservation for financial and emotional relief. She viewed the works she produced in this time of her life as imaginative and \u201cprojections of her fantasy.Oppenheim kept a studio in Bern since 1954 and lived there permanently from 1967 until her death.In the 1950s Oppenheim became friends with Arnold Rudlinger, the director of the Kunsthall Bern. The varying programs and exhibitions at the Kunstall Bern placed Oppenheim in a stimulating artistic environment that enabled her to explore international art trends while working alongside Dieter Roth, Daniel Spoerri, and Markus Raetz.In 1956, Oppenheim designed the costumes and masks for Daniel Spoerri\u2019s production of Picasso\u2019s play Le D\u00e9sir attrap\u00e9 par la queue in Berne. She and artist Lilly Keller were cast as the curtains. Three years later, in 1959, she organized a Spring Banquet (Le Festin) in Bern for a few friends at which food was served on the body of a naked woman. The exhibit cause controversy, with Oppenheim accused of treating the female body as on object to be devoured. With Oppenheim's permission, Andre Breton restaged the performance later that year at the opening of the Exposition inteRnatiOnale du Surrealisme (EROS), at the Galerie Cordier in Paris. Outside its original intimate setting, the performance was overly provocative and Oppenheim felt her original intention for the work was lost. Oppenheim felt surrealism changed after World War II and she never exhibited with the Surrealists again.In the 1960s Oppenheim distanced herself from the Surrealists. She felt she belonged with the post-war generation, which was younger. Oppenheim was notably \u201ctrue to herself\u201d and undertook novel topics in her work with \u201cfresh pictorial language.\u201d Despite this, Oppenheim never had her own students, but sometimes would mentor younger artists. In 1968 Oppenheim had a solo exhibition at the Galerie Martin Krebs in Bern.In 1982 Oppenheim won the Berlin Art Prize and was featured in Rudi Fuchs\u2019 exhibition documenta 7. In this year Meret Oppenheim: Defiance in the Face of Freedom was published, and she was commissioned to make a public fountain by Berlin's art commission. Her fountain was cast in 1983 and had mixed public reviews.Due to the fact it lights up at night, newspapers called it a \u201clighthouse\u201d and \u201can eyesore.\u201d Eventually it became covered in algae and moss, allowing the public to accept it. In 1983 Oppenheim also partook a touring exhibition through the Geothe Institute in Italy. In 1984 she had a solo exhibition in Kunsthalle Burn in Switzerland along with Musee d\u2019Art Moderne in Paris, France. Thus, Oppenheim was one of the only \u201cfemale artists of her generation to be recognized internationally while she was alive.\u201d\n\n\n== Oppenheim and Surrealism ==\nAfter Oppenheim moved to Paris, her first contacts became Alberto Giacommetti and Hans Arp. She was then introduced to Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray, and was in 1936 asked to exhibit her work in a show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Her paintings were hung alongside those in the Paris and New York art scenes, including Salvador Dal\u00ed and Giacommetti. After the exhibion of Object Man Ray anointed Oppenheim as \"Surrealism's 'muse.'\"\nOppenheim fit in with the Surrealists because she was seeking \"acceptance and approval for the way she was living her life.\" She was skeptical of any concrete ideology, and Surrealism allowed her to experiment within her art. This is evident in her painting Sitting Figure with Shrunken Fingers, which has been described as \"sexless, featureless, placeless...a portrait of the attitude of its maker.\"Oppenheim experimented with diverse styles throughout her career, including while she identified as a Surrealist. She experimented with \u201cveristic surrealism\u201d and had a quality of openness that allowed her work to maintain relevance. Unlike other Surrealists that viewed dreams as a way to unlock the subconscious, Oppenheim used painting and her dreams as an \u201canalogy to its (the subconsciousness\u2019) forms. Likewise, Oppenheim used versatile symbols, partly influenced by Carl Jung, that provided mystery and ambiguity. Similarly, unlike other Surrealists Oppenheim used symbols with a \u201cfluid and changeable impact\u201d and produced works that were cohesive through frequent and organized ideas rather than formal language. To direct viewers towards her meaning, she would strategically title her works.Nonetheless, Oppenheim's Object persists as an example of \u201cSurrealist fetishism,\u201d as its function follows its form; the fur on the cup renders it not functional.\n\n\n== List of works ==\nThe Exercise Book, 1930, Collage, 20.5 x 33.5 cm\nVotive Picture (Destroying Angel), 1931, ink, watercolor, 34  x 17.5 cm\nFor Irene Zurkinden, 1932, mixed media on cardboard, 75 x 52 cm\nOne-eyed, 1933, Gouache, 27 x 17.5 cm\nSitting Figure with Folded Hands, 1933, oil on cardboard, 28.5 x 22.5 cm\nThe Ear of Giacometti, 1933, Bronze object after plaster model, 10 x 7.5 x 1.5 cm\nAnatomy of a Dead Woman, 1934, Oil on canvas, 150 x 60 cm\nArmband/ Bracelet, 1935, Brass, covered with fur, 6.5 x 2 cm\nHabillez-vous en ours blanc, 1935, oil on cardboard, glued celluloid, brass plate, 65 x 50 cm\nObject (The Luncheon in Fur). 1936. fur covered cup and spoon. cup 4 \u00be\" diameter, saucer 9 \u215c\", spoon 8\".

In Switzerland, her first retrospective was held at Museum der Stadt, Solothurn (1974) and traveled to Kunstmuseum Winterthur and Wilhelm-Lehmbruck Museum, Duisberg, Germany in 1975.\nIn 1996, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum mounted Oppenheim's first major museum show in the United States at a time when renewed interest in her work, particularly among young artists, had already begun in Europe. In 2013, a comprehensive retrospective of Oppenheim's work opened at the Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin, gathering the artist's paintings, sketches, sculptures, masks, clothing, furniture, and jewelry. Lenders included singer David Bowie, the Swiss retail tycoon and art dealer Ursula Hauser, and the Dutch diamond magnate Sylvio Perlstein.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nOppenheim received the Art Award of the City of Basel on January 16, 1975. In her acceptance speech, Oppenheim coined the phrase \"Freedom is not given to you \u2014 you have to take it.\" In 1982, three years before her death, she received the 1982 Berliner Kunstpreis.In 2019, Basel inaugurated a plaza, road, fountain and a high-rise apartment building (by Herzog & de Meuron) all named after Oppenheim in the city center. The large fountain features her sculpture Spirale (der Gang der Natur).\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nOppenheim has been esteemed as figure of \u201cfeminist identification\u201d for the women's movement and a role model for younger generations due to her \u201csocio-critical and emancipatory attitude.\u201d In 1975 Oppenheim gave a speech at \u201cthe presentation of Basler Kuntpreis\u201d and directly asked women \u201cto demonstrate to society by the invalidity of taboos by adopting unconventional ways of life\u201d and utilize their intellect as a creative strength without fear.Oppenheim, who died in 1985, at 72, kept careful notes about which patrons and colleagues she liked and where her works ended up. She dictated which of her writings should be published and when, and there are puzzling gaps, since she destroyed some material.  The archive and much artwork have been entrusted to institutions in Bern, including the Museum of Fine Arts and the National Library.Levy Galerie, founded in 1970 by Hamburg resident Thomas Levy, represents the estate of Meret Oppenheim, in close collaboration with the artist's family.\nOn October 6, 2017, Google celebrated her 104th birthday with a Google Doodle.In 2018, Oppenheim was the subject of a short documentary by Cheri Gaulke, Gloria's Call.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nChadwick, Whitney. \"Oppenheim, Meret.\" Grove Art Online.

        "wiki": "Thun Castle (German: Schloss Thun) is a castle in the city of Thun, in the Swiss canton of Bern. It was built in the 12th century, today houses the Thun Castle museum, and is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the Early Middle Ages there was a small fort and church on the top of the castle hill.  The castle was built between 1180 and 1190 by Duke Berthold V of Z\u00e4hringen, who constructed the still preserved keep to the level of the Knights' Hall (German: Rittersaal). The 14 m (46 ft) tall Knights' Hall was built as the centerpiece of a monument to Z\u00e4hringen power.  However, the family never lived in the castle, preferring Burgdorf Castle.  In 1218 it was inherited by the House of Kyburg, who built the upper levels above the Z\u00e4hringen castle.  A quarrel over who would rule the southern Kyburg lands led, in 1322, to Eberhard II von Kyburg murdering his brother Hartmann II at the castle.  To protect his newly acquired land from the Habsburgs Eberhard II then sold them to Bern and was promptly given them back as a fief.  The Kyburgs ruled over the region for nearly two centuries until a failed raid by Rudolf II on Solothurn, in 1382, started the Burgdorferkrieg (also Kyburgerkrieg).  After several decisive Bernese victories the Kyburgs were forced to concede an unfavorable peace.  In 1384 Bern bought Thun and Burgdorf, the most important cities of the Kyburg lands.  The castle came under Bernese control and became the seat of their local administration.\nThe massive roof (1430\u201336) comes from the Bernese period. Due to the lack of residences in the castle, in 1429, an administrative and residential wing was added to the west of the keep, built in late Gothic style, and known as the \"new castle\".  The castle was the seat of the local court and since at least the 17th century there was a prison under the roof of the donjon.  In 1886 a new prison was built on the castle grounds.  Two years later, in 1888, the museum opened in the castle.  For a time the jailer was also the ticket seller and guard for the museum.In 2006, the castle was bought by the city of Thun from the canton of Bern. Until the end of 2009 the Bernese Oberland regional court was based in the castle.\n\n\n== The castle museum ==\nThe castle museum is housed in the five floors of the tower, and includes cultural and historic displays showing the development of the region over some 4,000 years. It is open daily between February and October, and on Sundays only for the rest of the year. The great hall is used for concerts or plays, and can be hired for private events.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of castles in Switzerland\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Schloss Thun at Wikimedia Commons\nThun Castle Museum web site (in German)\nPage on Thun Castle from city web site (in German)",

        "wiki": "Marcus Pfister (born 30 July 1960 in Bern, Switzerland) is a Swiss author and illustrator of children's picture books.His Rainbow Fish series of children's picture books, published since 1992, has been a worldwide success. The books have been translated into over 60 languages and have sold over 30 million copies. DHX Media turned the picture books into a 26-episode animated television series of the same name, which has aired on the HBO Family television channel in the United States since 2000.\nHe uses water colors to illustrate his children's books. He begins by stretching the watercolor paper over a wooden board. Next, he copies his rough sketches onto the paper in pencil. He is then ready to begin painting. For his backgrounds and blended contours he uses wet paint on wait paper, this achieves a softer effect. For the finer details, he first lets the painting dry, and then he paints the final picture layer by layer. When the illustration is complete he cuts the paper from the wooden board.In February 2017 he was the featured speaker, author, and illustrator at Nepal's first children's literature festival, Bal Sahitya Mahotsav.\nMarcus Pfister lives with his wife Debora in Bern, Switzerland. \n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Awards ==\n1988: Schweizer Jugendbuchpreis, Nominationlist\n1992: Christopher Award\n1993: Critici in Erba Prize\n1993: 1.

          "This is another great place to visit in Switzerland. This cave features a massive waterfall, the you can follow inside the mountain. Tickets are not very expensive (14 per person), considering what an amazing experience it gives you. I recommend it.",
          "A bit overpriced, but it's a nice cave with different formations and waterfalls inside. It's almost a km to walk, which takes about an hour with reading the signs and taking photos if you're interested. They have a nice terrasse where you \u2026",
          "A Place to see . We loved it. Outside waterfall and very beautiful cave. Highly recommended",
          "Beautiful, Wonderful inside and out side the caves .  Temperature would be 8*C to10*C in side the cave May required warm clothing in side the caves.",
          "Worth a visit. Very unrealistic biews",
          "At around a kilometer deep, the St. Beatus Caves run directly into a Swiss Mountain side. Depending on your pace it will take about an hour to traverse them. You will find handy informational signs that point you where to go, and while right in some places I never found it uncomfortable.",
          "The cave route through the mountain is an easy walk. The temperature inside is cool, but some might find it cold. If you walk to the very end, then you may get a little cold on the way back. Some sections require heads to be low down. Great day trip, would definitely recommend.",
          "Beautiful waterfall outside the cave, and very I interesting cave on the inside. Cave is fairly old and has a waterfall inside, so rock developments are unique. Very simple path to walk. Somewhat chilly (about 8-10\u00b0C, so bring a jacket if you need one). Path is somewhat wet at times so bring hiking shoes if you think you might slip.",

Took us about 45 minutes to walk all the way into the cave (while stopping and admiring along the way), 15 minutes to walk out. I\u2019d recommend about 1.5-2 hours here. You can skip the museum entrance afterwards... you are not missing much.",

The cave is very long. You can only see about 1/3 of the cave if any.  Nothing really wow me from inside the cave but was nice just to explore.  Not expensive.",

          "Went in spring, and it was very enjoyable. So few people allowed you to really take your time. Well worth a stop, but be prepared to climb some stairs and hills. All manageable (I had my nearly 60 year old mom with me, and she had no \u2026",

          "Very nicely maintained and a good option close to Interlaken for a rainy day activity. The temperature inside is around 8-10 degrees C so ensure you wear warm clothes. Takes about 1.5 hours to go till the end and come back. \n\nThe resturant \u2026",

Children friendly dinosaurs theme playing ground with grill place, restaurant, coffee an a magical scenery - what needs more for a short trip. Reachable via bus, ship from Thun or car(parking spots very limited).",

In agreement, cant believe they charge 10CHF for our dog but free for our son who clearly enjoyed 10 times more. If you don't have the francs for the parking we didn't, you can pay at the ticket office.",

          "Gorgeous entrance, bit of a walk up if you\u2019re out of shape, reasonable cost compared to most sights in Switzerland.\n\nThe caves took about 1.5 hours total to see out and back. Spent 2 hours total here including the hike up the hill!",
          "Just an amazing place where you can see the creativity of the Creator \u201cAllah\u201d. The stalagmites and castles in this cave are spectacular with all sense. It\u2019s a must to visit this place without a doubt.",
          "Incredible Area. The caves have been dug out very far and the workers do a great job win the lights within so you can see the running waters. There\u2019s even a secret trail to the left of the attraction that will take you up very high for great pics of the mountains across the lake.",

          "Great place to stay during the heat of the day. It's about 8-10 degrees down in the caves. You can be in and out in an hour or so. Dogs cost 10CHF which is a bit expensive, but other than that the walk is worth the 18CHF pp. Photos are not for commercial use.",
          "As tourist caves go, this is nice. There are tours, or you can go through at your own pace by getting a token on the way in. It's possible to get there from Interlaken via boat (free with a Swiss Rail pass) and a bit of walking, or the 21 bus.",

          "Nice place to visit one should not miss when you visit Interlaken.",
          "Great experience. Nice to see",
          "Nature's  creation  and beautiful place to visit",
          "Well detailed with electronic signs, water running through cave was a rather distinct feature, gorgeous walkway to the caves, a little bit of climbing to the entrance and throughout the cave, and the cave itself was long enough. All that was well worth the price.",
          "It was very good, the only issue is that towards the end we we're rushed out due to rising water due to recent rain and existing run off. Overall I would recommend to others.",
          "It has very nice view",
          "Beautiful views outside,  but nothing special inside the caves.",
          "Lovely hike from the parking to the caves, a little less than 30 mins at a leisurely pace. The caves themselves are huge but not very interesting 10mins in. The waterfall however is magnificent.",
          "Awesome cave system.  You walk up the side of the mountain and over the waterfalls  then follow the river into the cave.  Restaurant on top is pricey but has amazing views.  Would love to go again!",
          "Very big and beautiful cave. Worth to go. The scenery outside the cave is outstanding. The view over the lake and the small climb to the cave itself is great.  The cave itself is long and the direction to walk is clearly seen. Parking you need to pay.",
          "Cool place to see and enjoy the nature in its own time without any rush.",
          "'twas an amazing experience. Dress warm or bring jacket as it is cold inside the cave. The scenery outside is beautiful. There is also a museum where you can stop by.",
          "Disapointed, will not recomend to anyone.45min waiting for ticket. Not too much to see in cave, few stalagmits. Blue screens disaster for cave.",
          "Very nice place. Impression of nature. And wonderful images",
          "At\u00e9 1.900 anos atr\u00e1s, dizia-se que um terr\u00edvel drag\u00e3o aprontava diabruras numa grande caverna no Lago Thun. O \u00fanico a conseguir afugentar o drag\u00e3o foi o monge errante irland\u00eas Beatus. Hoje, o maravilhoso mundo das grutas pode ser visitado \u2026",
          "Beautiful place to visit! The sheer power of the water is astounding! The guided tour is worth catching (its provided at no extra cost to your entrance ticket) & is provided in many languages including English. Visit here! If you drive, \u2026",
          "Loved it, nice experience for the whole family and kids can get exposed to new nature creation phenomenon",
          "Nice scenic place with great water falls and Crystal clear water....",
          "Great walk and nice place",
          "It was wery interesting to visit this cool place.",
          "If you\u2019re into photography, then this cave with Low light setting is a must place to go, set your tripod for Long exposure. I flew my drone here to capture a very cinematic view. There will be a lot of people in the afternoon so better come early",
          "Still a pretty nice spot in the Bernese Oberland. Entry price is fair. The caves are beautiful and impressive. The way is approx. 900m long and elevates about 100m. Warm clothing is recommended. \nThe playground outside is worth a visit as well. Don\u2018t forget to visit the museum!",
          "Awesome place to explore. I would highly advise coming very early in the morning before the caves fill up with people to enjoy the atmosphere. Lots of interesting formations but not many stalactites or stalagmites if that's what you're \u2026",
          "Easy way. But before you go here, you need at least 2 sleeved clothes. Otherwise, you will run back to the entrance like I did. You can bring your dogs, but have to pay.",
          "Longest cave, lots of features and flowing water.",
          "An amazing experience, I enjoyed my time there, well maintained, reasonable ticket price, easy to get in and out, informative application that you can download",
          "Not the best cave I've been in but a really nice attraction and worth the short trip from Interlaken.",
          "Great cave and amazing pizza lol",
          "A 1.4 mile round trip walk into the caves, well lit, and very informative . Views from the top were incredible.",
          "Kids would love to visit. Make sure to wear warm clothes",
          "Really nice place to visit",
          "Well worth visiting, the views of the waterfalls as you climb, to the view across the lake from the top.",
          "Such an intricate cave network. The place was so cool and the walking paths were well laid out. There were lights at various spots. There is a river flowing inside.",
          "Very nice Caves. Use swiss digital travel pass stp. For 2 tickets at cost of one.",
          "Amazing experience and a breathtaking view. Definitely a must if you're near the area. I was worried about being cold but it was not as bad as I thought it would be (wore long sleeve and shorts in July). Howevere do wear proper shoes as it \u2026",
          "Beautiful very cold.",
          "Arrived by boat. Didn't know that we had a very steep way ahead. 30 minute hike to get to the caves. Take good comfortable hiking shoes! The cave itself was nice but not spectacular. The 75 min guided tour was in English and German. You enjoy the way down much better and have time to take nice pictures.",
          "Be prepared for a climb to get there, but it is a beautiful hike and so worth it when you arrive. While other caves may be more dramatic with stalagmites and stalagmtites, the fast moving water and numerous waterfalls makes the cave unique. \u2026",
          "Very nice spot. You must see",
          "Thought the place has a great infrastructure inside, the limestone formation is ok.... The guided tour is informative, tough there is no much information to be shared.\n\nThe guide could be given a mix set. The surrounding noises is quiet loud at places and it was difficult for her to communicate.",
          "Stunning views. Very restricted parking so get there early",
          "Spectacular natural caves. Geology in action.",
          "If you like cave  you can not miss this",
          "Super nice but Swiss like very pricey",
          "These caves are spectacular and I absolutely worth a visit. But because of all the infrastructure added to the cave, (concrete, electrical cables, lighting and control panels) I just can't give it 5 stars. The cave felt very overdeveloped, \u2026",
          "this attraction is onerous for old people. To reach the entrance we should walk like 6 or 7 floors without escalators or elevator.",
          "Amazing Historical Place! Free tour of 45minutes with small information you cant get elsewhere, narrow caves. Pretty cold inside as fresh air circulation is taking place. Fascinating staglamites and staglatites to be witnessed.\n\nLittle \u2026",
          "Amazing place.. Walked till the end and loved it.",
          "Very cool!  Excellent tour guide (she gave the tour in three different languages to our group!)!  The stairs to get up to the cave entrance are very intimidating and tough (quantity and steepness).  Be prepared for that, we weren't, but it was worth it.",
          "Fun for the whole family.  Best if your kids are a bit older than 2 maybe.  A kid backpack won't fit under some of the low arches.",
          "Beautiful but not a special cave",
          "Excellent place, enterance is an expensive 18 CHF",
          "Good choice, if you have a free day:)",
          "Beautifully maintained and an enjoyable walk through the cave for almost one kilometre",
          "It is a very nice place, we were impressed. You have to be well dressed inside it is cold and a lot of humidity. the visit can be guided or by your own, I recommend the guided one, they explain everything very well in English and German. In \u2026",
          "Beautiful place. The waterfall is splendid. The car park machine only takes coins. Around 3 francs for 4 hours. Only a short walk through the wood to the reception. Depending on the time of the day there can be a queue to buy tickets to visit the cave. ",
          "Very friendly and calm. A good day out to relax.",
          "Very good experience. The walkway through the caves is long but worth the effort. It is spacious a d well lit. There are several fascinating sights.",
          "On a hot day, the Caves are Great. Take Bus 21 from Interlaken. Travel light, caves entrance is 5 minutes climb. Bring jacket Very cold inside. Wear nonslip shoes. Ticket deals for group and family. Avoid snack bar, ... see Nature and avoid the food.",
          "Grand view and nice place",
          "Fun place to escape the rain. The weather took an unfortunate turn so in place of a hike, we headed for the cave.\n\nIt's a fascinating history and though the tour was a bit dry, I still recommend it. Path is very well defined so you can't explore independently but still allows you to go pretty deep! Also points for free wifi!",
          "I don't recall ever going this deep into any caves in my life, we had to stop going further as it wasn't that convenient since our 3 years old son was with us and had to be carried all the way as you'd imagine, having a stroller was allowed \u2026",
          "Very nice cave",
          "A heavenly place!",
          "Really nice day trip to see some caves. Reasonably priced. Went on the tour and learned some local knowledge. Great for photos and the length of the cave takes about an hour and a half to explore.",
          "Nice place.",
          "A must for your visit here. It\u2019s a hike on top of another hike. Lots of stairs and uneven ground. Strapped our 5 month old to us and trekked through it. Recommend jackets for all through the cave. Was eerie to walk through without a guide and not many in the cave but worth it to go all the way to the end.",
          "Incredible to witness such a treasure. Do not take a guided tour. Not worth it. Use the app and listen instead. Lots of walking up steep hills and might be difficult for persons compromised physically in any way. Need $ for parking also.",
          "Nice place to discover. Nice view from top and inside. Amazing view of the lake from top of the entrance.",
          "It was a nice experience, could click some immaculate shots . But the cave was closed in Nov , please make sure it\u2019s opened before you go from Interlaken . Nevertheless the trip is worth as it won\u2019t take too long .",
          "This is a fantastic outing...steep climb to the top and extensive cave system. Do not plan to eat at the top as the prices are ridiculous. The views are spectacular. Parking is tricky; pass the street parking as there is a lot just around the corner.",
          "Wonderful stop. The caves are impressive. It was very crowded and busy, but worth the visit. Please hit the like button, if you enjoyed my review. Thank you :)",
          "Very beautiful area. Cold and long caves. Be ready to climb the mountain to the caves or just use the train. Kids under 6 years free to access.",
          "Definitely a must go !",
          "Great cave system and value!",
          "Very beautiful place!",
          "The view from the top is awesome! Don't forget to stop by an visit the area if you're going that way. It won't take more than 30 or 45 minutes. By the way, the ticket for the cave was very expensive (about 20 CHF per person) and we didn't visit the it.",
          "Super cool place on a hot day",
          "Caves well maintained.",
          "A beautiful long long cave with water fall inside and well preparing trail. This was by history a place where St. Beatus live together with dragon. The cave is near by the Interlarken and reach there by bus from Thun.",
          "Really well maintained and lit cave system. Not too crowed. Tour guides available. Really ridiculous NO TRIPOD rule for photographers. I snuck mine in anyway. I traveled half way around the world...I'm getting my shots. Enjoy the cell phone pics but my real pics are so much better with my tripod lol!!",
          "Great place to visit and cool down on a hot summer day. It is always 8 - 10C  in the cave . So you need a light long sleeve jacket.",
          "Have seen better places",
          "The Guide explains a lot in German and only says an abbreviated version in English.  Other than that, very great place.  The restaurant outside has the best view!",
          "It's okay-ish.",
          "Awesome view average food. But worth the climb.",
          "Parking facility is pour. Climbing hill is a bit hard specially with young children.",
          "Entrance to cave is a bit of hike. The staff is friendly. Dont forget to bring your pull overs or something warm to wear as the temperature inside cave can get low. The height of the caves is decent enough so a person of say 5 8 can walk \u2026",
          "Huge cave system with amazing waterfalls, large rooms, interesting facts and some plant life to check out. Also naturally cool which is nice to escape the heat in summer",

          "Worth a visit if in the area. Has a free guided tour included. Lots of stalagmites and stalactites and intersting rock formations",
          "If you travel by train from Bern you need to reach Thun and from there you need to catch a bus. In 30 mins you will reach the entrance to the caves. The view on the way to the entrance (the lake) is fantastic.  You will probably spend about \u2026",
          "The hike to the top of the mountain to get to the cave was just as fun as the cave itself. Great activity for a rainy day.",
          "Such a wonderful place\ud83d\udc96",
          "It's a steep but short walk to the caves but well worth it. The waterfall outside the caves is worth the visit alone with such stunning views over the lake!",

          "Great place to see the formation of limestones in a beautiful shapes resembling dagger. Nice view from outside the cave.",
          "OMG this place is just stunning. The moment you get off the car, everything is great, the walk up, the view up and down, but the really cool place is in the caves, it is just mind blowing gorgeous",
          "Well organized place, with very interesting guided tour and museum. Not much variety on stalactites and stalagmites in the cave, however their number is enough to get a comprehensive picture of geological processes in the cave.\nIt worths a visit.",
          "Really interesting cave network, they have a guided tour available but we didn't take it.  Make sure to take a coat as it is cold inside.",
          "If you get there via the boat, there's quite a bit of uphill walking, but it is so worth it! The views over Lake Thun are spectacular, the caves are beautiful, and to sit and have lunch after the adventures while looking out over the lake \u2026",

          "It's very nice inside, a long and amazing walk. In my opinion, there is just one problem: you need to go up a loooottt, and only there you know the prices (that are quite expensive), so even if you don't want to go anymore, you \"have to\" \u2026",
          "Very interesting and informative",
          "Worth a visit from Interlaken. It's situated in Thun and is good to spend around 2 hrs here",

          "Be careful you have to do a lot of walking and going up to the entrace of the cave. The views are outstanding from the top but the cave is nothing special. I think you can walk half of it and come back, not much to see different as you go deeper into the cave.",
          "Amazing views",
          "Amazing place you have to first climb up the stairs for at least 1.5 km and them again walk in side the cave for around 1.5 km. You should defiantly go till the end it\u2019s worth it",
          "The climb is steep for people who find it  difficult to  walk. Need a separate ticket . Swiss pass is not valid. No discount.",
          "Great experience. The museum is not a great one, and they really overcharge for the food. But the views from outside and inside the cave are amazing.  Bring a jacket even if it's hot outside. ",

          "Beautifull & cheap place on Suiza",
          "It was nice to visit, not mega impressive but still enjoyable. It's easily possible to do without the guided tour. \nThe end of the caves is actually worth it. ",

          "Though 800+ meter deep it is far from worth the entrance fee.",
          "St beatus, slayer of dragons. Great cave about 900 metres worth. Can get very crowded",
          "A great place to explore, the tour was fairly limited in detail but still informative and entertaining. It's about 800m from start to finish, but then the same amount back and there is a bit of a walk to get up. ",

          "We didn\u2019t take a tour with their guide. We went our own pace and it took us about 2 hours to explore the caves and the museum. The admission ticket is quite expensive, but everything is expensive in Switzerland in my opinion so that doesn\u2019t stop me from visiting a unique place like this.",
          "Very interesting place (thanks atlasobscura.com!). The cave system is relatively \"new\" compared to most famous caves (see Postumia) but there's a lot to see, more than 10 \"rooms\" and an amazing view over the lake Thun. Very recommended.",

          "Nothing wrong with the management but you're better off saving your time and money for other things. Very underwhelming!",
          "Not unique and easy for old people. Good for sending sometime.",
          "The route to get there is amazing and the view from the restaurant is spectacular as well, though the number of tables with view are limited. The length of the cave is just perfect, you can go alone or take the guided tour.",
          "The location is simply amazing. It's right next to Thun lake and the landscape is mind-blowing. The lion sculpture is not that great but the hike and caves are amazing. The temperature inside the cave is chilling and that adds a lot to the \u2026",
          "Highly recommend",
          "Top experience",
          "There's parking nearby, it's not free and it's a steep but short hike to the entrance. Entrance fee of CHF18 is worth it considering how you can go on a guided tour through the beautiful caves, includes a free visit to the small museum and allows you to purchase a whole pizza which you can share at CHF14.",
          "Beautiful place . You have to hike to the top",
          "Marvelous natural caves with a free guided tour. Worth half day trip.",

        "wiki": "The Bellevue Palace is a five-star luxury hotel located in the Old City of Bern, Switzerland. Owned by the Swiss Confederation, it is the state's guesthouse for visiting heads of state and government, and is host to dozens of members of parliament during the weeks the assembly is in session.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe original Bellevue Palace was built by the financier Friedrich Osswald in 1865 immediately adjacent to the seat of the federal government, the Bundeshaus. His heirs had the hotel torn down and rebuilt it in 1910 in the neoclassical style. The new Bellevue Palace was reopened in 1913, and General Ulrich Wille made it Switzerland's military headquarters during World War I. During World War II, the hotel remained open for business. It became a focal point of the warring powers' diplomatic and intelligence activities in Switzerland, and its bar was a haunt of OSS station chief Allen Dulles. One half of the restaurant came to be frequented by Allied guests and the other by patrons from Axis states.\nAfter the war, the hotel's fortunes declined sharply. To prevent the state hotel from being acquired by foreign buyers, the Swiss National Bank acquired it in 1976, and in 1994 made a gift of it to the Confederation, which retains 99.7% of the hotel's shares. After it became apparent that the Bellevue Palace was in need of an overhaul, as it lacked amenities such as air conditioning, it was closed in 2002 for a one-year renovation that cost CHF 40 million and cut the number of rooms from 230 to 130. Following a spate of bad publicity over low staff wages, the Confederation turned over the management to a chain of Swiss luxury hotels in 2007.The Bellevue Palace has been host to a great number of heads of state and government, including Winston Churchill, Mikhail Gorbachev, Jawaharlal Nehru, Queen Elizabeth II and Emperor Akihito. When it was used as a negotiating venue in the Helsinki process during the Cold War, some participants called it \"the best-protected building in Europe\" due to its array of security features and extensive police protection. Parts of John le Carr\u00e9's spy novel Smiley's People and its TV adaption are set in the Bellevue Palace. In Swiss politics, the hotel's bar and lounge are known to be the site of much late-night political  horse trading during parliamentary sessions, such as arranging elections of Federal Councillors.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nApart from ballrooms, restaurants, salons, bars and conference facilities, the Bellevue Palace features an array of suites, including an extensive \"Presidential Suite\" with a view of the Bernese Alps over the Aare. The hotel's cuisine is rated at 16 Gault Millau points. Frommer's Switzerland describes the Bellevue Palace as \"the grand old dame of Bern\" and \"the most lavish and opulent choice in town\", opining that \"dining on the renowned Bellevue Terrace is one of the reasons to come to Bern.\" The hotel is a member of the Leading Hotels of the World association.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

Its Old City, one of the best-maintained in Switzerland, sits on a small rocky hill above the valley of the Sarine.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nThe region around Fribourg has been settled since the Neolithic period, although few remains have been found. These include some flint tools found near Bourguillon, as well as a stone hatchet and bronze tools. A river crossing was located in the area during the Roman Era. The main activity in the Swiss plateau bypassed the area to the north, however, and was instead centered around the valley of the river Broye and Aventicum. Therefore, only a few remains from the Roman era have been found in Fribourg. These include the traces of a wall foundation on the plains near P\u00e9rolles.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nThe town was founded in 1157 by Berthold IV, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen. Its name is derived from German frei (free) and Burg (fort). Its most ancient part is conveniently located on a former peninsula of the river Sarine, protected on three sides by steep cliffs. The easily defended city helped the Dukes of Z\u00e4hringen to strengthen and extend their power in the Swiss plateau in the area between the Aare and La Sarine.Beginning at the time of its inception, Fribourg built a city-state; initially, the land it controlled lay some distance away. When the dukes of Z\u00e4hringen died out in 1218, the city was transferred to the related Kyburg family. They granted the city its former privileges and wrote the municipal laws in the so-called Handfeste in 1249, in which the legal, institutional and economic organizations were established. Several treaties with neighbouring city-states, including Avenches (1239), Berne (1243), and Morat (Murten) (1245), were signed at this time.\nThe city was sold to the Habsburgs in 1277. Trade and industry began as early as the mid-13th century. In the early period, Fribourg consisted of four distinct inner city districts: Burg, Au, La Neuveville, and Spital. The city developed rapidly, which led to its first expansion: the Burg district expanded to the west in 1224, a town was established across the river in 1254, and in 1280 development began near Place Python. These expansions reflect the economic boom in Fribourg. The 14th century was dominated by trade, and cloth and leather production, which brought the city renown in Central Europe by 1370. In 1339, Fribourg participated alongside the Habsburgs and the County of Burgundy in the Battle of Laupen against Bern and its Swiss Confederacy allies.\n\nThe treaty with Bern was renewed in 1403. The leaders of the city began a territorial acquisition, in which they gradually brought more nearby land under their control. This laid the ground-work for the Canton of Fribourg. By 1442 the city had control of all the land within about 20 kilometres (12 mi), on both sides of the Saane. It was therefore directly controlled by the city leaders, not by any intermediate administration.\nThe mid-15th century was shaped by various military conflicts. First, considerable losses in a war against Savoy had to be made good. The Savoyard influence on the city grew, and the Habsburgs ceded it to them in 1452. It remained under the control of Savoy until the Burgundian Wars in 1477. As an ally of Bern, Fribourg participated in the war against Charles I of Burgundy, thereby bringing more land under its control.\nAfter the city was released from the sphere of influence of Savoy, it attained the status of Free Imperial City in 1478. The city and its canton joined the Swiss Confederation in 1481, and has long influenced Swiss and European Catholicism. In the 16th century, Fribourg continued to grow, first following the invasion of Waadtland (Pays de Vaud) in 1536 with the help of Bern, and then in 1554 through the annexation of land formerly controlled by the Count of Greyerz (Gruy\u00e8re).\n\nSeveral prominent families developed as a result of the cloth and leather trade, beginning in the 14th century, including Gottrau, Lanthen, Affry, Diesbach (originally from Bern), von der Weid, Fegeli, and Weck. Together with the local nobles (the Maggenberg, D\u00fcddingen/Velga, Montenach, Englisberg and Praroman families) they formed the 15th century patrician class. This contributed to the decline of the cloth trade, however, as the families involved in the industry began to be more concerned with governing the city and its surrounding possessions.\nAn important milestone for the politics of the city was reached in 1627, when the patricians drew up a new constitution, in which they declared that they were the only people capable of ruling the city, and thereby took control of all voting rights. This consolidated the oligarchy which had begun to form as early as the 15th century.\n\n\n=== Importance of monasteries and churches in Fribourg ===\nThe monasteries of Fribourg have always formed a centre of religious culture, which includes architecture, sculpture and painting, and have contributed to the culture of the city. The Franciscan monastery was donated by Jakob von Riggisberg in 1256. In early times, it was closely associated with the city council, because it housed the city archives and its monastery church was used for town meetings until 1433.\n\nSimilarly, the Augustinian monastery was founded in the mid-13th century, and enjoyed the support of the noble Velga family for a long time. Additionally, La Maigrauge Abbey has existed since 1255, and has belonged to the Cistercians since 1262. An important institution was the public hospital, opened in the mid-13th century, which provided services for the poor.During the Reformation, Fribourg remained Catholic, although it was nearly surrounded by the Protestant Bern. This led to repeated conflicts over religion in border regions, and in areas controlled jointly by Fribourg and Bern. The city was a major centre of the Counter-Reformation. At the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th, new monasteries were established in the city, including: a Capuchin monastery (1608), another on Bisemberg (1621), an Ursuline monastery (1634), and a Visitandine monastery (1635). The most influential monastery, however, was that of the Jesuits, which contributed to a large extent to the advancement and prosperity of the city. It established the College of Saint Michael in 1582, the theological faculty of which formed the basis of the University of Fribourg. The concept of an objective press was also begun by the Jesuits.In 1613 Fribourg became the seat of the Bishop of Lausanne, who, after the Reformation, was forced first into Evian, and then into exile in Burgundy. Today it is the seat of the Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg.\n\n\n=== 1780\u20131809 ===\n\nThe strong patrician regime, consisting of no more than 60 families, filled all of the influential positions in the city and dominated all political, social, economic and cultural arenas of Fribourg. On several occasions unhappy citizens joined together to attempt a revolt, including in 1781 under the leadership of Pierre-Nicolas Chenaux. These revolts were repressed with the help of Bern and Bernese troops. The invasion of Switzerland by French troops in 1798 led to the downfall of this Ancien R\u00e9gime. Fribourg capitulated to the French on 2 March and relinquished leadership of its lands. This freed the way for the first municipal elections, in which Jean de Montenach was elected the first mayor. With the introduction of the Act of Mediation under Napoleon in 1803, the separation of the city of Fribourg from its Canton was finally carried out. Fribourg was made the capital of its region and Canton, and, between 1803 and 1809, was one of the capitals of Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Sonderbund ===\nThe patricians regained control of the city in 1814 during the Restoration period. They ruled until 1830. Its leadership was followed by a new and more liberal constitution. Fribourg was part of the 1845-1847 Sonderbund, a \"separate alliance\" of Catholic cantons attempting to secede from Switzerland. Fribourg and the Sonderbund capitulated to Federalist forces under General Dufour on 14 November 1847 in what amounted to a brief and nearly bloodless Swiss civil war. Since 1848, the new national constitution and the amendment to the Canton constitution has guaranteed every citizen the right to vote.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\nThe later 19th and the 20th century brought about drastic changes to the city's culture and physical nature. In 1848 the city wall was partially torn down and a new bridge constructed across the Saane/La Sarine. The opening of the midland railway line through the city in 1862 led to the development of a \"railway station quarter\" of the city. The improved transportation enabled Fribourg to undergo industrialisation. The city centre shifted from the Old City to the new Train Station quarter. Extensive areas in P\u00e9rolles, Beauregard and Vignettaz were developed with industry or houses around 1900. The inauguration of the University in 1889 was an important event in Fribourg. Another economic boon to the city was the opening of the nearby A12 highway.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\nFribourg has an elevation of 581 metres (1,906 ft) (in the Old City), and is situated 28 kilometres (17 mi) southwest of Bern. It is located on the Swiss plateau, and extends on both sides of the Sarine, which, in the vicinity of Fribourg, has cut deeply into the molasse. The Old City is located on a hill, only about 100 metres (330 ft) wide, which rises about 40 metres (130 ft) above the valley floor. Most quarters of the city are located on the High Plateau and the surrounding hills, which have an average elevation of 620 metres (2,030 ft). The valley floor is only settled in the area immediately around the Old City.\nFribourg has an area, as of 2009, of 9.3 square kilometers (3.6 sq mi).  Of this area, 1.25 km2 (0.48 sq mi) or 13.4% is used for agricultural purposes, while 1.58 km2 (0.61 sq mi) or 17.0% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 5.89 km2 (2.27 sq mi) or 63.3% is settled (buildings or roads), 0.53 km2 (0.20 sq mi) or 5.7% is either rivers or lakes and 0.07 km2 (17 acres) or 0.8% is unproductive land.\n\nOf the built up area, industrial buildings made up 4.5% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 34.5% and transportation infrastructure made up 15.2%.  Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 1.6% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 7.5%.  Out of the forested land, 14.4% of the total land area is heavily forested and 2.6% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees.  Of the agricultural land, 6.9% is used for growing crops and 6.0% is pastures.  Of the water in the municipality, 1.7% is in lakes and 4.0% is in rivers and streams.The area of the municipality, which is relatively small for a city, covers an area of Molasse in the central part of Canton of Fribourg. The area is cut through from south to north by the tightly wound Saane/La Sarine, which has eroded a valley, in some places, to a depth of 100 metres (330 ft) below the surrounding Plateau. In general, the valley floor is between 200 and 500 metres (660 and 1,640 ft) wide. Le Lac de P\u00e9rolles, formed as a reservoir by Maigrauge Dam, the first Gravity Dam in Europe, in 1872, is located south of the city. The head of the Schiffenensee is located just 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) north of the city. At both of these artificial lakes, La Sarine covers nearly the entire valley floor.\nThe hills flanked on both sides by steep, largely wooded, slopes. To the east, the municipality reaches up the slopes of Mount Sch\u00f6nberg, which, with an elevation of 702 metres (2,303 ft), is the highest point in Fribourg. The river Galtera, also deeply cut into the plateau, flows between the mountain and the river, emptying into the Saane/La Sarine near the Old City.\nThe former village of Bourguillon lies within the municipality. Fribourg borders on D\u00fcdingen and Tafers to the east, Pierrafortscha to the southeast, Marly to the south, Villars-sur-Gl\u00e2ne and Givisiez to the west, and Granges-Paccot to the north.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is Azure a Castle embattled and towered on dexter issuant from a Semi Annulet all Argent.The canton and the capital share the same name but have different coats of arms.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\n\n=== Government ===\nThe Municipal Council (French: Conseil communal de la Ville de Fribourg, German: Gemeinderat) constitutes the executive government of the City of Fribourg and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of five councilors (French: Conseiller communal / Conseill\u00e8re communale, German: Gemeinderat / Gemeinder\u00e4tin), each presiding over a directorate comprising several departments and the related commissions. The president of the executive department acts as mayor (syndic). In the mandate period 2016\u20132021 (la l\u00e9gislature) the Municipal Council is presided by Monsieur le Syndic Pierre-Alain Cl\u00e9ment. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the General Council (parliament) are carried by the Municipal Council. The regular election of the Municipal Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every five years. Any resident of Fribourg allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. Due to the constitution by canton of Fribourg not only Swiss citizen have the right to vote and elect and being elected on communal level, but also foreigners with a residence permit of type C and being resident in the canton of Fribourg for at least 5 years. The current mandate period is from 1 June 2016 to 31 May 2021. The delegates are selected by means of a system of Proporz. The mayor is elected as such by a public election while the heads of the other directorates are assigned by the collegiate. The executive body holds its meetings in the Town Hall (L'H\u00f4tel de Ville), in the old city on Place de l'H\u00f4tel-de-Ville.As of 2016, Fribourg's Municipal Council is made up of two representatives of the PS/SP (Social Democratic Party, of whom one is also the mayor), and one each of PDC/CVP (Christian Democratic Party), PCS/CSP (Christian Social Party), and PLR/FDP (Les Lib\u00e9raux-Radicaux), giving the left parties a majority of three out of five seats. The last election was held on 28 February 2016.\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\n\nThe General Council (French: Conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, German: Generalrat), the city parliament, holds legislative power. It is made up of 80 members, with elections held every five years. The General Council decrees regulations and by-laws that are executed by the Municipal Council and the administration. The delegates are selected by means of a system of proportional representation.\nThe sessions of the General Council are public. Unlike members of the Municipal Council, members of the General Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Fribourg allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the General Council. Due to the constitution by canton of Fribourg not only Swiss citizen have the right to vote and elect and being elected on communal level, but also foreigners with a residence permit of type C and being resident in the canton of Fribourg for at least 5 years. The Parliament holds its meetings in the Grande salle de la Maison de Justice, in the old city on rue des Chanoines 1.The last regular election of the General Council was held on 28 February 2016 for the mandate period (la l\u00e9gislature) from 1 June 2016 to 31 May 2021. Currently the General Council consist of 30 members of the Social Democratic Party (PS/SP), 15 Christian Democratic People's Party (PDC/CVP), 10 The Liberals (PLR/FDP), 9 Swiss People's Party (UDC/SVP), 8 Green Party (PES/GPS), 5 Centre Gauche (PCS/CSP), and one each for the Green Liberal Party (PVL/GLP), Movement libre et ind\u00e9pendante (MLI), and Parti des artistes.\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n\n\n==== National Council ====\nIn the 2015 federal election for the Swiss National Council the most popular party was the PS/SP which received 36.3% of the vote. The next four most popular parties were the PDC/CVP (22.5%), the UDC/SVP (13.8%), the Green Party (9.8%), and the FDP/PLR (8.7%). In the federal election, a total of 9.795 voters were cast, and the voter turnout was 48.4%.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nFribourg has a population (as of December 2018) of 38,365.  As of 2008, 31.9% of the population are resident foreign nationals.  Over the last 10 years (2000\u20132010) the population has changed at a rate of 8.3%.  Migration accounted for 8.1%, while births and deaths accounted for 0.9%.Fribourg is the largest city in Canton Fribourg.  The population of Fribourg grew markedly at the beginning of the 20th century, as well as from 1930 to 1970. The maximum population of 42,000 was reached in 1974. Since then, there had been a population loss of approximately 14%, which might have recently reversed.\nThe population of the agglomeration around Fribourg is 110,000, or, counting only the most nearby suburbs, 75,000(2015). This includes the municipalities of Avry, Belfaux, Corminboeuf, Givisiez, Granges-Paccot, Marly, Matran and Villars-sur-Gl\u00e2ne.  Surrounding municipalities include Givisiez, Granges-Paccot, Villars-sur-Gl\u00e2ne, Marly, as well as Corminboeuf, Belfaux, Grolley, and stretches as far as D\u00fcdingen (French Guin) and Tafers (French Tavel) on the right bank of the Sarine.\nThe growth of the agglomeration around Fribourg has fused the city proper with the neighboring towns of Villars-sur-Gl\u00e2ne, Givisiez, and Granges-Paccot. The town of Klein-Sch\u00f6nberg, which belongs to Tafers, and the village of Uebewil, which belongs to D\u00fcdingen, are located right on the eastern edge of town. This settlement area itself has a population of 60,000(2015).\nAs of 2008, the population was 48.8% male and 51.2% female.  The population was made up of 12,080 Swiss men (31.8% of the population) and 6,475 (17.0%) non-Swiss men.  There were 13,855 Swiss women (36.4%) and 5,636 (14.8%) non-Swiss women.  Of the population in the municipality, 10,756 or about 30.3% were born in Fribourg and lived there in 2000.  There were 6,394 or 18.0% who were born in the same canton, while 7,164 or 20.2% were born somewhere else in Switzerland, and 8,981 or 25.3% were born outside of Switzerland.\n\nAs of 2000, children and teenagers (0\u201319 years old) make up 19.3% of the population, while adults (20\u201364 years old) make up 65.8% and seniors (over 64 years old) make up 14.9%.As of 2000, there were 17,825 people who were single and never married in the municipality.  There were 13,581 married individuals, 2,146 widows or widowers and 1,995 individuals who are divorced.As of 2000, there were 15,839 private households in the municipality, and an average of 2. persons per household.  There were 7,342 households that consist of only one person and 687 households with five or more people.  In 2000, a total of 15,409 apartments (87.0% of the total) were permanently occupied, while 1,757 apartments (9.9%) were seasonally occupied and 549 apartments (3.1%) were empty.  As of 2009, the construction rate of new housing units was 5.5 new units per 1000 residents.As of 2003 the average price to rent an average apartment in Fribourg was 1062.05 Swiss francs (CHF) per month (US$850, \u00a3480, \u20ac680 approx. exchange rate from 2003).  The average rate for a one-room apartment was 623.40 CHF (US$500, \u00a3280, \u20ac400), a two-room apartment was about 792.47 CHF (US$630, \u00a3360, \u20ac510), a three-room apartment was about 993.14 CHF (US$790, \u00a3450, \u20ac640) and a six or more room apartment cost an average of 1870.76 CHF (US$1500, \u00a3840, \u20ac1200).  The average apartment price in Fribourg was 95.2% of the national average of 1116 CHF.  The vacancy rate for the municipality, in 2010, was 1.45%.\n\n\n=== Historic population ===\nThe historical population is given in the following chart:\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nMost of the population (as of 2000) speaks French (22,603 or 63.6%) as their first language, German is the second most common (7,520 or 21.2%) and Italian is the third (1,359 or 3.8%).\nThere are 55 people who speak Romansh.\nFew inhabitants in village of Basse-Ville speak Bolze, a mixed language created from the blend of French and Swiss German. \nFribourg, the city and the canton, has two official languages, and French outweighs German as both the language of the local government and the most commonly spoken language in public discourse and business in the canton.\nFribourg has always been located on the Swiss language border, but at the time of the city's founding in the 12th century, German was the prevailing language. Although German was the official language of the city until 1800, French gradually became more influential. This was aided by industrialization, which led to an influx of French-speaking immigrants. Since the political changes of the late 18th century and early 19th century, the German-speaking population has been a minority. Even in German, the town is often called \"Fribourg\" instead of the Standard German \"Freiburg\", which helps distinguish it from Freiburg im Breisgau on the edge of the Black Forest, Germany. Another explanation is that in the local Alemannic German dialect, the city is called Fryb\u00f9rg or Friburg (pronounced: [\u02c8frib\u0325\u028ar\u0261]), from which the French name \"Fribourg\" was probably derived.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nFrom the 2000 census, 24,614 or 69.2% were Roman Catholic, while 2,763 or 7.8% belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church.  Of the rest of the population, there were 443 members of an Orthodox church (or about 1.25% of the population), there were 13 individuals (or about 0.04% of the population) who belonged to the Christian Catholic Church, and there were 668 individuals (or about 1.88% of the population) who belonged to another Christian church.  There were 62 individuals (or about 0.17% of the population) who were Jewish, and 1,676 (or about 4.71% of the population) who were Islamic.  There were 161 individuals who were Buddhist, 71 individuals who were Hindu and 43 individuals who belonged to another church.  2,843 (or about 8.00% of the population) belonged to no church, are agnostic or atheist, and 2,509 individuals (or about 7.06% of the population) did not answer the question.The city remained Catholic during the Reformation, and has since become a centre of Catholicism. It has a greater than average number of churches and monasteries. Fribourg has been the seat of the Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg since 1613. (See Sonderbund)\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n\n=== Development of trade and economy ===\nSeveral types of industry developed in Fribourg as early as the 13th and 14th centuries. The extension of the city along the east bank of the Saane/La Sarine made about this time was indicative of a strong economic upturn. In Galterntal, water power was used for various mills. Along the Saane new trade districts developed with the towns of Au, Neustadt and Matten.\nThe tanneries and cloth manufacturers, strengthened by widespread sheep raising, led to an economic boom in the 14th and 15th centuries. This helped Fribourg by making its trades well known throughout central Europe. A gradual decline in cloth making in the second half of the 15th century occurred as local farmers replaced their sheep with cattle. Other reasons for the collapse of the cloth industry in the 16th century include the fact that the guild refused to use new materials or modern styles, and that the social structure of the city changed with the rise of the patrician class.\nAfter this time, Fribourg was shaped by low-level trade, and was not industrialized until it was connected to the Swiss Railroad, beginning in the 1870s. After Lake P\u00e9rolles was built in 1872, energy was able to be supplied to the plateau south and west of the city. Thus, an industrial area developed there, dominated in its early years by a wagon factory and a lumber mill. Later, two breweries were established in this area. A chocolate factory was established in Vill\u00e2rs-sur-Gl\u00e2ne in 1901, but it came under Fribourg's jurisdiction in 1906 after a change of borders.\nIn the course of the 20th century, the plateau became the industrial section of the city. The development of new industrial areas in neighbouring municipalities, beginning in the 1970s, has permitted continued economic growth.\n\n\n=== Economic situation today ===\nAs of  2010, Fribourg had an unemployment rate of 4.9%.  As of 2008, there were 18 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 5 businesses involved in this sector.  3,821 people were employed in the secondary sector and there were 232 businesses in this sector.  21,614 people were employed in the tertiary sector, with 2,004 businesses in this sector.  There were 17,207 residents of the municipality who were employed in some capacity, of which females made up 47.1% of the workforce.\nIn 2008 the total number of full-time equivalent jobs was 20,099.  The number of jobs in the primary sector was 14, of which 4 were in agriculture, 8 were in forestry or lumber production and 1 was in fishing or fisheries.  The number of jobs in the secondary sector was 3,530 of which 1,744 or (49.4%) were in manufacturing, 9 or (0.3%) were in mining and 1,455 (41.2%) were in construction.  The number of jobs in the tertiary sector was 16,555.  In the tertiary sector; 2,633 or 15.9% were in wholesale or retail sales or the repair of motor vehicles, 993 or 6.0% were in the movement and storage of goods, 1,003 or 6.1% were in a hotel or restaurant, 568 or 3.4% were in the information industry, 957 or 5.8% were the insurance or financial industry, 1,535 or 9.3% were technical professionals or scientists, 3,273 or 19.8% were in education and 1,970 or 11.9% were in health care.Fribourg has more jobs than laborers, and is therefore a large commuter destination for the largely agricultural surrounding area. Local industry includes food and luxury products, drinks (the breweries are owned by the Danish firm Carlsberg), metal and machine construction, electronics, and computer technology.\nThe largest number of workers are active in the service industries. Many of these work in government administrative positions. Other important sectors are education (at the University), banks and insurance companies, tourism and restaurants, as well as health services. Fribourg is home to the administrative offices of several international companies. The Cantonal hospital is on the border with Villars-sur-Gl\u00e2ne.\nIn 2000, there were 16,572 workers who commuted into the municipality and 6,505 workers who commuted away.  The municipality is a net importer of workers, with about 2.5 workers entering the municipality for every one leaving.  Of the working population, 35% used public transportation to get to work, and 37.8% used a private car.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSchools at the compulsory and pre-university level are available in both French and German. The University is officially bilingual, meaning students are expected to have a passive knowledge of both languages, even though it is possible to graduate with a degree exclusively in either language, or both.

The connection to the Swiss motorway network was established in 1971 with the opening of the A12 motorway from Bern to Matran, which was extended in 1981 to Vevey. The Swiss east-west A1 from the West Bern bypasses the town to the north and west, only affecting the communities of T\u00e4lchen and Chamblioux. The access points of Fribourg-Sud and Fribourg-North are each about 3 km from the city centre.\n\n\n=== Railway ===\n\nThe connection to the railway network was accomplished in several stages from 1860. Initially, the railway line from Bern to Fribourg opened on 2 July 1860 with a temporary terminal at Balliswil about 4 km north of the city, as the Grandfey Viaduct over the Sarine valley was not yet finished. On 4 September 1862, the whole of the line from Balliswil to Lausanne via Fribourg opened, with a temporary station building at Fribourg railway station, until the permanent building opened in 1873. A line to Payerne opened on 25 August 1876 and to Morat on 23 August 1898.\n\n\n=== Public transport ===\n\nA funicular railway has been operated from the Neuveville district to the upper city since 1899 by the sewage works. The Fribourg funicular is one of the world's few remaining water-powered funiculars, and the only one powered by sewage water. The upper station is located at the sewage plant which pumps sewage water into the descending car, which makes it heavier than the ascending car. The sewage is released at the bottom.From 1897 to 1965 in Fribourg there was a 6-kilometre (3.7 mi) long tram network in operation, with the trams replaced from 1949 with the Fribourg trolleybus system. The current bus network is now operated by the Transports publics fribourgeois, with connections to Bulle, Avenches, Schmitten, Schwarzenburg and in the tourist region Schwarzsee.\n\n\n=== Airport ===\nThe regional Bern-Belp Airport is an hour away from the area.\n\n\n== Culture and tourism ==\n\nFribourg is a day trip destination for tourists who want to visit the sights of the city. These include the historic Old City with its Gothic Cathedral of Saint Nicholas renowned for its stained glass windows designed by J\u00f3zef Mehoffer, and the museums. The Natural History Museum was founded in 1873, and is now located in the natural sciences building at the University. The Museum of Art and History, located in the Ratz\u00e9hof since 1920, has exhibits on ancient and early history, sculpture and paintings, traditional tin figures, arts and crafts, as well as money and graphic collections. In the cathedral, a treasure chamber has been on display since 1992. Other museums include the Swiss Museum of Marionnettes, the Swiss Sewing Machine Museum, the Gutenberg Museum, the Bible and Orient Museum and a beer museum.\nCultural experiences include the festival of religious music, the international folklore convention, the jazz parade, an international film festival and Cin\u00e9plus (since 1972).\nLike its sister city Bern, Fribourg has preserved its medieval center as a whole that is now one of the largest in Europe. It is located on a spectacular peninsula, surrounded on three sides by the Saane/La Sarine. The architecture of the Old City date primarily from the Gothic period; it was built predominately before the 16th century. Most houses are built of the local molasse stone. Consisting of the neighborhoods Bourg, Auge and Neuveville, its old town is rich in fountains and churches dating from the 12th century until the 17th century. Its cathedral, reaching 76 metres (249 ft) in height, was built between 1283 and 1490.\nThe fortifications of Fribourg form the most important medieval military architecture of Switzerland: 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) of ramparts, 14 towers and one big bulwark. The protections are especially well preserved east and south of the city.\n\n\n== Heritage sites of national significance ==\nFribourg is home to 67 buildings or sites that are listed as Swiss heritage site of national significance.\nReligious Buildings: Cistercians Maigrauge Abbey with Library, the former Convent of the Augustinians, Former Commandry de Saint-Jean, Notre-Dame Basilica, Saint-Nicolas et Tr\u00e9sor Cathedral, Centre paroissial du Christe-Roi, Chapel de Lorette, Chapel Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy and Chapel de P\u00e9rolles, Convent of the Capucins, Convent of the Cordeliers, Convent of the Ursulines, Church of Saint-Pierre, Monast\u00e8re de la Visitation and Monast\u00e8re of the Capucines de Montorge\nSecular Buildings: Former H\u00f4tel des Postes et T\u00e9l\u00e9graphes, Centrale \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique de la Maigrauge, Cercle de la Grande Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, Chancellerie de l\u2019Etat, Poya Castle, Cure at Rue de la Lenda 1, Factory Complex of the Chocolats Villars company, Fortifications, Funiculaire Neuveville-Saint-Pierre, H\u00f4pital of the Bourgeois, H\u00f4tel de Ville, Immeuble de rapport Sallin, Les Arcades, Motta Swimming Pool and Vieille Village\nHouses and Private Buildings: Auberge de la Cigogne, House at Rue de la Neuveville 48, House at Rue d\u2019Or 7, House at Rue d\u2019Or 13, House d\u2019Alt at Place de l\u2019H\u00f4tel-de-Ville 1, House de Castella, House de F\u00e9gely-d\u2019Estavayer dite Vicarino, House de Fran\u00e7ois-Prosper de Castella, House de Gottrau dite Les Tornalettes, House de Jean-Fran\u00e7ois d\u2019Ammann de Macconens, House de Lanthen-Heid, House de Reyff, House de Reyff de Cugy, House de Techtermann, House de Nicolas Kuenlin, House des tanneurs Reyff, House F\u00e9gely (?) dite tannerie Deillon and Villa Mayer\nSchools: Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Michel, Universit\u00e9 Mis\u00e9ricorde\nArchives, Libraries and Museums: Archives de l\u2019Etat de Fribourg, Archives de la Ville de Fribourg, Cantonal and University Library, Grenier de Derri\u00e8re-Notre-Dame et Museum Gutenberg, Mus\u00e9e suisse des arts graphiques, Grenier de la Planche and H\u00f4tel Ratz\u00e9 et Museum d\u2019art et d\u2019histoire\nFountains: Fountain de la Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9, Fountain de la Force, Fountain de la Samaritaine, Fountain de la Vaillance, Fountain de Sainte-Anne, Fountain de Saint-Georges, Fountain de Saint-Jean, Fountain de Samson and Jo Siffert Fountain\nBridges: Pont de Bern, Pont de Saint-Jean, Pont du Gott\u00e9ron and Pont du Milieu\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe most popular sport club in the town is the ice hockey club HC Fribourg-Gott\u00e9ron, which plays in the National League (NL).

        "wiki": "Affoltern im Emmental is a municipality in the district of Trachselwald in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAffoltern is first mentioned in 1261/63 as Affolterra.The oldest trace of a settlement in the area comes from the Middle Ages.  The village church of St. Michael was first mentioned in 1275.  It remained a local chapel until 1484 when Teutonic Knights Commandry of Sumiswald provided funding for a permanent parish priest.  In 1528 Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and Affoltern converted.  However, the Commandry retained patronage rights over the church until 1698.\nBy the 18th century many local farmers were raising cattle for meat and milk in the rolling Emmental hills.  In 1764 the cheese exporting company Pionierbauern Sommer was founded in the municipality.  It remained in business for over a century before closing in 1869.  A cheese co-op opened in 1844 to support the local dairy farmers.  In the early 20th century the municipality remained fairly isolated and cheese producers and exporters began to leave for other communities.  Today about one-third of the jobs in Affoltern are in agriculture with the rest being in small manufacturers and service companies.  In 1990 a dairy center with a cheese making demonstrations opened.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAffoltern im Emmental has an area of 11.51 km2 (4.44 sq mi).  As of the 2005/06 survey, a total of 8.32 km2 (3.21 sq mi) or 72.3% is used for agricultural purposes, while 2.27 km2 (0.88 sq mi) or 19.7% is forested.   Of rest of the municipality 0.87 km2 (0.34 sq mi) or 7.6% is settled (buildings or roads) and 0.01 km2 (2.5 acres) or 0.1% is unproductive land.From the same survey, housing and buildings made up 4.3% and transportation infrastructure made up 2.4%.  All of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests.  Of the agricultural land, 42.2% is used for growing crops and  28.7% is pasturage, while 1.4% is used for orchards or vine crops.As indicated by the name Affoltern i.E. is situated in the Emmental. It is bordered by Walterswil, D\u00fcrrenroth, Sumiswald, R\u00fcegsau, Heimiswil and Wynigen. The well-known mountain Lueg is located in Affoltern.  The hamlets of Weier, Rinderbach, Eggerdingen, Heiligenland and Hirsegg belong to Affoltern im Emmental.\nOn 31 December 2009 Amtsbezirk Trachselwald, the municipality's former district, was dissolved.  On the following day, 1 January 2010, it joined the newly created Verwaltungskreis Emmental.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe name Affoltern is a derivation of the old German for apple-tree, \"Affal Tra\". The apple-tree features prominently in Affoltern's coat of arms, making it an example of canting arms.\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is Argent an Apple Tree eradicated Vert fructed Gules.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAffoltern im Emmental has a population (as of December 2018) of 1,101.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Adrian von Bubenberg (born c. 1434 in Bern; died August 1479 in Bern) was a Bernese knight, military commander and mayor (Schultheiss) of Bern in 1468-1469, 1473-1474 and 1477-1479. In Switzerland, he is remembered as the hero of the Battle of Murten.\n\n\n== Life ==\nAdrian von Bubenberg was born as the son of Heinrich IV. von Bubenberg, Schultheiss of Bern and lord of Spiez, whom he succeeded in 1465. During a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1466, he was dubbed a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre.\nNumerous times before and after the Burgundy wars, he led Bernese negotiations with other cantons of the old Swiss Confederacy and foreign powers including Savoy, Burgundy, France and the Holy Roman Empire. \nBut his heroic stature in Swiss history is due to his tenacious defense during the siege of Murten. He had been appointed commander of the city garrison in April 1476. The city was besieged during twelve days in June by the troops of Charles, Duke of Burgundy, and Bubenberg managed to hold until he was relieved by confederate forces on 22 June, leading to the decisive defeat of Charles.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nVon Bubenberg was buried in the choir of the Berner M\u00fcnster, the Cathedral of Bern. Ever having been short of funds in spite of being the head of Berne's preeminent noble house, von Bubenberg was posthumously banned for his debts in 1481, but the government resisted Pope Sixtus IV's demand that he be exhumed and dishonourably buried because of this.\n\nBubenberg's deeds figure already in the near-contemporary illustrated chronicles by Diebold Schilling the Elder. Later, he became an icon in Romantic nationalism, portrayed in literature as the ideal of knightly virtue and of  patriotism, notably in the novel  Ring i der Chetti by Rudolf von Tavel (1931).\nIn 1897, Bern honoured Bubenberg with a bronze statue on Christoffelplatz, which was renamed to   Bubenbergplatz on the occasion.  The design for the statue triggered a dispute on whether it was proper to show Bubenberg on foot rather than as a knight in an equestrian statue. \nThe statue was moved to the nearby Hirschengraben in 1930 to make room for tramway infrastructure; plans to move the statue triggered controversial debate in Bernese newspapers in early 1930, but the plan found popular support in a vote of 6 April, the statue was removed on 24 April and erected at its current location on 19 May.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdrian von Bubenberg in  German, French and Italian in the online Historical Dictionary of Switzerland.",

        "wiki": "The Bern tramway network (German: Berner Strassenbahn-Netz) is a network of tramways forming part of the public transport system in Bern, the capital city of Switzerland.  In operation since 1890, it presently has five lines, one of which incorporates the Bern\u2013Worb Dorf railway.\nThe trams on the network run on 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3\u20448 in) metre gauge track.  Initially, they were powered by compressed air, but from 1894, the air trams were supplemented by steam trams.  Since 1901, the trams have been powered by electricity, at 600 V DC.\nThe network is operated by a public transport corporation, the St\u00e4dtische Verkehrsbetriebe Bern (SVB), which, since 2000, has marketed itself mainly under the trading name Bernmobil.  The SVB also operates most of Bern's motor buses, and the Bern trolleybus system.  Like the other public transport services in the region, the tramway network is part of the Tarifverbund Bern-Solothurn, which is equivalent to a passenger transport executive or transit district.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pneumatic trams ===\n\nOn 18 July 1889, the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Amt f\u00fcr Verkehr (Confederate Office of Transport) (EAV) granted the Berner Tramway-Gesellschaft (Bernese Tramway Company) (BTG) an 80-year concession for the operation of tramways in Bern.\nConstruction of a tramway began immediately, and the first line was opened on 1 October 1890.\nServices were operated by compressed air-powered vehicles, known colloquially as Lufttrams (air trams), according to the system developed by the Parisian engineer Louis M\u00e9karski.\nThe first line, designated as line I, ran from the B\u00e4rengraben (bear pits), which was also the location of the depot, to the Bremgartenfriedhof, via Bern railway station.  At each terminus, there was a turntable to turn the vehicles.\nDuring the winter months, the compressed air pipes often froze, and this would lead to several days of service interruptions.\n\n\n=== Steam tramway ===\n\nIn light of the problems the BTG was experiencing with operating the pneumatic trams, and also Bern's challenging topography, the residents of the city voted in favour of using steam trams to operate line II. This line, opened in 1894, ran from L\u00e4nggasse to Wabern, via the railway station, the Mattenhofquartier (Eigerplatz) and Weissenb\u00fchl.\nThe depot for the steam trams was in the Mattenhofquartier.  Bern's main tram depot is still located there.\nThe new steam tram line ousted Bern's horse buses from the city centre; from then onwards, the horse buses operated a new connection from Wabern to Belp-Steinbach.  Meanwhile, plans were developed to extend the steam tramway to Kehrsatz and Belp.A coalition of political and economic interests in various neighbouring communities then vehemently campaigned for the construction of a steam-driven interurban tramway from Bern to Worb. Such a tramway would allow connections at G\u00fcmligen with the standard gauge railways to Bern, Thun and Emmental. The BTG assisted with planning and cost calculations, and applied on behalf of the coalition for the required concession, which was issued by the EAV on 23 December 1896.\nThe opening of the 9.7 km (6.0 mi) long Bern to Worb tramway took place on 21 October 1898.  From then until 31 March 1904, the Bern-Worb-Bahn (BWB) was operated by the BTG.\n\n\n=== Electrification ===\nThe development of urban tramway networks in Switzerland and abroad at around the turn of the 20th century did not go unnoticed in Bern.  A third line was planned for the Bern tramway network at that time, and it was intended to operate that line by electricity from the outset.  Electrification of the two existing lines was planned to follow.  There was opposition to the construction of overhead catenary, mainly from the residents of Kirchenfeld on the other side of the Aare. But at the ballot box, the electrification plans received the go ahead.  Equally as unsuccessful as the opposition to electrification was a simultaneous popular initiative for the retention of the Lufttrams on line I.\n\nOn 1 July 1901, services commenced on line III. This led from Breitenrain to Burgernziel via the Zytglogge. For four and a half months, Bern had three types of tram traction at the same time. The opening of the G\u00fcrbetalbahn enabled the replacement of the city's horse bus services.  On the other hand, plans for the extension of line II were abandoned. The last day of operation of the pneumatic trams was 15 November 1901.  None of the pneumatically powered vehicles has been preserved, but the old Depot and a bus shelter at the B\u00e4rengraben continue to remind Bernese residents today of the Lufttram era. The B\u00e4rengraben depot was abandoned and sold three years later.\nIn time for the winter of 1901-1902, the Burgernziel depot, which also still exists today, was able to be completed. Electric operations on line II were taken up on 29 January 1902. For that purpose, 24 two-axle and seven Maximum-bogied motor tramcars, as well as the twelve former steam tram trailers, were available.  The SSB remained the only Swiss tram company that bought the Maximum-bogied tramcars. In the course of 1902, the SSB also retrained the horse tram drivers from the city of Biel/Bienne as electric tram drivers, so that in the new year of 1903 a smooth transition could be made to the new form of traction.\nIn the summer of 1904, eight short open tram trailer cars were added to the fleet. They rapidly came to enjoy great popularity. Unexpectedly, damage to the chassis frame occurred on two of the motor tramcars used to haul the open trailers, which operated mostly on line I. The damage was obviously caused by the Demerbe rails used on that line, and the SSB was forced to replace the two tramcars much earlier than planned.  At the end of 1905 came the first six axle enclosed tram trailer.  Between 1906 and 1914, 29 two-axle motor tramcars were commissioned in a number of separate deliveries. These new tramcars were stronger than their predecessors and were also no longer asymmetrical.\nBern's fourth tramway, line IV, was the first radial route in the Bern tramway network. It ran from the railway station to Br\u00fcckfeld.  Scheduled services on line IV commenced on 27 June 1908.  To cater for the  Eidgen\u00f6ssische Sch\u00fctzenfest 1910, line III had been extended during the preceding winter months to Papierm\u00fchlestrasse. In addition, four new two-axle tram trailers had been purchased.  In 1909, more than ten million passengers travelled on Bern's trams for the first time.\nIn 1911, the SSB changed the routing of lines II, III and IV. The station was now the central interchange point. The line II trams ran from Weissenb\u00fchl to Papierm\u00fchlestrasse, those of line III from L\u00e4nggasse to Burgernziel, and the trams on line IV from Wabern to L\u00e4nggasse. With the opening of the Hirschengraben to Friedheim section through the Monbijou Quartier in 1912, the line IV trams could now run directly to Wabern without going through the Mattenhofquartier and Weissenb\u00fchl.  Since then, the Weissenb\u00fchl Friedheim section has been a non-revenue track. At the same time, a new network came into operation. The lines were now given Arabic designators:\n\nLine 1 (opposite direction: line 2): B\u00e4rengraben \u2013 Bahnhof \u2013 Friedhof (former line I)\nLine 3 (opposite direction: line 4): Weissenb\u00fchl \u2013 Bahnhof \u2013 Papierm\u00fchlestrasse (former line II)\nLine 5 (opposite direction: line 6): L\u00e4nggasse \u2013 Bahnhof \u2013 Burgernziel (former line III)\nLine 8 (opposite direction: line 9): Wabern \u2013 Friedheim \u2013 Bahnhof \u2013 Br\u00fcckfeld (former line IV)Trams that reversed at Friedheim, and therefore did not continue to Wabern, operated as line 7. The fleet of two-axle trailers was expanded by another seven units.\nIn 1913, the tramway sections in the L\u00e4nggasse and to Br\u00fcckfeld were converted into double track lines, in preparation for the Swiss National Exposition that was to be held in Bern the following year.  During the Exposition, the SSB was responsible for the operation of the Rundbahn (circle of track) running through the exhibition grounds. To cope with the task of carrying Exposition visitors to and from the Exposition, the SSB also procured more two-axle trailers. These were the last two-axle vehicles to be acquired by the SSB, and for nearly two decades were also the SSB's newest trailers. Upon their entry into service, the size of the SSB's fleet was increased to a total of 60 motor cars and 54 trailer cars.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\n\nIn the summer of 1914, tram traffic in Bern came to be affected by global politics, when the Federal Council ordered the general mobilization of the army effective from 2 August 1914. As a result, a total of 125 employees of the SSB went missing from all areas of its operations. This loss of available staff represented about 40 percent of a workforce of 319 people.  To alleviate the personnel shortage, the company needed 144 Hilfskondukteure (assisting conductors).  At that time, women were not allowed to be hired.\nMeanwhile, to facilitate the extension of the Worblentalbahn (WT) from Papierm\u00fchlestrasse to the Kornhausplatz with effect from 19 July 1915, the spacing between the tracks had to be increased, initially in the curves, to avoid crossing prohibitions due to the greater width of the WT's vehicles. As World War I continued, the SSB was forced by inflationary increases in the price of coal imports to restrict its activities to the absolute minimum. The six Rundbahn motor cars, which, due to their low powered motors, had been used only as summer trailers, were converted to closed vehicles that could be used all year round. Three vehicles became trailers, and the tramcars that had actually been procured as summer trailers were sold to the St\u00e4dtische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich.\nIn the summer of 1918, the SSB helped out the Bern-Worb-Bahn on a number of Sundays, by lending tramcar combinations that were able to carry many day trippers despite the BWB's shortage of vehicles.\n\n\n=== Interwar period ===\nIn 1919, the Bernese Gemeinderat debated the merits of two projects for the extension of the tram network. While the extension of line 1/2 from B\u00e4rengraben to Ostermundigen (with inclines at Aargauerstalden, Laubeggstrasse and Ostermundigenstrasse) was rejected for cost reasons, the Gemeinderat agreed to a line to B\u00fcmpliz. This line was compensation for the incorporation of B\u00fcmpliz into Bern.\nAfter the war, the economic situation did not improve much at first.  The SSB remained limited to only the most essential maintenance work. Nineteen twenty was the first year in the company's operating history to end in a deficit. In 1920 and 1921, a total of 65 people had to be laid off. The sale of surplus spare parts to the Lucerne tramway network brought in revenue of 700 Swiss francs.\nBetween 1921 and 1932, the summer tramcars were rebuilt in the SSB's own workshop into closed all-year-round trailers. Some vehicles were used as testbeds for various modifications until, with one exception, they were all fitted with the large round platforms that were typical for Bern.\nIn 1923, the network was extended once again for the first time in 15 years. With the commissioning of the branch line from the Effingerstrasse into Fischerm\u00e4tteli on 18 November 1923, the Bern tramway network reached a length of 18.2 km (11.3 mi). The branch line was the last new SSB line to be built for nearly a quarter of a century.  The new line's introduction led to a slight change in the network's operations: trams now ran from Br\u00fcckfeld into Fischerm\u00e4tteli (line 11; in the opposite direction, line 12). The line to Wabern became a radial route.An application by the Bern\u2013Worb-Bahn for permission to relocate its terminus from Helvetiaplatz to Casinoplatz (Hotelgasse) at the other (Bern) end of the Kirchenfeld Bridge was met with a negative response from the City of Bern: it feared that such a relocation would lead to a substantial deterioration of the traffic conditions on the edge of the inner city.  Instead, the proposal started a political debate that extended over the following eight decades, until it was finally implemented in the late 1990s.\nFrom 1924, trams made up of three tramcars were operated during rush hours for reasons of cost. In subsequent years, the SSB continued to incur no significant outgoings. Apart from the two extensions to Br\u00fcckfeld and Wankdorf stadium, which operated only on special occasions, the main work the company performed on its tracks was maintenance work. As a search for cheap second hand tramcars in Germany, where the hyperinflation of 1923 had driven a number of tram operators into bankruptcy, did not produce the desired result, the company had to keep the 1901/02 vintage two axle motor tramcars in service by replacing the car bodies that had become rotten. Additionally, the Maximum motor tramcars were fitted with more powerful engines; the SSB thus hoped to extend their service life by 15 to 20 years. However, it was not possible to install track brakes in these cars, which is why they continued to operate mostly on line 3/4. From 1928, pantographs replaced the bow collectors with which the SSB tramcars had previously been fitted.\n\nMajor renovation work carried out in 1930 in the Bahnhofplatz/Bubenbergplatz area changed not only the image of that part of the city, but also the line routes of the SSB. On the Bubenbergplatz, a large stabling area for trams (the \"Blaserm\u00e4tteli\") came into being. The station was robbed of its large entrance hall, and its front was moved to the back. The SSB took the opportunity to reorganise the network and introduced the coloured route panels still used in part today:\n\nLine 1/2 (blue): Friedhof \u2013 Bahnhof \u2013 Br\u00fcckfeld\nLine 3/4 (white): Weissenb\u00fchl \u2013 Bahnhof \u2013 Papierm\u00fchlestrasse\nLine 5/6 (red): L\u00e4nggasse \u2013 Bahnhof \u2013 Burgernziel\nLine 8/9 (yellow): B\u00e4rengraben \u2013 Bahnhof \u2013 Sch\u00f6negg \u2013 Wabern (trams operating only as far as Sch\u00f6negg ran as line 7)\nLine 11/12 (green): Bahnhof \u2013 Fischerm\u00e4tteliIn August of the same year, the SSB received its first new vehicles for 16 years. These were two four-axle motor tramcars of type Be 4/4.\nIn 1931, the SSB applied for a concession to extend line 5/6 by 800 m (2,600 ft) along the Muristrasse to Eggh\u00f6lzli. The cantonal authorities rejected this application, on the grounds that it could not accept responsibility for a double track section in the Muristrasse, with its heavy motor vehicle traffic. In 1932/1933, the \"Landibahn trains\" were permanently joined together in pairs with a gangway connection. From then onwards, they operated almost exclusively on line 11/12.  In 1933, three new trailers were put into operation: two four-axle trams and one three-axle vehicle, each with an SLM-pony truck.\nThe first signs of the Great Depression were already being felt in Switzerland in 1932. Incomes declined more and more. In 1936, unemployment finally reached its peak. However, the SSB continued to carry out major work on its track system. At the same time, the SSB began to scrap the two-axle trailers from 1905 and 1910 and re-use parts of their chassis in the construction of new vehicles in its own workshop. The former steam tram trailers were gradually given new car bodies and boarded platforms. In December 1935, deliveries of seven four-axle motor tramcars began.  This meant the end for the old Maximum motor cars.  One survived until 1975 as a welding carriage.\nThe blackest day in the history of the network was 19 September 1936. At the Henkerbr\u00fcnnli stop on line 1, fallen leaves lay on the wet rails. On the way back from a football match, a three tramcar combination operating a supplementary service skidded on the leaves, and then collided heavily with a stationary tram on a regularly scheduled service. A total of 28 passengers were injured, some seriously.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nAt the beginning of 1939, there was a flu epidemic that at times afflicted one fifth of the SSB's workforce. When the Federal Council finally proclaimed a general war mobilization in late summer that year, a large portion of the SSB's employees had to report for army duty, which caused numerous restrictions in the SSB's operations. Nevertheless, and for the first time ever, more than 20 million passengers travelled on the network tram in 1939.\nAs a result of the war, there was no celebration in 1940 of the 50th anniversary of trams in Bern. From 1941, the tramway network was fully double-tracked. In the next few years, restrictions of all kinds affected public transport in the federal city. As the war continued, shortages of materials made themselves felt. Passenger numbers rose sharply.\nIn 1944, the last vehicles with longitudinal bench seats entered service. These five four-axle motor tramcars and six four-axle trailer cars were also the last vehicles to be procured by the SSB. The motor tramcars were unusual, in that on one side there were modern air-operated folding doors, but on the other side only basic sliding doors were provided.\n\n\n=== Postwar period ===\nOn 1 October 1944, the blackout was lifted after three years. Shortly after the war ended in 1945, SSB reintroduced the operation of trams at five-minute intervals.  Voters approved the extension of line 5/6 from Burgernziel to Freudenbergerplatz (Ostring). This extension was ready to be opened on 1 December 1946.\nAs a result of the merger of the SSB with the bus company Stadt-Omnibus Bern (SOB) to form the St\u00e4dtische Verkehrsbetriebe Bern (SVB) on 1 September 1947, there were changes in the routing of the tram lines, and a new uniform tariff for all urban transport. At the same time, separate numbering of routes according to the direction of tram travel was abandoned, in favour of the following line numbering scheme:\nLine 1: G\u00fcterbahnhof (formerly Friedhof) \u2013 Bahnhof \u2013 Br\u00fcckfeld\nLine 3: Weissenb\u00fchl \u2013 Bahnhof\nLine 5: L\u00e4nggasse \u2013 Bahnhof \u2013 Ostring\nLine 9: Wabern \u2013 Bahnhof \u2013 Milit\u00e4rplatz (formerly Papierm\u00fchlestrasse)\nLine 11: Fischerm\u00e4tteli \u2013 Bahnhof\nIn autumn, the first ten Standard motor tramcars arrived.  Five more joined the fleet the following spring. These were the first Bernese tramcars with passenger flow optimisation; the ticket inspector was allocated a reserved seat at the third door.  Meanwhile, the renewal program for the older rolling stock renewal was continued. A planned takeover of trailers nos. 41 to 46 from the Biel/Bienne tramway network, which was closed in 1948, did not materialize, however, because agreement on price could not be reached. The new Bernese numbers 215-220 that had been intended for these cars were never allocated.\nThe incipient boom in the late 1940s brought an increase in motorized traffic. At the same time, the number of public transport passenger journeys declined steadily. The following year, the Lorraine and the Wyler lines were merged. In 1951/1952, the SVB received ten four-axle trailers. These were based on the (Swiss Standard Tram) proposed by the Association of Swiss Transport Institutions (VST) in 1945. Along with motor tramcars supplied four years earlier, these trailers could now be formed into trains of tramcars, and a large amount of older rolling stock therefore became surplus to requirements. At the Weissenb\u00fchl terminus, a car barn for 20 to 24 two-axle vehicle was constructed. The trams stored there formed the reserve for major events.\nFrom 1952, the route of the B\u00fcmpliz line ran along the Effingerstrasse and no longer via the Laupenstrasse. This new route was introduced in view of the construction of a high-rise hospital building for the Inselspital. In the early summer of 1954, a traffic report by a Z\u00fcrich consulting firm suggested the conversion of the entire Bernese tramway network to bus operation. The model for this was the then modern concept of the car-friendly city. This met with opposition from the Bernese population, including demonstrations in favour of retaining the trams. In 1955, work began on the reconstruction of the railway tracks in front of the Eigerplatz depot.  Meanwhile, during renovations of the track on the Kirchenfeld Bridge, buses were used frequently to operate a rail replacement bus service to the Ostring.\nIn 1958, all of Bern's motor tramcars had to be fitted with blinkers. In November of the same year the SVB introduced new express routes from Hauptbahnhof to Milit\u00e4rplatz and from Hauptbahnhof to Ostring. Also in 1958, work began on the renovation of the railway station. As a direct result of the construction of the new Schanzen bridge, the L\u00e4nggasse \u2013 Hauptbahnhof section was converted to motor bus operation. From then onwards, line 5 (formerly line 11) was operated as a Fischerm\u00e4tteli \u2013 Hauptbahnhof \u2013 Ostring cross-city line. Consequently, the \"Landibahn\" trains from 1914 lost its area of operation and could be withdrawn from service along with the last steam tram trailers.  Additionally, the introduction of the second series of Standard trams (ten motor tramcars and ten trailers) led to the withdrawal of a large portion of the remaining two-axle vehicles. Ridership increased by up to six percent annually.\nIn 1964, Bern voters approved a general ban on smoking in buses and trams. This approval overrode earlier rules, such as the one stating that smoking is only allowed in the standing areas. With the conversion of Line 1 to motor bus operation on 11 October 1965, the track length of the tram network was reduced to 13.55 km (8.42 mi). This was also the last closure of a tramway in Bern. In the same year, the conversion of a Standard tram to driver-only operation marked the commencement of self-service ticket control, which was otherwise phased in gradually between 1967 and 1973. In August 1966, in view of the replacement of the old four-axle trams equipped with longitudinal benches, the SVB took delivery of a bi-articulated vehicle with four single axle bogies from SWS Schlieren on a trial basis. However, the trial of this vehicle did not lead to a series production order, as the SVB decided to acquire conventional eight-axle bi-articulated vehicles with Jacobs bogies instead.\n\n\n=== Late twentieth century ===\nFrom the winter of 1972/1973, the new bi-articulated vehicles were in service, mostly on line 9. This development enabled the withdrawal of the last two axled trams. The Maximum tramcar from 1902, which had been converted into a work car, was scrapped and replaced by another tramcar thirty years younger. By this means, the last representative of its type disappeared. On 28 October 1973, the 1.67 km (1.04 mi) long extension of line 3 from Burgernziel to the new suburb of Wittigkofen (Saali) went into operation.With the opening on 26 May 1974 of the underground station on the Zollikofen\u2013Bern railway, a station that also served trains from Solothurn and from Worb Dorf, an important revenue source for the city of Bern dried up. Previously, the Solothurn-Zollikofen-Bern-Bahn (SZB) and the Vereinigte Bern\u2013Worb-Bahnen (VBW) had paid track access charges for the use of the infrastructure within the city limits.  On 4 September 1976, as part of the big \"Bernfest\" marking the completion of a total of 17 years of rebuilding work at the station, the newly designed Bubenbergplatz was inaugurated. At the same time, the SVB presented to the public Switzerland's first dining car tram, developed from a motor tramcar with longitudinal seating and an accompanying trailer. Also in 1976, a section of line 9 in the Seftigenstrasse approximately 800 m (2,600 ft) long was moved to a reserved track section. This change made faster progress possible, especially during peak periods.\nDue to the unexpectedly high passenger volume caused by the introduction of the \"B\u00e4reabi\" in 1984, the mid-1980s was marred by an acute shortage of vehicles. The SVB therefore tried to find well-preserved used vehicles. Amongst the options considered were the acquisition of five Standard motor car/trailer combinations from Z\u00fcrich, or the same number of DUEWAG trams from the Bielefeld Stadtbahn. Finally, five 40-year-old trailers were taken over in 1986 from Verkehrsbetriebe Z\u00fcrich; these replaced the last six trailers with longitudinal seating. In 1987, with a view to the possibility of orders for new vehicles, there were guest appearances in Bern by a Geneva low-floor articulated tram and a high-floor Z\u00fcrich tram of type Tram 2000. The Geneva low-floor tram was well received by the population, and this led to the procurement of twelve eight-axle vehicles in 1990.\nIn the summer of 1988, the closure of the Kirchenfeld Bridge to traffic for renovations led to a division of the tramway network. To allow operation on the eastern part, a provisional balloon loop was created at Helvetiaplatz and ran from there to Ostring and Saali. To connect the two sub-networks, two specially equipped bus lines 31 and 32 were operated.  In 1990 twelve low-floor articulated tram trains entered service, and this made it possible to withdraw the old Z\u00fcrich tramcars. Just three years later, and despite the withdrawal of these vehicles, the SVB bought other used trailers in Basel, and these were later onsold to Baselland Transport. Due to the bus replacement operations during the renovation of the Kornhaus Bridge additional buses from Baden-Wettingen and Lucerne also helped out.\nAt the end of the 1990s, a network optimization study suggested that the existing motorbus and trolleybus to B\u00fcmpliz, Bethlehem, Ostermundigen and Wyler be converted to tram operation by 2020.\n\n\n=== Twenty-first century ===\nOn 17 June 2007, the voters of the canton of Bern approved the investment credit required for the suggested conversion. On 1 April 2008, construction work began on the new line, which is 6.8 km (4.2 mi) long.  The new line begins at a junction at Kaufm\u00e4nnischer Verband, and proceeds to B\u00fcmpliz underpass, where it divides into line 7 to B\u00fcmpliz and line 8 to Brunnen. At the end of September 2010, the construction work was completed.\nThe new line was commissioned to coincide with the timetable change on 12 December 2010.  Simultaneously, line G to Worb was renamed as line 6, and extended to Fischerm\u00e4tteli.  Immediately before its renaming, line G had been the last of the lines in the Bernese transport network to be designated by a letter. The concession for this line was transferred to Bernmobil on 30 November 2010, a couple of weeks before the various network changes occurred.\n\n\n== Lines ==\nAs of 2013, the lines of Bern's tramway network were as follows:\n\n\n== Fleet ==\n\n\n=== Current articulated trams ===\n\n\n=== Withdrawn trams ===\n\n\n=== Former trailer cars ===\n\n\n=== Heritage vehicles ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of town tramway systems in Switzerland\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nBernmobil \u2013 official site (in German)\nBernmobil historic foundation \u2013 official site (in German)\nTrack plan of the Bern tram system\nBern database / photo gallery and Bern tram list at Urban Electric Transit \u2013 in various languages, including English.\nBern database / photo gallery at Phototrans \u2013 in various languages, including English.\nCompressed Air Trams \u2013 includes Bern",

        "wiki": "Sandro Del-Prete (born 1937) is a Swiss artist who creates illusionary and surrealistic paintings.  His style has been compared to M. C. Escher, though it lacks the latter's mathematical precision.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDel-Prete was born in Bern, Switzerland in 1937 and went to school in Fribourg, Switzerland.  When he was twenty-three Del-Prete spent six months in Florence, Italy, where he attended the Florence Academy of Art.  When he returned to Switzerland, Del-Prete began creating religious and symbolic art both in drawing and in sculpture. Initially he worked in the insurance industry and painted or drew just as a hobby.Del-Prete\u2019s interest in Illusionism sprang from his observation of a chameleon. He wondered \u2018what the animal really saw, what picture it had of its own world\u2019. He began to look upon different perspectives and in the early 1960s began creating illustrations that would lead to his later \u2018illusory\u2019 images. Del-Prete began to experiment, drawing scenes and objects that could be looked at from two different viewpoints.He completed his first double-perspective painting, \u2018Window Gazing\u2019 in 1961 and continued to experiment with the style for the next two decades.  In 1981 Del-Prete self published a collection of black and white pencil drawings called Illusorismen.  Illusorismen was very successful and convinced Del-Prete to become a professional artist. In 1987 he published a second collection of his art called Illusoria, which was followed by a third book in 2007.  One of his sculptures, Loubegaffer, a statue with eyes that seem to follow the viewer, was placed on permanent display in the main rail station in Bern.He opened a gallery on Schwarztorstrasse in Bern, before moving, in 2002, to nearby Ittigen and opening Illusoria-Land.  The 700 m2 (7,500 sq ft) gallery, fun house and museum displayed many of his works.  In 2014 Illusoria-Land closed in Ittigen and moved to Restaurant Kreuz in Hettiswil bei Hindelbank.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIllusoria-Land, Ittigen",

          "The site is as nasty, touristy and as big a rip off as you might expect but the location and coastline itself is actually more scenic than I expected (hence the 2 stars!) so I'm glad I went. You do, however, have to pay for all day parking and there is no blue badge discount -",
          "Great place to come just because its the arse of England :) The visitors centre is fine (its commercialised to buggery) but its the scenery one comes for anyway right! If you are in to walking then this is the place to come! Fantastic scenery and lots of walks to do. Just come",
          "Even though the attraction was closed there was still a few shops and cafe opened , we would be tempted to stay at the hotel next time , we did a round trip from sennen cove to here then to penzance and back to sennen cove ,",
          "Visited 2nd January. Was very windy, but the views were stunning. Sea was crashing against the rocks. Most of the attractions were closed for renovations. Didn't realise you had to pay to have a photo by the Lands End sign. We still a managed to get a selfie though.",
          "To say I\u2019ve been to Lands End the furthest point in England is one of my 2019 highlights! Yes it\u2019s commercialised but what are you expecting from a landmark. Yes I did pay for the photo. It\u2019s not that expensive. Theme parks charge more and the delivery was very quick. Arrived",
          "Went in winter, super windy, was beautiful - the waves were churning up spray across the cliffs, loved it. Really nice walk across the cliffs",
          "Well worth a visit. Lovely views and good walks. Parking a little pricey tho but other than that a great piece of our country.",
          "I love Land's End. There's just something about the fresh air, rugged coast and blue as far as the eye can see that makes me come back again and again. Parking is a bit expensive: \u00a36 and it has become a bit touristy, but if you ignore all that, it's wonderful!",
          "Beautiful place and peaceful because it is closed season but some shop are open perfect for my friend birthday treats",
          "I visited john I groats and I thought I definitely need visit lands end. What a beauty of a view so I have done both lands end and john o groats. Loads views to do around here great for photography.",
          "Good for young children but rather expensive. Check prices before foing as there is no local alternative parking. You can stand on the end and look for New York but cannot see it!",
          "Reminded me of going to the Needles in the Isle of Wight - ruined by pointless profiteering but somewhere you just have to go to tick off your bucket list. \u00a36 potholed car park, quick run past the shops/\u2018entertainment\u2019 and onto lovely walk along the cliff. Been there, seen it,",
          "Great trip to Land\u2019s End. Whilst the amenities were all closed until Spring\u201920 (which was good actually) its the scenery that you come here for and it\u2019s absolutely breathtaking. Waves breaking against the shore, sun setting, breeze whipping against you, wonderful.",
          "We visited here on a wet rainy day. Despite that it was still fairly busy with cars queuing to get in. It was \u00a36 to park!!! A bit expensive for what it was if you ask me. The car park was some run down uneven gravelled area with large potholes everywhere. It says the funds",
          "We only really visited Land's End, to be able to say that we had been, and to see the famous Land's End sign. When we arrived and saw that parking was \u00a36, we considered turning around, but, decided to park up while we were already there. The parking ticket is valid for the week,",
          "The Land's End landmark is literally at the end of the UK. You have to pay \u00a36 to park your car. I guess you pay for the convenience and the council relies on funds to keep the landmark preserved for generations. Food offerings are mediocre. You have a nice seaview restaurant",
          "Very disappointed at how expensive / how poor value for money Lands End was today. \u00a36 for the car parking (no blue badge discount) and then almost \u00a350 for 3 adults and 2 children. Each of the main attractions took no more than 15 minutes each and the whole place felt very tired.",
          "This place sure does know how to charge, but it is worth the visit. The views are lovely, and yes, it has been commercialised but that's no reason to miss out on the visit. The car park could do with resurfacing, as we were there on a rainy day and it was just water filled",
          "\u00a36 parking charge to enter, we felt this is too extortionate under our personal circumstances, the car park could do with being resurfaced - maybe with some of the parking charge funds. The shops are cute and have many things to offer but again are very highly priced. Very",
          "Unfortunately a prime example of taking advantage of tourists by over-charging and under-providing. View was spectacular but we came away feeling we'd been fleeced frankly. From \u00a36 charge for car park to poor quality cafe. We bought full price all-inclusive tickets to the",
          "What a shame, my god this place has to win best in show for how to ruin a national place of outstanding beauty by installing a rip off tacky tourist reception before you even get to the view. Ashamed is what the people behind this should be. Surprising locals don't get together",
          "Arrived here, with plenty of parking and blue skies. The entrance is great. As you walk through there are gift shops and refreshments. Continue walking and you will come to the famous Lands End sign. But disappointing they want to charge you for a photo next to the sign, think",
          "Hi both of us visited lands end first only place to park charge you \u00a36 no other place within 2 miles. Great views of the coast line but it\u2019s been turned in to a side show with over priced food and drinks outlets And 3D film shows not our cup of tea ok for small children and",
          "Yes, we visited Lands End. As we arrived, we were immediately confronted with parking expenses - on a one way road...? As we finally found our way out, (thanks to the gateman), we drove back to hopefully find a parking space, each available space for at least a mile was",
          "Never been to Cornwall before and wanted to visit here and was well surprised how lovely the place is we had plenty to to do nice walks places where you can eat shops loads of others things to do we was there for a few hours we will be back plus things to do for children to",
          "Was sooo windy when we visited but was nice to see the spectacular views and the Wallace and Gromit studio's. Only downside is its soo commercialised that the sign is actually owned by a photographer.",
          "Yes, it\u2019s a bit touristy, but completely worth it for the incredible views. If you walk on the cliffside trails, you\u2019ll quickly escape the crowds and experience just what makes this place so special. A short walk will take you to Sennen, which combines for a truly great day.",
          "As everyone mentions the parking is a bit steep at \u00a36 but once over that fact we thoroughly enjoyed our visit the lands end sign you can pay 9.50 for your personalised photo which we did do as I will probably never get back that way again just 489 miles from Durham!!! You can",
          "The parking is \u00a36, so twice the price of Lizard point and there is the most awful mini- Disney to walk through to get to the coast! Souvenir shops, cheap food outlets like doughnut/hotdog stands, along with tacky amusement rides!!! What a shame. The coastline and sea views",
          "After visiting John O' Groats, Lands End was such a letdown. \u00a36 firstly to park in a totally flooded car park - so let's not be fooled by all these fees going back into the local area- total rubbish - Shops full of overpriced TAT. \u00a310 to get a pic of the lampost by what can only",
          "Some things should just be.... it\u2019s Lands End and should just be a point, a walk, and a place to reflect. Last came 35yrs ago and was disappointed to find it\u2019s now got donut shacks, pasty shop, kids fair rides, and feels more like a mini. Thorpe Park. It\u2019s not what I came for",
          "Expensive to park and extras whilst at the attraction. We went over 30 years ago and could take photos at the landmark. It\u2019s now fenced off and a photographer is there to take your picture under the landmark sign for \u00a35. Ok to say we\u2019d revisited but wouldn\u2019t bother again.",
          "I'm glad I travelled here but it is a once only trip. I wanted a photo of the sign post but really expensive. The best part was walking along the coast line seeing the views. Shame it's been over commercialised.",
          "If you just want to see the stunning views and countryside, or just want to say you've been there, then visiting Land's End is absolutely worth every penny. Even when it's windy or cold the scenery is simply stunning. Lovely open sea, rolling Cornish countryside and the rough",
          "If you ignore all the touristy trap exhibitions and shops, the views and coastline are worth the visit.It was particularly windy on the day we visited which made the coastline even more dramatic. Parking was on par with other carparks in the area.",
          "An amazing walk and views. However the car park is too expensive \u00a36.00 no matter how long you stay. The exhibitions in there are \u00a314 per adult \u00a310 per child. Again it\u2019s 4d cinema so feel that it\u2019s too expensive. The shop however is vast and lovely. Set out well and reasonably",
          "Land's End has fantastic scenery and is always worth a visit for the views. It is a pity the advance of commercialism has intruded upon this. The car parking fee (\u00a36 during hours, \u00a33 outside) is an absolute rip off and does not encourage visiting - even if you can come back",
          "We visited later in the afternoon, so skipped all of the crowds and tourist trappings, but there was some type of formal event happening and there were still people milling about. We took in the views at the main Land's End area, then hiked up the SW Coast Path toward Sennen",
          "Plenty to do here and not too expensive, worth getting a family ticket for the attractions. My only concerns were about the car park the condition of it was appalling and dangerous and in desperate need of attention. Probably worth bringing along your own drinks and snacks too",
          "I must say that this is the second time that we have been to the Land's end stopping at their hotel always very clean, staff is always very helpful, food is good, and the views are fantastic. I would recommend this this hotel to everyone that would like a break we will be",
          "Decided to visit having been to John O\u2019Groats previously when doing the North Coast 500 \u2013 paid our \u00a36 to park \u2013 more like an entrance fee as it allows you to return within next 7 days \u2013 having visited 35+ years ago \u2013 it seems much changed with more attractions \u2013 but the sign is",
          "I know not to everyone's taste, but we loved it. Had a lovely walk around the coast in the sunshine and went in all the attractions. We had a discount voucher. Parking and entry value for free returns within a week. Aardman attraction was great, and the 4d film was fun (be",
          "... and visit St Michael's Mount whilst you at it, as it's 15 miles away. There are activities, eateries and shops at Land's End. And several walks to craftworks, farm and shipwreck if you're adventurous. But in reality you go there for the iconic signpost, to see and",
          "We visited on possibly the worst weather day of our holiday, however we had a fab time. We had a toddler and a baby with us so we went to the Aardman exhibition which we all loved. Our 2 year old loved walking around in the rain, we had a photo by the sign and a lovely hot drink",
          "This was our first visit to this attraction and we were not disappointed..We were so lucky with the weather so we saw it at its best.The views were beautiful and the scenery gorgeous.The facilities here are excellent.There are various places to eat and some excellent shops as",
          "Booked for my wife and myself 36yrs wedding anniversary, i had explained that when we stayed yrs ago we loved it and was looking forward to staying again, we had just had a bad experience at the Camelot Hotel so was hoping for better. The reception staff was very nice and the",
          "Land's end is worth a visit, but stay away from the tourist clap trap. One has to pay \u00a36 for parking. You may come back the next 7 days for parking, but who does that. After a night of rain most of the carpark was covered in deep pools of water. Why not use some of the parking",
          "Well I must say I dont understand all the awful reviews of this place, it was abolutely beautiful. Yes the car park seemed expensive but considering thats parking for a week its cheap. We parked up and went for morning coffee at the hotel, nothing special but good range. From",
          "3 adults and 2 kids (9&12) enjoyed the Aardman display, 4D cinema and Arthurs Quest. Not cheap but good value with beautiful views and reasonable food.",
          "This week My Lady and I are on holiday in Cornwall, along with two other couples. We decided that a visit to Lands End would brighten an otherwise dreary day weatherwise. We loaded the dogs in the cars, packed the wet-weather gear and set off on the 24 mile drive. As we went the",
          "Got there just after 4pm and was charged on the gate \u00a36 to park up. Went in and everything was closed apart from the snack kiosk. However the views are worth going for, but would have been nice to be told at the time that everything was closed.",
          "Went to Lands End on a Sunday and the main shop on the right as you go in had closed their doors by 4.10pm, depsite the website saying it was all open until 5pm. We went in but the tills were being cashed up and they were hoovering the front mat where they had closed the doors.",
          "There are far better places to go to at the coast. The view is average at best. Still, there are a lot of tourists (coaches) and there are shops / restaurants / entertainments facilities around to cater for the tourists. If you want a beautiful view of the Cornish coast, try for",
          "Was surprised with the \u00a36 parking fee but then most places in cornwall charge that much for just 4hrs anyway. Agree with what most people say, the design of the place could have been better but hey ho, thats what you get for now. The view though is amazing. The price for the",
          "The views are stunning from lands end. The whole thing has become rather pricy! Luckily not too bad to park - \u00a36. The food was all very expensive in the restaurant and not much better elsewhere. If you want a picture next to the sign you will have to pay for this too!",
          "As others have said the car park is \u00a36 for however long you visit and allows you return within a week, could this be cheaper yes, is it extortionate no. The sign itself is behind a rope and need to pay for professional photo to have it personalised, but if get there very early",
          "Wow I have never seen an attraction with such an even volume of love and hate on trip advisor! Apart from 'poor' all other categories have almost the same votes!!! I visited the area just wanting to see the 2003 RMS Mulheim shipwreck remains, which are just North of the main",
          "We went as a couple, thought we could do the romantic husband and wife thing, you know the photo. \u00a36 for a pot holed wet, puddled car park, even for just 1 hour, no scaled charges here. Couldn't believe the tacky shops and the king Arthur ride! When we got to the signpost, saw",
          "Don't object to paying \u00a36 to park..for the beautiful walks and views..I appreciate that charge for the upkeep of the paths However what I do object to is the blatant ripping off of the visitors in the shops \u00a34.50 to \u00a35.00 per bottle for the various flavours of Rattler Cider \ud83e\udd2c\ud83d\ude20",
          "Looking forward for ages to visiting Lands End, but so disappointed at the commercialism & the rip off cost of parking on a very rough surface, covered in pot holes which were filled with muddy water. It was embarrassing to hear foreign visitors complaining about the exorbitant",
          "Found Cornwall to be a palatably peaceful place. Land\u2019s End has a well established tourist area with a few shops, a cafe, and don\u2019t miss the end-to-ender\u2019s hall of fame near the entrance. Pet and Family friendly with activities and a play area for kids. If arrive during",
          "You can really enjoy being here when the weather is fine and there's a good view across to America or the Scillys! We went on the bus, so didn't worry about the car park and also we were able to walk the coastal path to Sennnen Cove to get the bus back. We didn't bother with",
          "We went here as a couple to have of first family photo on our wedding year. A family tradition but sadly the photos are very expensive and so is the food and drink on site. DO NOT get the Cornish pasties they are not good enough for Cornwall. Lands end is a place where",
          "This is a must. Although car park is large it can fill up. Although it is very commercialised now it is still a great place to go. The views are great.",
          "I remember visiting Lands End as a child and there was almost nothing there. It had a wild, untameable beauty. Now it doesn\u2019t even look like the same place. There\u2019s a petting farm, numerous shops, restaurants, a children play area, lots of buildings, a huge car park, tarmac",
          "A lovely part of the world and a place not to be missed. Enjoyed a good walk looking at the stunning scenery.",
          "We visited here for the day. A lot to see and experience at the visitors centre where you can obtain tickets to access the shows etc. There are shops to buy gifts,clothing, fudge, alcohol etc. Plenty of eateries. There are walks around the centre allowing views from the cliffs",
          "Was really looking forward to visiting Lands End and the coastal views did not disappoint however, to take a picture by the famous 'Lands End' and you have to queue and pay for the privilege. The the rest of the experience is too commercialised and is being charged at exorbitant",
          "Make the most of your visit and instead of parking at Lands End (\u00a36) park instead at Sennen top car park (\u00a34) and walk the coast path as it's stunning and by far the best bit. When you get there you can wander about the various shops and eateries and of course if you time it",
          "We went to Land\u2019s end for the end of season spectacular. The fireworks were definitely worth the 1.30 hr drive. Thoroughly enjoyed by everyone from young children up to older adults. The ABBA tribute was very good also. If you love the sunset over the sea then it\u2019s worth a",
          "This is well worth a visit if you've never been here before. However, the car parking charge of \u00a36 is in my opinion almost as steep as the cliffs themselves.",
          "Beautiful dramatic scenery and walks as we walked from Sennen to Lands end, quite a large commercial area on a wet day lots to do inside for the little ones and a fantastic park for the little ones with a small farm at the other end of the car park, kids loved it.",
          "Lovely place good park for kids lovely walk and great views nice food and cafe with 4D cinema lovely little craft shop.",
          "It\u2019s cool to go but there\u2019s not really much to do if (like us) you just want to see the sign post and look at the view... we stayed less than an hour as there was not way my pregnant wife could walk that far!",
          "Fab day out with the little ones, we went to see wallace and gromits house, we went to king arthers quest and we went to the 4d cinema which were all fab, can only go once with your ticket, lots of other things on eg.fireworks and shows. We walked all around and visited the",
          "First faced with the monstrosity of a building which is just in fact in the way and blocking the view. You then walk through an amusement area, very overpriced and mostly irrelevant. The attractions just seen odd like the area is having an identity crisis. Other than the End to",
          "Went there on a day trip before going to Penzance , got there about 1, awhat a rip off having to pay 6 pounds to park my car , and for him to,say you can use t for seven days , who is going to go back there if they are on holiday, no one , why not charge half the amount people",
          "When down in Cornwall we had a bucket list of things to do, this being on it. Now I have to say I had done a bit of research on this place through TripAdvisor as I new this bit of land was in private hands. People mentioned about going late on to avoid all the rubbish that is",
          "Landmark indeed Lands End Attractions in a unique area of great costal area.Beautiful attractions,shops,restaurants,play area for the kids and a lot more.The family had a wonderful time time on our first day in Cornwall and hope to visit again.A great place for",

          "The famous sign post is actually cordoned off by the professional photographers who will charge \u00a310 a time to take a picture of you and your family but you can manage to take pictures with it in the background. There is a nice giftshop further down the path where you can take",
          "Great destination, views are stunning. Love the sign post and photo opportunity. Lots to do, nice day out.",
          "I'd read lots of negative reviews before visiting but felt that I still wanted to go and see for myself. We went on a Magic In the Skies day and had a great evening, with everything staying open late. We didn't visit the attractions as we had no children with us, but we enjoyed",
          "Paying to park here is worth it if you intend to visit again, as you can return for free within seven days, which we did to see the wonderful fireworks. The site seemed tacky and over-commercialised, though my kids enjoyed the (overpriced) Jurassic Park 4D Experience. I also",
          "It's one of those things you feel you have to do. It's completely free and we didn't have an issue with paying \u00a36 to park at all. Everywhere seems free and parking is cheap compared to where we come from! Plus there are toilets at every place and car park. We didn't stay here",
          "Disappointed by this place, long drive but wish I hadn't bothered. Went to Lizard Point the day before and found that more impressive and enjoyable. I left Lands End disappointed, feeling ripped off and glad I do not have to return.",
          "More commercial than our last visit but plenty to do.. Lots of lovely views. Craft area has nice walk around the outer part of the farm with little craft rooms to look in. 4D cinema that was there was good and not too expensive. Lots of gift shops to tempt you. Food not too",
          "If you are looking for a quiet place to take in the scenery this probably isn't for you. If you are looking for entertainment for young children for a couple of hours then it's not bad. I don't really understand people moaning about having to pay for parking - you don't HAVE to",
          "My mother and I were a bit disappointed by the atmosphere at Land\u2019s End. All you could see was this fairground and loads of shops around it. It looked like the commercial part had been prioritised over the natural beauty that surrounded the area. The walk over the cliffs was",
          "It\u2019s a good place to spend a sunny day with family. There are some interesting attraction, amazing panoramic view, some instagramable spots to take pictures and a thematic playground for kids. Not to mention, the easy walking track around the cliff.",
          "This was somewhere we felt we wanted to visit just once, and when we left we definitely felt that -once is enough! The area is not very inspiring and mostly it's taken over with retail opportunities, selling a jaw-dropping range of tat stamped with the words \"Land's End\". You",
          "Not worth travelling to as a standalone attraction but okay for an hour or so if you are in the area.",
          "Lovely day out, the views are breathtaking... Really nice cafe serving lovely food and drinks, the cafe also as great views. Nice little gift shop and photographer to take your pictures with the sign post . For anyone that\u2019s not visited , you should go amazing!!",
          "We took a two and half drive to Land\u2019s end while on our holiday to Cornwall (myself, two sons, 12 & 14, and my sister 11). We had never been & I think the idea seemed better than the experience. \u00a36 to park, even though we got there at 2pm and it shut at 4pm, still had to pay",
          "The views around the coast and the walk to the cliffs are spectacular. However, the individuality and uniqueness has been sapped out of the place. Lots of nicer and more unique landmarks in the area. Also, get there early as it is very busy and you may be parked a fair bit",
          "A novel experience and expensive. There is a car park charge of \u00a36 before you have even started. It is a beautiful place with spectacular scenery and the famous sign but sadly for me too gimmicky and commercial. I was overwhelmed by the stalls and shops just trying to find the",
          "Yes it has been made into a tourist attraction, yes it's like a mini seaside town with amusements, shops and hot doughnut stalls. But this place is great for kids!!! The land mark post is there and you can personalise it with where you live and how far away from home you are!",

          "What a huge shame that a company have managed to ruin a beauty spot so spectacularly! From the huge white pillars to the do- nut shop to 4d cinemas to Wallace and Grommit! ( what have they to do with the most westerly point in UK.) they have managed to destroy a beautiful place.",
          "On holiday in Cornwall, lands End on our list, no idea you had to pay to park, you don't find out how much til your at the gate house, \u00a36 for a car, the same as a minibus, can't do anything about it as you can't turn around, cap park is full of potholes and mud, went down to",

          "We went to Flambards theme park and as we were not far away - 20 miles, decided to cross Lands End off the bucket list. Bit of a con really as you basically have little choice but to drive into the car park which will take \u00a36 to park. Then its basically a load of shops selling",
          "Visited with the family, done the bundle offer for all 4 attractions with the option to return free as many times as we wanted within 7 days the offer also includes parking. We did use the return tickets for the family fun day. Both visits we enjoyed fantastic days with will",

          "We were not shocked at the \u00a36 parking as we had paid more in cornwall for a days parking, We did have a picture taken at \u00a310 but we only will ever visit here once so worth the memory.

          "We would never have gone near this place had we known. \u00a36 to park in front of a tacky theme park with no connection to this beautiful spot. Although we were only there for ten minutes, I couldn\u2019t get the smell of hot dogs and other junk food out of my nose for hours. Best to",
          "\u00a36 just to park. It\u2019s a rip off. I\u2019ve been before and wanted to show my kids. But it\u2019s just a cliff. The \u2018Lands End Experience\u2019 is just not worth it. I\u2019ll park in Sennen and walk next time.",
          "After driving 2 hours to get to Lands End, we were incredibly disappointed with what we found. it cost us 6GBP to park - not even a tarred parking - and we left after 30 minutes - an absolute rip-off. Once we walked in, it was just money, money, money, and even the well known",
          "The real landmark is the Lighthouse anyway. If the parking is too expensive then park in Sennon Cove and walk - it is a grest walk and only just over a mile. It's a free country, take your own phoyo!!!",
          "This is one of them places you need to visit. Views are amazing and so many great pictures to be taken. Parking is \u00a36 but worth it. Site also has a hotel, restaurants, shops etc.",
          "Visiting the actual Land\u2019s End signpost is a bit of an information black out zone like Area 51. Yes lots of information on the Landmark Attraction but near to nothing on the actual iconic signpost (probably not entirely coincidental), even phoning the tourist information centers",
          "\u00a36 to park. The ticket lasts all week but I'm definitely not going back. \u00a310 for a picture with the sign. I asked the man if he could remove the personalised name off the lands end sign as Everyone wanted a picture without someone else's name on it and he was horrifically rude",
          "We parked in the Sennen Cove Harbour Car Park which is significantly cheaper than the one at Lands End itself. We paid \u00a32.50 for 4 hours, although you can have 2 hours for \u00a31 or all day for \u00a34 so good value for money! The walk to Lands End is clearly signposted and begins from",
          "Didnt mind too much paying \u00a36 to park, but not being able to take a picture near the sign without paying \u00a312 is just unnecessary money grabbing. Not worth the visit.",
          "Get the feeling Land\u2019s End is trying too hard to capitalise on the fact that it is at the end of the country which makes people flock to visit it. We came for the sole purpose to take a photo at the sign as we are off to John o\u2019groats later in the year and thought it would be a",
          "I'd been to Land's End about a decade ago with my parents but it was in the middle of winter and thick fog so I was keen to go again. My husband had never been so we thought we'd give it a go. You have to pay \u00a36 in cash to park up so make sure you have the cash on you as you",
          "After getting the bus from Penzance we were deposited here for 2hrs, which was 1hr50 too long. There is a horrible, tacky frontier land village selling seaside tat and overpriced food: \u00a34.50 for a Preheated hotdog and \u00a32.50 for 1 scoop of ice cream. The famous sign is cordoned",
          "\u00a36 mandatory parking but worth it for the stunning views and coastal path walk - it's possible to walk to Sennen Cove. For a close up with the Land's End marker the cost is circa. \u00a310. Good amenities and gift shops.",
          "You get an idea of what is coming when you enter the car-park and have to pay \u00a36--00 !!!!. When you go into the facility if you want to view the attractions it cost us a further \u00a336--00. The shops outside of this are free entry but they are run of the mill and nothing to write",
          "We\u2019re from midcornwall but somehow I\u2019ve never been to Lands end so decided, weathers good, let\u2019s do it! But I\u2019d heard bad things. Heard it was tacky, heard it was commercialised, heard there was a lame attempt at a theme park so was here purely for the sign post and to say I\u2019ve",
          "We visited here while in the area to say we had been. While we expected the landmark to have our photo taken by, we did not expect it to be so commercialised. There was still enough to do without paying for the attractions, it was disappointing not more to do.",
          "We took the kids to lands end mainly because I have always wanted to have a photo taken by the sign post. But when we arrived we found that there was so much for the kids to do there was a play park and a little farm also a 4D cinema a king Arthur trail and also a trip round",
          "I\u2019m not too sure what I expected - it wasn\u2019t this though. Very pricey, very tacky looking, very commercialised. We drove into the car park and turned around (luckily hadn\u2019t paid an extortionate parking charge yet). Myself and my partner expected an open space with a couple of",
          "Disgusting that this beautiful place has been made into a money grabbing den! \u00a310 to have a picture taken is downright disgusting shame on whoever let this happen! And why oh why would anyone want to go and watch Wallace and gromit instead of taking in the stunning landscape . I",
          "What a beautiful place! Honestly worth the visit (and the \u00a36 parking fee) it\u2019s natural and we got some beautiful photos! I loved coming here and seeing the end of the UK",
          "One of the best parts of the visit was Colin at the car park, huge beaming smile welcomed us and he was happy to point out the highlights!",

          "Unless you want to waste a ton of money you don\u2019t need long to visit. The car park costs 6\u00a3 no matter how long you stay. In order to put your name on the lands end sign you have to pay 10\u00a3 for 1 name and 14\u00a3 for 2 names (if I remember correctly). Nice views and obviously a",

          "This is a lovely landmark but unfortunately they are now fleecing you. There is a \u00a36 parking fee and then attractions that are an extra cost and none of them cheap at that. We did the farm when it is ok, there is not a lot there and certainly not worth the money! Everything is",
          "You have to pay \u00a36 for parking which is pretty much if you don\u2019t spend whole day there. The most shocking part was that you have to pay minimum \u00a310 for a photo with famous sign! Ridiculous! They are trying to steal your money without giving anything back. Food was over priced",
          "This 'attraction' has turned into a scam. \u00a36 for parking and then they try to charge you \u00a310 for a picture with the sign post. The whole place is now designed to get you to part with your cash with overpriced tat. The views are great but they can be found across all of Cornwall",

          "We were expecting Land\u2019s End to be much more touristy than it turned out to be. In fact the touristy parts were quite restrained, and only take up a small area of Land\u2019s End itself, leaving the majority of the place free for walking and enjoying the view, which was good. Car",

          "\u00a36 parking! Guess we was there for 45min you have to pay for everything crazy. People climbing down the cliffs no staff stopped the public, a shameful place we will never never be returning and our advice is don\u2019t waist you money,",
          "Being the tourists that we are in Cornwall we of course decided to visit Land\u2019s End. You\u2019ve GOT to right?! Think again. Seriously. I would imagine there are two keys reasons people visit here. One is to get a picture beside the famous sign and the other to take in the",
          "Whilst we enjoyed the lovely walk over the cliffs and the views, this place has turned into a completely tourist trap. Just another Cornish rip off. We arrived to discover it was \u00a36 to park. We then walked to the sign hoping to get a photo only to realise some old man has a hut",
          "Although we completly forgot to take the classic picture of the post like everyone else, we embarked on the long walk down the coastline. There is nothing I could fault about this place and the views it beholds. It was such a beautiful day and the walk was suitable for our five",
          "Got there about 9.30 am. Worth the visit and were there before the shops etc opened so not many people around. It is no problem taking a photo near the sign without paying- just not right up against it . The parking ticket Is valid for 6 days and we will return as are staying",
          "The experience of going to Land\u2019s End was good - we went for a couple of hours before heading to the Minack Theatre for an evening performance. It was cool to say I have been to the end of the country and see the famous Land\u2019s End sign. There were quite a few tourists there,",
          "This was our second time to Land's End, the first was 10 years earlier, but I was so disappointed this time around. Last time it was a bit touristy but you could enjoy the views, walks, scenery and last house in England in relative peace and take a picture of the well known sign",
          "We visited Lands End while staying nearby in Sennen. We went in the early evening when everything was closed. Still able to walk around and enjoy the sun setting over the rocks.",
          "Lands end is a beautiful place to wander around. They have a few small side attractions including a 4D cinema but these on top of the paid parking were too expensive for 5 of us (although they do offer discounted bulk buy tickets and return and park free within a week). We",
          "Whilst having a break in Cornwall we decided to visit Land\u2019s end which I had done many times as a child. First of all you have to pay \u00a36 to park. We then went to the visitors centre and was told that the attractions were suitable for my 3 and 6 year old so we paid to visit them",
          "We paid the mandatory \u00a36 (yes \u00a36, it seems to have recently increased from \u00a34) to park our car and then had a walk around the site. We looked into all the food/refreshments venues and walked out of all of them - depressing atmosphere and poor quality/extortionately priced",

          "The monstrous carbuncle on the beautiful landscape ruined the experience for me. Just an awful monument to mammon. Money for tat. The car park charges full price until 17:00 but all the shops and attractions shut at 15:00 - what a rip-off. I only give a couple of stars because",
          "Extremely disappointed. Roadtrip around the UK from John O\u2019Groats. Was hoping for similar pictures at each sign - understandably. John O\u2019Groats was a free for all classic sign. Lands End was a money making scam to even touch the sign. Refused to pay for a tacky sign that you",
          "25 years since I was there last but still as breathtaking even with the stormy winds & rain. The hotels had a face lift & a couple of extensions but the place generally looks the same. Unfortunately very misty while we were there but even so the waves crashing against the rocks",
          "The coastal scenery is, of course, sensational and well worth 5* and a visit. The rip off parking charges and mostly closed so called attractions over the winter (including March) are another matter! There is only a daily car park rate until 17.00 - but the toilets close at",
          "As a location, simply stunning. The staff were extremely helpful and the food was great. The rooms in the main hotel are somewhat dated, but most disappointingly, the cleanliness was poor. We upgraded the room on arrival and were shown to Room 14. All seem fine until that",
          "Awesomely stunning coastline!! Rest of what\u2019s on offer absolutely horrible and unnecessary!! Insult to injury having to pay for a photograph next to the Lands End sign - we chose not to! Total tacky rip off!!!",
          "I have to admit this place was more stunning than I expected. Maybe we got lucky with the weather as it was bright sunshine. Maybe it was the fact it was out of season and so not that busy. The coastline and view really was fantastic and the extra treat of a coastal helicopter",
          "We spent a fab day here exploring. Parking was \u00a34 and valid for a week so you could easily come back. Lots of parking, we were grateful for our warm coats too! The views are spectacular! Kiddies play area really great & a variety of choices to get something to eat. We paid extra",
          "What is it? One way of looking at it is, it's just a sign saying you can go no further (well, you can, but you'll probably need to be rescued by the coastguard!) and a tourist centre. And a bus stop back to where ever you need to go What else is it? A glorious view across the",
          "What can I say apart from I should have checked the reviews before I visited. Went to this place over the weekend with my family for the very first time and all I can say is we won't be rushing back anytime soon. First of all \u00a34 to park the car for an hour, then to the famous",
          "Another lovely visit to Landsend. Had a fab morning with our friends and 4 month old son. Stunning views and great gift shops.",
          "We were incredibly lucky with the weather ok our visit to Cornwall and had a lovely say at Land's End with a walk along the cliffs and back - perfect!",
          "Really nice setting, quite humbling. Went in Feb and the weather was not great but without a doubt still worth the trip.",
          "No trip to Cornwall is complete without a visit to Land\u2019s End. We were there at the end of a cold, windy and wet day so did not bother to pay for parking in the parking lot which was covered in puddles. The shops and attractions were closing but looked like the usual tacky",
          "We rented a car and drove to Land\u2019s End. It was a memorable trip and I love the lighthouse off shore. Great view and awesome experience getting there. Love England",
          "Visited in January and we appreciate that it was closed. However \u00a34 to park (even if you only stay 10 minutes) is unreasonable. The coastal scenery, sea and lighthouse are magnificent The tacky \u201cattractions\u201d and poor attempts at commercial gain are out of place in this",
          "A trip to Cornwall wouldn't be complete without a trip to lands end Sure it's vey commercial but it's fun and there's something for all ages",
          "Wouldn\u2019t visit at the moment as everything was shut even though we were there before 15:30 when it was still supposed to be open. Certainly don\u2019t pay for car parking as there\u2019s nothing to see there apart from the sign post. Go and take a quick photograph and you\u2019re done!",
          "Land's End is a landmark marking the most western point of England's shore.  It is in the village of Sennen, and is essentially a tourist trap.  The complex and its adjoining parking is private land, and a hefty parking charge is levied even for a brief photo visit.  There are",
          "Paid \u00a34 for parking and to discover that everything was closed. Even the toilets which were closed for maintenance. The only thing open was the photographer charging to take photos standing in front of the Land's End sign. Not allowed to enter this area without paying for photo.",
          "So finally made it to Cornwall and Land's End........Now this is a bit of a mixed bag. My excellent rating is for the.......incredible......wind swept.....wild.....untamed landscape. Awe inspiring and a creative and literary inspiration. The day ear-marked for this adventure",
          "How has the end of the country become so commercialised? It's a disgusting collection of irrelevant attractions such as a 4D cinema. Admittedly everything was closed, and the photographer man was still putting together the iconic sign for the day, but the scenery really just",

          "Reading some of the reviews here highlight the fact that we have bred a society of people with unrealistic expectations of everything!!! We visited on Boxing Day and didn't expect anything to be open so the fact the shops, hotel and famous sign were accesible were a bonus. I",
          "Although everything was closed when we arrived as it was December it\u2019s still a beautiful place to visit and take pictures.",
          "Used to visit here years ago and not as I remember it. The actual sign post was a bit of a tourist trap - you now have to pay for a professional printed photograph which is then posted to you - no camera phones, etc anymore. We visited in November where everything bar the gift",
          "Area is now full of tatty shops and you have to pay through the nose to get near the landmark sign or take a photo of yourself by it if you wish - ridiculous attempt to make profit from a landmark that has been available and free for years previously, really disappointed.",
          "A nice place to see the end of the English lands, you can take a picture and they can deliver it to your house, also they can take a picture using your phone, there are some kids activities like a cinema, you can have a small hike to the top of the rocks to see the view, if you",
          "Like several other reviewers, we were quite taken aback by the approach to our destination, the Land's End hotel. Fortunately, my wife overcame my confusion and encouraged me to continue to drive through what appears to be a Prison gate, ignore the barriers and other signage to",
          "As one of the most famous attractions in the UK we wanted to visit and hoped there would be tasteful history and/or information on the area and it's legacy (like a lot of good places in Cornwall). There isn't. It's a huge anti climax and worth about 20 mins. The coast is",
          "Because of time constraint, I can only pick either Land's End or the Lizard Lighthouse. Since I also want to go to Minack Theatre, the bus route to Land's End happens to be the same as to Minack Theatre. I have to agree with other reviewers, this place is too commercialised. The",
          "We paid \u00a36 to park for an hour to wave my husband off on his bike towards John O'Groats. We didn't pay the \u00a310 that they wanted to have a photo beside the famous Land's End sign. The coast path is lovely but there are a lot of naff shops and attractions that detract from it all.",

          "There are two reasons for going to Land's End: (1) to visit a small theme park, tacky and over-priced; or (2) visit the south-western tip of England. If it's the second you want, you don't have to visit Land's End! The true SW tip is actually Gwennap Head, on a lovely stretch of",
          "Arrived late afternoon, not long before sunset in winter, parking costs were \u00a34 (with no other options!). All of the (theme park type) attractions are closed until spring 2019, the cafe was also closed but, there was no indication of this when paying for parking which left us",
          "This has to be one of the most commercially spoilt landmarks in the UK. The actual coastline of lands end itself is incredible and well worth the visit, especially on a clear day but the apalling, overpriced, tacky commercialisation of it really detracted from the natural beauty",
          "Park at Land\u2019s End, walk to the famous sign post (which is now cordoned off so that you have to pay to have your photo taken with it!!), turn right and walk along the stunning coastal path into Sennon Cove... you can watch the fishermen come in, enjoy fish and chips or a pint,",
          "I\u2019ve never been so shocked to see the downfall of such a great landmark. I went years ago and it was what it was. A NATURAL landmark with a place to get coffee. Like the Lizard point... (way better) Now this place is not only \u00a36 per car to park... which everyone going in made",
          "I was quite disappointed to discover Lands End has been turned into a way to extort money from visitors . \u00a38 to have a photo with the sign ! And they post it to you - no thanks . Views are still stunning as are the coastal walls but we could do without the 3D cinema and shopping",
          "We went as a family of 4 and had a great time. The views are amazing so if you want to visit just to see the views then you can. Alternatively as a family there is lots to do and keep the kids entertained. Despite a lot of negative reviews about this we found this excellent.",
          "There really is nothing here apart from the view. The commercialised units are there to fleece money from tourists (especially the Lands End Sign at \u00a310 for a photo) You can take a pic of the sign from outside the cordon though. Didn't park at the lands end carpark as prices",
          "My last visit to Lands End was some years ago. I had heard it was now commercialised and tacky and it certainly lived up to its new reputation. \u00a36 to park but only \u00a32 if you have a blue badge. The disabled car park is close to the entrance to the visitor centre and",

          "Beautiful coastline and scenery marred by a tacky visitors centre, if you can call it that. Not much choice of food in the 2 cafes just tge usual burger and chips combo. We did go to the hotel in the hope of getting something better but that was also a let down. Very poor and",
          "Make sure the weather is going to be fine before visiting - when it is, the views are breath-taking!",
          "Visited Lands End and was surprised by the lack of souvenir shops and things to do. Surely by paying \u00a36 to park there should be attractions. Sorry been once, not to return.",
          "A world renowned site, completely ruined and turned into a penny grabbing tourist attraction. \u00a36 parking no matter how long you stay - we were there for 5 minutes. The only way to have a photo with the signpost landmark is by paying some old chap with a camera and putting some",
          "Wet, grey and grim. The physical setting is impressive, even when poring with rain. However, the tacky entertainment was both disappointing, opportunistic and unnecessary. \u00a36 for parking and everything else there has a price tag, including food prices, unlike many other",
          "I don't care about attractions or photos by signposts I think the real joy of Lands End are the cliff tops it's sad that some parts are crumbling and therefore roped off but it is a pleasure to walk along the cliff top",
          "Visited there late afternoon and was still charged \u00a36 for parking.When we got into the attraction there wasn\u2019t much open due to the time of years opening times.shouldnt be made to pay full price at that time a day.yes it\u2019s reduced at 5pm to \u00a32 but no much to do wen everything is",
          "As long as you don\u2019t get taken in like most tourists do you can have a pleasant hour or so there, but because it is a tourist attraction you can easily end up spending lots of money very quickly! \u00a36 to park your car so if like me, had no kids with us you\u2019ll be in and out after",
          "The only reason for visiting Land's End is to say that you have been there. \u00a36 to park your car. Yes you can park there for a week for the six pounds but why would anyone want to come back after an hour. \u00a310 for anyone who wants their photo taken by the Land's End signpost.",
          "Had a nice visit, we were lucky with the weather. Hotel\\bar a little tatty round the edges. Menu nothing special (no fresh fish!) So we didn't eat there. Some nice shops. My husband was outraged that you have to pay to have photo with the famous sign lol The guy running the",
          "Read loads of bad reviews about visiting Lands End. Went 3/10/18 and unfortunately it was really foggy so view was really bad. That said what you can see looked brilliant. Reference paying for picture, it\u2019s true if you want to stand right next to sign. However there is a chain",
          "Great area for a walk. Lands end is a tourist trap. Lots of terrible fun fair rides which no body goes on. For a photo next to lands end sign this will cost you as it Is fenced off. If you walk down the coast you can find a beached ship which is pretty cool.",
          "My daughter and i went there late!afternoon/ evening on the day we arrived for our weekend break in cornwell. The 1st thing you spot whereever you go is that unless you have a Cornish disabled badge for your vehicle you have to pay car parking fees. An elderly couple was",
          "Trip from St Ives along the coast road is only for the brave ! Very narrow road but the views make it worth it. Lands End itself is spectacular - just pay for car parking, very reasonable, and access is free. Lots of good food options, a couple of pay attractions, the King",
          "Before we went to lands end we were warned it was a bit like a theme park. To be honest I thought those reviewers were being a bit silly. How could lands end be theme park like? What else was there but maybe a shop or two and a white post? How wrong I was! I wish I\u2019d looked",
          "Couldn't believe how commercialized this \"landmark\" has become - try visiting Lizard Point (most southerly point in England) instead - as much better",
          "It's been about 25 years or more since my last visit to Land's End and I was a little disappointed by the development that has happened. It's now commercial and in my opinion has been spoilt. If you can see past the developments and just look at the coastline then it's a good",
          "We paid a shocking \u00a36 to park but the views were breathtaking so bit the bullet. However the visit was somewhat spoilt by the range of shops, eateries, ice cream sellers and attractions that are overpriced and some tacky and some closed. Couldn't take photos next to the sign",
          "Definitely a 5* destination.

        "wiki": "Ballenberg is an open-air museum in Switzerland that displays traditional buildings and architecture from all over the country. Located near Brienz in the municipality of Hofstetten bei Brienz, Canton of Bern, Ballenberg has over 100 original buildings that have been transported from their original sites. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.In addition to the main attraction of the buildings themselves, some of the industrial and crafting buildings still operate to give demonstrations of traditional rural crafts, techniques and cheesemaking. There is also a sizable number of farmyard animals in the grounds.Founded in 1978, the museum features buildings from all over the country and has structures from almost all of the cantons. The buildings are set in surroundings appropriate to their type (farm buildings surrounded by small fields etc.) with pathways snaking across the 660,000 square metres (164 acre) site. Most buildings allow the visitor to walk around the rooms, each recreated from the time period of the building or brought over wholesale when the building was transplanted.\nThe museum is divided into the various regions of Switzerland with the structures carefully chosen to give a view of traditional architecture from those areas. The regions represented are:\n\nAlpine - the higher mountain areas of the cantons of  Bern, Graub\u00fcnden, Nidwalden, Obwalden and Valais\nBernese Midlands - from the central region of the Canton of Bern.\nBernese Oberland - the higher areas of southern Canton of Bern.\nCentral Midlands - the central region of the Canton of Aargau.\nCentral Switzerland - cantons of Nidwalden, Obwalden and parts of Luzern, Schwyz, Uri and Zug.\nEast Midlands - the Canton of Zurich and some areas of the cantons of Schaffhausen and Thurgau.\nEastern Switzerland - the central valley areas of Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Appenzell Innerrhoden and St. Gallen.\nJura - the central regions of the cantons of Jura, Neuch\u00e2tel and the northern areas of Vaud.\nThe Valais - the valley areas of the Canton of Valais.\nTicino - the central areas of Ticino.\nWest Midlands - central Fribourg and Vaud.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArchitecture of Switzerland\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBallenberg official site\nimage collection",

          "Amazing place to visit with educational value. We spent half a day there. It was easy to get to from Brienz. From the Brienz train station, there are yellow buses (included in the Swiss Travel Pass) which go to the museum area. Check the schedule of activities to plan",

          "I knew very little about this place before I went, except that it's the Swiss equivalent of the Weald and Downland Museum in Singleton, Sussex, UK. I discovered that it's a bit like that, only about 100 times bigger. This place covers a huge area, so I recommend comfortable",

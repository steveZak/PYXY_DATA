          "This is a very large market with open air stalls, and some in closed areas, with everything from shoes to children's items to food to everything in between. I went with an item in mind and found it - although it took about 15 minutes of looking. Don't buy at the first stalls at",
          "Unfortunately, the place was more than dirty. It was stinky actually!!! Meat was thown everywhere around and the smell was awfull!!! I was so disapointed when visited this place.",
          "Too large to see everything...! As I came in December, I could see unusual marchandise: someone sell potatoes on truck. If you go there, recommend to have a brief plan :)",
          "Chorsu is the central market of Tashkent. The locals do their shopping here but the place can be interesting for someone visiting the city. The interior section is majestically big and there are a few nice shops for handicrafts. The prices are lower than the ordinary tourist",
          "Local market mostly crowded with locals. Of you do not have dry fruit shopping, can be avoided......",
          "Had heard so much about this place that we were rather disappointed. The stores were mediocre and the goods of a very average quality.",
          "The chorsu is the biggest market area I have ever seen. You can find everything in this bazaar but it is really chaotic place.",
          "Chorsu Bazaar feels incredibly authentic, and is like nothing you\u2019ll see in the West. Truthfully, I didn\u2019t find any of the things on offer particularly appealing (and the stuff on sale for tourists isn\u2019t particularly exciting), but the whole draw of Chorsu Bazaar for me are the",
          "This covered bazaar is wonderful to stroll through, especially the nut, fruit and vegetable sections where the produce looks fabulous. We did not find the clothing and souvenir stalls enticing.",
          "Nice traditional bazaar with all the hustle and bustle of a bazaar. A variety of food and other items available",
          "A must if you want to see a glimpse of everyday life. Good place to get cheap items (snacks and trinkets). Make sure to get a meal at the row of open air restaurants - really good stuff there.",
          "Classic veg/meat/fruits/spices/ all kinds of household stuff market for locals. Tourists get charged at least 10times the price the locals get, no matter how you bargain, they rather won't sell than give you a reasonable price. Not worth the journey from the other side of the",
          "I visited the market twice, once for looking and the other to buy a bag to take back Uzbek crafts. The market is a site to see and fun, especially in the food sections (for foodies like me). My bag ended up being barely strong enough to carry my stuff back to Canada so be",
          "Worth a visit . I can\u2019t say more . Prices vary if you can bargain your good . The place is good for understanding how much meat and cheese Uzbek people eat. One of the biggest meat and cheese markets Ive seen in my life . Outside the market its very big and you can find",
          "We came to Chorsu Bazaar on a Sunday around noon. The Chorsu metro can also get you here. The market is large. There are sections for meats, fruits and vegetables. If you go to the 2nd floor, you can get an overview of the entire area. If you exit the round dome building,",
          "A very large, confusing area with hundreds (thousands?) of vendors selling a huge variety of things. At its centre is a domed indoor market selling meat, cheese and (upstairs) a vast array of nuts and dried fruits. Perfect for your last day in Tashkent when you're hoping to buy",
          "One of the few 'Must sees' in Tashkent and it is worth it. It is very much a working market and thankfully not touristifyed. You need small denomination of som just in case! Great variety of produce, no hassle. Great to see bread being made -every tourist must be brought to see",
          "We went on Sunday - a bad day to visit, lots and lots of people! There is so much stuff there, for everyone\u2019s taste. My absolute favorite were nuts - I love nuts, and there are so many to choose from! I also enjoyed the spices, vegetables, and various salads. And, of course,",
          "No visit to Tashkent can be complete without spending a few hours in Chorsu. Its scale and spread are mind-blowing! Flowers, fruits, meats, dry fruits, bread, clothes, bags, souvenirs, bakery, local food, salads, whatever you can imagine is available. The most remarkable",
          "Chorus Bazaar is a sprawling indoor and outdoor market which seems like Central Asia's answer to Bangkok's Chatachak Market. For dedicated market enthusiasts, this one will deliver, as it offers everything from gold to terracotta and cashews to silk. We are not keen shoppers,",
          "Visited twice the bazar . I did most of my shopping from Chorsu Bazar. Best place to buy dry fruits , fresh Uzbek Bread . Tasty local food .",
          "Chorsu bazaar is the biggest market place of Tashkent. You will get everything here right from souvenirs, handicrafts, crockeries, fruits, vegetables, nuts, dryfruits, milk products, local cuisines, restaurants, money exchange and a metro station too which opens right in the",
          "My can driver was butt and dropped me off a block away across the street but friendly locals got me to the right place. The place is huge. People are hustling and selling and negotiating all over the place. Do not ever pay full price. Cut in half and negotiate. Here is English",
          "Charsu is a huge bazaar that sells everything from exotic meats and fruits to handy crafts and many will enjoy a treasure hunt in it's vast streets and enclaves. It was not my cup of tea as I could not stand the smell of meat, or the chaos that surrounds it. But I probably paid",
          "The Chorsu Bazaar provided a look at how the local people in Tashkent live. Access is via the Metro and ext at Chorsu Station.The market was full of people and had atmosphere and was clean and neat and well organized.You will find everything you need here and some things you do",
          "chorrsu bazar in tashkent is a small world in itself here you will find local people and tourists purchasing dryfruits vegetalbles and gifts and stationery items THE bazar gives you a feeling of the old world charm with a lot of bargaining to purchase your required items",
          "The smells, the food, the people, just the whole place in general is fantastic! There are so many different vendors showcasing their local goods. An absolute must do while in Tashkent!",
          "The bazar was a centre of old Tashkent and as the name suggests it is circular complex with entry from all four sides. Go shopping for local dry fruits and fresh fruits",
          "Recommended for all travelers who would like to obtain souvenirs, National jewelry, carpets , clothes and many other things. Inexpensive bazaar! Kindly recommend for travelers to go there with the local friends in order to avoid highly offered prices by shopkeepers:)) anyways,",
          "This is a must see in Tashkent. Could be seen multiple times because the make up of the vendor's stalls and the expressions on the people's faces changes often. Be prepared for a sensory overload and remember the entrance so you can find your way back out because there is",
          "A nice place to visit since it provides safe, enjoyable and economic tourism. Hotels, food and transport are cheap. History and monuments are impressive. People are excellent and hospitable. Dry fruits are must purchase. The value for money spent is high.",

          "The Chorsu Bazaar in Tashkent is an interesting market for all sorts of products ranging from vegetables, soveniors, food and various other items. One section that was particularly interesting was the bread section where bakers bake bread in huge clay ovens and one can buy them",
          "For someone on a business trip for Licorice we very disappointed by the amount or weak availability. A lot of spices Vendors are nice.",
          "VERY large bazzar (we traveled for half a day and still haven't seen half of it). I thought the market was just the dome in the middle, but it's just a tiny fraction of the market. Lots of street food , fruits, vegetables, souviners, spices, knives.. you name it. Pretty much",
          "At first Chorsu Bazaar looked exciting but as I looked closely I realized all the merchants sell nearly the same things. There's very little variety and it gets boring quite quickly. If you don't like crowded, hot places then this is not the right place for you. You won't get",
          "It\u2019s a Nazarene - hot busy and noisy and huge We arrived at 0700 as the stalls were being set up - amazing experience - left at twelve as the days heat started Bought alsorts and spent very little Yes the meat room smells - we just avoided it Great experience - noise -",
          "Spent a few hours here walking around. It is a very local market. The best part was watching the Non bread being made and cooked. Then buying a fresh loaf for 1500 som and eating it hot.",
          "Loads of market stalls, with many kids hassling you to buy from them. A rather off putting smell of raw meat on the lower floor.",
          "Chorsu has variety but if you are a connoisseur, don't expect great quality. Value for money, Yes. Good variety of dry fruits. It's ironic and paradoxical, the place of origin never provides great quality in local markets, perhaps because export fetches the green bucks. Friendly",
          "Chorus is an must experience! Market us where you get to see the kind and welcoming culture of Uzbekistan.",
          "Nice place to see the bazaar and buy nuts and other food items back for your Friends and family back home.",
          "The Bazaar is a central dome shaped structure surrounded by a huge array of stalks outside. My favourite was the bread bazaar with wonderful smells, if you like butchered meat smells the main dime is the place for you. Lots of animal carcasses hanging and kits of huge trays of",
          "Very busy and lots to see! The meat section was fascinating and the fresh fruit and vegetables were cheap and good. The bakery section was great especially eating a piece of bread straight out of the oven!",

          "You must visit this bazaar if you visit Tashkent: so vast and so well organised - a joy to wander around even if you're not planning to buy anything. The displays are fabulous and you will end up buying some fruit, spices or nuts - they just look so good and the prices are",
          "Probably one of the largest Bazaar I have seen. This market is huge and sells everything, you can spend hours wandering around, Do not miss the huge Dome in the middle where the meat sellers are, it is quite a site ! People are very friendly and will often give you some of",

          "It was raining and quite cold when we visited Chorsu Bazaar in Tashkent. So much to see and so much to buy. Great place to buy dry fruits and the variety is just endless. Some amount of bargaining is required and the shopkeepers are friendly and eager to please. They allow you",
          "I really wish I didn't waste my time. So many stalls selling junk and animals in disgusting conditions. Also a variety of roosters which have obviously been used for fighting. There is a great range of fruit, vegetables and spices which I enjoyed. Everything else was",
          "It\u2019s nothing special selling yet special experience. From farm fresh vegetables to 22 carat gold jewellery to horse meat to Adrus. You can come out without impulse buying. You can\u2019t call your Tashkent trip complete without visiting it. Souvenirs are cheaper then market and more",
          "This enormous covered market is amazing. It is on 2 levels. We were fortunate to be here in Ramadan when many of the stall are closed and many people do not come. At least we could walk around and see things - usually it is so crowded that getting around is tricky let alone",
          "worth visiting. The place where east meets west.There you can find everything, from food to clothing.It is so colorfull .",

          "Chorsu Bazaar is the best place in Tashkent where you can feel real Uzbekistan. Local food and very nice and friendly people.",
          "Chorsu Bazaar is touted as a must see in Tashkent but it was basically a huge big mess of a market place. As a tourist, there is a small section that sold crafts that would be interesting but most of the place was produce, dried good, and meat that wouldn\u2019t interest the visitor",
          "This must be one of the largest bazaars I've been to - and the variety was staggering - sections specialising from meat to vegetables to bread, sweets and dried fruits. Not to forget the usual market fare of clothing Very easy to get to as it's by the Chorsu metro",
          "Chorsu Bazaar is a huge market in Tashkent. You can buy just about anything in its many halls and rooms. The giant dome is very impressive. The bread making area is particularly interesting. A must for market lovers.",

          "Must go for spices and dry Fruits Bargaining is the norm here. However with prices being low it does not hurt to pay a few more som. It was quite hot in august even under the dome . I did not find many souvenir shops though.",
          "Market that has everything (starting from groceries and ending by souvenirs). Can\u2019t compare to other markets since haven\u2019t been there. Bought some local dried fruits - very tasty. Can\u2019t say it was cheap. Good place to see how locals do trade. Will definitely come again.",
          "Chorsu Bazar is a must for everyone who enjoys the open markets, who wants to taste the real, authentic, local food and local fruits. The best apricots we ever had were the one we found here! We tried the somsa and we had lunch in the bazar, where the local chefs cook on the",
          "I was there at the wrong time, about 2 in the afternoon, too hot to enjoy it much, it was a good place to get local souvenir.",
          "Useless place. Only for below poverty line people. Oversold , not good quality of dry fruits.Get much better in India",
          "We went there last month to buy dry fruits and bought a whole lot of them from different vendors as there are so many of them. Only after I got back did I realize that the quantities were far less actually. All the one kg packets ranged from 700-800 gm Buyers beware",

          "Nothing much to see there. Dont think it worth going there that much. Just go there if you have time or you never visit a fresh market.",

          "If you are an architecture buff than you should see this huge concrete and glass dome that covers the market hall. The market is on two levels and is spectacular. All kinds of stalls, from butchers to spices. If you want to buy nice raisins or sultana\u2019s go upstairs.",
          "This is a great place to buy fresh and dried fruits/nuts etc to take home. The different areas specialise in different products for example there are numerous bakeries, butchers, fruit and vegetable sellers etc The bazaar is very large with a great variety of choice and the",
          "The bazar is quite huge and separated into different \"topics\". Assumingly if you need supplies you will have tons of opportunities. Of course this also is a huge tourist spot and many shopkeeper know it, so that many of them try to attrackt you. I personally am no friend of this",

          "A proper bazaar with all sorts of different stuff. One part is currently under reconstruction, thus some entrances are filled with traders side by side. Feeling everything from hand-made exclusives to batteries and everyday items. The central dome is quite interesting,",
          "This market is a great window into daily Uzbek life, people going about their daily business. The market has a huge range of very high quality and beautifully presented goods. The selection of food is amazing. Pick up some fresh bread, literally straight out of the brick oven,",
          "This place could s big and the main hall is over two floors. Here you find fruit, veg, meat and yes also horse meat. On the upper floor dried fruit spices and all types of nuts. Amazing. Next to the main hall the market continues and offers many different products. Great picture",
          "Huge space with hundreds of stalls selling mainly food items such as: dried fruits, nuts, spices, fresh poultry, meat, fruit and vegetables. Good opportunity to take some nice photos.",
          "Chorsu is well worth a visit. It is subdivided in different parts, each with its own offering. The \"meat section\" in the big dome is amazing (though we doubt that the setting would pass the food safety tests of the EU). Nevertheless, it is a very interesting experience. Be",
          "There was much anticipation of going to Chorsu bazar but quite frankly, it was a let down. The stuff on sale was mostly low quality, cheap knock offs... T-shirts, purses, track pants, sun glasses etc. The local souvenirs were interesting tho. Surprisingly the best part of",
          "Made a quick stop at this market to try to look for some souvenirs. The market is split into different levels selling everything one can imagine. However, it\u2019s too big and too repetitive with many vendors selling the exact same thing. Not a very pushy environment where vendors",
          "The bazaar is worth visiting to experience local shopping. Under the main dome on the ground floor there is every type of meat you could imagine. Upstairs are the dried fruit & nuts. In a separate pavilion is the fruit & vegetables, all incredibly fresh.",

          "We went to Chorsu several times. We loved the diverse products, the goods and the cultural experience. We bought food there and a few Uzbek pieces such as clothes to bread stamps to bring home. A must see if visiting and a must do if living in Tashkent.",
          "This is where the locals come to shop. If you are looking for the typical souk type market or souvenirs, you will likely be disappointed. Although there are some \u201csouvenirs\u201d to be found (including some from others areas of Uzbekistan), they are mostly of the \u201cmade in China\u201d",
          "An original and authentic experience. Buy local almonds not to leave the place with empty hands. The most of the sellers are uzbek speaking only. Even knowledge of Russian doesn\u2019t help in half of the bargaining cases",

          "This bazaar has it all, people, traditional clothing, daily foods that the local eats (bread, meat, vegetables, dried fruits, nuts, spices), and many more. Be careful of pick-pocketing, put it in secure place, don't carry big bags. Better to have a local taking you there.",
          "Chorsu is your place for souvenirs if in Tashkent, don't get confused with the dome markets in there as Chorsu is a bit close to the underground station where as most of the domes are meat selling shops which also come under Chorsu! People are real honest and friendly!",
          "Wonderful place to see the food and wares of Uzbekistan. The fruit and vegetables are so vibrant, they look almost fake. Breads section is endless, with each vendor selling their own version of the local favorite. Great place to buy ceramics or embroidered items as well.",
          "Just roam around the place for whatever you want. Pin to piano almost every thing available. Cost effective and many stalls available in market. One of the tourist attractions. Of course you can find this type of market (street market) in almost every country but this is worth",
          "If you\u2019ve never been to a bazaar before, then this might be interesting. It\u2019s simply an open mall that sell cheap goods, nothing special other than it\u2019s cheap and outdoors. One word of caution though: I found most of the outdoor food to be horrible, and the people coming around",
          "Chorsu market is very interesting place. there you can not only see the appearance of endless rows with goods that are typical for Asia, but also a delicious snack. to visit Tashkent and not to go to Chorsu would be a mistake!",

          "Always great to go see markets to better understand local culture. This market is in a 'modern' building but spills into many other areas. Segmented by good it's a really interesting visit. Butchery on ground floor, Dried fruit and nots above. The stall owners fully expect you",
          "We browsed through the bazaar and were amazed at the variety of fresh produce,sweets, breads, etc that was available .a very colourful place to visit . The bakery was the highlight and the classic lepeshkas too tasty!",

          "The bazaar has many sections and its a huge place. Fruits, food, spices, clothes and whatever you need is available here. Its well organised i suppose but the lack of English speakers makes it difficult to convey one's needs. The food section has exotic stuff like horse meat",
          "Shopping from Chorsu Bazaar was like revisiting in History. Typical street market where you can buy almost anything.",
          "The bazaar was highly recommended by the hostel that we stayed in but really is more a place for those who live in Tashkent to buy their food and other needed items than for tourists to purview, there are some slightly touristy stalls but not many.",
          "This is not for beginners. Take good care of your belongings and bargain your way through the selection of foods and goods. Touting can be a bit annoying but nothing unusual. Scams are not uncommon but the experienced traveller has no problems identifying them. Maybe not the",
          "This is a great local market where the people of Tashkent convene to either sell their wares or buy their groceries. The market is organized by the type of item being sold. There are separate sections for fruit, vegetables, meats, nuts, and then there is a less-organized flea",
          "I bought some good quality embroidered goods here (accompanied by a specialist) and enjoyed the hustle and bustle of the place at the same time. There was also a travelling performing circus group there when I visited - pulling cars and doing gymnastics",
          "We shopped for all manner of nuts at the bazaars of Samarkand and Bukhara, but wished we'd done it all at Chorsu in Tashkent, where the prices we were able to haggle were the best, and the quality was just as good or better than at any of the others.",
          "Dirty, crowded, hot, stinky (in places), full of stuff you don't need - in other words a perfect Central Asian bazaar.",

        "wiki": "Tashkent (; Russian pronunciation: [t\u0250\u0282\u02c8k\u02b2ent]; Russian: \u0422\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442, tr. Tashkent), or Toshkent (Uzbek pronunciation: [t\u0252\u0283\u02c8kent]; Uzbek: Toshkent, \u0422\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442, \u062a\u0627\u0634\u0643\u06cc\u0646\u062a\u200e), is the capital and largest city of Uzbekistan, as well as the most populous city in ex-Soviet Central Asia, with a population in 2018 of 2,485,900. It is in northeastern Uzbekistan, near the border with Kazakhstan.\nBefore Islamic influence started in the mid 8th century AD, Tashkent was influenced by the Sogdian and Turkic cultures. After Genghis Khan destroyed it in 1219, it was rebuilt and profited from the Silk Road. From the 18th to the 19th century, the city became an independent city-state, before being re-conquered by the Khanate of Kokand. In 1865, Tashkent fell to the Russian Empire, and became the capital of Russian Turkestan. In Soviet times, it witnessed major growth and demographic changes due to forced deportations from throughout the Soviet Union. Much of Tashkent was destroyed in the 1966 Tashkent earthquake, but it was rebuilt as a model Soviet city. It was the fourth-largest city in the Soviet Union at the time, after Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev.\nToday, as the capital of an independent Uzbekistan, Tashkent retains a multiethnic population, with ethnic Uzbeks as the majority. In 2009, it celebrated its 2,200 years of written history.\n\n\n== History ==\nSee also: Timeline of Tashkent and History of TashkentDuring its long history, Tashkent has had various changes in names and political and religious affiliations.\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nTashkent was settled by ancient people as an oasis on the Chirchik River, near the foothills of the West Tian Shan Mountains. In ancient times, this area contained Beitian, probably the summer \"capital\" of the Kangju confederacy. Some scholars believe that a \"Stone Tower\" mentioned by Ptolemy and by other early accounts of travel on the Silk Road referred to this settlement (\"Tashkent\" means \"stone city\"). This tower is said to have marked the midway point between Europe and China. Other scholars, however, disagree with this identification, though it remains one of four most probable sites for the Stone Tower.\n\n\n=== History as Chach ===\nIn pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, the town and the province were known as Chach.  The Shahnameh of Ferdowsi also refers to the city as Chach.\nThe principality of Chach had a square citadel built around the 5th to 3rd centuries BC, some 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) south of the Syr Darya River. By the 7th century AD, Chach had more than 30 towns and a network of over 50 canals, forming a trade center between the Sogdians and Turkic nomads. The Buddhist monk Xuanzang (602/603? \u2013 664 AD), who travelled from China to India through Central Asia, mentioned the name of the city as Zh\u011bsh\u00ed (\u8d6d\u6642. The Chinese chronicles Book of Sui from the History of Northern Dynasties and Old Book of Tang, mention a possession called Sh\u00ed \u77f3 or Zh\u011bsh\u00ed \u8d6d\u6642 with a capital of the same name since the fifth century AD.In 751, the region was conquered by Muslim Arabs.\n\n\n=== Islamic history ===\nIn the mid-seventh century, the Sasanian Persian Empire collapsed as a result of the Arab Muslim conquest of Persia. Under the Samanid dynasty (819\u2013999), whose founder Saman Khuda was a Persian Zoroastrian convert to Islam, the city came to be known as Binkath. However, the Arabs retained the old name of Chach for the surrounding region, pronouncing it ash-Shash (\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0634) instead. Kand, qand, kent, kad, kath, kud\u2014all meaning a city\u2014are derived from the Persian/Sogdian \u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0647 kanda, meaning a town or a city. They are found in city names such as Samarkand, Yarkand, Panjakent, Khujand etc.). After the 16th century, the name evolved from Chachkand/Chashkand to Tashkand. The modern spelling of \"Tashkent\" reflects Russian orthography and 20th-century Soviet influence.\n\n\n=== Mongol conquest and aftermath ===\nThe city was destroyed by Genghis Khan in 1219 and lost much of its population as a result of the Mongols' destruction of the Khwarezmid Empire in 1220.  Under the Timurid and subsequent Shaybanid dynasties, the city's population and culture gradually revived as a prominent strategic center of scholarship, commerce and trade along the Silk Road.\n\n\n=== Kokand khanate ===\nIn 1809, Tashkent was annexed to the Khanate of Kokand. At the time, Tashkent had a population of around 100,000 and was considered the richest city in Central Asia. It prospered greatly through trade with Russia but chafed under Kokand's high taxes. The Tashkent clergy also favored the clergy of Bukhara over that of Kokand. However, before the Emir of Bukhara could capitalize on this discontent, the Russian army arrived.\n\n\n=== Tsarist period ===\n \nIn May 1865, Mikhail Grigorevich Chernyayev (Cherniaev), acting against the direct orders of the tsar and outnumbered at least 15\u20131, staged a daring night attack against a city with a wall 25 kilometres (16 mi) long with 11 gates and 30,000 defenders. While a small contingent staged a diversionary attack, the main force penetrated the walls, led by a Russian Orthodox priest. Although the defense was stiff, the Russians captured the city after two days of heavy fighting and the loss of only 25 dead as opposed to several thousand of the defenders (including Alimqul, the ruler of the Kokand Khanate). Chernyayev dubbed the \"Lion of Tashkent\" by city elders, staged a \"hearts-and-minds\" campaign to win the population over. He abolished taxes for a year, rode unarmed through the streets and bazaars meeting common people, and appointed himself \"Military Governor of Tashkent\", recommending to Tsar Alexander II that the city become an independent khanate under Russian protection.\nThe Tsar liberally rewarded Chernyayev and his men with medals and bonuses, but regarded the impulsive general as a \"loose cannon\", and soon replaced him with General Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman. Far from being granted independence, Tashkent became the capital of the new territory of Russian Turkistan, with Kaufman as first Governor-General. A cantonment and Russian settlement were built across the Ankhor Canal from the old city, and Russian settlers and merchants poured in. Tashkent was a center of espionage in the Great Game rivalry between Russia and the United Kingdom over Central Asia. The Turkestan Military District was established as part of the military reforms of 1874. The Trans-Caspian Railway arrived in 1889, and the railway workers who built it settled in Tashkent as well, bringing with them the seeds of Bolshevik Revolution.\n\n\n=== Effect of the Russian revolution ===\n\nWith the fall of the Russian Empire, the Russian Provisional Government removed all civil restrictions based on religion and nationality, contributing to local enthusiasm for the February Revolution. The Tashkent Soviet of Soldiers' and Workers' Deputies was soon set up, but primarily represented Russian residents, who made up about a fifth of the Tashkent population. Muslim leaders quickly set up the Tashkent Muslim Council (Tashkand Shura-yi-Islamiya) based in the old city. On 10 March 1917, there was a parade with Russian workers marching with red flags, Russian soldiers singing La Marseillaise and thousands of local Central Asians. Following various speeches, Governor-General Aleksey Kuropatkin closed the events with words \"Long Live a great free Russia\".The First Turkestan Muslim Conference was held in Tashkent 16\u201320 April 1917. Like the Muslim Council, it was dominated by the Jadid, Muslim reformers. A more conservative faction emerged in Tashkent centered around the Ulema. This faction proved more successful during the local elections of July 1917. They formed an alliance with Russian conservatives, while the Soviet became more radical. The Soviet attempt to seize power in September 1917 proved unsuccessful.In April 1918, Tashkent became the capital of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkestan ASSR). The new regime was threatened by White forces, basmachi; revolts from within, and purges ordered from Moscow. In 1930, Tashkent fell within the borders of the Uzbek SSR, and became the capital of the Uzbek SSR, displacing Samarkand.\n\n\n=== Soviet period ===\n\nThe city began to industrialize in the 1920s and 1930s.\nViolating the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. The government worked to relocate factories from western Russia and Ukraine to Tashkent to preserve the Soviet industrial capacity. This led to great increase in industry during World War II.\nIt also evacuated most of the German communist emigres to Tashkent. The Russian population increased dramatically; evacuees from the war zones increased the total population of Tashkent to well over a million. Russians and Ukrainians eventually comprised more than half of the total residents of Tashkent. Many of the former refugees stayed in Tashkent to live after the war, rather than return to former homes.\nDuring the postwar period, the Soviet Union established numerous scientific and engineering facilities in Tashkent.\nOn 10 January 1966, then Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistan President Ayub Khan signed a pact in Tashkent with Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin as the mediator to resolve the terms of peace after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. On the next day, Shastri died suddenly, reportedly due to a heart attack. It is widely speculated that Shastri was killed by poisoning the water he drank.Much of Tashkent's old city was destroyed by a powerful earthquake on 26 April 1966. More than 300,000 residents were left homeless, and some 78,000 poorly engineered homes were destroyed, mainly in the densely populated areas of the old city where traditional adobe housing predominated. The Soviet republics, and some other countries such as Finland, sent \"battalions of fraternal peoples\" and urban planners to help rebuild devastated Tashkent.\nTashkent was rebuilt as a model Soviet city with wide streets planted with shade trees, parks, immense plazas for parades, fountains, monuments, and acres of apartment blocks. The Tashkent Metro was also built during this time. About 100,000 new homes were built by 1970, but the builders occupied many, rather than the homeless residents of Tashkent. Further development in the following years increased the size of the city with major new developments in the Chilonzor area, north-east and south-east of the city.At the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Tashkent was the fourth-largest city in the USSR and a center of learning in the fields of science and engineering.\nDue to the 1966 earthquake and the Soviet redevelopment, little architectural heritage has survived of Tashkent's ancient history. Few structures mark its significance as a trading point on the historic Silk Road.\n\n\n=== Capital of Uzbekistan ===\nTashkent is the capital of and the most cosmopolitan city in Uzbekistan. It was noted for its tree-lined streets, numerous fountains, and pleasant parks, at least until the tree-cutting campaigns initiated in 2009 by the local government.\n\nSince 1991, the city has changed economically, culturally, and architecturally. New development has superseded or replaced icons of the Soviet era. The largest statue ever erected for Lenin was replaced with a globe, featuring a geographic map of Uzbekistan. Buildings from the Soviet era have been replaced with new modern buildings. The \"Downtown Tashkent\" district includes the 22-story NBU Bank building, international hotels, the International Business Center, and the Plaza Building.\n\nThe Tashkent Business district is a special district, established for the development of small, medium and large businesses in Uzbekistan. In 2018, was started to build a Tashkent city (new Downtown) which would include a new business district with skyscrapers of local and foreign companies, world hotels, apartments, biggest mall, shops and other entertainments. The construction of the International Business Center is planned to be completed by the end of 2021  Fitch assigns \u201cBB-\u201d rating to Tashkent city, \u201cStable\u201d forecast In 2007, Tashkent was named a \"cultural capital of the Islamic world\" by Moscow News, as the city has numerous historic mosques and significant Islamic sites, including the Islamic University. Tashkent holds the Samarkand Kufic Quran, one of the earliest written copies of the Quran, which has been located in the city since 1924.Tashkent is the most visited city in the country, and has greatly benefited from increasing tourism as a result of reforms under president Shavkat Mirziyoyev and opening up by making visas easier for foreigners.\n\n\n=== Tashkent over the years ===\nDevelopment of Tashkent\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Origin of television ==\nThe first demonstration of a fully electronic TV set to the public was made in Tashkent in summer 1928 by Boris Grabovsky and his team. In his method that had been patented in Saratov in 1925, Boris Grabovsky proposed a new principle of TV imaging based on the vertical and horizontal electron beam sweeping under high voltage. Nowadays this principle of the TV imaging is used practically in all modern cathode-ray tubes. Historian and ethnographer Boris Golender (\u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440 in Russian), in a video lecture, described this event. This date of demonstration of the fully electronic TV set is the earliest known so far. Despite this fact, most modern historians disputably consider Vladimir Zworykin and Philo Farnsworth as inventors of the first fully electronic TV set. In 1964, the contribution made to the development of early television by Grabovsky was officially acknowledged by the Uzbek government and he was awarded the prestigious degree \"Honorable Inventor of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic\".\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Geography ===\nTashkent is situated in a well-watered plain on the road between Samarkand, Uzbekistan's second city, and Shymkent across the border. Tashkent is just 13 km from two border crossings into Kazakhstan. Closest geographic cities with populations of over 1 million are: Shymkent (Kazakhstan), Dushanbe (Tajikistan), Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan), Kashgar (China), Almaty (Kazakhstan), Kabul (Afghanistan) and Peshawar (Pakistan).\nTashkent sits at the confluence of the Chirchiq River and several of its tributaries and is built on deep alluvial deposits up to 15 metres (49 ft). The city is located in an active tectonic area suffering large numbers of tremors and some earthquakes.\nThe local time in Tashkent is UTC/GMT +5 hours.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTashkent features a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) bordering a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dsa). As a result, Tashkent experiences cold and often snowy winters not typically associated with most Mediterranean climates and long, hot and dry summers. Winters are cold and often snowy, covering the months of December, January and February. Most precipitation occurs during these months which frequently falls as snow. The city experiences two peaks of precipitation in the early winter and spring. The slightly unusual precipitation pattern is partially due to its 500 m (roughly 1600 feet) altitude. Summers are long in Tashkent, usually lasting from May to September. Tashkent can be extremely hot during the months of July and August. The city also sees very little precipitation during the summer, particularly from June through September.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn 1983, the population of Tashkent amounted to 1,902,000 people living in a municipal area of 256 km2 (99 sq mi). By 1991, (break-up of Soviet Union) the number of permanent residents of the capital had grown to approximately 2,136,600. Tashkent was the fourth most populated city in the former USSR, after Moscow, Leningrad (St. Petersburg), and Kiev. Nowadays, Tashkent remains the fourth most populous city in the CIS and Baltic countries. The population of the city was 2,295,300 people in 2004.As of 2008, the demographic structure of Tashkent was as follows:\n\n63.0% \u2013 Uzbeks\n20.0% \u2013 Russians\n4.5% \u2013 Tatars\n2.2% \u2013 Koryo-saram (Koreans)\n2.1% \u2013 Tajiks\n1.2% \u2013 Uighurs\n7.0% \u2013 other ethnic backgroundsRussian and Uzbek are both the main spoken languages. As with most of Uzbekistan, street signs and other things are often a mix of Latin and Cyrillic scripts.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\nTashkent is divided into the following districts (Uzbek: Tuman):\n\nAt the time of the Tsarist take over it had four districts (Uzbek daha):\n\nBeshyoghoch\nKukcha\nShaykhontokhur\nSebzorIn 1940 it had the following districts (Russian \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d):\n\nOktyabr\nKirov\nStalin\nFrunze\nLenin\nKuybishevBy 1981 they were reorganized into:\nBektemir\nAkmal-Ikramov (Uchtepa)\nKhamza (Yashnobod)\nLenin (Mirobod)\nKuybishev (Mirzo Ulugbek)\nSergeli\nOktober (Shaykhontokhur)\nSobir Rakhimov (Olmazar)\nChilanzar\nFrunze (Yakkasaray)\nKirov (Yunusabad)\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nDue to the destruction of most of the ancient city during the 1917 revolution and, later, the 1966 earthquake, little remains of Tashkent's traditional architectural heritage. Tashkent is, however, rich in museums and Soviet-era monuments. They include:\n\nKukeldash Madrasah. Dating back to the reign of Abdullah Khan II (1557\u20131598) it is being restored by the provincial Religious Board of Mawarannahr Moslems. There is talk of making it into a museum, but it is currently being used as a madrassah.\nChorsu Bazaar, located near the Kukeldash Madrassa. This huge open air bazaar is the center of the old town of Tashkent. Everything imaginable is for sale. It is one of the major tourist attractions of the city.\nTelyashayakh Mosque (Khast Imam Mosque).  It Contains the Uthman Qur'an, considered to be the oldest extant Qur'an in the world. Dating from 655 and stained with the blood of murdered caliph, Uthman, it was brought by Timur to Samarkand, seized by the Russians as a war trophy and taken to Saint Petersburg. It was returned to Uzbekistan in 1924.\nYunus Khan Mausoleum. It is a group of three 15th-century mausoleums, restored in the 19th century. The biggest is the grave of Yunus Khan, grandfather of Mughal Empire founder Babur.\nPalace of Prince Romanov. During the 19th century Grand Duke Nikolai Konstantinovich, a first cousin of Alexander III of Russia was banished to Tashkent for some shady deals involving the Russian Crown Jewels. His palace still survives in the centre of the city. Once a museum, it has been appropriated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nAlisher Navoi Opera and Ballet Theatre, built by the same architect who designed Lenin's Tomb in Moscow, Aleksey Shchusev, with Japanese prisoner of war labor in World War II. It hosts Russian ballet and opera.\nFine Arts Museum of Uzbekistan. It contains a major collection of art from the pre-Russian period, including Sogdian murals, Buddhist statues and Zoroastrian art, along with a more modern collection of 19th and 20th century applied art, such as suzani embroidered hangings. Of more interest is the large collection of paintings \"borrowed\" from the Hermitage by Grand Duke Romanov to decorate his palace in exile in Tashkent, and never returned. Behind the museum is a small park, containing the neglected graves of the Bolsheviks who died in the Russian Revolution of 1917 and to Osipov's treachery in 1919, along with first Uzbekistani President Yuldosh Akhunbabayev.\nMuseum of Applied Arts. Housed in a traditional house originally commissioned for a wealthy tsarist diplomat, the house itself is the main attraction, rather than its collection of 19th and 20th century applied arts.\nState Museum of History of Uzbekistan the largest museum in the city. It is housed in the ex-Lenin Museum.\nAmir Timur Museum, housed in a building with brilliant blue dome and ornate interior. It houses exhibits of Timur and of President Islam Karimov. The gardens outside contain a statue of Timur on horseback, surrounded by some of the nicest gardens and fountains in the city.\nNavoi Literary Museum, commemorating Uzbekistan's adopted literary hero, Alisher Navoi, with replica manuscripts, Islamic calligraphy and 15th century miniature paintings.\nThe Tashkent Metro is known for extravagant design and architecture in the buildings. Taking photos in the system was banned until 2018.The Russian Orthodox church in Amir Temur Square, built in 1898, was demolished in 2009. The building had not been allowed to be used for religious purposes since the 1920s due to the anti-religious campaign conducted across the former Soviet Union by the Bolshevik (communist) government in Moscow. During the Soviet period the building was used for different non-religious purposes; after independence it was a bank.\nTashkent also has a World War II memorial park and a Defender of Motherland monument.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMost important scientific institutions of Uzbekistan, such as the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan, are located in Tashkent. There are several universities and institutions of higher education:\n\nThe Branch of the Russian State University of Oil and Gas (NRU) named after I.M.

        "wiki": "The Amir Timur Museum is located in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan. It opened in 1996, and is dedicated to the Mongol warlord Amir Timur (Tamerlane).\n\n\n== Origin ==\nAfter Uzbekistan became independent in 1991, much attention was given to the revival of the nation's spiritual and cultural heritage, including recognition of historical persons who had an important role in world civilization. Among those was Amir Temur, the warlord, politician and reformer, patron of science, education, trade, culture, and craft. Having established a great centralized state, he strengthened its power and also united many nations and people. Amir Temur's rule promoted science, education, culture, architecture, fine arts, music and poetry, laying the foundations of the Timurid Renaissance.\nFormer President Islam Karimov encouraged celebration of Timur, linking the Mongol ruler's achievements with the President's own style of governance. Karimov declared 1996 to be the \u201cYear of Amir Temur\u201d, and the 660th anniversary was widely celebrated in Uzbekistan, and the republic subsequently resolved to build a state museum in central Tashkent, featuring the Timurid history.\n\n\n== Opening ==\nThe ceremonial opening of the round museum structure was held on 18 October 1996 in the presence of Uzbek people and foreign guests. President Karimov stated that, \"The State Museum of the History of the Temurids which is opening in such a holiday conditions is the real result of the fact that in our country the historical justice towards the personality of Sahibkiran has triumphed\". He compared Amir Temur Square to a ring, saying \"the Museum is a precious stone decorating it\u201d.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe museum's blue cupola resembles that of the Gur-e-Amir mausoleum in Samarkand. Though the museum was built according to the traditions of medieval architecture, it satisfies modern requirements.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\n\nThere are more than 5,000 artifacts in the museum collection, with more than 2,000 displayed in museum exhibition halls. In particular, the museum displays focus on the genealogy of Amir Temur, his coming to power, the military campaigns of Sahib Kiran, diplomatic and trade relations, workmanship, city improvement and landscaping, and science and education development. There are also exhibits related to representatives of the Timurid dynasty, including maps, weapons, copper and silver coins, miniatures, rare manuscripts, potteries, and jewelry.\n\n\n== Visitors ==\nThe museum attracts more than 2 million visitors annually. It is visited by foreign statesmen and official delegations, and more than 800 such delegations have been recorded in the museum guest book.\n\n\n== International links ==\nThrough participation in international exhibitions, the museum has promoted its material and spiritual heritage around the world. In particular, unique exhibits were displayed at the international exhibitions as \"Timurid Renaissance\" in France; at Expo 2000 in Hannover, Germany; and \"Bright colors: fabrics and ceramics from Central Asia\" at the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia.\n\n\n== Education and research ==\nThe museum carries out educational work with young people, encouraging respect and love towards heritage, history, and historical figures. To this end, the museum holds spiritual enlightenment activities in collaboration with schools, colleges, and lyceums.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMuseum of Amir Timur at Aba Travel Media related to Amir Timur Museum at Wikimedia Commons",

          "Calling this a historical museum is very generous. The building is impressive and grandiose (and slightly tacky) but it is mainly an exhibition to promote Amir Timur. There are very few old artifacts - the majority of items are modern (and artistically dubious) and are meant to",

          "When I visited the entrance fee was 6000 som, and the fee to take photos was 10000 som. Argh. I hate fees like that. The very middle of this building is absolutely gorgeous, I kept staring up. The displays show some of Uzbek history quite well, its definitely worth seeing",

          "It's worth the admission fee just to see the grand foyer with the best chandelier in all of Uzbekistan. I wouldn't bother with the photo permit. By the time they approach you about it, the deed will have already be done, you claim ignorant tourist, and there's not really much",

          "The life and times of Tamerlane is an amazing story. This museum falls well short of doing the story justice. There are not a lot of exhibits and there is no story weaved around the exhibits. The upside of the museum is the spectacular interior. If you have a spare half an hour",
          "The contend of the museum was ok but the building was superb. You need to pay to take pictures and they are awake here. It is worth the cost and you will not regret it. There are two floors and it will not are you about one hour to see all. Great place.",

          "Please carry your kids school badges as you can get a serious discount from the foreign tourist price if you have student passes. It is a very pretty building in the old Soviet syte. Museum on ground floor with an encircling balcony on the first floor. Basement has an auditorium",
          "Given the limited resources this museum works hard to tell the story of the ancient kingdom and uses what it has imaginatively. The (human) guide was very informative. At first she seemed to set off by autopilot on a set description of the displays one by one so I had to stop",
          "A humble collection of Timurid history. The building is centrally located and can be accessed easily. No tickets required here. The building is new and displays the family tree of the Timurid dynasty.",

          "Of all the museums we visited this one had the most glaringly obvious propaganda. Timur's memory seems to be used well and truly to imbue the visitor with the 'correct' attitudes and opinions. Handy to access from the park but the entrance door is on the lower ground floor, so",
          "To be honest, expected a bit more. Price is very ok, but hardly seen anything about his conquering the world. It seemed more a general museum rather than about him. Tool a guide, bought a photo license and two tickets, but weren't super excited about it. Wonderful, great",
          "This is a beautiful museum which houses some of the oldest manuscripts and Quran of Khaliph Osman ( AS) as well as artifacts. It is a very impressive building in itself with a classic blue dome that cannot be missed. Worth a visit.",

          "The iconic modern architecture of this museum, built in 1996, appears on the 1000 Som note; it is a museum that highlights the historical significance of Timur (Tamerlane), who is significant not only to the history of Uzbekistan, but whose empire extended into Anatolia",

          "Impressive dome with magnificent decoration. The museum hoist few ancient manuscripts and some ceramics. There was a time around the 14th - 15th century in which Amir Timur ruled Asia from Turkey to China ... and that's all. Worth the visit because it is the core Uzbek culture.",
          "This museum was designed as a replica of Amir Temur's Crown. A worthy building to view while on Amir Temur Square.",
          "If for no other reason than to see the eye brows of Timur (Tamurlane the Great) this is worth a visit!",
          "The building is impressive and it's definitely worth a visit. I wouldn't call it a priority though. The artefacts in the museum are all (but a few) replicas since the originals are kept in the museums around the world.",
          "Went there not knowing what to expect. Cheap to get into, BUT, to take photos you have to pay and extra 2000 som (about 70c). they check if you have a photo ticket. Very interesting and you feel a bit sorry for them as a lot of the exhibits are copies. the originals have",

Unlike other mosque, the main color theme is white delicately adorned with navy blue patterns. Unfortunately, it takes around 20-30 minutes walk from the nearest subway station. Yet, if you have time, I recommend a visit!",
          "Beautiful, traditional-style mosque with modern traits built in 2014. You're welcome to come have a look even if you have no business praying or doing other islam-related activities.",
          "Very comfortable and big mosque in the heart of Tashkent, Uzbekistan.",
          "Great impressions. It's a must for any guest of Tashkent to visit this devoted place. It's a beautiful white mosque Minor. Met there the bosh imom (the chief imam) Rahimberdy. \nEverything starting from taharat (self-cleaning facilities) till architecture and athmosphere around is so nice."

        "wiki": "Tashkent (; Russian pronunciation: [t\u0250\u0282\u02c8k\u02b2ent]; Russian: \u0422\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442, tr. Tashkent), or Toshkent (Uzbek pronunciation: [t\u0252\u0283\u02c8kent]; Uzbek: Toshkent, \u0422\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442, \u062a\u0627\u0634\u0643\u06cc\u0646\u062a\u200e), is the capital and largest city of Uzbekistan, as well as the most populous city in ex-Soviet Central Asia, with a population in 2018 of 2,485,900. It is in northeastern Uzbekistan, near the border with Kazakhstan.\nBefore Islamic influence started in the mid 8th century AD, Tashkent was influenced by the Sogdian and Turkic cultures. After Genghis Khan destroyed it in 1219, it was rebuilt and profited from the Silk Road. From the 18th to the 19th century, the city became an independent city-state, before being re-conquered by the Khanate of Kokand. In 1865, Tashkent fell to the Russian Empire, and became the capital of Russian Turkestan. In Soviet times, it witnessed major growth and demographic changes due to forced deportations from throughout the Soviet Union. Much of Tashkent was destroyed in the 1966 Tashkent earthquake, but it was rebuilt as a model Soviet city. It was the fourth-largest city in the Soviet Union at the time, after Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev.\nToday, as the capital of an independent Uzbekistan, Tashkent retains a multiethnic population, with ethnic Uzbeks as the majority. In 2009, it celebrated its 2,200 years of written history.\n\n\n== History ==\nSee also: Timeline of Tashkent and History of TashkentDuring its long history, Tashkent has had various changes in names and political and religious affiliations.\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nTashkent was settled by ancient people as an oasis on the Chirchik River, near the foothills of the West Tian Shan Mountains. In ancient times, this area contained Beitian, probably the summer \"capital\" of the Kangju confederacy. Some scholars believe that a \"Stone Tower\" mentioned by Ptolemy and by other early accounts of travel on the Silk Road referred to this settlement (\"Tashkent\" means \"stone city\"). This tower is said to have marked the midway point between Europe and China. Other scholars, however, disagree with this identification, though it remains one of four most probable sites for the Stone Tower.\n\n\n=== History as Chach ===\nIn pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, the town and the province were known as Chach.  The Shahnameh of Ferdowsi also refers to the city as Chach.\nThe principality of Chach had a square citadel built around the 5th to 3rd centuries BC, some 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) south of the Syr Darya River. By the 7th century AD, Chach had more than 30 towns and a network of over 50 canals, forming a trade center between the Sogdians and Turkic nomads. The Buddhist monk Xuanzang (602/603? \u2013 664 AD), who travelled from China to India through Central Asia, mentioned the name of the city as Zh\u011bsh\u00ed (\u8d6d\u6642. The Chinese chronicles Book of Sui from the History of Northern Dynasties and Old Book of Tang, mention a possession called Sh\u00ed \u77f3 or Zh\u011bsh\u00ed \u8d6d\u6642 with a capital of the same name since the fifth century AD.In 751, the region was conquered by Muslim Arabs.\n\n\n=== Islamic history ===\nIn the mid-seventh century, the Sasanian Persian Empire collapsed as a result of the Arab Muslim conquest of Persia. Under the Samanid dynasty (819\u2013999), whose founder Saman Khuda was a Persian Zoroastrian convert to Islam, the city came to be known as Binkath. However, the Arabs retained the old name of Chach for the surrounding region, pronouncing it ash-Shash (\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0634) instead. Kand, qand, kent, kad, kath, kud\u2014all meaning a city\u2014are derived from the Persian/Sogdian \u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0647 kanda, meaning a town or a city. They are found in city names such as Samarkand, Yarkand, Panjakent, Khujand etc.). After the 16th century, the name evolved from Chachkand/Chashkand to Tashkand. The modern spelling of \"Tashkent\" reflects Russian orthography and 20th-century Soviet influence.\n\n\n=== Mongol conquest and aftermath ===\nThe city was destroyed by Genghis Khan in 1219 and lost much of its population as a result of the Mongols' destruction of the Khwarezmid Empire in 1220.  Under the Timurid and subsequent Shaybanid dynasties, the city's population and culture gradually revived as a prominent strategic center of scholarship, commerce and trade along the Silk Road.\n\n\n=== Kokand khanate ===\nIn 1809, Tashkent was annexed to the Khanate of Kokand. At the time, Tashkent had a population of around 100,000 and was considered the richest city in Central Asia. It prospered greatly through trade with Russia but chafed under Kokand's high taxes. The Tashkent clergy also favored the clergy of Bukhara over that of Kokand. However, before the Emir of Bukhara could capitalize on this discontent, the Russian army arrived.\n\n\n=== Tsarist period ===\n \nIn May 1865, Mikhail Grigorevich Chernyayev (Cherniaev), acting against the direct orders of the tsar and outnumbered at least 15\u20131, staged a daring night attack against a city with a wall 25 kilometres (16 mi) long with 11 gates and 30,000 defenders. While a small contingent staged a diversionary attack, the main force penetrated the walls, led by a Russian Orthodox priest. Although the defense was stiff, the Russians captured the city after two days of heavy fighting and the loss of only 25 dead as opposed to several thousand of the defenders (including Alimqul, the ruler of the Kokand Khanate). Chernyayev dubbed the \"Lion of Tashkent\" by city elders, staged a \"hearts-and-minds\" campaign to win the population over. He abolished taxes for a year, rode unarmed through the streets and bazaars meeting common people, and appointed himself \"Military Governor of Tashkent\", recommending to Tsar Alexander II that the city become an independent khanate under Russian protection.\nThe Tsar liberally rewarded Chernyayev and his men with medals and bonuses, but regarded the impulsive general as a \"loose cannon\", and soon replaced him with General Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman. Far from being granted independence, Tashkent became the capital of the new territory of Russian Turkistan, with Kaufman as first Governor-General. A cantonment and Russian settlement were built across the Ankhor Canal from the old city, and Russian settlers and merchants poured in. Tashkent was a center of espionage in the Great Game rivalry between Russia and the United Kingdom over Central Asia. The Turkestan Military District was established as part of the military reforms of 1874. The Trans-Caspian Railway arrived in 1889, and the railway workers who built it settled in Tashkent as well, bringing with them the seeds of Bolshevik Revolution.\n\n\n=== Effect of the Russian revolution ===\n\nWith the fall of the Russian Empire, the Russian Provisional Government removed all civil restrictions based on religion and nationality, contributing to local enthusiasm for the February Revolution. The Tashkent Soviet of Soldiers' and Workers' Deputies was soon set up, but primarily represented Russian residents, who made up about a fifth of the Tashkent population. Muslim leaders quickly set up the Tashkent Muslim Council (Tashkand Shura-yi-Islamiya) based in the old city. On 10 March 1917, there was a parade with Russian workers marching with red flags, Russian soldiers singing La Marseillaise and thousands of local Central Asians. Following various speeches, Governor-General Aleksey Kuropatkin closed the events with words \"Long Live a great free Russia\".The First Turkestan Muslim Conference was held in Tashkent 16\u201320 April 1917. Like the Muslim Council, it was dominated by the Jadid, Muslim reformers. A more conservative faction emerged in Tashkent centered around the Ulema. This faction proved more successful during the local elections of July 1917. They formed an alliance with Russian conservatives, while the Soviet became more radical. The Soviet attempt to seize power in September 1917 proved unsuccessful.In April 1918, Tashkent became the capital of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkestan ASSR). The new regime was threatened by White forces, basmachi; revolts from within, and purges ordered from Moscow. In 1930, Tashkent fell within the borders of the Uzbek SSR, and became the capital of the Uzbek SSR, displacing Samarkand.\n\n\n=== Soviet period ===\n\nThe city began to industrialize in the 1920s and 1930s.\nViolating the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. The government worked to relocate factories from western Russia and Ukraine to Tashkent to preserve the Soviet industrial capacity. This led to great increase in industry during World War II.\nIt also evacuated most of the German communist emigres to Tashkent. The Russian population increased dramatically; evacuees from the war zones increased the total population of Tashkent to well over a million. Russians and Ukrainians eventually comprised more than half of the total residents of Tashkent. Many of the former refugees stayed in Tashkent to live after the war, rather than return to former homes.\nDuring the postwar period, the Soviet Union established numerous scientific and engineering facilities in Tashkent.\nOn 10 January 1966, then Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistan President Ayub Khan signed a pact in Tashkent with Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin as the mediator to resolve the terms of peace after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. On the next day, Shastri died suddenly, reportedly due to a heart attack. It is widely speculated that Shastri was killed by poisoning the water he drank.Much of Tashkent's old city was destroyed by a powerful earthquake on 26 April 1966. More than 300,000 residents were left homeless, and some 78,000 poorly engineered homes were destroyed, mainly in the densely populated areas of the old city where traditional adobe housing predominated. The Soviet republics, and some other countries such as Finland, sent \"battalions of fraternal peoples\" and urban planners to help rebuild devastated Tashkent.\nTashkent was rebuilt as a model Soviet city with wide streets planted with shade trees, parks, immense plazas for parades, fountains, monuments, and acres of apartment blocks. The Tashkent Metro was also built during this time. About 100,000 new homes were built by 1970, but the builders occupied many, rather than the homeless residents of Tashkent. Further development in the following years increased the size of the city with major new developments in the Chilonzor area, north-east and south-east of the city.At the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Tashkent was the fourth-largest city in the USSR and a center of learning in the fields of science and engineering.\nDue to the 1966 earthquake and the Soviet redevelopment, little architectural heritage has survived of Tashkent's ancient history. Few structures mark its significance as a trading point on the historic Silk Road.\n\n\n=== Capital of Uzbekistan ===\nTashkent is the capital of and the most cosmopolitan city in Uzbekistan. It was noted for its tree-lined streets, numerous fountains, and pleasant parks, at least until the tree-cutting campaigns initiated in 2009 by the local government.\n\nSince 1991, the city has changed economically, culturally, and architecturally. New development has superseded or replaced icons of the Soviet era. The largest statue ever erected for Lenin was replaced with a globe, featuring a geographic map of Uzbekistan. Buildings from the Soviet era have been replaced with new modern buildings. The \"Downtown Tashkent\" district includes the 22-story NBU Bank building, international hotels, the International Business Center, and the Plaza Building.\n\nThe Tashkent Business district is a special district, established for the development of small, medium and large businesses in Uzbekistan. In 2018, was started to build a Tashkent city (new Downtown) which would include a new business district with skyscrapers of local and foreign companies, world hotels, apartments, biggest mall, shops and other entertainments. The construction of the International Business Center is planned to be completed by the end of 2021  Fitch assigns \u201cBB-\u201d rating to Tashkent city, \u201cStable\u201d forecast In 2007, Tashkent was named a \"cultural capital of the Islamic world\" by Moscow News, as the city has numerous historic mosques and significant Islamic sites, including the Islamic University. Tashkent holds the Samarkand Kufic Quran, one of the earliest written copies of the Quran, which has been located in the city since 1924.Tashkent is the most visited city in the country, and has greatly benefited from increasing tourism as a result of reforms under president Shavkat Mirziyoyev and opening up by making visas easier for foreigners.\n\n\n=== Tashkent over the years ===\nDevelopment of Tashkent\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Origin of television ==\nThe first demonstration of a fully electronic TV set to the public was made in Tashkent in summer 1928 by Boris Grabovsky and his team. In his method that had been patented in Saratov in 1925, Boris Grabovsky proposed a new principle of TV imaging based on the vertical and horizontal electron beam sweeping under high voltage. Nowadays this principle of the TV imaging is used practically in all modern cathode-ray tubes. Historian and ethnographer Boris Golender (\u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440 in Russian), in a video lecture, described this event. This date of demonstration of the fully electronic TV set is the earliest known so far. Despite this fact, most modern historians disputably consider Vladimir Zworykin and Philo Farnsworth as inventors of the first fully electronic TV set. In 1964, the contribution made to the development of early television by Grabovsky was officially acknowledged by the Uzbek government and he was awarded the prestigious degree \"Honorable Inventor of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic\".\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Geography ===\nTashkent is situated in a well-watered plain on the road between Samarkand, Uzbekistan's second city, and Shymkent across the border. Tashkent is just 13 km from two border crossings into Kazakhstan. Closest geographic cities with populations of over 1 million are: Shymkent (Kazakhstan), Dushanbe (Tajikistan), Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan), Kashgar (China), Almaty (Kazakhstan), Kabul (Afghanistan) and Peshawar (Pakistan).\nTashkent sits at the confluence of the Chirchiq River and several of its tributaries and is built on deep alluvial deposits up to 15 metres (49 ft). The city is located in an active tectonic area suffering large numbers of tremors and some earthquakes.\nThe local time in Tashkent is UTC/GMT +5 hours.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTashkent features a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) bordering a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dsa). As a result, Tashkent experiences cold and often snowy winters not typically associated with most Mediterranean climates and long, hot and dry summers. Winters are cold and often snowy, covering the months of December, January and February. Most precipitation occurs during these months which frequently falls as snow. The city experiences two peaks of precipitation in the early winter and spring. The slightly unusual precipitation pattern is partially due to its 500 m (roughly 1600 feet) altitude. Summers are long in Tashkent, usually lasting from May to September. Tashkent can be extremely hot during the months of July and August. The city also sees very little precipitation during the summer, particularly from June through September.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn 1983, the population of Tashkent amounted to 1,902,000 people living in a municipal area of 256 km2 (99 sq mi). By 1991, (break-up of Soviet Union) the number of permanent residents of the capital had grown to approximately 2,136,600. Tashkent was the fourth most populated city in the former USSR, after Moscow, Leningrad (St. Petersburg), and Kiev. Nowadays, Tashkent remains the fourth most populous city in the CIS and Baltic countries. The population of the city was 2,295,300 people in 2004.As of 2008, the demographic structure of Tashkent was as follows:\n\n63.0% \u2013 Uzbeks\n20.0% \u2013 Russians\n4.5% \u2013 Tatars\n2.2% \u2013 Koryo-saram (Koreans)\n2.1% \u2013 Tajiks\n1.2% \u2013 Uighurs\n7.0% \u2013 other ethnic backgroundsRussian and Uzbek are both the main spoken languages. As with most of Uzbekistan, street signs and other things are often a mix of Latin and Cyrillic scripts.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\nTashkent is divided into the following districts (Uzbek: Tuman):\n\nAt the time of the Tsarist take over it had four districts (Uzbek daha):\n\nBeshyoghoch\nKukcha\nShaykhontokhur\nSebzorIn 1940 it had the following districts (Russian \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d):\n\nOktyabr\nKirov\nStalin\nFrunze\nLenin\nKuybishevBy 1981 they were reorganized into:\nBektemir\nAkmal-Ikramov (Uchtepa)\nKhamza (Yashnobod)\nLenin (Mirobod)\nKuybishev (Mirzo Ulugbek)\nSergeli\nOktober (Shaykhontokhur)\nSobir Rakhimov (Olmazar)\nChilanzar\nFrunze (Yakkasaray)\nKirov (Yunusabad)\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nDue to the destruction of most of the ancient city during the 1917 revolution and, later, the 1966 earthquake, little remains of Tashkent's traditional architectural heritage. Tashkent is, however, rich in museums and Soviet-era monuments. They include:\n\nKukeldash Madrasah. Dating back to the reign of Abdullah Khan II (1557\u20131598) it is being restored by the provincial Religious Board of Mawarannahr Moslems. There is talk of making it into a museum, but it is currently being used as a madrassah.\nChorsu Bazaar, located near the Kukeldash Madrassa. This huge open air bazaar is the center of the old town of Tashkent. Everything imaginable is for sale. It is one of the major tourist attractions of the city.\nTelyashayakh Mosque (Khast Imam Mosque).  It Contains the Uthman Qur'an, considered to be the oldest extant Qur'an in the world. Dating from 655 and stained with the blood of murdered caliph, Uthman, it was brought by Timur to Samarkand, seized by the Russians as a war trophy and taken to Saint Petersburg. It was returned to Uzbekistan in 1924.\nYunus Khan Mausoleum. It is a group of three 15th-century mausoleums, restored in the 19th century. The biggest is the grave of Yunus Khan, grandfather of Mughal Empire founder Babur.\nPalace of Prince Romanov. During the 19th century Grand Duke Nikolai Konstantinovich, a first cousin of Alexander III of Russia was banished to Tashkent for some shady deals involving the Russian Crown Jewels. His palace still survives in the centre of the city. Once a museum, it has been appropriated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nAlisher Navoi Opera and Ballet Theatre, built by the same architect who designed Lenin's Tomb in Moscow, Aleksey Shchusev, with Japanese prisoner of war labor in World War II. It hosts Russian ballet and opera.\nFine Arts Museum of Uzbekistan. It contains a major collection of art from the pre-Russian period, including Sogdian murals, Buddhist statues and Zoroastrian art, along with a more modern collection of 19th and 20th century applied art, such as suzani embroidered hangings. Of more interest is the large collection of paintings \"borrowed\" from the Hermitage by Grand Duke Romanov to decorate his palace in exile in Tashkent, and never returned. Behind the museum is a small park, containing the neglected graves of the Bolsheviks who died in the Russian Revolution of 1917 and to Osipov's treachery in 1919, along with first Uzbekistani President Yuldosh Akhunbabayev.\nMuseum of Applied Arts. Housed in a traditional house originally commissioned for a wealthy tsarist diplomat, the house itself is the main attraction, rather than its collection of 19th and 20th century applied arts.\nState Museum of History of Uzbekistan the largest museum in the city. It is housed in the ex-Lenin Museum.\nAmir Timur Museum, housed in a building with brilliant blue dome and ornate interior. It houses exhibits of Timur and of President Islam Karimov.

Taking photos in the system was banned until 2018.The Russian Orthodox church in Amir Temur Square, built in 1898, was demolished in 2009. The building had not been allowed to be used for religious purposes since the 1920s due to the anti-religious campaign conducted across the former Soviet Union by the Bolshevik (communist) government in Moscow. During the Soviet period the building was used for different non-religious purposes; after independence it was a bank.\nTashkent also has a World War II memorial park and a Defender of Motherland monument.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMost important scientific institutions of Uzbekistan, such as the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan, are located in Tashkent. There are several universities and institutions of higher education:\n\nThe Branch of the Russian State University of Oil and Gas (NRU) named after I.M.

        "wiki": "Tashkent (; Russian pronunciation: [t\u0250\u0282\u02c8k\u02b2ent]; Russian: \u0422\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442, tr. Tashkent), or Toshkent (Uzbek pronunciation: [t\u0252\u0283\u02c8kent]; Uzbek: Toshkent, \u0422\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442, \u062a\u0627\u0634\u0643\u06cc\u0646\u062a\u200e), is the capital and largest city of Uzbekistan, as well as the most populous city in ex-Soviet Central Asia, with a population in 2018 of 2,485,900. It is in northeastern Uzbekistan, near the border with Kazakhstan.\nBefore Islamic influence started in the mid 8th century AD, Tashkent was influenced by the Sogdian and Turkic cultures. After Genghis Khan destroyed it in 1219, it was rebuilt and profited from the Silk Road. From the 18th to the 19th century, the city became an independent city-state, before being re-conquered by the Khanate of Kokand. In 1865, Tashkent fell to the Russian Empire, and became the capital of Russian Turkestan. In Soviet times, it witnessed major growth and demographic changes due to forced deportations from throughout the Soviet Union. Much of Tashkent was destroyed in the 1966 Tashkent earthquake, but it was rebuilt as a model Soviet city. It was the fourth-largest city in the Soviet Union at the time, after Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev.\nToday, as the capital of an independent Uzbekistan, Tashkent retains a multiethnic population, with ethnic Uzbeks as the majority. In 2009, it celebrated its 2,200 years of written history.\n\n\n== History ==\nSee also: Timeline of Tashkent and History of TashkentDuring its long history, Tashkent has had various changes in names and political and religious affiliations.\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nTashkent was settled by ancient people as an oasis on the Chirchik River, near the foothills of the West Tian Shan Mountains. In ancient times, this area contained Beitian, probably the summer \"capital\" of the Kangju confederacy. Some scholars believe that a \"Stone Tower\" mentioned by Ptolemy and by other early accounts of travel on the Silk Road referred to this settlement (\"Tashkent\" means \"stone city\"). This tower is said to have marked the midway point between Europe and China. Other scholars, however, disagree with this identification, though it remains one of four most probable sites for the Stone Tower.\n\n\n=== History as Chach ===\nIn pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, the town and the province were known as Chach.  The Shahnameh of Ferdowsi also refers to the city as Chach.\nThe principality of Chach had a square citadel built around the 5th to 3rd centuries BC, some 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) south of the Syr Darya River. By the 7th century AD, Chach had more than 30 towns and a network of over 50 canals, forming a trade center between the Sogdians and Turkic nomads. The Buddhist monk Xuanzang (602/603? \u2013 664 AD), who travelled from China to India through Central Asia, mentioned the name of the city as Zh\u011bsh\u00ed (\u8d6d\u6642. The Chinese chronicles Book of Sui from the History of Northern Dynasties and Old Book of Tang, mention a possession called Sh\u00ed \u77f3 or Zh\u011bsh\u00ed \u8d6d\u6642 with a capital of the same name since the fifth century AD.In 751, the region was conquered by Muslim Arabs.\n\n\n=== Islamic history ===\nIn the mid-seventh century, the Sasanian Persian Empire collapsed as a result of the Arab Muslim conquest of Persia. Under the Samanid dynasty (819\u2013999), whose founder Saman Khuda was a Persian Zoroastrian convert to Islam, the city came to be known as Binkath. However, the Arabs retained the old name of Chach for the surrounding region, pronouncing it ash-Shash (\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0634) instead. Kand, qand, kent, kad, kath, kud\u2014all meaning a city\u2014are derived from the Persian/Sogdian \u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0647 kanda, meaning a town or a city. They are found in city names such as Samarkand, Yarkand, Panjakent, Khujand etc.). After the 16th century, the name evolved from Chachkand/Chashkand to Tashkand. The modern spelling of \"Tashkent\" reflects Russian orthography and 20th-century Soviet influence.\n\n\n=== Mongol conquest and aftermath ===\nThe city was destroyed by Genghis Khan in 1219 and lost much of its population as a result of the Mongols' destruction of the Khwarezmid Empire in 1220.  Under the Timurid and subsequent Shaybanid dynasties, the city's population and culture gradually revived as a prominent strategic center of scholarship, commerce and trade along the Silk Road.\n\n\n=== Kokand khanate ===\nIn 1809, Tashkent was annexed to the Khanate of Kokand. At the time, Tashkent had a population of around 100,000 and was considered the richest city in Central Asia. It prospered greatly through trade with Russia but chafed under Kokand's high taxes. The Tashkent clergy also favored the clergy of Bukhara over that of Kokand. However, before the Emir of Bukhara could capitalize on this discontent, the Russian army arrived.\n\n\n=== Tsarist period ===\n \nIn May 1865, Mikhail Grigorevich Chernyayev (Cherniaev), acting against the direct orders of the tsar and outnumbered at least 15\u20131, staged a daring night attack against a city with a wall 25 kilometres (16 mi) long with 11 gates and 30,000 defenders. While a small contingent staged a diversionary attack, the main force penetrated the walls, led by a Russian Orthodox priest. Although the defense was stiff, the Russians captured the city after two days of heavy fighting and the loss of only 25 dead as opposed to several thousand of the defenders (including Alimqul, the ruler of the Kokand Khanate). Chernyayev dubbed the \"Lion of Tashkent\" by city elders, staged a \"hearts-and-minds\" campaign to win the population over. He abolished taxes for a year, rode unarmed through the streets and bazaars meeting common people, and appointed himself \"Military Governor of Tashkent\", recommending to Tsar Alexander II that the city become an independent khanate under Russian protection.\nThe Tsar liberally rewarded Chernyayev and his men with medals and bonuses, but regarded the impulsive general as a \"loose cannon\", and soon replaced him with General Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman. Far from being granted independence, Tashkent became the capital of the new territory of Russian Turkistan, with Kaufman as first Governor-General. A cantonment and Russian settlement were built across the Ankhor Canal from the old city, and Russian settlers and merchants poured in. Tashkent was a center of espionage in the Great Game rivalry between Russia and the United Kingdom over Central Asia. The Turkestan Military District was established as part of the military reforms of 1874. The Trans-Caspian Railway arrived in 1889, and the railway workers who built it settled in Tashkent as well, bringing with them the seeds of Bolshevik Revolution.\n\n\n=== Effect of the Russian revolution ===\n\nWith the fall of the Russian Empire, the Russian Provisional Government removed all civil restrictions based on religion and nationality, contributing to local enthusiasm for the February Revolution. The Tashkent Soviet of Soldiers' and Workers' Deputies was soon set up, but primarily represented Russian residents, who made up about a fifth of the Tashkent population. Muslim leaders quickly set up the Tashkent Muslim Council (Tashkand Shura-yi-Islamiya) based in the old city. On 10 March 1917, there was a parade with Russian workers marching with red flags, Russian soldiers singing La Marseillaise and thousands of local Central Asians. Following various speeches, Governor-General Aleksey Kuropatkin closed the events with words \"Long Live a great free Russia\".The First Turkestan Muslim Conference was held in Tashkent 16\u201320 April 1917. Like the Muslim Council, it was dominated by the Jadid, Muslim reformers. A more conservative faction emerged in Tashkent centered around the Ulema. This faction proved more successful during the local elections of July 1917. They formed an alliance with Russian conservatives, while the Soviet became more radical. The Soviet attempt to seize power in September 1917 proved unsuccessful.In April 1918, Tashkent became the capital of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkestan ASSR). The new regime was threatened by White forces, basmachi; revolts from within, and purges ordered from Moscow. In 1930, Tashkent fell within the borders of the Uzbek SSR, and became the capital of the Uzbek SSR, displacing Samarkand.\n\n\n=== Soviet period ===\n\nThe city began to industrialize in the 1920s and 1930s.\nViolating the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. The government worked to relocate factories from western Russia and Ukraine to Tashkent to preserve the Soviet industrial capacity. This led to great increase in industry during World War II.\nIt also evacuated most of the German communist emigres to Tashkent. The Russian population increased dramatically; evacuees from the war zones increased the total population of Tashkent to well over a million. Russians and Ukrainians eventually comprised more than half of the total residents of Tashkent. Many of the former refugees stayed in Tashkent to live after the war, rather than return to former homes.\nDuring the postwar period, the Soviet Union established numerous scientific and engineering facilities in Tashkent.\nOn 10 January 1966, then Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistan President Ayub Khan signed a pact in Tashkent with Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin as the mediator to resolve the terms of peace after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. On the next day, Shastri died suddenly, reportedly due to a heart attack. It is widely speculated that Shastri was killed by poisoning the water he drank.Much of Tashkent's old city was destroyed by a powerful earthquake on 26 April 1966. More than 300,000 residents were left homeless, and some 78,000 poorly engineered homes were destroyed, mainly in the densely populated areas of the old city where traditional adobe housing predominated. The Soviet republics, and some other countries such as Finland, sent \"battalions of fraternal peoples\" and urban planners to help rebuild devastated Tashkent.\nTashkent was rebuilt as a model Soviet city with wide streets planted with shade trees, parks, immense plazas for parades, fountains, monuments, and acres of apartment blocks. The Tashkent Metro was also built during this time. About 100,000 new homes were built by 1970, but the builders occupied many, rather than the homeless residents of Tashkent. Further development in the following years increased the size of the city with major new developments in the Chilonzor area, north-east and south-east of the city.At the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Tashkent was the fourth-largest city in the USSR and a center of learning in the fields of science and engineering.\nDue to the 1966 earthquake and the Soviet redevelopment, little architectural heritage has survived of Tashkent's ancient history. Few structures mark its significance as a trading point on the historic Silk Road.\n\n\n=== Capital of Uzbekistan ===\nTashkent is the capital of and the most cosmopolitan city in Uzbekistan. It was noted for its tree-lined streets, numerous fountains, and pleasant parks, at least until the tree-cutting campaigns initiated in 2009 by the local government.\n\nSince 1991, the city has changed economically, culturally, and architecturally. New development has superseded or replaced icons of the Soviet era. The largest statue ever erected for Lenin was replaced with a globe, featuring a geographic map of Uzbekistan. Buildings from the Soviet era have been replaced with new modern buildings. The \"Downtown Tashkent\" district includes the 22-story NBU Bank building, international hotels, the International Business Center, and the Plaza Building.\n\nThe Tashkent Business district is a special district, established for the development of small, medium and large businesses in Uzbekistan. In 2018, was started to build a Tashkent city (new Downtown) which would include a new business district with skyscrapers of local and foreign companies, world hotels, apartments, biggest mall, shops and other entertainments. The construction of the International Business Center is planned to be completed by the end of 2021  Fitch assigns \u201cBB-\u201d rating to Tashkent city, \u201cStable\u201d forecast In 2007, Tashkent was named a \"cultural capital of the Islamic world\" by Moscow News, as the city has numerous historic mosques and significant Islamic sites, including the Islamic University. Tashkent holds the Samarkand Kufic Quran, one of the earliest written copies of the Quran, which has been located in the city since 1924.Tashkent is the most visited city in the country, and has greatly benefited from increasing tourism as a result of reforms under president Shavkat Mirziyoyev and opening up by making visas easier for foreigners.\n\n\n=== Tashkent over the years ===\nDevelopment of Tashkent\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Origin of television ==\nThe first demonstration of a fully electronic TV set to the public was made in Tashkent in summer 1928 by Boris Grabovsky and his team. In his method that had been patented in Saratov in 1925, Boris Grabovsky proposed a new principle of TV imaging based on the vertical and horizontal electron beam sweeping under high voltage. Nowadays this principle of the TV imaging is used practically in all modern cathode-ray tubes. Historian and ethnographer Boris Golender (\u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440 in Russian), in a video lecture, described this event. This date of demonstration of the fully electronic TV set is the earliest known so far. Despite this fact, most modern historians disputably consider Vladimir Zworykin and Philo Farnsworth as inventors of the first fully electronic TV set. In 1964, the contribution made to the development of early television by Grabovsky was officially acknowledged by the Uzbek government and he was awarded the prestigious degree \"Honorable Inventor of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic\".\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Geography ===\nTashkent is situated in a well-watered plain on the road between Samarkand, Uzbekistan's second city, and Shymkent across the border. Tashkent is just 13 km from two border crossings into Kazakhstan. Closest geographic cities with populations of over 1 million are: Shymkent (Kazakhstan), Dushanbe (Tajikistan), Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan), Kashgar (China), Almaty (Kazakhstan), Kabul (Afghanistan) and Peshawar (Pakistan).\nTashkent sits at the confluence of the Chirchiq River and several of its tributaries and is built on deep alluvial deposits up to 15 metres (49 ft). The city is located in an active tectonic area suffering large numbers of tremors and some earthquakes.\nThe local time in Tashkent is UTC/GMT +5 hours.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTashkent features a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) bordering a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dsa). As a result, Tashkent experiences cold and often snowy winters not typically associated with most Mediterranean climates and long, hot and dry summers. Winters are cold and often snowy, covering the months of December, January and February. Most precipitation occurs during these months which frequently falls as snow. The city experiences two peaks of precipitation in the early winter and spring. The slightly unusual precipitation pattern is partially due to its 500 m (roughly 1600 feet) altitude. Summers are long in Tashkent, usually lasting from May to September. Tashkent can be extremely hot during the months of July and August. The city also sees very little precipitation during the summer, particularly from June through September.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn 1983, the population of Tashkent amounted to 1,902,000 people living in a municipal area of 256 km2 (99 sq mi). By 1991, (break-up of Soviet Union) the number of permanent residents of the capital had grown to approximately 2,136,600. Tashkent was the fourth most populated city in the former USSR, after Moscow, Leningrad (St. Petersburg), and Kiev. Nowadays, Tashkent remains the fourth most populous city in the CIS and Baltic countries. The population of the city was 2,295,300 people in 2004.As of 2008, the demographic structure of Tashkent was as follows:\n\n63.0% \u2013 Uzbeks\n20.0% \u2013 Russians\n4.5% \u2013 Tatars\n2.2% \u2013 Koryo-saram (Koreans)\n2.1% \u2013 Tajiks\n1.2% \u2013 Uighurs\n7.0% \u2013 other ethnic backgroundsRussian and Uzbek are both the main spoken languages. As with most of Uzbekistan, street signs and other things are often a mix of Latin and Cyrillic scripts.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\nTashkent is divided into the following districts (Uzbek: Tuman):\n\nAt the time of the Tsarist take over it had four districts (Uzbek daha):\n\nBeshyoghoch\nKukcha\nShaykhontokhur\nSebzorIn 1940 it had the following districts (Russian \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d):\n\nOktyabr\nKirov\nStalin\nFrunze\nLenin\nKuybishevBy 1981 they were reorganized into:\nBektemir\nAkmal-Ikramov (Uchtepa)\nKhamza (Yashnobod)\nLenin (Mirobod)\nKuybishev (Mirzo Ulugbek)\nSergeli\nOktober (Shaykhontokhur)\nSobir Rakhimov (Olmazar)\nChilanzar\nFrunze (Yakkasaray)\nKirov (Yunusabad)\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nDue to the destruction of most of the ancient city during the 1917 revolution and, later, the 1966 earthquake, little remains of Tashkent's traditional architectural heritage. Tashkent is, however, rich in museums and Soviet-era monuments. They include:\n\nKukeldash Madrasah. Dating back to the reign of Abdullah Khan II (1557\u20131598) it is being restored by the provincial Religious Board of Mawarannahr Moslems. There is talk of making it into a museum, but it is currently being used as a madrassah.\nChorsu Bazaar, located near the Kukeldash Madrassa. This huge open air bazaar is the center of the old town of Tashkent. Everything imaginable is for sale. It is one of the major tourist attractions of the city.\nTelyashayakh Mosque (Khast Imam Mosque).  It Contains the Uthman Qur'an, considered to be the oldest extant Qur'an in the world. Dating from 655 and stained with the blood of murdered caliph, Uthman, it was brought by Timur to Samarkand, seized by the Russians as a war trophy and taken to Saint Petersburg. It was returned to Uzbekistan in 1924.\nYunus Khan Mausoleum. It is a group of three 15th-century mausoleums, restored in the 19th century. The biggest is the grave of Yunus Khan, grandfather of Mughal Empire founder Babur.\nPalace of Prince Romanov. During the 19th century Grand Duke Nikolai Konstantinovich, a first cousin of Alexander III of Russia was banished to Tashkent for some shady deals involving the Russian Crown Jewels. His palace still survives in the centre of the city. Once a museum, it has been appropriated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nAlisher Navoi Opera and Ballet Theatre, built by the same architect who designed Lenin's Tomb in Moscow, Aleksey Shchusev, with Japanese prisoner of war labor in World War II. It hosts Russian ballet and opera.\nFine Arts Museum of Uzbekistan. It contains a major collection of art from the pre-Russian period, including Sogdian murals, Buddhist statues and Zoroastrian art, along with a more modern collection of 19th and 20th century applied art, such as suzani embroidered hangings. Of more interest is the large collection of paintings \"borrowed\" from the Hermitage by Grand Duke Romanov to decorate his palace in exile in Tashkent, and never returned. Behind the museum is a small park, containing the neglected graves of the Bolsheviks who died in the Russian Revolution of 1917 and to Osipov's treachery in 1919, along with first Uzbekistani President Yuldosh Akhunbabayev.\nMuseum of Applied Arts. Housed in a traditional house originally commissioned for a wealthy tsarist diplomat, the house itself is the main attraction, rather than its collection of 19th and 20th century applied arts.\nState Museum of History of Uzbekistan the largest museum in the city. It is housed in the ex-Lenin Museum.\nAmir Timur Museum, housed in a building with brilliant blue dome and ornate interior. It houses exhibits of Timur and of President Islam Karimov. The gardens outside contain a statue of Timur on horseback, surrounded by some of the nicest gardens and fountains in the city.\nNavoi Literary Museum, commemorating Uzbekistan's adopted literary hero, Alisher Navoi, with replica manuscripts, Islamic calligraphy and 15th century miniature paintings.\nThe Tashkent Metro is known for extravagant design and architecture in the buildings. Taking photos in the system was banned until 2018.The Russian Orthodox church in Amir Temur Square, built in 1898, was demolished in 2009. The building had not been allowed to be used for religious purposes since the 1920s due to the anti-religious campaign conducted across the former Soviet Union by the Bolshevik (communist) government in Moscow. During the Soviet period the building was used for different non-religious purposes; after independence it was a bank.\nTashkent also has a World War II memorial park and a Defender of Motherland monument.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMost important scientific institutions of Uzbekistan, such as the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan, are located in Tashkent.

          "I agree with others who have visited, it takes less than an hour to wander around and check out the trains. No information about the trains or their history, which would have made it more interesting, but still pretty cool to see these huge trains. We had no one telling us",
          "These Engines and Carriages are true giants you have to see them, some you can climb on a really good way to spend an hour or so",
          "I would have liked to give a better review to the Railway Museum, but in all honesty it's not fulfilling its potential. On the plus side, it does have some truly impressive old engines, many of them true locomotive giants. It was also cool to see Soviet insignia on the sides",
          "Cheap and cheerful way of filling an hour. Some interesting and giant trains. Wheelchair accessible (except the trains, of course)",
          "Some interesting trains but no information. The traditional hammer and sickle was replaced on the trains with a hammer and c-wrench, rather logical but some were in reverse as if copied incorrectly. There was a museum in one train showing a tank/gun train but that was locked.",
          "This is quite a spectacular collection of Soviet era steam trains together with some diesel and electric locomotives. However the only notice in English is the one at the entrance stating that entry for foreigners is much more expensive than for locals (still quite cheap -",

          "Railway Museum, located a few minutes walk from Tashkent Station, was a good place to spend a half hour walking around before hopping on my train. The old Soviet era trains were cool to look at. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t go inside any of them but they seemed to have no problem",
          "It was a surprise to see that they have a notice in English on ticket booth about extra cost for foreigners , but the same management did not consider it necessary to put some information in English on exhibits. They are having good collection of vintage railway engines and",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed spending an hour in this place with lots of different engines on display. Problem is they are not maintained, just slap on a bit more green paint to cover the rust and don't pick out the lettering on the description plates. Would have liked more info,",

        "wiki": "Tashkent (; Russian pronunciation: [t\u0250\u0282\u02c8k\u02b2ent]; Russian: \u0422\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442, tr. Tashkent), or Toshkent (Uzbek pronunciation: [t\u0252\u0283\u02c8kent]; Uzbek: Toshkent, \u0422\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442, \u062a\u0627\u0634\u0643\u06cc\u0646\u062a\u200e), is the capital and largest city of Uzbekistan, as well as the most populous city in ex-Soviet Central Asia, with a population in 2018 of 2,485,900. It is in northeastern Uzbekistan, near the border with Kazakhstan.\nBefore Islamic influence started in the mid 8th century AD, Tashkent was influenced by the Sogdian and Turkic cultures. After Genghis Khan destroyed it in 1219, it was rebuilt and profited from the Silk Road. From the 18th to the 19th century, the city became an independent city-state, before being re-conquered by the Khanate of Kokand. In 1865, Tashkent fell to the Russian Empire, and became the capital of Russian Turkestan. In Soviet times, it witnessed major growth and demographic changes due to forced deportations from throughout the Soviet Union. Much of Tashkent was destroyed in the 1966 Tashkent earthquake, but it was rebuilt as a model Soviet city. It was the fourth-largest city in the Soviet Union at the time, after Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev.\nToday, as the capital of an independent Uzbekistan, Tashkent retains a multiethnic population, with ethnic Uzbeks as the majority. In 2009, it celebrated its 2,200 years of written history.\n\n\n== History ==\nSee also: Timeline of Tashkent and History of TashkentDuring its long history, Tashkent has had various changes in names and political and religious affiliations.\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nTashkent was settled by ancient people as an oasis on the Chirchik River, near the foothills of the West Tian Shan Mountains. In ancient times, this area contained Beitian, probably the summer \"capital\" of the Kangju confederacy. Some scholars believe that a \"Stone Tower\" mentioned by Ptolemy and by other early accounts of travel on the Silk Road referred to this settlement (\"Tashkent\" means \"stone city\"). This tower is said to have marked the midway point between Europe and China. Other scholars, however, disagree with this identification, though it remains one of four most probable sites for the Stone Tower.\n\n\n=== History as Chach ===\nIn pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, the town and the province were known as Chach.  The Shahnameh of Ferdowsi also refers to the city as Chach.\nThe principality of Chach had a square citadel built around the 5th to 3rd centuries BC, some 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) south of the Syr Darya River. By the 7th century AD, Chach had more than 30 towns and a network of over 50 canals, forming a trade center between the Sogdians and Turkic nomads. The Buddhist monk Xuanzang (602/603? \u2013 664 AD), who travelled from China to India through Central Asia, mentioned the name of the city as Zh\u011bsh\u00ed (\u8d6d\u6642. The Chinese chronicles Book of Sui from the History of Northern Dynasties and Old Book of Tang, mention a possession called Sh\u00ed \u77f3 or Zh\u011bsh\u00ed \u8d6d\u6642 with a capital of the same name since the fifth century AD.In 751, the region was conquered by Muslim Arabs.\n\n\n=== Islamic history ===\nIn the mid-seventh century, the Sasanian Persian Empire collapsed as a result of the Arab Muslim conquest of Persia. Under the Samanid dynasty (819\u2013999), whose founder Saman Khuda was a Persian Zoroastrian convert to Islam, the city came to be known as Binkath. However, the Arabs retained the old name of Chach for the surrounding region, pronouncing it ash-Shash (\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0634) instead. Kand, qand, kent, kad, kath, kud\u2014all meaning a city\u2014are derived from the Persian/Sogdian \u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0647 kanda, meaning a town or a city. They are found in city names such as Samarkand, Yarkand, Panjakent, Khujand etc.). After the 16th century, the name evolved from Chachkand/Chashkand to Tashkand. The modern spelling of \"Tashkent\" reflects Russian orthography and 20th-century Soviet influence.\n\n\n=== Mongol conquest and aftermath ===\nThe city was destroyed by Genghis Khan in 1219 and lost much of its population as a result of the Mongols' destruction of the Khwarezmid Empire in 1220.  Under the Timurid and subsequent Shaybanid dynasties, the city's population and culture gradually revived as a prominent strategic center of scholarship, commerce and trade along the Silk Road.\n\n\n=== Kokand khanate ===\nIn 1809, Tashkent was annexed to the Khanate of Kokand. At the time, Tashkent had a population of around 100,000 and was considered the richest city in Central Asia. It prospered greatly through trade with Russia but chafed under Kokand's high taxes. The Tashkent clergy also favored the clergy of Bukhara over that of Kokand. However, before the Emir of Bukhara could capitalize on this discontent, the Russian army arrived.\n\n\n=== Tsarist period ===\n \nIn May 1865, Mikhail Grigorevich Chernyayev (Cherniaev), acting against the direct orders of the tsar and outnumbered at least 15\u20131, staged a daring night attack against a city with a wall 25 kilometres (16 mi) long with 11 gates and 30,000 defenders. While a small contingent staged a diversionary attack, the main force penetrated the walls, led by a Russian Orthodox priest. Although the defense was stiff, the Russians captured the city after two days of heavy fighting and the loss of only 25 dead as opposed to several thousand of the defenders (including Alimqul, the ruler of the Kokand Khanate). Chernyayev dubbed the \"Lion of Tashkent\" by city elders, staged a \"hearts-and-minds\" campaign to win the population over. He abolished taxes for a year, rode unarmed through the streets and bazaars meeting common people, and appointed himself \"Military Governor of Tashkent\", recommending to Tsar Alexander II that the city become an independent khanate under Russian protection.\nThe Tsar liberally rewarded Chernyayev and his men with medals and bonuses, but regarded the impulsive general as a \"loose cannon\", and soon replaced him with General Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman. Far from being granted independence, Tashkent became the capital of the new territory of Russian Turkistan, with Kaufman as first Governor-General. A cantonment and Russian settlement were built across the Ankhor Canal from the old city, and Russian settlers and merchants poured in. Tashkent was a center of espionage in the Great Game rivalry between Russia and the United Kingdom over Central Asia. The Turkestan Military District was established as part of the military reforms of 1874. The Trans-Caspian Railway arrived in 1889, and the railway workers who built it settled in Tashkent as well, bringing with them the seeds of Bolshevik Revolution.\n\n\n=== Effect of the Russian revolution ===\n\nWith the fall of the Russian Empire, the Russian Provisional Government removed all civil restrictions based on religion and nationality, contributing to local enthusiasm for the February Revolution. The Tashkent Soviet of Soldiers' and Workers' Deputies was soon set up, but primarily represented Russian residents, who made up about a fifth of the Tashkent population. Muslim leaders quickly set up the Tashkent Muslim Council (Tashkand Shura-yi-Islamiya) based in the old city. On 10 March 1917, there was a parade with Russian workers marching with red flags, Russian soldiers singing La Marseillaise and thousands of local Central Asians. Following various speeches, Governor-General Aleksey Kuropatkin closed the events with words \"Long Live a great free Russia\".The First Turkestan Muslim Conference was held in Tashkent 16\u201320 April 1917. Like the Muslim Council, it was dominated by the Jadid, Muslim reformers. A more conservative faction emerged in Tashkent centered around the Ulema. This faction proved more successful during the local elections of July 1917. They formed an alliance with Russian conservatives, while the Soviet became more radical. The Soviet attempt to seize power in September 1917 proved unsuccessful.In April 1918, Tashkent became the capital of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkestan ASSR). The new regime was threatened by White forces, basmachi; revolts from within, and purges ordered from Moscow. In 1930, Tashkent fell within the borders of the Uzbek SSR, and became the capital of the Uzbek SSR, displacing Samarkand.\n\n\n=== Soviet period ===\n\nThe city began to industrialize in the 1920s and 1930s.\nViolating the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. The government worked to relocate factories from western Russia and Ukraine to Tashkent to preserve the Soviet industrial capacity. This led to great increase in industry during World War II.\nIt also evacuated most of the German communist emigres to Tashkent. The Russian population increased dramatically; evacuees from the war zones increased the total population of Tashkent to well over a million. Russians and Ukrainians eventually comprised more than half of the total residents of Tashkent. Many of the former refugees stayed in Tashkent to live after the war, rather than return to former homes.\nDuring the postwar period, the Soviet Union established numerous scientific and engineering facilities in Tashkent.\nOn 10 January 1966, then Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistan President Ayub Khan signed a pact in Tashkent with Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin as the mediator to resolve the terms of peace after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. On the next day, Shastri died suddenly, reportedly due to a heart attack. It is widely speculated that Shastri was killed by poisoning the water he drank.Much of Tashkent's old city was destroyed by a powerful earthquake on 26 April 1966. More than 300,000 residents were left homeless, and some 78,000 poorly engineered homes were destroyed, mainly in the densely populated areas of the old city where traditional adobe housing predominated. The Soviet republics, and some other countries such as Finland, sent \"battalions of fraternal peoples\" and urban planners to help rebuild devastated Tashkent.\nTashkent was rebuilt as a model Soviet city with wide streets planted with shade trees, parks, immense plazas for parades, fountains, monuments, and acres of apartment blocks. The Tashkent Metro was also built during this time. About 100,000 new homes were built by 1970, but the builders occupied many, rather than the homeless residents of Tashkent. Further development in the following years increased the size of the city with major new developments in the Chilonzor area, north-east and south-east of the city.At the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Tashkent was the fourth-largest city in the USSR and a center of learning in the fields of science and engineering.\nDue to the 1966 earthquake and the Soviet redevelopment, little architectural heritage has survived of Tashkent's ancient history. Few structures mark its significance as a trading point on the historic Silk Road.\n\n\n=== Capital of Uzbekistan ===\nTashkent is the capital of and the most cosmopolitan city in Uzbekistan. It was noted for its tree-lined streets, numerous fountains, and pleasant parks, at least until the tree-cutting campaigns initiated in 2009 by the local government.\n\nSince 1991, the city has changed economically, culturally, and architecturally. New development has superseded or replaced icons of the Soviet era. The largest statue ever erected for Lenin was replaced with a globe, featuring a geographic map of Uzbekistan. Buildings from the Soviet era have been replaced with new modern buildings. The \"Downtown Tashkent\" district includes the 22-story NBU Bank building, international hotels, the International Business Center, and the Plaza Building.\n\nThe Tashkent Business district is a special district, established for the development of small, medium and large businesses in Uzbekistan. In 2018, was started to build a Tashkent city (new Downtown) which would include a new business district with skyscrapers of local and foreign companies, world hotels, apartments, biggest mall, shops and other entertainments. The construction of the International Business Center is planned to be completed by the end of 2021  Fitch assigns \u201cBB-\u201d rating to Tashkent city, \u201cStable\u201d forecast In 2007, Tashkent was named a \"cultural capital of the Islamic world\" by Moscow News, as the city has numerous historic mosques and significant Islamic sites, including the Islamic University. Tashkent holds the Samarkand Kufic Quran, one of the earliest written copies of the Quran, which has been located in the city since 1924.Tashkent is the most visited city in the country, and has greatly benefited from increasing tourism as a result of reforms under president Shavkat Mirziyoyev and opening up by making visas easier for foreigners.\n\n\n=== Tashkent over the years ===\nDevelopment of Tashkent\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Origin of television ==\nThe first demonstration of a fully electronic TV set to the public was made in Tashkent in summer 1928 by Boris Grabovsky and his team. In his method that had been patented in Saratov in 1925, Boris Grabovsky proposed a new principle of TV imaging based on the vertical and horizontal electron beam sweeping under high voltage. Nowadays this principle of the TV imaging is used practically in all modern cathode-ray tubes. Historian and ethnographer Boris Golender (\u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440 in Russian), in a video lecture, described this event. This date of demonstration of the fully electronic TV set is the earliest known so far. Despite this fact, most modern historians disputably consider Vladimir Zworykin and Philo Farnsworth as inventors of the first fully electronic TV set. In 1964, the contribution made to the development of early television by Grabovsky was officially acknowledged by the Uzbek government and he was awarded the prestigious degree \"Honorable Inventor of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic\".\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Geography ===\nTashkent is situated in a well-watered plain on the road between Samarkand, Uzbekistan's second city, and Shymkent across the border. Tashkent is just 13 km from two border crossings into Kazakhstan. Closest geographic cities with populations of over 1 million are: Shymkent (Kazakhstan), Dushanbe (Tajikistan), Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan), Kashgar (China), Almaty (Kazakhstan), Kabul (Afghanistan) and Peshawar (Pakistan).\nTashkent sits at the confluence of the Chirchiq River and several of its tributaries and is built on deep alluvial deposits up to 15 metres (49 ft). The city is located in an active tectonic area suffering large numbers of tremors and some earthquakes.\nThe local time in Tashkent is UTC/GMT +5 hours.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTashkent features a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) bordering a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dsa). As a result, Tashkent experiences cold and often snowy winters not typically associated with most Mediterranean climates and long, hot and dry summers. Winters are cold and often snowy, covering the months of December, January and February. Most precipitation occurs during these months which frequently falls as snow. The city experiences two peaks of precipitation in the early winter and spring. The slightly unusual precipitation pattern is partially due to its 500 m (roughly 1600 feet) altitude. Summers are long in Tashkent, usually lasting from May to September. Tashkent can be extremely hot during the months of July and August. The city also sees very little precipitation during the summer, particularly from June through September.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn 1983, the population of Tashkent amounted to 1,902,000 people living in a municipal area of 256 km2 (99 sq mi). By 1991, (break-up of Soviet Union) the number of permanent residents of the capital had grown to approximately 2,136,600. Tashkent was the fourth most populated city in the former USSR, after Moscow, Leningrad (St. Petersburg), and Kiev. Nowadays, Tashkent remains the fourth most populous city in the CIS and Baltic countries. The population of the city was 2,295,300 people in 2004.As of 2008, the demographic structure of Tashkent was as follows:\n\n63.0% \u2013 Uzbeks\n20.0% \u2013 Russians\n4.5% \u2013 Tatars\n2.2% \u2013 Koryo-saram (Koreans)\n2.1% \u2013 Tajiks\n1.2% \u2013 Uighurs\n7.0% \u2013 other ethnic backgroundsRussian and Uzbek are both the main spoken languages.

Tashkent is, however, rich in museums and Soviet-era monuments. They include:\n\nKukeldash Madrasah. Dating back to the reign of Abdullah Khan II (1557\u20131598) it is being restored by the provincial Religious Board of Mawarannahr Moslems. There is talk of making it into a museum, but it is currently being used as a madrassah.\nChorsu Bazaar, located near the Kukeldash Madrassa. This huge open air bazaar is the center of the old town of Tashkent. Everything imaginable is for sale. It is one of the major tourist attractions of the city.\nTelyashayakh Mosque (Khast Imam Mosque).  It Contains the Uthman Qur'an, considered to be the oldest extant Qur'an in the world. Dating from 655 and stained with the blood of murdered caliph, Uthman, it was brought by Timur to Samarkand, seized by the Russians as a war trophy and taken to Saint Petersburg. It was returned to Uzbekistan in 1924.\nYunus Khan Mausoleum. It is a group of three 15th-century mausoleums, restored in the 19th century. The biggest is the grave of Yunus Khan, grandfather of Mughal Empire founder Babur.\nPalace of Prince Romanov. During the 19th century Grand Duke Nikolai Konstantinovich, a first cousin of Alexander III of Russia was banished to Tashkent for some shady deals involving the Russian Crown Jewels. His palace still survives in the centre of the city. Once a museum, it has been appropriated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nAlisher Navoi Opera and Ballet Theatre, built by the same architect who designed Lenin's Tomb in Moscow, Aleksey Shchusev, with Japanese prisoner of war labor in World War II. It hosts Russian ballet and opera.\nFine Arts Museum of Uzbekistan. It contains a major collection of art from the pre-Russian period, including Sogdian murals, Buddhist statues and Zoroastrian art, along with a more modern collection of 19th and 20th century applied art, such as suzani embroidered hangings. Of more interest is the large collection of paintings \"borrowed\" from the Hermitage by Grand Duke Romanov to decorate his palace in exile in Tashkent, and never returned. Behind the museum is a small park, containing the neglected graves of the Bolsheviks who died in the Russian Revolution of 1917 and to Osipov's treachery in 1919, along with first Uzbekistani President Yuldosh Akhunbabayev.\nMuseum of Applied Arts. Housed in a traditional house originally commissioned for a wealthy tsarist diplomat, the house itself is the main attraction, rather than its collection of 19th and 20th century applied arts.\nState Museum of History of Uzbekistan the largest museum in the city. It is housed in the ex-Lenin Museum.\nAmir Timur Museum, housed in a building with brilliant blue dome and ornate interior. It houses exhibits of Timur and of President Islam Karimov. The gardens outside contain a statue of Timur on horseback, surrounded by some of the nicest gardens and fountains in the city.\nNavoi Literary Museum, commemorating Uzbekistan's adopted literary hero, Alisher Navoi, with replica manuscripts, Islamic calligraphy and 15th century miniature paintings.\nThe Tashkent Metro is known for extravagant design and architecture in the buildings. Taking photos in the system was banned until 2018.The Russian Orthodox church in Amir Temur Square, built in 1898, was demolished in 2009. The building had not been allowed to be used for religious purposes since the 1920s due to the anti-religious campaign conducted across the former Soviet Union by the Bolshevik (communist) government in Moscow. During the Soviet period the building was used for different non-religious purposes; after independence it was a bank.\nTashkent also has a World War II memorial park and a Defender of Motherland monument.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMost important scientific institutions of Uzbekistan, such as the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan, are located in Tashkent.

        "wiki": "The State Museum of Applied Arts of Uzbekistan (Uzbek: O\u02bbzbekiston Respublikasi Amaliy San\u02bcati Muzeyi) is an art museum located in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, founded in 1937 as a temporary exhibition for handicrafts. The museum contains over 4,000 exhibits on decorative art in Uzbekistan, including wood carving, ceramics, embossing, jewelry, gold weaving, embroidery, and samples of mass production in local industry.\n\n\n== History ==\nUntil the beginning of the 21st century, the museum was located in the former palace of the Russian diplomat Alexander Alexandrovich Polovtsev Jr..\nThe museum building, known as the Polovtsev house, was purchased by his secretary Mikhail Stepanovich Andreev from Tashkent merchant Nikolai Ivanovich Ivanov. Under Andreev's guidance, the interiors of the house were readjusted and refurbished to fit an Oriental style. The main architect of this restructuring was A. A. Burmeyster. The house was known colloquially as the \"Polovtsev House\". The building is an example of Oriental architectural and decorative art, built in the late 19th century. The decoration, carving and painting of the building was done by Uzbek folk artists Usta T. Arsankulov, A. Kazymdzhanov (Tashkent), Usta Shirin Muradov (Bukhara), Usta A. Palvanov (Khiva), and Usta Abdullah (Rishtan).During the First World War, the house was used to hold captured Austrian officers. After the Russian Revolution until the mid-30s, the building housed an orphanage. Subsequently, various organizations operated out of the house, including a training center for ganch carving and embossing, as well as an embroidery workshop. Since July 1937, the house housed the Handicraft Museum, the Museum of Applied Art's predecessor.In 1941 and 1961, the building was restored. In 1960, it received the name \"Permanent Exhibition of Applied Arts of Uzbekistan\". In 1970, the museum building was reconstructed. In 1997, the museum was transferred to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Uzbekistan, receiving the status of \"State Museum of Applied Art\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMuseum website\nOn the history of the \"House of Polovtsev\" in Tashkent\nState Museum of Applied Arts of Uzbekistan",

          "We visited this museum as part of a tour of all Uzbekistan and enjoyed the excellent explanations of our guide. The museum occupies the eclectic house of a former tzarist Russia high official. The house is built in local style, but heavily modified to suit modern life and the",

          "The things displayed are of interest. Even more, I'd guess, if you're into local handicrafts. Also, the house in which it's built is the former residence of a Russian ambassador, who decorated it in a very peculiar way.",
          "Our tour included about a one hour stop at this museum. I accept that's not long enough to do it full justice. We had the benefit of a guide which was vital to explaining the exhibits and their significance. I don't think a foreign visitor would appreciate everything so well",
          "This museum has over 7,000 samples of applied arts. It includes handmade embroidery, skull-caps (tyubeteyka), jewelry, carpets and other examples of craftsmanship. This museum is a treasure trove of applied arts based on ancient traditions. It contains mainly works created",

          "The Uzbekistan State museum offers a deep insight into the USSR era and how the state was controlled by coercion. The nation was born out of a repressive regime and is maturing into a tolerant Islamic state. The museum staff is extremely friendly and guides who charge$ 2-4 are",

        "wiki": "Tashkent (; Russian pronunciation: [t\u0250\u0282\u02c8k\u02b2ent]; Russian: \u0422\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442, tr. Tashkent), or Toshkent (Uzbek pronunciation: [t\u0252\u0283\u02c8kent]; Uzbek: Toshkent, \u0422\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442, \u062a\u0627\u0634\u0643\u06cc\u0646\u062a\u200e), is the capital and largest city of Uzbekistan, as well as the most populous city in ex-Soviet Central Asia, with a population in 2018 of 2,485,900. It is in northeastern Uzbekistan, near the border with Kazakhstan.\nBefore Islamic influence started in the mid 8th century AD, Tashkent was influenced by the Sogdian and Turkic cultures. After Genghis Khan destroyed it in 1219, it was rebuilt and profited from the Silk Road. From the 18th to the 19th century, the city became an independent city-state, before being re-conquered by the Khanate of Kokand. In 1865, Tashkent fell to the Russian Empire, and became the capital of Russian Turkestan. In Soviet times, it witnessed major growth and demographic changes due to forced deportations from throughout the Soviet Union. Much of Tashkent was destroyed in the 1966 Tashkent earthquake, but it was rebuilt as a model Soviet city. It was the fourth-largest city in the Soviet Union at the time, after Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev.\nToday, as the capital of an independent Uzbekistan, Tashkent retains a multiethnic population, with ethnic Uzbeks as the majority. In 2009, it celebrated its 2,200 years of written history.\n\n\n== History ==\nSee also: Timeline of Tashkent and History of TashkentDuring its long history, Tashkent has had various changes in names and political and religious affiliations.\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nTashkent was settled by ancient people as an oasis on the Chirchik River, near the foothills of the West Tian Shan Mountains. In ancient times, this area contained Beitian, probably the summer \"capital\" of the Kangju confederacy. Some scholars believe that a \"Stone Tower\" mentioned by Ptolemy and by other early accounts of travel on the Silk Road referred to this settlement (\"Tashkent\" means \"stone city\"). This tower is said to have marked the midway point between Europe and China. Other scholars, however, disagree with this identification, though it remains one of four most probable sites for the Stone Tower.\n\n\n=== History as Chach ===\nIn pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, the town and the province were known as Chach.  The Shahnameh of Ferdowsi also refers to the city as Chach.\nThe principality of Chach had a square citadel built around the 5th to 3rd centuries BC, some 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) south of the Syr Darya River. By the 7th century AD, Chach had more than 30 towns and a network of over 50 canals, forming a trade center between the Sogdians and Turkic nomads. The Buddhist monk Xuanzang (602/603? \u2013 664 AD), who travelled from China to India through Central Asia, mentioned the name of the city as Zh\u011bsh\u00ed (\u8d6d\u6642. The Chinese chronicles Book of Sui from the History of Northern Dynasties and Old Book of Tang, mention a possession called Sh\u00ed \u77f3 or Zh\u011bsh\u00ed \u8d6d\u6642 with a capital of the same name since the fifth century AD.In 751, the region was conquered by Muslim Arabs.\n\n\n=== Islamic history ===\nIn the mid-seventh century, the Sasanian Persian Empire collapsed as a result of the Arab Muslim conquest of Persia. Under the Samanid dynasty (819\u2013999), whose founder Saman Khuda was a Persian Zoroastrian convert to Islam, the city came to be known as Binkath. However, the Arabs retained the old name of Chach for the surrounding region, pronouncing it ash-Shash (\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0634) instead. Kand, qand, kent, kad, kath, kud\u2014all meaning a city\u2014are derived from the Persian/Sogdian \u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0647 kanda, meaning a town or a city. They are found in city names such as Samarkand, Yarkand, Panjakent, Khujand etc.). After the 16th century, the name evolved from Chachkand/Chashkand to Tashkand. The modern spelling of \"Tashkent\" reflects Russian orthography and 20th-century Soviet influence.\n\n\n=== Mongol conquest and aftermath ===\nThe city was destroyed by Genghis Khan in 1219 and lost much of its population as a result of the Mongols' destruction of the Khwarezmid Empire in 1220.  Under the Timurid and subsequent Shaybanid dynasties, the city's population and culture gradually revived as a prominent strategic center of scholarship, commerce and trade along the Silk Road.\n\n\n=== Kokand khanate ===\nIn 1809, Tashkent was annexed to the Khanate of Kokand. At the time, Tashkent had a population of around 100,000 and was considered the richest city in Central Asia. It prospered greatly through trade with Russia but chafed under Kokand's high taxes. The Tashkent clergy also favored the clergy of Bukhara over that of Kokand. However, before the Emir of Bukhara could capitalize on this discontent, the Russian army arrived.\n\n\n=== Tsarist period ===\n \nIn May 1865, Mikhail Grigorevich Chernyayev (Cherniaev), acting against the direct orders of the tsar and outnumbered at least 15\u20131, staged a daring night attack against a city with a wall 25 kilometres (16 mi) long with 11 gates and 30,000 defenders. While a small contingent staged a diversionary attack, the main force penetrated the walls, led by a Russian Orthodox priest. Although the defense was stiff, the Russians captured the city after two days of heavy fighting and the loss of only 25 dead as opposed to several thousand of the defenders (including Alimqul, the ruler of the Kokand Khanate). Chernyayev dubbed the \"Lion of Tashkent\" by city elders, staged a \"hearts-and-minds\" campaign to win the population over. He abolished taxes for a year, rode unarmed through the streets and bazaars meeting common people, and appointed himself \"Military Governor of Tashkent\", recommending to Tsar Alexander II that the city become an independent khanate under Russian protection.\nThe Tsar liberally rewarded Chernyayev and his men with medals and bonuses, but regarded the impulsive general as a \"loose cannon\", and soon replaced him with General Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman. Far from being granted independence, Tashkent became the capital of the new territory of Russian Turkistan, with Kaufman as first Governor-General. A cantonment and Russian settlement were built across the Ankhor Canal from the old city, and Russian settlers and merchants poured in. Tashkent was a center of espionage in the Great Game rivalry between Russia and the United Kingdom over Central Asia. The Turkestan Military District was established as part of the military reforms of 1874. The Trans-Caspian Railway arrived in 1889, and the railway workers who built it settled in Tashkent as well, bringing with them the seeds of Bolshevik Revolution.\n\n\n=== Effect of the Russian revolution ===\n\nWith the fall of the Russian Empire, the Russian Provisional Government removed all civil restrictions based on religion and nationality, contributing to local enthusiasm for the February Revolution. The Tashkent Soviet of Soldiers' and Workers' Deputies was soon set up, but primarily represented Russian residents, who made up about a fifth of the Tashkent population. Muslim leaders quickly set up the Tashkent Muslim Council (Tashkand Shura-yi-Islamiya) based in the old city. On 10 March 1917, there was a parade with Russian workers marching with red flags, Russian soldiers singing La Marseillaise and thousands of local Central Asians. Following various speeches, Governor-General Aleksey Kuropatkin closed the events with words \"Long Live a great free Russia\".The First Turkestan Muslim Conference was held in Tashkent 16\u201320 April 1917. Like the Muslim Council, it was dominated by the Jadid, Muslim reformers. A more conservative faction emerged in Tashkent centered around the Ulema. This faction proved more successful during the local elections of July 1917. They formed an alliance with Russian conservatives, while the Soviet became more radical. The Soviet attempt to seize power in September 1917 proved unsuccessful.In April 1918, Tashkent became the capital of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkestan ASSR). The new regime was threatened by White forces, basmachi; revolts from within, and purges ordered from Moscow. In 1930, Tashkent fell within the borders of the Uzbek SSR, and became the capital of the Uzbek SSR, displacing Samarkand.\n\n\n=== Soviet period ===\n\nThe city began to industrialize in the 1920s and 1930s.\nViolating the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. The government worked to relocate factories from western Russia and Ukraine to Tashkent to preserve the Soviet industrial capacity. This led to great increase in industry during World War II.\nIt also evacuated most of the German communist emigres to Tashkent. The Russian population increased dramatically; evacuees from the war zones increased the total population of Tashkent to well over a million. Russians and Ukrainians eventually comprised more than half of the total residents of Tashkent. Many of the former refugees stayed in Tashkent to live after the war, rather than return to former homes.\nDuring the postwar period, the Soviet Union established numerous scientific and engineering facilities in Tashkent.\nOn 10 January 1966, then Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistan President Ayub Khan signed a pact in Tashkent with Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin as the mediator to resolve the terms of peace after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. On the next day, Shastri died suddenly, reportedly due to a heart attack. It is widely speculated that Shastri was killed by poisoning the water he drank.Much of Tashkent's old city was destroyed by a powerful earthquake on 26 April 1966. More than 300,000 residents were left homeless, and some 78,000 poorly engineered homes were destroyed, mainly in the densely populated areas of the old city where traditional adobe housing predominated. The Soviet republics, and some other countries such as Finland, sent \"battalions of fraternal peoples\" and urban planners to help rebuild devastated Tashkent.\nTashkent was rebuilt as a model Soviet city with wide streets planted with shade trees, parks, immense plazas for parades, fountains, monuments, and acres of apartment blocks. The Tashkent Metro was also built during this time. About 100,000 new homes were built by 1970, but the builders occupied many, rather than the homeless residents of Tashkent. Further development in the following years increased the size of the city with major new developments in the Chilonzor area, north-east and south-east of the city.At the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Tashkent was the fourth-largest city in the USSR and a center of learning in the fields of science and engineering.\nDue to the 1966 earthquake and the Soviet redevelopment, little architectural heritage has survived of Tashkent's ancient history. Few structures mark its significance as a trading point on the historic Silk Road.\n\n\n=== Capital of Uzbekistan ===\nTashkent is the capital of and the most cosmopolitan city in Uzbekistan. It was noted for its tree-lined streets, numerous fountains, and pleasant parks, at least until the tree-cutting campaigns initiated in 2009 by the local government.\n\nSince 1991, the city has changed economically, culturally, and architecturally. New development has superseded or replaced icons of the Soviet era. The largest statue ever erected for Lenin was replaced with a globe, featuring a geographic map of Uzbekistan. Buildings from the Soviet era have been replaced with new modern buildings. The \"Downtown Tashkent\" district includes the 22-story NBU Bank building, international hotels, the International Business Center, and the Plaza Building.\n\nThe Tashkent Business district is a special district, established for the development of small, medium and large businesses in Uzbekistan. In 2018, was started to build a Tashkent city (new Downtown) which would include a new business district with skyscrapers of local and foreign companies, world hotels, apartments, biggest mall, shops and other entertainments. The construction of the International Business Center is planned to be completed by the end of 2021  Fitch assigns \u201cBB-\u201d rating to Tashkent city, \u201cStable\u201d forecast In 2007, Tashkent was named a \"cultural capital of the Islamic world\" by Moscow News, as the city has numerous historic mosques and significant Islamic sites, including the Islamic University. Tashkent holds the Samarkand Kufic Quran, one of the earliest written copies of the Quran, which has been located in the city since 1924.Tashkent is the most visited city in the country, and has greatly benefited from increasing tourism as a result of reforms under president Shavkat Mirziyoyev and opening up by making visas easier for foreigners.\n\n\n=== Tashkent over the years ===\nDevelopment of Tashkent\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Origin of television ==\nThe first demonstration of a fully electronic TV set to the public was made in Tashkent in summer 1928 by Boris Grabovsky and his team. In his method that had been patented in Saratov in 1925, Boris Grabovsky proposed a new principle of TV imaging based on the vertical and horizontal electron beam sweeping under high voltage. Nowadays this principle of the TV imaging is used practically in all modern cathode-ray tubes. Historian and ethnographer Boris Golender (\u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440 in Russian), in a video lecture, described this event. This date of demonstration of the fully electronic TV set is the earliest known so far. Despite this fact, most modern historians disputably consider Vladimir Zworykin and Philo Farnsworth as inventors of the first fully electronic TV set. In 1964, the contribution made to the development of early television by Grabovsky was officially acknowledged by the Uzbek government and he was awarded the prestigious degree \"Honorable Inventor of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic\".\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Geography ===\nTashkent is situated in a well-watered plain on the road between Samarkand, Uzbekistan's second city, and Shymkent across the border. Tashkent is just 13 km from two border crossings into Kazakhstan. Closest geographic cities with populations of over 1 million are: Shymkent (Kazakhstan), Dushanbe (Tajikistan), Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan), Kashgar (China), Almaty (Kazakhstan), Kabul (Afghanistan) and Peshawar (Pakistan).\nTashkent sits at the confluence of the Chirchiq River and several of its tributaries and is built on deep alluvial deposits up to 15 metres (49 ft). The city is located in an active tectonic area suffering large numbers of tremors and some earthquakes.\nThe local time in Tashkent is UTC/GMT +5 hours.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTashkent features a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) bordering a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dsa). As a result, Tashkent experiences cold and often snowy winters not typically associated with most Mediterranean climates and long, hot and dry summers. Winters are cold and often snowy, covering the months of December, January and February. Most precipitation occurs during these months which frequently falls as snow. The city experiences two peaks of precipitation in the early winter and spring. The slightly unusual precipitation pattern is partially due to its 500 m (roughly 1600 feet) altitude. Summers are long in Tashkent, usually lasting from May to September. Tashkent can be extremely hot during the months of July and August. The city also sees very little precipitation during the summer, particularly from June through September.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn 1983, the population of Tashkent amounted to 1,902,000 people living in a municipal area of 256 km2 (99 sq mi). By 1991, (break-up of Soviet Union) the number of permanent residents of the capital had grown to approximately 2,136,600. Tashkent was the fourth most populated city in the former USSR, after Moscow, Leningrad (St. Petersburg), and Kiev. Nowadays, Tashkent remains the fourth most populous city in the CIS and Baltic countries. The population of the city was 2,295,300 people in 2004.As of 2008, the demographic structure of Tashkent was as follows:\n\n63.0% \u2013 Uzbeks\n20.0% \u2013 Russians\n4.5% \u2013 Tatars\n2.2% \u2013 Koryo-saram (Koreans)\n2.1% \u2013 Tajiks\n1.2% \u2013 Uighurs\n7.0% \u2013 other ethnic backgroundsRussian and Uzbek are both the main spoken languages. As with most of Uzbekistan, street signs and other things are often a mix of Latin and Cyrillic scripts.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\nTashkent is divided into the following districts (Uzbek: Tuman):\n\nAt the time of the Tsarist take over it had four districts (Uzbek daha):\n\nBeshyoghoch\nKukcha\nShaykhontokhur\nSebzorIn 1940 it had the following districts (Russian \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d):\n\nOktyabr\nKirov\nStalin\nFrunze\nLenin\nKuybishevBy 1981 they were reorganized into:\nBektemir\nAkmal-Ikramov (Uchtepa)\nKhamza (Yashnobod)\nLenin (Mirobod)\nKuybishev (Mirzo Ulugbek)\nSergeli\nOktober (Shaykhontokhur)\nSobir Rakhimov (Olmazar)\nChilanzar\nFrunze (Yakkasaray)\nKirov (Yunusabad)\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nDue to the destruction of most of the ancient city during the 1917 revolution and, later, the 1966 earthquake, little remains of Tashkent's traditional architectural heritage. Tashkent is, however, rich in museums and Soviet-era monuments. They include:\n\nKukeldash Madrasah. Dating back to the reign of Abdullah Khan II (1557\u20131598) it is being restored by the provincial Religious Board of Mawarannahr Moslems. There is talk of making it into a museum, but it is currently being used as a madrassah.\nChorsu Bazaar, located near the Kukeldash Madrassa. This huge open air bazaar is the center of the old town of Tashkent. Everything imaginable is for sale. It is one of the major tourist attractions of the city.\nTelyashayakh Mosque (Khast Imam Mosque).  It Contains the Uthman Qur'an, considered to be the oldest extant Qur'an in the world. Dating from 655 and stained with the blood of murdered caliph, Uthman, it was brought by Timur to Samarkand, seized by the Russians as a war trophy and taken to Saint Petersburg. It was returned to Uzbekistan in 1924.\nYunus Khan Mausoleum. It is a group of three 15th-century mausoleums, restored in the 19th century. The biggest is the grave of Yunus Khan, grandfather of Mughal Empire founder Babur.\nPalace of Prince Romanov. During the 19th century Grand Duke Nikolai Konstantinovich, a first cousin of Alexander III of Russia was banished to Tashkent for some shady deals involving the Russian Crown Jewels. His palace still survives in the centre of the city. Once a museum, it has been appropriated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nAlisher Navoi Opera and Ballet Theatre, built by the same architect who designed Lenin's Tomb in Moscow, Aleksey Shchusev, with Japanese prisoner of war labor in World War II. It hosts Russian ballet and opera.\nFine Arts Museum of Uzbekistan. It contains a major collection of art from the pre-Russian period, including Sogdian murals, Buddhist statues and Zoroastrian art, along with a more modern collection of 19th and 20th century applied art, such as suzani embroidered hangings. Of more interest is the large collection of paintings \"borrowed\" from the Hermitage by Grand Duke Romanov to decorate his palace in exile in Tashkent, and never returned. Behind the museum is a small park, containing the neglected graves of the Bolsheviks who died in the Russian Revolution of 1917 and to Osipov's treachery in 1919, along with first Uzbekistani President Yuldosh Akhunbabayev.\nMuseum of Applied Arts. Housed in a traditional house originally commissioned for a wealthy tsarist diplomat, the house itself is the main attraction, rather than its collection of 19th and 20th century applied arts.\nState Museum of History of Uzbekistan the largest museum in the city. It is housed in the ex-Lenin Museum.\nAmir Timur Museum, housed in a building with brilliant blue dome and ornate interior. It houses exhibits of Timur and of President Islam Karimov.

Taking photos in the system was banned until 2018.The Russian Orthodox church in Amir Temur Square, built in 1898, was demolished in 2009. The building had not been allowed to be used for religious purposes since the 1920s due to the anti-religious campaign conducted across the former Soviet Union by the Bolshevik (communist) government in Moscow. During the Soviet period the building was used for different non-religious purposes; after independence it was a bank.\nTashkent also has a World War II memorial park and a Defender of Motherland monument.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMost important scientific institutions of Uzbekistan, such as the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan, are located in Tashkent.

        "wiki": "Tashkent (; Russian pronunciation: [t\u0250\u0282\u02c8k\u02b2ent]; Russian: \u0422\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442, tr. Tashkent), or Toshkent (Uzbek pronunciation: [t\u0252\u0283\u02c8kent]; Uzbek: Toshkent, \u0422\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442, \u062a\u0627\u0634\u0643\u06cc\u0646\u062a\u200e), is the capital and largest city of Uzbekistan, as well as the most populous city in ex-Soviet Central Asia, with a population in 2018 of 2,485,900. It is in northeastern Uzbekistan, near the border with Kazakhstan.\nBefore Islamic influence started in the mid 8th century AD, Tashkent was influenced by the Sogdian and Turkic cultures. After Genghis Khan destroyed it in 1219, it was rebuilt and profited from the Silk Road. From the 18th to the 19th century, the city became an independent city-state, before being re-conquered by the Khanate of Kokand. In 1865, Tashkent fell to the Russian Empire, and became the capital of Russian Turkestan. In Soviet times, it witnessed major growth and demographic changes due to forced deportations from throughout the Soviet Union. Much of Tashkent was destroyed in the 1966 Tashkent earthquake, but it was rebuilt as a model Soviet city. It was the fourth-largest city in the Soviet Union at the time, after Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev.\nToday, as the capital of an independent Uzbekistan, Tashkent retains a multiethnic population, with ethnic Uzbeks as the majority. In 2009, it celebrated its 2,200 years of written history.\n\n\n== History ==\nSee also: Timeline of Tashkent and History of TashkentDuring its long history, Tashkent has had various changes in names and political and religious affiliations.\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nTashkent was settled by ancient people as an oasis on the Chirchik River, near the foothills of the West Tian Shan Mountains. In ancient times, this area contained Beitian, probably the summer \"capital\" of the Kangju confederacy. Some scholars believe that a \"Stone Tower\" mentioned by Ptolemy and by other early accounts of travel on the Silk Road referred to this settlement (\"Tashkent\" means \"stone city\"). This tower is said to have marked the midway point between Europe and China. Other scholars, however, disagree with this identification, though it remains one of four most probable sites for the Stone Tower.\n\n\n=== History as Chach ===\nIn pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, the town and the province were known as Chach.  The Shahnameh of Ferdowsi also refers to the city as Chach.\nThe principality of Chach had a square citadel built around the 5th to 3rd centuries BC, some 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) south of the Syr Darya River. By the 7th century AD, Chach had more than 30 towns and a network of over 50 canals, forming a trade center between the Sogdians and Turkic nomads. The Buddhist monk Xuanzang (602/603? \u2013 664 AD), who travelled from China to India through Central Asia, mentioned the name of the city as Zh\u011bsh\u00ed (\u8d6d\u6642. The Chinese chronicles Book of Sui from the History of Northern Dynasties and Old Book of Tang, mention a possession called Sh\u00ed \u77f3 or Zh\u011bsh\u00ed \u8d6d\u6642 with a capital of the same name since the fifth century AD.In 751, the region was conquered by Muslim Arabs.\n\n\n=== Islamic history ===\nIn the mid-seventh century, the Sasanian Persian Empire collapsed as a result of the Arab Muslim conquest of Persia. Under the Samanid dynasty (819\u2013999), whose founder Saman Khuda was a Persian Zoroastrian convert to Islam, the city came to be known as Binkath. However, the Arabs retained the old name of Chach for the surrounding region, pronouncing it ash-Shash (\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0634) instead. Kand, qand, kent, kad, kath, kud\u2014all meaning a city\u2014are derived from the Persian/Sogdian \u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0647 kanda, meaning a town or a city. They are found in city names such as Samarkand, Yarkand, Panjakent, Khujand etc.). After the 16th century, the name evolved from Chachkand/Chashkand to Tashkand. The modern spelling of \"Tashkent\" reflects Russian orthography and 20th-century Soviet influence.\n\n\n=== Mongol conquest and aftermath ===\nThe city was destroyed by Genghis Khan in 1219 and lost much of its population as a result of the Mongols' destruction of the Khwarezmid Empire in 1220.  Under the Timurid and subsequent Shaybanid dynasties, the city's population and culture gradually revived as a prominent strategic center of scholarship, commerce and trade along the Silk Road.\n\n\n=== Kokand khanate ===\nIn 1809, Tashkent was annexed to the Khanate of Kokand. At the time, Tashkent had a population of around 100,000 and was considered the richest city in Central Asia. It prospered greatly through trade with Russia but chafed under Kokand's high taxes. The Tashkent clergy also favored the clergy of Bukhara over that of Kokand. However, before the Emir of Bukhara could capitalize on this discontent, the Russian army arrived.\n\n\n=== Tsarist period ===\n \nIn May 1865, Mikhail Grigorevich Chernyayev (Cherniaev), acting against the direct orders of the tsar and outnumbered at least 15\u20131, staged a daring night attack against a city with a wall 25 kilometres (16 mi) long with 11 gates and 30,000 defenders. While a small contingent staged a diversionary attack, the main force penetrated the walls, led by a Russian Orthodox priest. Although the defense was stiff, the Russians captured the city after two days of heavy fighting and the loss of only 25 dead as opposed to several thousand of the defenders (including Alimqul, the ruler of the Kokand Khanate). Chernyayev dubbed the \"Lion of Tashkent\" by city elders, staged a \"hearts-and-minds\" campaign to win the population over. He abolished taxes for a year, rode unarmed through the streets and bazaars meeting common people, and appointed himself \"Military Governor of Tashkent\", recommending to Tsar Alexander II that the city become an independent khanate under Russian protection.\nThe Tsar liberally rewarded Chernyayev and his men with medals and bonuses, but regarded the impulsive general as a \"loose cannon\", and soon replaced him with General Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman. Far from being granted independence, Tashkent became the capital of the new territory of Russian Turkistan, with Kaufman as first Governor-General. A cantonment and Russian settlement were built across the Ankhor Canal from the old city, and Russian settlers and merchants poured in. Tashkent was a center of espionage in the Great Game rivalry between Russia and the United Kingdom over Central Asia. The Turkestan Military District was established as part of the military reforms of 1874. The Trans-Caspian Railway arrived in 1889, and the railway workers who built it settled in Tashkent as well, bringing with them the seeds of Bolshevik Revolution.\n\n\n=== Effect of the Russian revolution ===\n\nWith the fall of the Russian Empire, the Russian Provisional Government removed all civil restrictions based on religion and nationality, contributing to local enthusiasm for the February Revolution. The Tashkent Soviet of Soldiers' and Workers' Deputies was soon set up, but primarily represented Russian residents, who made up about a fifth of the Tashkent population. Muslim leaders quickly set up the Tashkent Muslim Council (Tashkand Shura-yi-Islamiya) based in the old city. On 10 March 1917, there was a parade with Russian workers marching with red flags, Russian soldiers singing La Marseillaise and thousands of local Central Asians. Following various speeches, Governor-General Aleksey Kuropatkin closed the events with words \"Long Live a great free Russia\".The First Turkestan Muslim Conference was held in Tashkent 16\u201320 April 1917. Like the Muslim Council, it was dominated by the Jadid, Muslim reformers. A more conservative faction emerged in Tashkent centered around the Ulema. This faction proved more successful during the local elections of July 1917. They formed an alliance with Russian conservatives, while the Soviet became more radical. The Soviet attempt to seize power in September 1917 proved unsuccessful.In April 1918, Tashkent became the capital of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkestan ASSR). The new regime was threatened by White forces, basmachi; revolts from within, and purges ordered from Moscow. In 1930, Tashkent fell within the borders of the Uzbek SSR, and became the capital of the Uzbek SSR, displacing Samarkand.\n\n\n=== Soviet period ===\n\nThe city began to industrialize in the 1920s and 1930s.\nViolating the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. The government worked to relocate factories from western Russia and Ukraine to Tashkent to preserve the Soviet industrial capacity. This led to great increase in industry during World War II.\nIt also evacuated most of the German communist emigres to Tashkent. The Russian population increased dramatically; evacuees from the war zones increased the total population of Tashkent to well over a million. Russians and Ukrainians eventually comprised more than half of the total residents of Tashkent. Many of the former refugees stayed in Tashkent to live after the war, rather than return to former homes.\nDuring the postwar period, the Soviet Union established numerous scientific and engineering facilities in Tashkent.\nOn 10 January 1966, then Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistan President Ayub Khan signed a pact in Tashkent with Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin as the mediator to resolve the terms of peace after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. On the next day, Shastri died suddenly, reportedly due to a heart attack. It is widely speculated that Shastri was killed by poisoning the water he drank.Much of Tashkent's old city was destroyed by a powerful earthquake on 26 April 1966. More than 300,000 residents were left homeless, and some 78,000 poorly engineered homes were destroyed, mainly in the densely populated areas of the old city where traditional adobe housing predominated. The Soviet republics, and some other countries such as Finland, sent \"battalions of fraternal peoples\" and urban planners to help rebuild devastated Tashkent.\nTashkent was rebuilt as a model Soviet city with wide streets planted with shade trees, parks, immense plazas for parades, fountains, monuments, and acres of apartment blocks. The Tashkent Metro was also built during this time. About 100,000 new homes were built by 1970, but the builders occupied many, rather than the homeless residents of Tashkent. Further development in the following years increased the size of the city with major new developments in the Chilonzor area, north-east and south-east of the city.At the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Tashkent was the fourth-largest city in the USSR and a center of learning in the fields of science and engineering.\nDue to the 1966 earthquake and the Soviet redevelopment, little architectural heritage has survived of Tashkent's ancient history. Few structures mark its significance as a trading point on the historic Silk Road.\n\n\n=== Capital of Uzbekistan ===\nTashkent is the capital of and the most cosmopolitan city in Uzbekistan. It was noted for its tree-lined streets, numerous fountains, and pleasant parks, at least until the tree-cutting campaigns initiated in 2009 by the local government.\n\nSince 1991, the city has changed economically, culturally, and architecturally. New development has superseded or replaced icons of the Soviet era. The largest statue ever erected for Lenin was replaced with a globe, featuring a geographic map of Uzbekistan. Buildings from the Soviet era have been replaced with new modern buildings. The \"Downtown Tashkent\" district includes the 22-story NBU Bank building, international hotels, the International Business Center, and the Plaza Building.\n\nThe Tashkent Business district is a special district, established for the development of small, medium and large businesses in Uzbekistan. In 2018, was started to build a Tashkent city (new Downtown) which would include a new business district with skyscrapers of local and foreign companies, world hotels, apartments, biggest mall, shops and other entertainments. The construction of the International Business Center is planned to be completed by the end of 2021  Fitch assigns \u201cBB-\u201d rating to Tashkent city, \u201cStable\u201d forecast In 2007, Tashkent was named a \"cultural capital of the Islamic world\" by Moscow News, as the city has numerous historic mosques and significant Islamic sites, including the Islamic University. Tashkent holds the Samarkand Kufic Quran, one of the earliest written copies of the Quran, which has been located in the city since 1924.Tashkent is the most visited city in the country, and has greatly benefited from increasing tourism as a result of reforms under president Shavkat Mirziyoyev and opening up by making visas easier for foreigners.\n\n\n=== Tashkent over the years ===\nDevelopment of Tashkent\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Origin of television ==\nThe first demonstration of a fully electronic TV set to the public was made in Tashkent in summer 1928 by Boris Grabovsky and his team. In his method that had been patented in Saratov in 1925, Boris Grabovsky proposed a new principle of TV imaging based on the vertical and horizontal electron beam sweeping under high voltage. Nowadays this principle of the TV imaging is used practically in all modern cathode-ray tubes. Historian and ethnographer Boris Golender (\u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440 in Russian), in a video lecture, described this event. This date of demonstration of the fully electronic TV set is the earliest known so far. Despite this fact, most modern historians disputably consider Vladimir Zworykin and Philo Farnsworth as inventors of the first fully electronic TV set. In 1964, the contribution made to the development of early television by Grabovsky was officially acknowledged by the Uzbek government and he was awarded the prestigious degree \"Honorable Inventor of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic\".\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Geography ===\nTashkent is situated in a well-watered plain on the road between Samarkand, Uzbekistan's second city, and Shymkent across the border. Tashkent is just 13 km from two border crossings into Kazakhstan. Closest geographic cities with populations of over 1 million are: Shymkent (Kazakhstan), Dushanbe (Tajikistan), Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan), Kashgar (China), Almaty (Kazakhstan), Kabul (Afghanistan) and Peshawar (Pakistan).\nTashkent sits at the confluence of the Chirchiq River and several of its tributaries and is built on deep alluvial deposits up to 15 metres (49 ft). The city is located in an active tectonic area suffering large numbers of tremors and some earthquakes.\nThe local time in Tashkent is UTC/GMT +5 hours.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTashkent features a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) bordering a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dsa). As a result, Tashkent experiences cold and often snowy winters not typically associated with most Mediterranean climates and long, hot and dry summers. Winters are cold and often snowy, covering the months of December, January and February. Most precipitation occurs during these months which frequently falls as snow. The city experiences two peaks of precipitation in the early winter and spring. The slightly unusual precipitation pattern is partially due to its 500 m (roughly 1600 feet) altitude. Summers are long in Tashkent, usually lasting from May to September. Tashkent can be extremely hot during the months of July and August. The city also sees very little precipitation during the summer, particularly from June through September.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn 1983, the population of Tashkent amounted to 1,902,000 people living in a municipal area of 256 km2 (99 sq mi). By 1991, (break-up of Soviet Union) the number of permanent residents of the capital had grown to approximately 2,136,600. Tashkent was the fourth most populated city in the former USSR, after Moscow, Leningrad (St. Petersburg), and Kiev. Nowadays, Tashkent remains the fourth most populous city in the CIS and Baltic countries. The population of the city was 2,295,300 people in 2004.As of 2008, the demographic structure of Tashkent was as follows:\n\n63.0% \u2013 Uzbeks\n20.0% \u2013 Russians\n4.5% \u2013 Tatars\n2.2% \u2013 Koryo-saram (Koreans)\n2.1% \u2013 Tajiks\n1.2% \u2013 Uighurs\n7.0% \u2013 other ethnic backgroundsRussian and Uzbek are both the main spoken languages. As with most of Uzbekistan, street signs and other things are often a mix of Latin and Cyrillic scripts.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\nTashkent is divided into the following districts (Uzbek: Tuman):\n\nAt the time of the Tsarist take over it had four districts (Uzbek daha):\n\nBeshyoghoch\nKukcha\nShaykhontokhur\nSebzorIn 1940 it had the following districts (Russian \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d):\n\nOktyabr\nKirov\nStalin\nFrunze\nLenin\nKuybishevBy 1981 they were reorganized into:\nBektemir\nAkmal-Ikramov (Uchtepa)\nKhamza (Yashnobod)\nLenin (Mirobod)\nKuybishev (Mirzo Ulugbek)\nSergeli\nOktober (Shaykhontokhur)\nSobir Rakhimov (Olmazar)\nChilanzar\nFrunze (Yakkasaray)\nKirov (Yunusabad)\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nDue to the destruction of most of the ancient city during the 1917 revolution and, later, the 1966 earthquake, little remains of Tashkent's traditional architectural heritage. Tashkent is, however, rich in museums and Soviet-era monuments. They include:\n\nKukeldash Madrasah. Dating back to the reign of Abdullah Khan II (1557\u20131598) it is being restored by the provincial Religious Board of Mawarannahr Moslems. There is talk of making it into a museum, but it is currently being used as a madrassah.\nChorsu Bazaar, located near the Kukeldash Madrassa. This huge open air bazaar is the center of the old town of Tashkent. Everything imaginable is for sale. It is one of the major tourist attractions of the city.\nTelyashayakh Mosque (Khast Imam Mosque).  It Contains the Uthman Qur'an, considered to be the oldest extant Qur'an in the world. Dating from 655 and stained with the blood of murdered caliph, Uthman, it was brought by Timur to Samarkand, seized by the Russians as a war trophy and taken to Saint Petersburg. It was returned to Uzbekistan in 1924.\nYunus Khan Mausoleum. It is a group of three 15th-century mausoleums, restored in the 19th century. The biggest is the grave of Yunus Khan, grandfather of Mughal Empire founder Babur.\nPalace of Prince Romanov. During the 19th century Grand Duke Nikolai Konstantinovich, a first cousin of Alexander III of Russia was banished to Tashkent for some shady deals involving the Russian Crown Jewels. His palace still survives in the centre of the city. Once a museum, it has been appropriated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nAlisher Navoi Opera and Ballet Theatre, built by the same architect who designed Lenin's Tomb in Moscow, Aleksey Shchusev, with Japanese prisoner of war labor in World War II. It hosts Russian ballet and opera.\nFine Arts Museum of Uzbekistan.

          "The things displayed are of interest. Even more, I'd guess, if you're into local handicrafts. Also, the house in which it's built is the former residence of a Russian ambassador, who decorated it in a very peculiar way.",
          "Our tour included about a one hour stop at this museum. I accept that's not long enough to do it full justice. We had the benefit of a guide which was vital to explaining the exhibits and their significance. I don't think a foreign visitor would appreciate everything so well",

          "This museum is housed in the house built in the 1920s for the Russian ambassador and the public rooms of the former house are worth a look. The collection of Applied art is mostly 20th century and may be interesting if you do not have time to visit elsewhere in Uzbekistan but",

        "wiki": "Boomerang is a model of roller coaster manufactured and designed by Vekoma, a Dutch manufacturer. The roller coaster model name is from the hunting implement based on the traditions of the Indigenous Australians. As of September 2020 there are 55 Boomerangs operating.\nThe roller coaster model was created in the early 1980s and was first introduced at four different parks around the world in 1984.\n\n\n== Design and ride experience ==\n\nThe Boomerang consists of a single train with seven cars, capable of carrying 28 passengers. The ride begins when the train is pulled backwards from the station and up the first lift hill by a catchcar. After being released, the train passes through the station, enters a Cobra roll element (referred to as a boomerang by the designers) and then travels through a vertical loop. After being pulled up a second lift hill, the train is released to head backwards through each inversion once more, making the total number of inversions per ride six. The train slows down as it passes through the station backwards and then comes to a complete stop in the station. This coaster model is popular among many amusement parks in the United States, but it has appeared at amusement parks around the world.\nBoomerang coasters have occasionally stalled, often in the Cobra Roll element. As a precaution, many Boomerang coasters are built with an access platform just under the Cobra Roll/Boomerang element.\n\n\n== Variant designs ==\nThere are three main design variants based on the Boomerang layout, all of which are produced by Vekoma.\n\n\n=== Invertigo ===\n\nThe first variant of the Boomerang is the Invertigo. While retaining the same layout as the Boomerang, the Invertigo has inverted track, turning it into an inverted roller coaster. Each car has two rows of seats that are back-to-back, so the riders in the back row of each car would be facing those in the front of the trailing car. The first Invertigo, HangOver at Liseberg in Gothenburg, Sweden was supposed to open in 1996 with a new linear induction motor (LIM) or LSM lift. However, development problems delayed the ride's opening to 1997, and the design was remade to include a traditional chain lift like the original Boomerang. Only four Invertigo models were ever built.\n\n\n=== Giant Inverted Boomerang ===\n\nThe second design is known as both the Giant Inverted Boomerang and the Super Invertigo. While maintaining a similar layout to the Boomerang, the track is again inverted and the size of the ride is increased. The track is 270 feet (82 m) longer, the two lift hills are almost 80 feet (24 m) taller and both hills are vertical. The track also crosses over, with the station underneath the vertical loop. The train has 8 cars, with the four seats of each car arranged in a chevron. As of 2011, four Giant Inverted Boomerangs operate and one was under construction. The ones that operate currently are Goliath at Six Flags New England (Previously located at Six Flags Magic Mountain as D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu), Aftershock at Silverwood Theme Park (Previously located at Six Flags Great America as D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu) and Stunt Fall at Parque Warner Madrid. Sky Mountain at Mirabalandia (Previously located at Six Flags Over Georgia as D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu) is currently being reassembled for a 2019 opening. A fifth Vekoma Giant Inverted Boomerang opened in 2011, the first brand-new such coaster in a decade; called Mountain Peak, it is located at Jinjiang Action Park.\n\n\n=== Family Boomerang ===\nIn late 2010, Vekoma announced that they would be manufacturing a Family Boomerang. The prototype opened in Drayton Manor Theme Park as Ben 10 - Ultimate Mission in April 2011 later renamed to Accelerator. Another layout was introduced on 17 May 2016 as Velociraptor in the Lost Kingdom area of Paultons Park. Unlike the other Boomerang roller coasters a Family Boomerang does not feature any inversions but it still has a similar shuttle design. The ride has two end spikes and generally a figure-8 design in the layout. Phantasialand added the world's largest family boomerang in 2016, in the new area Klugheim to complement the Intamin Blitz ride, Taron.\n\n\n== Layouts ==\n\n\n== Ride locations ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nInvertigo (roller coaster)\nGiant Inverted Boomerang\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nListing of Boomerang roller coasters at RCDB\nListing of Invertigo roller coasters at RCDB\nListing of Giant Inverted Boomerang roller coasters at RCDB\nDetailed Technical Article about Boomerang Roller Coasters\nBoomerang official website\nFamily Boomerang official website",

        "wiki": "Tashkent (; Russian pronunciation: [t\u0250\u0282\u02c8k\u02b2ent]; Russian: \u0422\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442, tr. Tashkent), or Toshkent (Uzbek pronunciation: [t\u0252\u0283\u02c8kent]; Uzbek: Toshkent, \u0422\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442, \u062a\u0627\u0634\u0643\u06cc\u0646\u062a\u200e), is the capital and largest city of Uzbekistan, as well as the most populous city in ex-Soviet Central Asia, with a population in 2018 of 2,485,900. It is in northeastern Uzbekistan, near the border with Kazakhstan.\nBefore Islamic influence started in the mid 8th century AD, Tashkent was influenced by the Sogdian and Turkic cultures. After Genghis Khan destroyed it in 1219, it was rebuilt and profited from the Silk Road. From the 18th to the 19th century, the city became an independent city-state, before being re-conquered by the Khanate of Kokand. In 1865, Tashkent fell to the Russian Empire, and became the capital of Russian Turkestan. In Soviet times, it witnessed major growth and demographic changes due to forced deportations from throughout the Soviet Union. Much of Tashkent was destroyed in the 1966 Tashkent earthquake, but it was rebuilt as a model Soviet city. It was the fourth-largest city in the Soviet Union at the time, after Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev.\nToday, as the capital of an independent Uzbekistan, Tashkent retains a multiethnic population, with ethnic Uzbeks as the majority. In 2009, it celebrated its 2,200 years of written history.\n\n\n== History ==\nSee also: Timeline of Tashkent and History of TashkentDuring its long history, Tashkent has had various changes in names and political and religious affiliations.\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nTashkent was settled by ancient people as an oasis on the Chirchik River, near the foothills of the West Tian Shan Mountains. In ancient times, this area contained Beitian, probably the summer \"capital\" of the Kangju confederacy. Some scholars believe that a \"Stone Tower\" mentioned by Ptolemy and by other early accounts of travel on the Silk Road referred to this settlement (\"Tashkent\" means \"stone city\"). This tower is said to have marked the midway point between Europe and China. Other scholars, however, disagree with this identification, though it remains one of four most probable sites for the Stone Tower.\n\n\n=== History as Chach ===\nIn pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, the town and the province were known as Chach.  The Shahnameh of Ferdowsi also refers to the city as Chach.\nThe principality of Chach had a square citadel built around the 5th to 3rd centuries BC, some 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) south of the Syr Darya River. By the 7th century AD, Chach had more than 30 towns and a network of over 50 canals, forming a trade center between the Sogdians and Turkic nomads. The Buddhist monk Xuanzang (602/603? \u2013 664 AD), who travelled from China to India through Central Asia, mentioned the name of the city as Zh\u011bsh\u00ed (\u8d6d\u6642. The Chinese chronicles Book of Sui from the History of Northern Dynasties and Old Book of Tang, mention a possession called Sh\u00ed \u77f3 or Zh\u011bsh\u00ed \u8d6d\u6642 with a capital of the same name since the fifth century AD.In 751, the region was conquered by Muslim Arabs.\n\n\n=== Islamic history ===\nIn the mid-seventh century, the Sasanian Persian Empire collapsed as a result of the Arab Muslim conquest of Persia. Under the Samanid dynasty (819\u2013999), whose founder Saman Khuda was a Persian Zoroastrian convert to Islam, the city came to be known as Binkath. However, the Arabs retained the old name of Chach for the surrounding region, pronouncing it ash-Shash (\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0634) instead. Kand, qand, kent, kad, kath, kud\u2014all meaning a city\u2014are derived from the Persian/Sogdian \u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0647 kanda, meaning a town or a city. They are found in city names such as Samarkand, Yarkand, Panjakent, Khujand etc.). After the 16th century, the name evolved from Chachkand/Chashkand to Tashkand. The modern spelling of \"Tashkent\" reflects Russian orthography and 20th-century Soviet influence.\n\n\n=== Mongol conquest and aftermath ===\nThe city was destroyed by Genghis Khan in 1219 and lost much of its population as a result of the Mongols' destruction of the Khwarezmid Empire in 1220.  Under the Timurid and subsequent Shaybanid dynasties, the city's population and culture gradually revived as a prominent strategic center of scholarship, commerce and trade along the Silk Road.\n\n\n=== Kokand khanate ===\nIn 1809, Tashkent was annexed to the Khanate of Kokand. At the time, Tashkent had a population of around 100,000 and was considered the richest city in Central Asia. It prospered greatly through trade with Russia but chafed under Kokand's high taxes. The Tashkent clergy also favored the clergy of Bukhara over that of Kokand. However, before the Emir of Bukhara could capitalize on this discontent, the Russian army arrived.\n\n\n=== Tsarist period ===\n \nIn May 1865, Mikhail Grigorevich Chernyayev (Cherniaev), acting against the direct orders of the tsar and outnumbered at least 15\u20131, staged a daring night attack against a city with a wall 25 kilometres (16 mi) long with 11 gates and 30,000 defenders. While a small contingent staged a diversionary attack, the main force penetrated the walls, led by a Russian Orthodox priest. Although the defense was stiff, the Russians captured the city after two days of heavy fighting and the loss of only 25 dead as opposed to several thousand of the defenders (including Alimqul, the ruler of the Kokand Khanate). Chernyayev dubbed the \"Lion of Tashkent\" by city elders, staged a \"hearts-and-minds\" campaign to win the population over. He abolished taxes for a year, rode unarmed through the streets and bazaars meeting common people, and appointed himself \"Military Governor of Tashkent\", recommending to Tsar Alexander II that the city become an independent khanate under Russian protection.\nThe Tsar liberally rewarded Chernyayev and his men with medals and bonuses, but regarded the impulsive general as a \"loose cannon\", and soon replaced him with General Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman. Far from being granted independence, Tashkent became the capital of the new territory of Russian Turkistan, with Kaufman as first Governor-General. A cantonment and Russian settlement were built across the Ankhor Canal from the old city, and Russian settlers and merchants poured in. Tashkent was a center of espionage in the Great Game rivalry between Russia and the United Kingdom over Central Asia. The Turkestan Military District was established as part of the military reforms of 1874. The Trans-Caspian Railway arrived in 1889, and the railway workers who built it settled in Tashkent as well, bringing with them the seeds of Bolshevik Revolution.\n\n\n=== Effect of the Russian revolution ===\n\nWith the fall of the Russian Empire, the Russian Provisional Government removed all civil restrictions based on religion and nationality, contributing to local enthusiasm for the February Revolution. The Tashkent Soviet of Soldiers' and Workers' Deputies was soon set up, but primarily represented Russian residents, who made up about a fifth of the Tashkent population. Muslim leaders quickly set up the Tashkent Muslim Council (Tashkand Shura-yi-Islamiya) based in the old city. On 10 March 1917, there was a parade with Russian workers marching with red flags, Russian soldiers singing La Marseillaise and thousands of local Central Asians. Following various speeches, Governor-General Aleksey Kuropatkin closed the events with words \"Long Live a great free Russia\".The First Turkestan Muslim Conference was held in Tashkent 16\u201320 April 1917. Like the Muslim Council, it was dominated by the Jadid, Muslim reformers. A more conservative faction emerged in Tashkent centered around the Ulema. This faction proved more successful during the local elections of July 1917. They formed an alliance with Russian conservatives, while the Soviet became more radical. The Soviet attempt to seize power in September 1917 proved unsuccessful.In April 1918, Tashkent became the capital of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkestan ASSR). The new regime was threatened by White forces, basmachi; revolts from within, and purges ordered from Moscow. In 1930, Tashkent fell within the borders of the Uzbek SSR, and became the capital of the Uzbek SSR, displacing Samarkand.\n\n\n=== Soviet period ===\n\nThe city began to industrialize in the 1920s and 1930s.\nViolating the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. The government worked to relocate factories from western Russia and Ukraine to Tashkent to preserve the Soviet industrial capacity. This led to great increase in industry during World War II.\nIt also evacuated most of the German communist emigres to Tashkent. The Russian population increased dramatically; evacuees from the war zones increased the total population of Tashkent to well over a million. Russians and Ukrainians eventually comprised more than half of the total residents of Tashkent. Many of the former refugees stayed in Tashkent to live after the war, rather than return to former homes.\nDuring the postwar period, the Soviet Union established numerous scientific and engineering facilities in Tashkent.\nOn 10 January 1966, then Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistan President Ayub Khan signed a pact in Tashkent with Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin as the mediator to resolve the terms of peace after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. On the next day, Shastri died suddenly, reportedly due to a heart attack. It is widely speculated that Shastri was killed by poisoning the water he drank.Much of Tashkent's old city was destroyed by a powerful earthquake on 26 April 1966. More than 300,000 residents were left homeless, and some 78,000 poorly engineered homes were destroyed, mainly in the densely populated areas of the old city where traditional adobe housing predominated. The Soviet republics, and some other countries such as Finland, sent \"battalions of fraternal peoples\" and urban planners to help rebuild devastated Tashkent.\nTashkent was rebuilt as a model Soviet city with wide streets planted with shade trees, parks, immense plazas for parades, fountains, monuments, and acres of apartment blocks. The Tashkent Metro was also built during this time. About 100,000 new homes were built by 1970, but the builders occupied many, rather than the homeless residents of Tashkent. Further development in the following years increased the size of the city with major new developments in the Chilonzor area, north-east and south-east of the city.At the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Tashkent was the fourth-largest city in the USSR and a center of learning in the fields of science and engineering.\nDue to the 1966 earthquake and the Soviet redevelopment, little architectural heritage has survived of Tashkent's ancient history. Few structures mark its significance as a trading point on the historic Silk Road.\n\n\n=== Capital of Uzbekistan ===\nTashkent is the capital of and the most cosmopolitan city in Uzbekistan. It was noted for its tree-lined streets, numerous fountains, and pleasant parks, at least until the tree-cutting campaigns initiated in 2009 by the local government.\n\nSince 1991, the city has changed economically, culturally, and architecturally. New development has superseded or replaced icons of the Soviet era. The largest statue ever erected for Lenin was replaced with a globe, featuring a geographic map of Uzbekistan. Buildings from the Soviet era have been replaced with new modern buildings. The \"Downtown Tashkent\" district includes the 22-story NBU Bank building, international hotels, the International Business Center, and the Plaza Building.\n\nThe Tashkent Business district is a special district, established for the development of small, medium and large businesses in Uzbekistan. In 2018, was started to build a Tashkent city (new Downtown) which would include a new business district with skyscrapers of local and foreign companies, world hotels, apartments, biggest mall, shops and other entertainments. The construction of the International Business Center is planned to be completed by the end of 2021  Fitch assigns \u201cBB-\u201d rating to Tashkent city, \u201cStable\u201d forecast In 2007, Tashkent was named a \"cultural capital of the Islamic world\" by Moscow News, as the city has numerous historic mosques and significant Islamic sites, including the Islamic University. Tashkent holds the Samarkand Kufic Quran, one of the earliest written copies of the Quran, which has been located in the city since 1924.Tashkent is the most visited city in the country, and has greatly benefited from increasing tourism as a result of reforms under president Shavkat Mirziyoyev and opening up by making visas easier for foreigners.\n\n\n=== Tashkent over the years ===\nDevelopment of Tashkent\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Origin of television ==\nThe first demonstration of a fully electronic TV set to the public was made in Tashkent in summer 1928 by Boris Grabovsky and his team. In his method that had been patented in Saratov in 1925, Boris Grabovsky proposed a new principle of TV imaging based on the vertical and horizontal electron beam sweeping under high voltage. Nowadays this principle of the TV imaging is used practically in all modern cathode-ray tubes. Historian and ethnographer Boris Golender (\u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440 in Russian), in a video lecture, described this event. This date of demonstration of the fully electronic TV set is the earliest known so far. Despite this fact, most modern historians disputably consider Vladimir Zworykin and Philo Farnsworth as inventors of the first fully electronic TV set. In 1964, the contribution made to the development of early television by Grabovsky was officially acknowledged by the Uzbek government and he was awarded the prestigious degree \"Honorable Inventor of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic\".\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Geography ===\nTashkent is situated in a well-watered plain on the road between Samarkand, Uzbekistan's second city, and Shymkent across the border. Tashkent is just 13 km from two border crossings into Kazakhstan. Closest geographic cities with populations of over 1 million are: Shymkent (Kazakhstan), Dushanbe (Tajikistan), Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan), Kashgar (China), Almaty (Kazakhstan), Kabul (Afghanistan) and Peshawar (Pakistan).\nTashkent sits at the confluence of the Chirchiq River and several of its tributaries and is built on deep alluvial deposits up to 15 metres (49 ft). The city is located in an active tectonic area suffering large numbers of tremors and some earthquakes.\nThe local time in Tashkent is UTC/GMT +5 hours.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTashkent features a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) bordering a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dsa). As a result, Tashkent experiences cold and often snowy winters not typically associated with most Mediterranean climates and long, hot and dry summers. Winters are cold and often snowy, covering the months of December, January and February. Most precipitation occurs during these months which frequently falls as snow. The city experiences two peaks of precipitation in the early winter and spring. The slightly unusual precipitation pattern is partially due to its 500 m (roughly 1600 feet) altitude. Summers are long in Tashkent, usually lasting from May to September. Tashkent can be extremely hot during the months of July and August. The city also sees very little precipitation during the summer, particularly from June through September.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn 1983, the population of Tashkent amounted to 1,902,000 people living in a municipal area of 256 km2 (99 sq mi). By 1991, (break-up of Soviet Union) the number of permanent residents of the capital had grown to approximately 2,136,600. Tashkent was the fourth most populated city in the former USSR, after Moscow, Leningrad (St. Petersburg), and Kiev. Nowadays, Tashkent remains the fourth most populous city in the CIS and Baltic countries. The population of the city was 2,295,300 people in 2004.As of 2008, the demographic structure of Tashkent was as follows:\n\n63.0% \u2013 Uzbeks\n20.0% \u2013 Russians\n4.5% \u2013 Tatars\n2.2% \u2013 Koryo-saram (Koreans)\n2.1% \u2013 Tajiks\n1.2% \u2013 Uighurs\n7.0% \u2013 other ethnic backgroundsRussian and Uzbek are both the main spoken languages. As with most of Uzbekistan, street signs and other things are often a mix of Latin and Cyrillic scripts.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\nTashkent is divided into the following districts (Uzbek: Tuman):\n\nAt the time of the Tsarist take over it had four districts (Uzbek daha):\n\nBeshyoghoch\nKukcha\nShaykhontokhur\nSebzorIn 1940 it had the following districts (Russian \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d):\n\nOktyabr\nKirov\nStalin\nFrunze\nLenin\nKuybishevBy 1981 they were reorganized into:\nBektemir\nAkmal-Ikramov (Uchtepa)\nKhamza (Yashnobod)\nLenin (Mirobod)\nKuybishev (Mirzo Ulugbek)\nSergeli\nOktober (Shaykhontokhur)\nSobir Rakhimov (Olmazar)\nChilanzar\nFrunze (Yakkasaray)\nKirov (Yunusabad)\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nDue to the destruction of most of the ancient city during the 1917 revolution and, later, the 1966 earthquake, little remains of Tashkent's traditional architectural heritage. Tashkent is, however, rich in museums and Soviet-era monuments. They include:\n\nKukeldash Madrasah. Dating back to the reign of Abdullah Khan II (1557\u20131598) it is being restored by the provincial Religious Board of Mawarannahr Moslems. There is talk of making it into a museum, but it is currently being used as a madrassah.\nChorsu Bazaar, located near the Kukeldash Madrassa. This huge open air bazaar is the center of the old town of Tashkent. Everything imaginable is for sale.

        "wiki": "Tashkent (; Russian pronunciation: [t\u0250\u0282\u02c8k\u02b2ent]; Russian: \u0422\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442, tr. Tashkent), or Toshkent (Uzbek pronunciation: [t\u0252\u0283\u02c8kent]; Uzbek: Toshkent, \u0422\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0442, \u062a\u0627\u0634\u0643\u06cc\u0646\u062a\u200e), is the capital and largest city of Uzbekistan, as well as the most populous city in ex-Soviet Central Asia, with a population in 2018 of 2,485,900. It is in northeastern Uzbekistan, near the border with Kazakhstan.\nBefore Islamic influence started in the mid 8th century AD, Tashkent was influenced by the Sogdian and Turkic cultures. After Genghis Khan destroyed it in 1219, it was rebuilt and profited from the Silk Road. From the 18th to the 19th century, the city became an independent city-state, before being re-conquered by the Khanate of Kokand. In 1865, Tashkent fell to the Russian Empire, and became the capital of Russian Turkestan. In Soviet times, it witnessed major growth and demographic changes due to forced deportations from throughout the Soviet Union. Much of Tashkent was destroyed in the 1966 Tashkent earthquake, but it was rebuilt as a model Soviet city. It was the fourth-largest city in the Soviet Union at the time, after Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev.\nToday, as the capital of an independent Uzbekistan, Tashkent retains a multiethnic population, with ethnic Uzbeks as the majority. In 2009, it celebrated its 2,200 years of written history.\n\n\n== History ==\nSee also: Timeline of Tashkent and History of TashkentDuring its long history, Tashkent has had various changes in names and political and religious affiliations.\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nTashkent was settled by ancient people as an oasis on the Chirchik River, near the foothills of the West Tian Shan Mountains. In ancient times, this area contained Beitian, probably the summer \"capital\" of the Kangju confederacy. Some scholars believe that a \"Stone Tower\" mentioned by Ptolemy and by other early accounts of travel on the Silk Road referred to this settlement (\"Tashkent\" means \"stone city\"). This tower is said to have marked the midway point between Europe and China. Other scholars, however, disagree with this identification, though it remains one of four most probable sites for the Stone Tower.\n\n\n=== History as Chach ===\nIn pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, the town and the province were known as Chach.  The Shahnameh of Ferdowsi also refers to the city as Chach.\nThe principality of Chach had a square citadel built around the 5th to 3rd centuries BC, some 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) south of the Syr Darya River. By the 7th century AD, Chach had more than 30 towns and a network of over 50 canals, forming a trade center between the Sogdians and Turkic nomads. The Buddhist monk Xuanzang (602/603? \u2013 664 AD), who travelled from China to India through Central Asia, mentioned the name of the city as Zh\u011bsh\u00ed (\u8d6d\u6642. The Chinese chronicles Book of Sui from the History of Northern Dynasties and Old Book of Tang, mention a possession called Sh\u00ed \u77f3 or Zh\u011bsh\u00ed \u8d6d\u6642 with a capital of the same name since the fifth century AD.In 751, the region was conquered by Muslim Arabs.\n\n\n=== Islamic history ===\nIn the mid-seventh century, the Sasanian Persian Empire collapsed as a result of the Arab Muslim conquest of Persia. Under the Samanid dynasty (819\u2013999), whose founder Saman Khuda was a Persian Zoroastrian convert to Islam, the city came to be known as Binkath. However, the Arabs retained the old name of Chach for the surrounding region, pronouncing it ash-Shash (\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0634) instead. Kand, qand, kent, kad, kath, kud\u2014all meaning a city\u2014are derived from the Persian/Sogdian \u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0647 kanda, meaning a town or a city. They are found in city names such as Samarkand, Yarkand, Panjakent, Khujand etc.). After the 16th century, the name evolved from Chachkand/Chashkand to Tashkand. The modern spelling of \"Tashkent\" reflects Russian orthography and 20th-century Soviet influence.\n\n\n=== Mongol conquest and aftermath ===\nThe city was destroyed by Genghis Khan in 1219 and lost much of its population as a result of the Mongols' destruction of the Khwarezmid Empire in 1220.  Under the Timurid and subsequent Shaybanid dynasties, the city's population and culture gradually revived as a prominent strategic center of scholarship, commerce and trade along the Silk Road.\n\n\n=== Kokand khanate ===\nIn 1809, Tashkent was annexed to the Khanate of Kokand. At the time, Tashkent had a population of around 100,000 and was considered the richest city in Central Asia. It prospered greatly through trade with Russia but chafed under Kokand's high taxes. The Tashkent clergy also favored the clergy of Bukhara over that of Kokand. However, before the Emir of Bukhara could capitalize on this discontent, the Russian army arrived.\n\n\n=== Tsarist period ===\n \nIn May 1865, Mikhail Grigorevich Chernyayev (Cherniaev), acting against the direct orders of the tsar and outnumbered at least 15\u20131, staged a daring night attack against a city with a wall 25 kilometres (16 mi) long with 11 gates and 30,000 defenders. While a small contingent staged a diversionary attack, the main force penetrated the walls, led by a Russian Orthodox priest. Although the defense was stiff, the Russians captured the city after two days of heavy fighting and the loss of only 25 dead as opposed to several thousand of the defenders (including Alimqul, the ruler of the Kokand Khanate). Chernyayev dubbed the \"Lion of Tashkent\" by city elders, staged a \"hearts-and-minds\" campaign to win the population over. He abolished taxes for a year, rode unarmed through the streets and bazaars meeting common people, and appointed himself \"Military Governor of Tashkent\", recommending to Tsar Alexander II that the city become an independent khanate under Russian protection.\nThe Tsar liberally rewarded Chernyayev and his men with medals and bonuses, but regarded the impulsive general as a \"loose cannon\", and soon replaced him with General Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman. Far from being granted independence, Tashkent became the capital of the new territory of Russian Turkistan, with Kaufman as first Governor-General. A cantonment and Russian settlement were built across the Ankhor Canal from the old city, and Russian settlers and merchants poured in. Tashkent was a center of espionage in the Great Game rivalry between Russia and the United Kingdom over Central Asia. The Turkestan Military District was established as part of the military reforms of 1874. The Trans-Caspian Railway arrived in 1889, and the railway workers who built it settled in Tashkent as well, bringing with them the seeds of Bolshevik Revolution.\n\n\n=== Effect of the Russian revolution ===\n\nWith the fall of the Russian Empire, the Russian Provisional Government removed all civil restrictions based on religion and nationality, contributing to local enthusiasm for the February Revolution. The Tashkent Soviet of Soldiers' and Workers' Deputies was soon set up, but primarily represented Russian residents, who made up about a fifth of the Tashkent population. Muslim leaders quickly set up the Tashkent Muslim Council (Tashkand Shura-yi-Islamiya) based in the old city. On 10 March 1917, there was a parade with Russian workers marching with red flags, Russian soldiers singing La Marseillaise and thousands of local Central Asians. Following various speeches, Governor-General Aleksey Kuropatkin closed the events with words \"Long Live a great free Russia\".The First Turkestan Muslim Conference was held in Tashkent 16\u201320 April 1917. Like the Muslim Council, it was dominated by the Jadid, Muslim reformers. A more conservative faction emerged in Tashkent centered around the Ulema. This faction proved more successful during the local elections of July 1917. They formed an alliance with Russian conservatives, while the Soviet became more radical. The Soviet attempt to seize power in September 1917 proved unsuccessful.In April 1918, Tashkent became the capital of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkestan ASSR). The new regime was threatened by White forces, basmachi; revolts from within, and purges ordered from Moscow. In 1930, Tashkent fell within the borders of the Uzbek SSR, and became the capital of the Uzbek SSR, displacing Samarkand.\n\n\n=== Soviet period ===\n\nThe city began to industrialize in the 1920s and 1930s.\nViolating the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. The government worked to relocate factories from western Russia and Ukraine to Tashkent to preserve the Soviet industrial capacity. This led to great increase in industry during World War II.\nIt also evacuated most of the German communist emigres to Tashkent. The Russian population increased dramatically; evacuees from the war zones increased the total population of Tashkent to well over a million. Russians and Ukrainians eventually comprised more than half of the total residents of Tashkent. Many of the former refugees stayed in Tashkent to live after the war, rather than return to former homes.\nDuring the postwar period, the Soviet Union established numerous scientific and engineering facilities in Tashkent.\nOn 10 January 1966, then Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistan President Ayub Khan signed a pact in Tashkent with Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin as the mediator to resolve the terms of peace after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. On the next day, Shastri died suddenly, reportedly due to a heart attack. It is widely speculated that Shastri was killed by poisoning the water he drank.Much of Tashkent's old city was destroyed by a powerful earthquake on 26 April 1966. More than 300,000 residents were left homeless, and some 78,000 poorly engineered homes were destroyed, mainly in the densely populated areas of the old city where traditional adobe housing predominated. The Soviet republics, and some other countries such as Finland, sent \"battalions of fraternal peoples\" and urban planners to help rebuild devastated Tashkent.\nTashkent was rebuilt as a model Soviet city with wide streets planted with shade trees, parks, immense plazas for parades, fountains, monuments, and acres of apartment blocks. The Tashkent Metro was also built during this time. About 100,000 new homes were built by 1970, but the builders occupied many, rather than the homeless residents of Tashkent. Further development in the following years increased the size of the city with major new developments in the Chilonzor area, north-east and south-east of the city.At the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Tashkent was the fourth-largest city in the USSR and a center of learning in the fields of science and engineering.\nDue to the 1966 earthquake and the Soviet redevelopment, little architectural heritage has survived of Tashkent's ancient history. Few structures mark its significance as a trading point on the historic Silk Road.\n\n\n=== Capital of Uzbekistan ===\nTashkent is the capital of and the most cosmopolitan city in Uzbekistan. It was noted for its tree-lined streets, numerous fountains, and pleasant parks, at least until the tree-cutting campaigns initiated in 2009 by the local government.\n\nSince 1991, the city has changed economically, culturally, and architecturally. New development has superseded or replaced icons of the Soviet era. The largest statue ever erected for Lenin was replaced with a globe, featuring a geographic map of Uzbekistan. Buildings from the Soviet era have been replaced with new modern buildings. The \"Downtown Tashkent\" district includes the 22-story NBU Bank building, international hotels, the International Business Center, and the Plaza Building.\n\nThe Tashkent Business district is a special district, established for the development of small, medium and large businesses in Uzbekistan. In 2018, was started to build a Tashkent city (new Downtown) which would include a new business district with skyscrapers of local and foreign companies, world hotels, apartments, biggest mall, shops and other entertainments. The construction of the International Business Center is planned to be completed by the end of 2021  Fitch assigns \u201cBB-\u201d rating to Tashkent city, \u201cStable\u201d forecast In 2007, Tashkent was named a \"cultural capital of the Islamic world\" by Moscow News, as the city has numerous historic mosques and significant Islamic sites, including the Islamic University. Tashkent holds the Samarkand Kufic Quran, one of the earliest written copies of the Quran, which has been located in the city since 1924.Tashkent is the most visited city in the country, and has greatly benefited from increasing tourism as a result of reforms under president Shavkat Mirziyoyev and opening up by making visas easier for foreigners.\n\n\n=== Tashkent over the years ===\nDevelopment of Tashkent\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Origin of television ==\nThe first demonstration of a fully electronic TV set to the public was made in Tashkent in summer 1928 by Boris Grabovsky and his team. In his method that had been patented in Saratov in 1925, Boris Grabovsky proposed a new principle of TV imaging based on the vertical and horizontal electron beam sweeping under high voltage. Nowadays this principle of the TV imaging is used practically in all modern cathode-ray tubes. Historian and ethnographer Boris Golender (\u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440 in Russian), in a video lecture, described this event. This date of demonstration of the fully electronic TV set is the earliest known so far. Despite this fact, most modern historians disputably consider Vladimir Zworykin and Philo Farnsworth as inventors of the first fully electronic TV set. In 1964, the contribution made to the development of early television by Grabovsky was officially acknowledged by the Uzbek government and he was awarded the prestigious degree \"Honorable Inventor of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic\".\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Geography ===\nTashkent is situated in a well-watered plain on the road between Samarkand, Uzbekistan's second city, and Shymkent across the border. Tashkent is just 13 km from two border crossings into Kazakhstan. Closest geographic cities with populations of over 1 million are: Shymkent (Kazakhstan), Dushanbe (Tajikistan), Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan), Kashgar (China), Almaty (Kazakhstan), Kabul (Afghanistan) and Peshawar (Pakistan).\nTashkent sits at the confluence of the Chirchiq River and several of its tributaries and is built on deep alluvial deposits up to 15 metres (49 ft). The city is located in an active tectonic area suffering large numbers of tremors and some earthquakes.\nThe local time in Tashkent is UTC/GMT +5 hours.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTashkent features a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa) bordering a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dsa). As a result, Tashkent experiences cold and often snowy winters not typically associated with most Mediterranean climates and long, hot and dry summers. Winters are cold and often snowy, covering the months of December, January and February. Most precipitation occurs during these months which frequently falls as snow. The city experiences two peaks of precipitation in the early winter and spring. The slightly unusual precipitation pattern is partially due to its 500 m (roughly 1600 feet) altitude. Summers are long in Tashkent, usually lasting from May to September. Tashkent can be extremely hot during the months of July and August. The city also sees very little precipitation during the summer, particularly from June through September.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn 1983, the population of Tashkent amounted to 1,902,000 people living in a municipal area of 256 km2 (99 sq mi). By 1991, (break-up of Soviet Union) the number of permanent residents of the capital had grown to approximately 2,136,600. Tashkent was the fourth most populated city in the former USSR, after Moscow, Leningrad (St. Petersburg), and Kiev. Nowadays, Tashkent remains the fourth most populous city in the CIS and Baltic countries. The population of the city was 2,295,300 people in 2004.As of 2008, the demographic structure of Tashkent was as follows:\n\n63.0% \u2013 Uzbeks\n20.0% \u2013 Russians\n4.5% \u2013 Tatars\n2.2% \u2013 Koryo-saram (Koreans)\n2.1% \u2013 Tajiks\n1.2% \u2013 Uighurs\n7.0% \u2013 other ethnic backgroundsRussian and Uzbek are both the main spoken languages. As with most of Uzbekistan, street signs and other things are often a mix of Latin and Cyrillic scripts.\n\n\n== Districts ==\n\nTashkent is divided into the following districts (Uzbek: Tuman):\n\nAt the time of the Tsarist take over it had four districts (Uzbek daha):\n\nBeshyoghoch\nKukcha\nShaykhontokhur\nSebzorIn 1940 it had the following districts (Russian \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d):\n\nOktyabr\nKirov\nStalin\nFrunze\nLenin\nKuybishevBy 1981 they were reorganized into:\nBektemir\nAkmal-Ikramov (Uchtepa)\nKhamza (Yashnobod)\nLenin (Mirobod)\nKuybishev (Mirzo Ulugbek)\nSergeli\nOktober (Shaykhontokhur)\nSobir Rakhimov (Olmazar)\nChilanzar\nFrunze (Yakkasaray)\nKirov (Yunusabad)\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nDue to the destruction of most of the ancient city during the 1917 revolution and, later, the 1966 earthquake, little remains of Tashkent's traditional architectural heritage. Tashkent is, however, rich in museums and Soviet-era monuments. They include:\n\nKukeldash Madrasah. Dating back to the reign of Abdullah Khan II (1557\u20131598) it is being restored by the provincial Religious Board of Mawarannahr Moslems. There is talk of making it into a museum, but it is currently being used as a madrassah.\nChorsu Bazaar, located near the Kukeldash Madrassa. This huge open air bazaar is the center of the old town of Tashkent. Everything imaginable is for sale. It is one of the major tourist attractions of the city.\nTelyashayakh Mosque (Khast Imam Mosque).  It Contains the Uthman Qur'an, considered to be the oldest extant Qur'an in the world. Dating from 655 and stained with the blood of murdered caliph, Uthman, it was brought by Timur to Samarkand, seized by the Russians as a war trophy and taken to Saint Petersburg. It was returned to Uzbekistan in 1924.\nYunus Khan Mausoleum. It is a group of three 15th-century mausoleums, restored in the 19th century. The biggest is the grave of Yunus Khan, grandfather of Mughal Empire founder Babur.\nPalace of Prince Romanov. During the 19th century Grand Duke Nikolai Konstantinovich, a first cousin of Alexander III of Russia was banished to Tashkent for some shady deals involving the Russian Crown Jewels. His palace still survives in the centre of the city. Once a museum, it has been appropriated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nAlisher Navoi Opera and Ballet Theatre, built by the same architect who designed Lenin's Tomb in Moscow, Aleksey Shchusev, with Japanese prisoner of war labor in World War II. It hosts Russian ballet and opera.\nFine Arts Museum of Uzbekistan. It contains a major collection of art from the pre-Russian period, including Sogdian murals, Buddhist statues and Zoroastrian art, along with a more modern collection of 19th and 20th century applied art, such as suzani embroidered hangings. Of more interest is the large collection of paintings \"borrowed\" from the Hermitage by Grand Duke Romanov to decorate his palace in exile in Tashkent, and never returned. Behind the museum is a small park, containing the neglected graves of the Bolsheviks who died in the Russian Revolution of 1917 and to Osipov's treachery in 1919, along with first Uzbekistani President Yuldosh Akhunbabayev.\nMuseum of Applied Arts. Housed in a traditional house originally commissioned for a wealthy tsarist diplomat, the house itself is the main attraction, rather than its collection of 19th and 20th century applied arts.\nState Museum of History of Uzbekistan the largest museum in the city. It is housed in the ex-Lenin Museum.\nAmir Timur Museum, housed in a building with brilliant blue dome and ornate interior. It houses exhibits of Timur and of President Islam Karimov. The gardens outside contain a statue of Timur on horseback, surrounded by some of the nicest gardens and fountains in the city.\nNavoi Literary Museum, commemorating Uzbekistan's adopted literary hero, Alisher Navoi, with replica manuscripts, Islamic calligraphy and 15th century miniature paintings.\nThe Tashkent Metro is known for extravagant design and architecture in the buildings. Taking photos in the system was banned until 2018.The Russian Orthodox church in Amir Temur Square, built in 1898, was demolished in 2009. The building had not been allowed to be used for religious purposes since the 1920s due to the anti-religious campaign conducted across the former Soviet Union by the Bolshevik (communist) government in Moscow. During the Soviet period the building was used for different non-religious purposes; after independence it was a bank.\nTashkent also has a World War II memorial park and a Defender of Motherland monument.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMost important scientific institutions of Uzbekistan, such as the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan, are located in Tashkent. There are several universities and institutions of higher education:\n\nThe Branch of the Russian State University of Oil and Gas (NRU) named after I.M.

The Planetarium is nowadays controlled by the controlling unit of Tashkent city municipality which focuses on culture and sport.\nThere are two main halls at the Planetarium, and each hall has its own functions. The first hall is mainly built for showing the Solar System and space, using Japanese technologies. The second hall contains artefacts, where visitors can learn more about specific planets and about Earth.\nIn 2008 a group of scientists at Tashkent Planetarium discovered the new planet \"Samarkand\".\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nState Museum of History of Uzbekistan\nThe Museum of Health Care of Uzbekistan\nThe Museum of Communication History in Uzbekistan\nMuseum of Arts of Uzbekistan\nTashkent Museum of Railway Techniques\nMuseum of Geology, Tashkent\nArt Gallery of Uzbekistan\nThe Alisher Navoi State Museum of Literature\nMuseum of Victims of Political Repression in Tashkent\nState Museum of Nature of Uzbekistan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBrochure about the planetarium\nArticle about the planetarium\nArticle about the planetarium in English\nArticle about the planetarium in English",
        "brit": "Planetarium,  theatre devoted to popular education and entertainment in astronomy and related fields, especially space science, and traditionally constructed with a hemispheric domed ceiling that is used as a screen onto which images of stars, planets, and other celestial objects are projected. The term planetarium may also refer to an institution in which such a theatre functions as the principal teaching arrangement or to the specialized projector employed. Planetarium is applied in yet another sense to describe computer software or Internet sites that allow the user to simulate views of the night sky and various celestial phenomena.PlanetariumDome of the Calouste Gulbenkian Planetarium, Lisbon, Portugal.Rodrigo Nuno Bragan\u00e7a da Cunha\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBritannica Quiz\nAstronomy and Space Quiz\nApproximately how many miles are there in a light-year?\n\n\n\nPermanent planetarium installations vary greatly. Those within a large supporting institution may coexist with extensive exhibit space and museum collections and have sizable professional and support staffs. Their projection theatres can be 25 metres (82 feet) or more in diameter and have capacities in excess of 600 persons. On the other hand, community or local college planetariums may accommodate only small groups of people. In a separate class are portable planetariums comprising inflatable domes and lightweight projectors that can be set up at schools and can hold several dozen students at a time.At the heart of every planetarium theatre is the projection instrument. The first modern electromechanical planetarium projector was built by the German optical firm Carl Zeiss in 1923 for the new Deutsches Museum in Munich. Current descendants of these instruments are technically complex, computer-controlled combinations of lamps, lenses, fibre optics, and motor drives designed to place the planets, Sun, and Moon in their correct locations among the stars for thousands of years past and future and to reproduce their motions through the sky, typically as seen from a selected latitude on Earth. The instruments also can add such details as horizon scenes, the Milky Way, nebulae, comets, meteors, and various reference lines and scales used for teaching descriptive astronomy and celestial navigation.Increasingly, institution-based planetariums are complementing or replacing electromechanical projectors with other technologies, including all-digital projector systems equipped with fish-eye lenses and laser projection systems that scan their images on the screen with colour-controlled laser beams. Digital and laser systems allow a seamless blending of sky images, photos, artwork, video, and computer-generated animations. They also can simulate accurate views from any perspective in space and take viewers on virtual flights through and beyond the solar system and into interstellar and intergalactic space. Variations in screen configuration and seating arrangements also are becoming common, ranging from the traditional horizontal domed screen and concentric seating around a central projector to tilted or distorted domes or giant wraparound screens and auditorium-style seating.\r\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription. \r\nSubscribe today\nIn a typical planetarium theatre, programs\u2014commonly called sky shows\u2014are offered to the public on a regular schedule. Show themes may focus on straightforward astronomical and space topics or take up related issues such as the cosmologies of ancient cultures, the extinction of the dinosaurs, or the future of life on Earth. The trend, especially for large audiences and multiple daily shows, is toward total computer automation of the program, combining visual display, cued music and sound effects, and prerecorded narration. Large planetariums with technologically advanced multimedia installations often supplement their science programs with shows featuring pure entertainment based on light, video, and music. In significant ways, in both technology and public program content, the distinction has lessened between planetarium theatres and other giant-screen \u201ctotal immersion\u201d entertainment centres.When the Deutsches Museum\u2019s planetarium, featuring the Zeiss projector, was publicly unveiled in 1923 (two years before the museum\u2019s formal opening), it was described as a \u201cschoolroom under the vault of the heavens.\u201d Special educational sky shows for schoolchildren remain an essential part of the program in most installations; astronomy lectures are given to college classes; and the facilities are commonly used for courses or lectures in adult continuing-education programs.The term planetarium was originally used to describe a type of mechanical model designed to portray the orbital motions of the planets and their moons. Made for teaching and exhibition, such tabletop devices consisted of small globes, representing the Sun and planets, that were mounted on wire rods supported and geared at a central pedestal. Many included the major moons known at the time of construction. Also called orreries (after the English sponsor of one built in 1712), they could be quite elaborate and accurate. ",

          "I simply loved it, most of the stations have something special and unique such as ceramics, beautiful sculptures, and stylish chandeliers. With only one token (around \u20ac 0.15 cents) you\u2019ll be able to visit all of them hopping on and of from the trains. Wow!!!",

          "The stations are all different and offer a wide selection of styles and artistic beauty. It helps if you can read Cyrillic. My wife and I are no longer the youngest and we never stood once in the metro. Every time we went into a carriage, people would jump up to give us a seat.",

          "I am a reviewer who normally gives low ratings to subways. I just don't see them as a sight. However, Metro Tashkent is something different. This one really is something worth experiencing. Dating back to the 1970s, it is a Soviet-era showpiece which really is impressive. Each",
          "Well worth going on a train ride for a few stations just to see each one. They are all very different and decorated with portraits of famous Uzbekisanis or Russians such as astronauts. We were very impressed with the young people; whenever they saw us getting on the train they",

          "The Tashkent metro is well worth a trip, even if you\u2019re not using it to actually commute. At UZS 1,200, it is very affordable. Entry is a bit like taking a trip back in time. The train cars are well maintained, but quite old. Very fun experience!",
          "I was returning from the market and was too tired to figure out were cabs were and the entrance to the metro was right in front of me. It\u2019s super inexpensive to get it. And there are only 3 lines. You have to be as talented as me to get lost in there. I couldn\u2019t find a map",
          "I gather that Moscow is better, but it\u2019s worthwhile going by metro and stopping off at a number of the stations. Many of them are theme decorated and some look a bit like an art gallery.",
          "The Tashkent Metro shows you what a public transport system should be like. It is safe, clean, efficient, cheap and stunning to look at. (All the things lacking from public transport back home in the UK). For about 14p you can travel where you like and get off to admire the",

          "I specifically asked our guide to show us the metro stations as I'd heard of their individual decors. We travelled to see just 3 stops and then returned. Each stop is very individual and named by theme rather than the locations above. Very distinctive!",

          "The trains were clean and ran regularly and cost only Uzbek Sum 1,400 per journey. (You buy a token for each journey). The stations were clean and there was good security. The stations are elaborately decorated and worth a look, if not for the journey.",
          "You must go down and look at the decorations in the metro. Each station is different and has a different theme",
          "I've heard the metro stations in Moscow are even more impressive, but for me these stations are wonderful to took at. All are very different but very well made. I think it's absolutely worth it taking the metro (for 0.12$ and check out some stations)",
          "I was worried about troublesome metro card purchasing, balance refill, and charge by different zoons stuff, as you would probably meet in metros in the US or European countries. But here things are simple. You buy a token for 1400 som, then you are in. And once you are in, you",

          "Completely nothing interesting is in Tashkent subway. Stations are old and not refurbished. Adventage is that you can make a movies and photos whenever you want. There is no any checks of your baggage - Police will not tell you even word if you are making photos. I've visited",
          "First and foremost it is a metro to get you from A to B. A ticket costs 1400 SOM and you can purchase this at the ticket counter as you enter the station. This price covers any distance on the metro as long as you don't leave the station. It is a good way for getting around",

          "If you are in Tashkent and enjoy architecture the metro stations are an absolute gem. On a hot day you could hide down there and explore all of them - some with glorious chandeliers and others with Art Deco ceramic tiling. Every station is cathedral like - certainly not",

          "If you're visiting Tashkent then you have to use the metro. It is relatively convenient for transit around the city, though it's not difficult to end up far away from a station. Mainly though it's worth visiting for the architecture and decor, which is fantastic.",

          "It\u2019s a rare city where you take the metro just to see the beauty of the stations, but that\u2019s the happy situation in Tashkent. When the city designed its new transportation system after the 1966 earthquake, architects competed to offer the most beautiful station designs. They are",
          "Many of the metro stations are absolutely stunning. Until June of 2018 it was illegal to photograph in the stations, so I\u2019m truly happy that we were able to do so. I had no idea that underground subway stations could be so elegant and beautiful. We spent several hours riding all",

          "We stopped at multiple stations to see the variety of themes and artistic expressions that are represented in the metro stops and the halls that connect the different lines. You can see where Soviet themes have been removed in some areas, but the overall character and impression",

          "Not quite on a par with the Moscow metro but worth a visit to view the decoration at different stations. You enter by buying a metro token and away you go. The platforms are spacious and airy, as are the trains/metro carriages - miles better than the London Underground. You can",
          "The Tashkent metro system is often described as a 'must' when visiting Uzbekistan. It is certainly a great means of transportation which is safe, clean and cheap (0,12 euro for a ticket). But as a tourist attrraction, I really don't know what to think. Stations in the Soviet",
          "The first metro system in Central Asia is very attractive. It reminds of Moscow however the stations are not so deep but their designed to serve as a shelter with reinforced walls. The decoration is very pretty. Now you are allowed to take pictures. The system works with tokens",

          "The stations are worth a trip and look and the metro is an easy way around. 1800 UZS is the price for a chip and one can ride as long as one wants. Trains are frequent app.6-10 min and it gets full but not overcrowded in rush hours",
          "One of the \"benefits\" for Tashkent suffering from a 1966 earthquake was infrastructure investment from the Soviet Union. Many of the government buildings remind you of Soviet style structures, and Metro system definitely reflects Moscow's style. It's much smaller and less grand",
          "12p a trip! It\u2019s so easy to use the metro, purchase a blue coin from the desk then walk to the guards who will check your bags, put your coin into the turnstile and walk into the platform. Enter/Exit sign on door is in English but be carful not to get too close to the doors",

          "Great to see the different styles at each station . The trains are efficient and people got up to offer us their seats. Such chivalry. The place puts other metros to shame. Only problem you can\u2019t take any photos",
          "Fantastic stations and plenty of photo opportunities. Yes the guards at I\u2019ll think you are not allowed to take pictures but this May 2018 the government approved and gave the all clear to take pictures. This underground system was build during the USSR period. It is interesting",
          "As in all major cities of the former USSR you'll find an excellent metro \"system\" in Tashkent. And also typical, the stations are more than a just a station: every single one is a fine example of Soviet architecture and decoration. Unfortunately you are not allowed to take",

          "Loved it. So fancy ceilings beautifully decorated. The train experience itself was the same as that of any other.",
          "Can't compare to Moscow, but has its own charm. Each station is unique, very nice. Suggest they change the light bulbs to something a bit warmer--too garish which takes away from the enjoyment.",

          "Some stations have great artworks. Unfortunately you can\u2019t photograph for security reasons. Subway rides are cheap. You get a token and pay in the turnstile on the way in. Not crowded and young people give older people seats. Nice!",
          "No visit of Uzbekistan should go without a sightseeing of the Tashkent metro. Built back during USSR times and still continuing to expand, each station of the metro is decorated in a different theme. Each of them feature the minds and preferences of the people at the time when",
          "In the centre quite good to travel but to new built districts no access still is present. Very clean all year round",
          "The stations I visited were clean and had some wonderful features. I wish I could have taken photos but that's not allowed. The lines and stations are well signed and I managed to make2 changes on my journeys without any assistance. The passengers were very friendly and I felt",

          "THe trains are old hand me downs from Moscow and have amazing rates of acceleration and breaking. The stations however, are each a pice of art. I could spend hours down there. It is definitely a very interesting place and a great thing to experience.",

          "Fine example of soviet era architecture adapted to local environment. It\u2019s such a cheap ride, about $.15 cents US, the cheapest ride I\u2019ve seen anywhere in the world. The bag checks aren\u2019t so bad. If you\u2019re a tourist, the guards are more interested in talking to you to practice",

          "Very nice metro stations from the soviet era. Make sure the security people dont see you making pictures of them as they will ask you to delete them.",
          "The Metro is closely related to the ones in Russia. The train stations are awe-inspiring and have character. The stations and trains are spacious and clean. We took a ride to a few stations to get a feel of the Metro. Definitely, more Europe than Asia-a legacy of the Soviets",

          "This is very similar to the Metros in Moscow & St Petersburg: lots of marble, plenty of space, each station with a different theme. Costs only a few pence for a ticket and is very efficient. Note: photos are strictly forbidden & we decided that it wasn't worth the risk",
          "Redecorated underground, sooty looking walls and overhead lights. Needs a good washing. No trash, no beggars present. Trains are very fast and cheap. You are checked before you enter. No photos once your in.",
          "Soviet union and Moscow metro can easily be felt once you are there. We actually felt like in Russia and enjoyed the stations. Beautiful stops, nice stations, Rocky bumpy rides. An interesting experience for the ones who haven't seen any of such metros,yet.",
          "Does what a metro should. Really cheap!!! Pity that you can't take photos...the stations are beautiful...not quite Moscow but better than London! Most notable is how polite and friendly people are.....no hesitation from young adults to offer up seats to my wife and I on busy",
          "There was a thorough check by a police post at the entrance, inside the train the passengers were very eager to support elder travellers",
          "What a superb and stunning architecture and magnificent chandeliers. And every station is different. Of course, some are more more beautiful and interesting than the others. If you have time in Tashkent, just go and do the metro hopping, admire the beautiful metro platforms on",

          "Old Metro, and a bit rickety for the ride. Anyone found/caught using a camera or mobile phone if caught will have the pictures deleted and the camera/mobile confiscated by the security, as we witnessed with a tourist. OK it's a cheap and cheerful form of transport, and that's",
          "The metro works well and it's relatively easy to get around. It's really the platforms which are the draw card the Russian influence is amazing and they are beautiful. Definitely worth a look",
          "We had a guided tour which included a ride on the Metro for three stations including an interchange. The security is tight esp for locals but seeing us with our certified guide, we were passed through. The ticket is a metal token which is returned into the machine. The security",
          "We rode the metro just for the experience and to see the associated art work. A token (cheap) allows you to travel the whole of the network. It's clean, comfortable, spacious and was uncrowded today (Independence Day Sept 1st). Photos are not allowed. But the cotton mosaics at",
          "An efficient system at low cost. Clean and safe. Each station was in a different style and there was lots of space between the two platforms. Easy to change between the different lines. We were told that the system will soon be extended.",
          "We took a trip on the metro just for the experience. It was great. It is definitely the way to get around in Tashkent. The fact that they had such a great system was surprising. Highly recommend it.",
          "Stepped into check out why its so popular in this site. Looks clean, neat and artistic. But I don't understand how a metro station makes to the top of the charts. Peep in if you like, after all the sight seeing options in this town are limited.",
          "The architecture of the metro stations is soviet era and awesome, each a hallway with striking pillars and decorated walls, the cosmonaut station was by far the most beautiful, the trains were mostly clean and ran reasonably efficiently.",
          "The subway is amazing. Every stop is decorated different and very ornate. My favorite stop was Kosmonavtlar, which has a Soviet space program theme.",
          "Check out which of the stations are worth a visit because not all of them are exceptional. If you are caught with a camera takin pictures they'll make you delete them there and then!",
          "Each station has beautiful art walls. Not complicated to travel. Easy to find stations. So cheap and clean. Safe to travel",
          "There is a lot of security that can be a bit inconvenient but everybody is friendly and at least you feel much saver than in European and US city metro stations. Sadly taking photographs is forbidden and it might be better to not provoke the authorities by ignoring the rules.",
          "The Tashkent Metro was so clean and extremely safe place for people. Every person is checked before going down the metro stations. That made me feel very safe and light.",
          "Even if you don't read Russian or Uzbek it is easy to navigate this small 3 line metro because each station is beautifully decorated in a different theme. Travel the whole system for 1,200 Sum and enjoy every station. The Cosmonauts is very exciting but my favourite was",
          "If you have a map of the metro it's a very convenient and cheap way to travel the city. People are also willing to help if you get lost. Some stations (kosmonavtlar) are really beautiful Sovjet style.",
          "As one Tashkenter broke in and said as we were pondering aloud a ride on the metro, \"you have to ride it; every stop is like a museum!\"",
          "Please remember NO PHOTOGRAPHS allowed in the metro. You will get a token to drop in for entry. We took a round trip and got off near the hotel",
          "Safe and fast way to travel around the city In the winter it is warm and cool in summer Very, very cheap Try it !",
          "Definitely take a ride on the subway!--it is one of the city's major attractions, with the decor changing from station to station and almost always being extremely interesting.",
          "Too bad photography is not allowed, each station is decorated differently. I did not see any signs saying no photo, at least not in English, but was told so on entering on one of the times I entered by the police. Expect an inspection of your bag as you enter from the street,",
          "When you hear \"Uzbekistan\", you probably either think \"where the heck is that?\" or \"that sounds like a third world country where people ride donkeys\". And you couldn't have been more wrong! Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, which is a country in Central Asia (formerly one of",
          "The Tashkent Metro was easy to navigate. It is cheap, fast, and efficient. Possibly because of the heavy security presence, there is no trash or scent of urine as is sometimes the case elsewhere. Perfectly safe, and some of the stations are interestingly decorated with murals.",
          "The metro stations of Tashkent have excellent interior designing and competes those of the Moscow metro. Its a pleasure to take a ride on the metro just to see the stations.",
          "I was astonished at the art work in this metro! The Russian space program tunnel was absolutely amazing. I learned so much about the accomplishments of these early space endeavors while I was awed by the art work that displayed the historical feats.",
          "Only used this once but it is simple to use with a single token for any journey and appears efficient. Was very impressed that young uzbekis quickly offered their seats to any older ones entering the carraige",
          "We thought using the metro was going to be difficult but we found it surprisingly easy. We travelled to Chorsu Market successfully from Tashkent and visited each metro station to see the different styles. Reminded us very much of Metros in Russia.",
          "Each station is beautiful clean.travelling once at least will be good experience.one can compare its efficacy",
          "It is a mix of Soviet times metro and modern recently built system, and trains and stations are clean and some are well decorated such as pakhtakor, in memory of cotton field workers and Alisher Navai station the literary figure.",
          "Not fool of people. Very safe place. Every metro ststion built in its own style. Not so big, very clean.",
          "Why see the Tashkent metro? - every station is beautiful and unique, even if there are many elements of Soviet architecture; - summer in Uzbekistan is extremely hot, so cool air and wind in the station are a real salvation; - it's fast, very safe and secure. Things that could be",
          "Metro was much easier to use then expected and the people are very helpful so we had no problems. I do research before I go and had a copy of the Metro system to hand which helped.",
          "You must take a short trip on the Metro and get off at a number of the stations. The underground was built in the USSR times so the stations are more art or museum stops. The Yuri Gargarin station is fantastic. No pictures allowed in stations.",
          "Tashkent metro is beautiful and cheap, all the stations are different and spectacular. The police controls makes the metro useless to travel with backpacks (they check you every single time also little backs, sometimes two times) forcing you to take taxis or bus. Also you cannot",
          "Was nicely decorated during soviet era, after collapse of USSR, many decorations were simply destroyed and nothing was installed instead. Stations are randomly renamed from time to time. Overall it is good and cheap mean of transportation from one place to another, but slow,",
          "It is prohibited to make fotoes but it worth to see if you are in Tashkent. Definitely use it if you need to move around. It is fresh and cool there. A lot of police and everything is under control. Costs 1200 som",
          "A fantastic blend of Soviet realist arts and architecture with Uzbek influences much in evidence as well. Compares favourably with any of those old Eastern European metro systems...worth a trip even if you don't need to travel. One warning - photography is very particularly",
          "It's got this soviet touch: it's huge, paradoxically looks good and it's unpopulated! At 14PM on Thursday there were virtually no people there, especially given the fact that it's a capital! Architectonically it's definitely worth a visit!",
          "An interesting activity for a rainy day. The stations are richly decorated. You have a security check before entering and no photography is allowed.",
          "Beautiful stations with wide platforms Easy and a pleasure to use. Tickets are tokens. Expect to have your bag searched by a policeman as you pass down the steps to the subway We used it to return to our hotel",

          "We only rode two stops, changed lines and rode two more. The stations are spotlessly clean, fascinating with interesting architecture and each one was designed around a theme. We found the one on the Russian space efforts and its pioneer cosmonauts particularly interesting. That",
          "Clean, fast, frequent. However unless you are a very seasoned traveler you might just need a guide as there are no schematic maps. There are three lines and the stations are very attractive. Security is very tight and bags are inspected before you go down. Please note that while",
          "nothing great as compared to metro in St Petersburg. Good for commuting - not to go out of the way to see.",
          "Today, the Tashkent Metro has 29 stations that differ from each other. The architecture and d\u00e9cor of each station depicts its name. The peculiarity of the Tashkent metro is its rather shallow station positioning. Some stations have escalators, 7 stations belong to the tower",
          "the metro is really helpful and cheap to get somewhere quickly. there are new, modern, comfortable trains now.",

          "Every station is decorated according to its name. Despite this practice is not new at all, the way it is done is just amazing!",
          "Very old subway in Central Asia. Police men seem to be from the former USSR. They do not help anyone and ask for passports even it is not necessary",
          "Metro looks like in Moscow, even with passengers :). Because in Moscow a lot of migrants from Central Asia. Decoration of each station is different and nice, expecially liked station Kosmonaftliar, decorated in space theme.",
          "The Metro is a must do when here. Some of the stations are wonderfully decorated. People are very friendly - every car I got on a young person got up to let me sit. Lots of security - be prepared to have your bag searched getting on, and no photographs are allowed",
          "Rather like the Moscow underground. Trains rush in and out so jump on quickly! Photos are not allowed and the police are strict about this",
          "one of the most beautiful metro stations in central asia, less crowd and the trains are on schedule.",
          "Satisfactory. The train is on time during our visit. However, the police is not friendly with people with hijab.",

          "Tashkent metro is not only transportation mean for traveler. You can learn more about the city and people here...",
          "Fantastic value and easy to find your way round Tashkent. Only downside is with a buggy it a bit difficult. I use this a lot now and the stations are really different but unique and cool to look at",
          "The architecture of the Metro alone is worth a visit. Minimal cost (buy a token at the kiosk). Police on all entrances and no photography.",
          "Easy and cost effective way to get around Tashkent. The subway stations are all different and nicely decorated with interesting lights and ceilings. The trains are clean but noisy while moving through the tunnels. The clock in the station provides time since last train only",
          "quite, clean and very nice subway station. I recommend to all visitors of Tashkent to go out in each station for walking. One big cons - you are not allowed to made photography, even to mobile phone.",

          "Easily get around the city on the metro. Impossible to get lost, as the platforms are clearly marked with the next stops, and where the interchanges are located. Stations are nicely decorated, but the train cars are ancient.",
          "If you have not seen a Soviet built metro system, this one is quite good. Biggest in Central Asia also.",
          "My wife and I like taking the metro sometimes. The decor could definitely do with a facelift, but some of the stations are really beautiful",
          "Very cheap and easy to use. Every station is different. Not quite up to Moscow's metro but pretty impressive all the same. Definitely worh a ride.",
          "Interesting metro with a story to tell for each station. I would recommend travelling as part of a tour so you can understand the various stations and what they mean. An eclectic mix of Soviet and Uzbek styles of architecture and paintings. Also cheap (about a dollar) for a",
          "The interior of the subway is simply stunning. Each station has a theme. Problem is that no pictures are allowed.",
          "Even if you have already seen Moscow underground, don't miss Tashkent's. Each stop is different; it is worth the trip from one stop to the other just for the sake of it. Remember that you cannot take photos since it is considered a sensitive spot, but fill your eyes with it",
          "Although this is not in the same class as Moscow and St Petersburg, this Russian built metro is a pleasure to visit. It is cheap, clean and tidy. The stations are spacious and individually decorated. There are three different lines serving the city with connecting points.",
          "We visited 4 stations during a guided tour. Security is mandatory at all entrances Ffares are very cheap, each station is decorated differently, but like most places in Tashkent the language barrier may be a problem if you don't speak Russian. I had lots of spare time and had",
          "A metro to travel around Tashkent Easy access and lot cheaper to move around Tashkent. Pay only 1300 Som close to 30 us cents for any length of travel inside. Mazakali station and get these views",
          "Like many Soviet era metro systems, Tashkent's was designed to take the workforce to and from the residential suburbs rather than deliver people around the city itself. It is clean and cheap, though. Expect more security than in most cities. Police inspect your bags on the",
          "This metro is similar in style but not nearly as grandiose as the metro system in Moscow. It has chandeliers and interesting murals and is worth a visit.",

          "We were stationed in Tashkent for 2 years and our sons (5 & 3) LOVED riding the metros! Nice and comfy in the cold winter months and cooler in the summer. Beautiful stations-different at each stop! Unlike the metro system in DC, could go all over the metro and even switch lines",
          "Like other Soviet places (eg Moscow), the stations are gorgeous! We had to show our passports going in but they are worth a visit, and we found it easy to get around from our hotel to various attractions. At one point we had to ask a security guard for directions, which i was",

          "The guards at every entrance will check your bags, and inside they'll enjoy feeling important looking through your passport. Some of them are quite nice though, like to have a short dialogue. As for the stations, no photos, but some pretty interesting architecture and old",
          "We experienced two of the lines and got to see the influence of the soviet design and decoration. The metro cars are a bit aged, but not bad for a city in central Asia. The traffic in Tashkent is seemingly light and this is probably the result of getting around by the metro.",
          "Metro Train experience was good...it under ground and Soooo clean, no disturbance for local traffic very good.",
          "Originally bomb shelters during the Cold War, each subway station,s decor differ from each other. One station was decorated with sculptured 8 foot diameter medallions. Another had contemporary chandeliers. The painted metal trains reminded me of train set cars I seen at the",

          "Firstly do not take photographs in the Metro unless you want to be arrested, because if you are seen doing so, you will be. The amazing thing about the Metro is the stations. The trains are fairly old and basic. However to get onto a train you have to get though 2 police",

          "Tashkent Underground is really something you HAVE to see. It's nothing like the lifeless utilitarian stations you would find in DC or NYC. Each station in Tashkent is a work of art. Calculate enough time to get out and walk around and the stations you like most. I am a local,",
          "For those from the west a trip on the Tashkent Metro is a must not because of the cars (they are as run down as most metros in the west.). What to see is the elaborate stations. Many are pieces of art. One celebrates Russian Cosmonauts so it is like a museum. For less than 50",

          "It is worth to have a look at Tashkent Metro stations as well as to have a tour. One can enjoy the variety of the oriental artistic design of every station. Don't look with suspicion at the guards requesting you to show your bags when entering Metro - it is for the safety",
          "Many of the stations are elaborately decorated with tile work and beautiful lighting. They are extremely wide and spacious and spotlessly clean. The station names are thoughtfully printed in Latin which is a huge help to those who cannot read cyrillic. It's cheap - only 700",
          "This metro is very clean! It s so different from the metro in Europe! Metro in Tashkent like a museum! I think it s very safety also! There are always some police inside and outside of it! Also there are some police on the station! When u just enter u have to show ur bag to the",
          "Ok, so the Moscow Metro is really impressive. However, this more limited network shakes a good fist at the Moscow benchmark and the more impressive stations are worth idling to inspect the imaginative artistic touches. Don't leave Tashkent without a metro trip.",
          "Just for fun we took subway and enjoyed several routes and stopped at numerous stations. Stations are beautiful. You have to be in Tashkent Metro if you visit Tashkent.",
          "metro is very easy to access and to travel through it, each station has a unique design which makes it a piece of art especially Alisheher Novoi station.",
          "If you have used the subway in Moscow, St Petersburg or Kiev, you will be disappointed as only a few stations are well decorated. Besides, pictures are completely forbiden! Even in the subway in Pyongyang (North Korea) I could make pictures wihout any problem! But in Tashkent",
          "Few metro stations are really artfully but it's definetely not THE \"Ne plus ultra\" compared to other Metro's in the world. It's useful to move through the city, cheap and good marked with signs for easy orientation. Due to the fact that Tashkent is not that precious \"overground\"",
          "Metro in Tashkent is clean.It's better to travel in Metro in summer as it is very cool,while the temperature outside is +40.It is also safe as there are many security men.",
          "very refreshing place during hot times. fast and easy. very comfortable. Enjoyed a lot. all stations are nice",
          "MRT in any place is used to travel from one place to another one. This is all. This MRT does the same. What is specific there? Quite underdeveloped style of service. I would say a very primitive style that cannot be compared with MRT in Singapore, Beijing, or New York. Any way -",
          "We visited in July and the metro was a nice break from the 100+degree heat. We rode around in kind of a make do loop on our own, before returning again later on a tour. Several stations are glamorously impressive, in a wedding hall type of way, but the cosmonaut station was by",
          "Hello! My name is Dior and I live in Russia but as I was born in Tashkent I go there every summer with my family to visit grandparents, old friends and simply to have a rest from Moscow's cloudy whether. Tashkent metro is not so big so locals don't have troubles traveling there",
          "Definately not what i expected. As part of a guided tour through the city, we took the metro to independence square and was completely surprised at the different architecture/theme of the stations we passed and stepped on and off at. One looked like a palace with ornate stucco",
          "Tashkent metro is one of the most beautiful one I've ever seen. Each and every station is very unique, few of them are exquisite, some are really beautiful, there are stations full of light and warmth and air, others have limited lighting with strictly directed spotlights on",
          "The metro stations in Tashkent are real tourist attractions. We saw the stations themed around Ali Sher Navoi, the poet, and the Cosmonaut station. Unfortunately, taking photographs is not permitted inside the station, but just take the train, stop at stations and admire!",
          "Clean. Quiet. Do not take excessive baggage. No bathrooms. More security in Metro than at the White House.",
          "Nice stations FAst moving escalators and trains You can't take photos there as it was a Bomber shelter Recommended Hold on tight when train starts or you will be grown back",
          "We read about the subway here and we were disappointed in that it was nothing special, like the Russian subways. You can skip this or if you are a subway buff...go.",
          "Tashkent's metro is one of the oldest subways...its very clean and it's comfortable to get many places cheaply. Inside is cool and each station is decorated differently.You don't have to wait for long time cuz its going very often (each 5-10min) and very safe!",
          "I was just in Tashkent for a few days, but it's absolutely worth a few hours of your time to take the metro. The stations are gloriously dated and a bit dark. I thought it fit the city perfectly. Bags and visa were checked.",
          "The stations are beautiful and the trains are really nice. We loved traveling by metro in Tashkent. And it's super cheap (compared to other places we've been)!",
          "Once you get the hang of it travelling on the Metro to various Tashkent destinations is pretty good and very cheap. Be prepared to have your back pack examined by the police/military on duty and remember a smile and a greeting go a long way.",
          "Construction was fine. But there is no any English sign or guide for you. You need to know Russian or Uzbek. Police will ask you for visa before taking a metro!!!!",
          "Soviet era ceramics, glass, lights each station has a different style, and all are worth a visit. Photos are not allowed.",
          "Very cheap and reliable way of transportation but might be slower than taxis and doesn't cover the whole city though it goes to the main touristic sites and city centre.",
          "Definitely worth seeing. The station art is impressive and varied. Cosmonaut station is eerie. I wish the stations weren't so dark and gloomy. They deserve good lighting. Photographs are absolutely forbidden and there are always one or two policemen on the platforms as well",
          "we went for a (brief) tour of the underground system with our guide - it's supposed to be a highlight - but I was disappointed. The metro was old and not that impressive - unlike the Moscow metro, which is all marble and chandeliers and busts everywhere - but it does serve a",
          "The stations on the Metro are really amazing. One of the best and cleanest. And trains are efficient. Good security and they check bags and passports if foreigner",
          "our guide took us by metro from the grand bazaar to independence square covering extra stops just to see the artwork in various stations. It's such a fantastic value at what is equivalent to 40 cents. They made almost every station different.",
          "There are three or four metro lines, interconnected at several places, but on each line the station has a different name. No maps and line schemes are displayed on the walls as usual. Policeman everywhere, they were friendly and helpful so I could catch the right train. When on",
          "Trains are punctual. Metro is very clean and orderly. Some of the stations are beautiful in the Soviet style. Signage could be better and in English. Police will check your documents and bag when you enter.",
          "The Tashkent metro is very fast it cheaper also and connected to almost every area of Tashkent. It is completely underground. Also very safe to travel. One should go for a ride once.",

          "Every passenger is checked by policeman before entrance - this is for security reasons. Very clean stations and some of them a very beautiful: Alisher Navoiy, Kosmonavts, Mustakillik square... You can visit a lot of interesting places using undeground: Chorsu market (Chorsu",

          "There's nothing special about the Tashkent Metro. The system is all very Soviet with guards checking bags before you go downstairs and inside the Metro halls. The stations are not extremely ornate and definitely a huge come down from the Moscow Metro. Trains are frequent and",
          "I live in New York, spent a couple of years in Mexico City, and have visited many cities in the US and Europe that have metro systems. I love taking public transportation whenever I can, so I consider myself knowledgeable about underground trains. The metro of Tashkent is",
          "When you feel safety undergroud, every station has a policman that controlls and check ups large bags, can be accepted as wierd...but it gave a safety filling.",
          "If you've been to Moscow subway you'll see similarities in architecture. Most interior design though comes with Uzbek twist on it: typical patterns & decor. However many stations have changed their names several times after Soviet Union collapsed, and to me it looks like they've",
          "Metro Tashkent is one of the safest, most convenient, the fastest way to commute in the city. There are 3 lanes - Chilanzar, Uzbekistan and Yunusabad. During your trip about metro you can enjoy architecture, design, aura and national spirit of Tashkent. Every station is",
          "We jumped on the Metro for the experience. Being Americans, people looked at us a little weird. Once we began our journey, people were enjoying see us have a good time. We went 4 stops to see where we would end up.",
          "The best subway network you will probably use in the whole of Central Asia. Dated, but safe, fit-for-purpose and simple to access system that connects to parts of Tashkent less visited by tourists. A good place to take in the \"Soviet-era\" retro experience, whether you're here",
          "like stepping back in time as you enter a metro that seems the same as it probably was 20, 30 or even 40 years ago. This is one of only two metro's in central asia and with ornate stations it is worth travelling around to see the various architecture and interior of each station",
          "Some of the platforms are beautiful, museum quality rooms, and it was nice seeing the people go about their daily lives up close and in action. The subway is easy to use and understand. It's also super cheap, like 1,000 som. I recommend taking a ride if only to enjoy the",
          "The main attraction of the metro are the wonderful stations. Each one is decorated in its own unique way. You get all types of art styles, ceramics etc. It is a shame that you are not allowed to take photos of the spaces. They are like caverns, really airy and completely",
          "Each station is decorated in its own quirky way. There are two security checks - your bags are first checked at surface level, and again before you enter the turnstiles. Tourists are not required to carry their passport unless past 9 PM. However some police personnel insist on",
          "Just sorry I couldn't take any photos to share with family and friends. A must see if you are in Tashkent",
          "Metro is veru beautiful. But some stations need a bit renovation. And also sometimes you have to wait for the train up to 10 minutes.",

          "Amazing .Very nice and good and safety confor transport. I would like used this for all times. I think is one of the best metro of the Soviet Union and very useful.",
          "Inexpensive way to travel in the city. I started to use it more often as the taxis in Tashkent are poor drivers and have many accidents. The metro is a good and cheap alternative.",
          "Tashkent Metro has some very attractive stations, produced in a style that is typical of the old soviet style. Unfortunately, like much of this country, no photos are required, and bag searches are carried out at random at every metro station entrance, sometimes two checks,",
          "Metro station are really very beautiful. Architecture design with different beautiful lights. One must visit at least 4-5 metro stations. It's very cheap to travel just by paying 1000 Sumo that is only 10 Indian rupees u can travel anywhere one way. We enjoyed the rides.",
          "Loved using the Metro to get around. Beautiful and intricate artwork on the platforms (much like Moscow Metro in this regard). I especially recommend the Kosomoskaya (or something- the one with cosmonaughts on it!) for awesome platform art. It's a treat to visit anyway. It's",
          "Exactly the same as in Russia, this impressive architecture is very. Interesting,But no photos are allowed and I really have no idea why!",
          "Each station is very different and spotless. Absolutely no photography allowed so don't be tempted. Cheap and very efficient.",
          "1,000 Sum gets you unlimited travel between 0600 and 2400 anywhere on the Tashkent Metro, and it is worth taking the train somewhere to experience this transport system. All very soviet style, fast and efficient, and part of the Tashkent experience.",
          "Take a ride anywhere to admire how metro stations should be like everywhere. Yes, they are simpler than the ones in Moscow but nonetheless beautiful. What a pitty photos are not allowed inside. =/",
          "If in Tashkent, ride on the metro. The stations are beautifully designed,some are based on cotton or wheat. Sadly you cannot take photos, but you can just admire the stations",
          "Best thing about Tashkent metro is : in winters it is hot and int summers it is windy-cold . Every station has its own unique peace of arts. Though, camera is not allowed since it is well protected place in tashkent and for safety reasons. Fr every tourist i would recommend give",
          "Although there are not many days with bad weather in Tashkent Metro can be a place when you can see any time. Nice architecture, from one side typical to all former USSR city subways, from the other hand there are many local cultural authenticity and art.",
          "Grand looking..but rather dim inside, which have it a very hard and cold feeling. The trains were easy to navigate, though frequency could have been much improved as it can be 10minutes between each train",
          "old trains yet the station are pieces of art. every station is built and designed to be different than any other one. it is sad that the photo taking in stations is not allowed",
          "We went on the metro to check out its elaborate architecture as recommended by fellow TAs. it only cost 1,000 Som per trip from any station to any station, end to end. we got off at one station to find that things are too far away, therefore we got back on the train (purchased a",
          "Ok, it isn't Moscow,however the art and design of the stations are really good. It is also efficient and Cheap. Ewas clean and I found the passengers polite. It is definitely worth the visit. EveryEvery carriage I entered was",
          "Moscow it is not but it is decorated along those lines~ and it is quick, clean and ridiculously cheap",
          "Even if the metro isn't taking you where you want to go, take it anyway! Some really good art, clean, and comfortable. Just make sure you don't take pictures (state security?) or curse......heavy police presence - all of whom were friendly but definitely on duty.",
          "It was built when the USSR was alive. some of the stations are peace of art and I think as a tourist you must see it.",
          "We rode all three lines and the blue was by far the best with most of the stations having really interesting art, architecture and lights. The metro is kept meticulously clean and devoid of advertising which makes it particularly charming. Photography is forbidden unfortunately.",
          "The metro is very clean and efficient. It only cost 1000 Som to go anywhwere.The staff were very helpful in guiding you to the correct line.",
          "The Metro system in Tashkent is dead easy to use, quick, efficient, and cheap. The entrances to all of the 3 stations we used had armed guards. To purchase a trip, go to the booth and buy a token for about 30 US cents for any length of journey. Go to the barriers and put token",
          "Every metrostation in Tashkent is a masterpiece. What is a pitty is that you can not take any pictures.",
          "I guess I liked the \"cotton station\" best, but I have not seen them all. Those that I did see, quite impressed me. From videos showing lovely sites of Uzbekistan on the walls, to chandeliers in the shape of cotton balls to passages mimicking spacecrafts, the stations were",
          "We (my wife and I) visited Tashkent in July, 2015. It was our first visit since 2000. The city changed significantly since that time. More parks, greener and wide streets, nice buildings. But, what was remarkable - hospitality of people! They are of wide sympathies and cordial.",
          "The metro is a great place to cool off in July when the temperature is over 35 degrees. Inexpensive and comfortable and clean and safe. Each station has different art theme so you feel as if you are in an art gallery. It is extensive and a great way to get around. It is never",
          "I wish you were allowed to take photos on the metro because it's incredible. If the London Underground was that pretty it'd make commutes to work far nicer! Don't leave Tashkent without a least one tube ride.",
          "Photos were not allowed on the stations, which is a shame as some great architecture and designs at most of the stations. Built during the Soviet times the stations are reminders of the great Moscow metro although perhaps not as ornate. So if your in Tashkent take the time to",
          "A great way to get around Tashkent; no English signs it is still very straightforward. Some of the stations are interestingly decorated, and I was impressed with the way Uzbeks will offer their seats to others. Cheap, too.",
          "If in Tashkent, take the metro. Easy to use and very clean. Each metro station is a visual experience and very interesting. The entire metro system is exceptionally clean and felt very safe. While it won't take you every place you might need to go it will get you around to most",
          "it was easy to use. more travellers should opt for this mode of transport within tashkent. have someone write down the destination, etc in russian/uzbek and show this to the metro personnel or the ever-friendly uzbek locals for guidance.",
          "This is the oldest metro system in Asia and it's beautiful. Every station is different with its own special architecture. In some stations there are chandeliers in the celing. It's easy to use and incredibly cheap. Police guard every entry and exit to the metro so it's also",
          "One of the most beautiful metro system I have seen. Architectural is unique for every station platform. Pity that picture is not allowed in the metro. There is also no handphone signal. The train is old and the platform condition rundown. Security is tight and be prepared",
          "if you want to see the old russian history and architecture and imagination the metro stations and travel in metro is must. it was built almost 30-40 years ago. in those days they made under ground metro and also one station below another. sad they dont allow you to click photos",
          "It is so different to metros you may take in Paris, London, Singapore or likewise. Very nice interior, almost without ads.",
          "It's fine for an experience of an underground system and travelling with locals. The architecture, murals and projected images are the best bits. It's cheap and worth doing as part of the overall experience of the city with different cultural and historical features.",
          "We went into Metro Tashkent for short rides in order to see some of the stations. The stations are quite old and I was disappointed. I expected more.",
          "Short ride only but it was fun. Stations seem old but well maintained and clean. Since we had our own transport we didn't have to use it so much. It is nice and cool on the station but do seem a bit gloomy. Coaches are good and neat but not like in other European countries.",
          "Just 1000soms to enter in to Metro,and you can go any where any line ,any times as long as you are not coming of entry/exit gates.Visited many metro stations in all 3 lines,with same ticket and lot of decorative art pieces on the walls and roofs.",
          "Very cheap; very safe (soldiers gurad before each entrance ; it costs around 0,25 USD ! Jetons can be bought at each entrance in a cashier point",
          "I travelled the metro more as a tourist destination than to travel through Tashkent. I would recommend it as a must see for the beautiful artwork on many of the old stations and the beautiful stations on the new line. Take your time to loiter, however there is policing on all",
          "Only rode the metro a couple of stations to look at the decor. Unfortunately, pictures are forbidden, why-not sure of their reason. You would think they would be proud of their system.",
          "Surprisingly spectacular tube system. Despite what Lonely Planet tell you, the police are not aggressive when you enter, a mere bag check is all you can expect.",
          "Interesting side trip. Well worth the time. It can be a little busy on occasions. Good photo opportunity.",
          "Though you cannot compare the metro in Tashkent with the one in Moscow (which is much larger with many more stations, the architecture of the old stations much more elaborate and the trains much more frequent). Nevertheless the metro in Tashkent is worth a visit - particularly,",
          "Our tour guide Sabina took us for a short ride in this metro and we found it the one of the best Metro in the world ,walls are having beautiful paintings ,neat and clean stations every thing perfect",
          "The only thing I did not like was the fact that photographing was not allowed in Tashkent metro. It was truly magically beautiful with dimmed lights, amazing deco, the ladies in uniforms, old trains coming and going... I loved it. And would have loved to shoot photos in there.",
          "The stations are beutifully decorated, clean, the old wagons ahve some charme ! A nice experience ! Frequency is not the same than Paris or London but if you visit tashkent you don't. Need to rush",
          "We had a metro station just next to our hotel so one day we decided to go for a ride. The trains were pretty old but very clean. The stations were very charming. Not as beautiful as Moscow metro but still worth to see if you have nothing to do on that day.",
          "Every station is a work of art. There is a different theme at every stop and they are all beautifully decorated. It only costs 1000 Sum (about 35 Cent) and is a fun experience. Unfortunately you are not allowed to take pictures.",
          "Its fast, not crowded & easy to get around the city. An added bonus are the beautifully done up stations-murals, artworks beautify some stations & its a pleasure to stroll along the platforms!",
          "Before we arrived in Tashkent my wife and I assembled a list of things to do, but we never considered riding the Metro. Thanks to our ever alert guide, Anton, he suggested that we spend an hour or so riding and visiting a few selected metro stops in the city. We accepted his",
          "An average ride, Its cheap. But not as well polished as New, Delhi, India. Worth a ride and nothing more. Gives an easy connect to across the city. Carry your Passport for sure",
          "If you are a foreigner carry your Passport while travelling in Tashkent Metro.But take care of yourself.",
          "There are only 2 lines on this Metro, so not easy to get lost. Very straight forward. Some stations are prettier than others, but not that pretty. In the past there was a lot of difficulties with bag checking, passport checking and police looking for bribes, I rode the",
          "While entering metro we were asked to show what's inside our bags. Another passenger was entering and she was asked to present her passport (which she couldn't) so she was refused entry. Very much like Moscow metro, only worse and much less spectacular.",
          "Remarkably beautiful stations, though not overly extensive. The station I visited had lovely lighting, and very clean...and fast transits, too.",
          "All of the stations have original desighn and are very clean. Metro doesn't cover all of the city and there is no metro station at the airport.",
          "It is..complete with lots of police who seem to do little..and be careful of asking directions. A must if you want to see a bit of the Soviet past...plus it's a good transport system and has some wonderful stations..get lost and enjoy",
          "It is old line with ornate lights & few sculptures.It is nice .I had seen only old line.Went in winter so it was very cold. There was not much of crowd ,as population of whole Uzbekistan is only 20 million.",
          "The metro is efficient, cheap and has beautiful stations. Unfortunately you are not allowed to take photos. Take your pasport and registration strips with you, because the police checks regularly. We were controlled once and after the policemen had checked our passport, he",
          "not many signs and everything is in uzbek or russian, so you must get a map before going there. No map in the stations I've been to. No general map and no map of the surrounding area.",
          "It's definitely worth seeing this beautiful place. Try to visit every single station, especially - Amir Temur, Alisher Navoiy, Kosmonavtlar. beautiful and incredible.",
          "Riding on the metro and visiting the different stations is certainly an experience you should not miss when you are in Tashkent. First, it's clean and safe. Second, if you do not get out of the station, you could spend at least a worthwhile 2 hours exploring the 3 lines and",
          "Tashkent metro is really a wonderful part of the city. Clean, piece, fast, cheap and the amazing stations designed in national and modern style. one gets on Tashkent metro not only to get somewhere but to enjoy its attractive stations. I like it.",
          "The Tashkent metro is fast, clean, cheap and safe. The stations are wonderful exercises in Soviet kitsch. At all costs go to Kosmonautli station - the mosaics are first class. Warning - do not be seen taking photographs in the stations.",
          "its very convenient to use the tickets are very cheap like 40 us cents. staions are grand and clean , and its better than the subway in nyc hands down !!!",
          "Interesting metro which is considered a defence installation, hence no photos. Although used on daily basis by commuters, it is an emergency link in case of catastrophe. All stations are beautifully decorated from a kind of Art Deco to grand Soviet style. You need to go through",
          "great way to travel, efficient, and very cheap, get a metro map or take a picture, or remember which stop is yours and you will be fine. you buy the plastic token at the metro. But please note they close about 10-11pm.",
          "Very surprised at the metro efficient and cheap and easy to get around on. The stations a very spacious and beautifully decorated, Well worth a visit.",
          "As I have not yet travelled on any Soviet style metro, this was an unexpected pleasure for me. Of course I have heard about the beautifully decorated stations in Moscow, but to find sparkling clean independently decorated stations here in Tashkent with chandeliers, etc was",
          "Each station has a different character, particularly liked the one with more than a nod to Art Deco. Try to see at least 4 to see how different each one is.",
          "Tashkent has a very good metro system. It is very similar to Moscow. It is also very beautiful. 1000 soms per person. You can buy the ticket at any station.",
          "Afrosiyob is one of the fastest train in Uzbekistan, the maximum speed I have noticed was 230km/hr, its quite comfortable and you can literally feel that you are travelling in one of the Euro rails.",
          "Better than the Tube but not as good as Moscow. Clean some stations were very unusual. Ticketing seemed odd and inefficient but very cheap",
          "Built in 1966 following the earthquake. Quite impressive and very much in the Soviet style, inspired by the Moscow model. The ceilings are high and the platforms wide. There are 29 stations on three principle lines. Each station is unique and the decor reflects some aspect of",
          "Take a ride you won't be disappointed. The metro stations are fantastic and like visiting a live museum. Each station is different so hop off and then get back on changing lines. We found the local young adults very polite always offering us a seat. Don't take photos as the",
          "Tashkent subway is so weird, that you would love to see it. Each station is uniquely designed and decorated, it brings you back to Soviet era again.",
          "Took the Bullet train to Samarkand. They start the fountains only during the train arrival and departure times. The station is efficient and plenty of railway staff to help around.",
          "The Metro in Tashkent is decent but not very frequent. Also, it does not work after 11pm, so if you need to get back after this, it's better to get a cab",
          "You have to pay 1000 soms to get in.Similar to the Moscow metros.Well designed metro.One of the clean metros in the world.",
          "The metro is a welcome necessity in the sprawled capital of Uzbekistan. As a bonus you can view the famous Soviet underground architecture - similar to Moscow, Minsk, St Petersburg, etc. Unfortunately photography is forbidden. I recommend taking a compass if you are unsure",

          "metro is ok, but just to see this 'sight' is not particularly of interest; ok, you've seen it, but then???",
          "Its been compared to the Moscow Metro, but on a much smaller basis. Trains run very efficiently and it has a safer feel to it than London underground.",

          "It was a wonderful place. when I went down stairs I did not expect anything like that. It was cheap and easy to use. But the enterance of subway station, the police checked my bag. I was annoyed. That is their rule. Also taking photo is prohibition. I really do not understand.",
          "The cleanest, least bust metro system you are ever likely to see. But if you want to record this with a photograph, you are wasting your time as all photography is banned as we found out. One of the omnipresent police force was there within seconds of me taking a picture. Before",
          "Worth a visit for the convenience, the vast platforms, the idling personnel and the Soviet mixed with local architecture.",
          "Like the Moscow subway with lovely art and polished glass columns. Not a single bit of graffiti anywhere. Police on duty at every platform. A young boy of about 5 stood up as soon as I got on and motioned for me to take his place. Love the Uzbeks",
          "most of the metro stations are worth a visit, just to view the architecture - beautiful wall decorations and light fixtures.",
          "The Tashkent Metro is like most Soviet projects a well run system that brings you around the city with ease. The various stations are decorated with impressive artwork, no less impressive than the Moscow Metro. Photographing inside is forbidden, and as always in Uzbekistan,",
          "Metro is easy, cheap and time saving. Taxies charge too much. For new commers its takes almost 5 to 10 minutes to understand all the routes of metro. We prefered to travel on metro. People also are very helpfull. some times police unnessarily teases the foreigners by asking",
          "The weather even between 6/15th Sept was very hot with day temps at 35 degrees Celsius. Sight seeing became a bit tiring as we had already been to Khiva, Bukhara and Samarkand so we got tired of seeing more mosques and madrassas",

          "Tashkent's subway is new and they are obviously very proud of it. It is a quick and clean method of getting around the city to the attractions. They are all fitted out in different styles, some of which would be worth a photo. However, taking photos is not allowed and it is",
          "I took the metro a few times during hot summer days. It is a change from hot busses and taxis. The metro in derp underground, and the stations are really nice pieces of architecture. It is worth a trip on a visit to Tashkent.",
          "this is the only Metro of Central Asia. The first line started functioning in !977. To date the Taschkentites are proud to have around 30 stations. Each station is uniquely decorated and is a piece of art on it's own. Glass, stone, marble, granite and chrome have been used to",
          "Very cheap way of transportation. Clean stations. Pitty you are not allowed to make photos. Every station is different so it would be nice if that was possible",
          "Trains are very frequent (never waited more than 7 minutes) and each stop is decorated a bit differently. Do NOT try to take photos. Signage is not in English, but decipherable with minimal effort.",
          "tashkand metro is a reliable, comfortable and cheap way of travel in the capital. it is on time , not crowded, and covering most parts of the city. the ticket is uniform(800 soums) for everywhere in the city and much cheaper as compared to taxy. the stations are open , the decor",
          "Tashkent Metro is cheap, efficient and easy to use. Although it's not a huge system, it serves pretty much everywhere you'd want to go as a tourist in the city. All journeys cost 800 soum, which I think is less than 20cents. Just go to the kasse and buy tokens. Expect to have",
          "While this is not amazing public transportation by any means, you must ride the Tashkent metro at least once! For transportation, it does cover a fairly extensive distance and is prompt, clean, inexpensive and easy to navigate. The really interesting parts, though, are the",
          "Our tourist guide proposed to pay a visit to the old metro and she was right. Some central stationed that we saw were like museums of local art. Unfortunately it is forbiden to take fotos (?) so I can not share my experience, only suggest an underground trip!",
          "I spent 1 day in the metro stopping at every stop to view the halls. They are all different from one another. My favourite is ASTRONAUT stop. Unfortunately it is not possible to take pictures. Metro is extremely safe, plenty of police all of the time also at the exit (4",

          "We shopped for all manner of nuts at the bazaars of Samarkand and Bukhara, but wished we'd done it all at Chorsu in Tashkent, where the prices we were able to haggle were the best, and the quality was just as good or better than at any of the others.",

          "Very disappointing if you're looking for the typical souk/bazaar type environment. Downstairs are a couple of touristy shops..a large biscuit/sweets/random things shop. Around the outside.... gold shops and 'made in china' rubbish. The only interesting part is the market",
          "Actually went there twice. Interesting place and gives a real feel for life in Uzbekistan. There is a large covered open air restaurant where you can order food. It is a nice place to relax with good food and rub elbows with the locals. English speaking Uzbek's more than",

          "Okay so if it's your first market in Uzebkistan you will enjoy it but if you did it in Samarkand avoid this. It's the same. Spices, toys, carpets, handicrafts, bread, meat. It's amazing for the first timer and for people used to controlled markets abroad. Here there are smells",

          "This market is only a typical muslim bazaar market containing shops and stalls selling local fruits, food, spice, and other Chinese made products. Compared with bazaar in other countries like Morocco, Turkey, and Iran, this market is much less interesting to walk around and see",
          "The market area is quite big, so if you think you haven't found what you are looking for, most probably you have missed some pavilion. This is the place where to buy everything, but as a foreigner I put the most emphasis on nuts, dried fruits, fresh fruits and spices. You will",

          "I have seen lots of bazaars and I think this one is over estimated by tourists. Ok they have lots of fresh vegy, nuts, dried fruits and meat sections. ( where you can buy horse meat btw) I think nothing special. Anyway here are the pictures",
          "It was just ok. There are many vendors selling all the same stuff. The people are not pushy and the items are nice but it not something that impressed This should be seen but do not think it will rock your world. Oh and go when it is warm.",

        "wiki": "The Registan was the heart of the ancient city of Samarkand of the Timurid Empire, now in Uzbekistan. The name R\u0113gistan (\u0631\u06cc\u06af\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646) means \"sandy place\" or \"desert\" in Persian.\nThe Registan was a public square, where people gathered to hear royal proclamations, heralded by blasts on enormous copper pipes called dzharchis - and a place of public executions. It is framed by three madrasahs (Islamic schools) of distinctive Islamic architecture. The square was regarded as the hub of the Timurid Renaissance.\n\n\n== Madrasahs ==\nThe three madrasahs of the Registan are: the Ulugh Beg Madrasah (1417\u20131420), the Tilya-Kori Madrasah (1646\u20131660) and the Sher-Dor Madrasah (1619\u20131636). Madrasah is an Arabic term meaning school.\n\n\n=== Ulugh Beg Madrasah (1417\u20131420) ===\nThe Ulugh Beg Madrasah, built by Ulugh Beg during the Timurid Empire era of Timur\u2014Tamerlane, has an imposing iwan with a lancet-arch pishtaq or portal facing the square. The corners are flanked by high minarets. The mosaic panel over the iwan's entrance arch is decorated by geometrical stylized ornaments. The square courtyard includes a mosque and lecture rooms, and is fringed by the dormitory cells in which students lived. There are deep galleries along the axes. Originally the Ulugh Beg Madrasah was a two-storied building with four domed darskhonas (lecture rooms) at the corners.\nThe Ulugh Beg Madrasah (Persian: \u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u063a \u0628\u06cc\u06af\u200e) was one of the best clergy universities of the Muslim Orient in the 15th Century CE. Abdul-Rahman Jami, the great Persian poet, scholar, mystic, scientist and philosopher studied at the madrasah. Ulugh Beg himself gave lectures there. During Ulugh Beg's government the madrasah was a centre of learning\n\n\n=== Sher-Dor Madrasah (1619\u20131636) ===\nIn the 17th century the ruler of Samarkand, Yalangtush Bakhodur, ordered the construction of the Sher-Dor (Persian: \u0634\u06cc\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631\u200e) and Tillya-Kori (Persian: \u0637\u0644\u0627\u06a9\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u200e) madrasahs. \nThe tiger mosaics with a rising sun on their back, on the face of each madrassa arch are interesting, in that they flout the ban in Islam of the depiction of living beings on religious buildings, especially as they represent the more ancient Persian Mithraic religious motifs. There is a bit of Zoroastrianism influence in the architecture.\n\n\n=== Tilya-Kori Madrasah (1646\u20131660) ===\nTen years later the Tilya-Kori (Persian: \u0637\u0644\u0627\u06a9\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u200e, meaning \"Gilded\") Madrasah was built. It was not only a residential college for students, but also played the role of grand masjid (mosque). It has a two-storied main facade and a vast courtyard fringed by dormitory cells, with four galleries along the axes. The mosque building (see picture) is situated in the western section of the courtyard. The main hall of the mosque is abundantly gilded.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Other buildings ==\n\n\n=== Mausoleum of Shaybanids ===\nTo the east of the Tilya-Kori Madrasah, the mausoleum of Shaybanids (16th century) is located (see picture). The real founder of Shaybanid power was Muhammad Shaybani - grandson of Abu'l-Khayr Khan. In 1500, with the backing of the Chaghataite Khanate, then based in Tashkent, Muhammad Shaybani conquered Samarkand and Bukhara from their last Timurid rulers. The founder of the dynasty then turned on his benefactors and in 1503 took Tashkent. He captured Khiva in 1506 and in 1507 he swooped down on Merv (Turkmenistan), eastern Persia, and western Afghanistan. The Shaybanids stopped the advance of the Safavids, who in 1502 had defeated the Akkoyunlu (Azerbaijan). Muhammad Shaybani was a leader of nomadic Uzbeks. During the ensuing years they substantially settled down in oases of Central Asia. The Uzbek invasion of the 15th Century CE was the last component of today's Uzbek nation ethnogeny.\n\n\n=== Chorsu trading dome ===\nThe ancient trading dome Chorsu is situated right behind the Sher-Dor.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nBibi-Khanym Mosque\nGur-e Amir\nShah-i-Zinda\nTimurid dynasty\nTourism in Uzbekistan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Registan at Wikimedia Commons",

          "The Registan is the central square of Samarkand. It is flanked on three sides by magnificent buildings. This is the highlight of a visit to Samarkand. At night the square is lit up.",
          "Registon is worth visiting , very beautiful square of 15 century architecture, costing of three madrsa Ulujbek , Sher dor and Tilly koari. The interior of tilly koai is the mesmerizing , fine guild work, very neat and clean. They have light and sound show at night during tourist",
          "It truly is the highlight of the attractions of Samarkand. The tilework is exquisite. The only thing that ruins a bit the whole atmosphere is the numerous stalls inside the madrassahs. Entrance fee is UZS40000.",
          "Many buildings beautiful to visit, friendly dealers, good choices and one of the invest places in Usbekistan.",
          "If you find yourself in Uzbekistan for whatever reason, you just have to make time to visit Samarkand. There is so much to see in this historical city, making your imagination work overtime to appreciate what it was like over the last few thousand years. Registan is the main",
          "It\u2019s a must do in Samarkand but the entire building complex was destroyed years ago and they only done restorations in the last 100 years I guess so it is a bit new. Also inside is full of shops for tourists which destroys it a bit I think. And within the building it isn\u2019t as",
          "Many things seem newly built or kind of imitation. Wherever you go in Uzbekhistan the buildings are similar. And it seems like they have built or restored most of them recently. It is also a fact that the city is old and has a lot to offer. It is also a fact that many things are",
          "The biggest must see in the city, you cant miss it when you walk by. It must've been rather intimidating back in the day. Enjoy the grandiose structures all around.",
          "Registan is one of a beautiful sights of the Samarkand, and if you're visiting the town, you should visit it. But it is enough to walk there without buying a ticket to get inside. If don't you'll find a market of souviniers for the entrance price of 40 000 S. No architecture,",
          "When Alexander the Great entered Samarkand in 329BCE he said 'Everything I have heard about Marakanda is true, except it's more beautiful than I imagined'. He was correct. Built on an massive scale the beauty of the square is overwhelming. The intricacy of the tiling and",
          "I would definitely stop by here and have a look and take some pictures if you\u2019re in Samarkand. Nice site to see",
          "Although a wet morning in Samarkand, once it cleared the view was breathtaking. Even more fantastic was when we visited in the evening to view it lit up.",
          "A hot favourite by the brides and grooms. Tourists flocked to its immense structure but the ticket prices are less than desirable as the foreigners pay perhaps 5 times higher.",
          "Yes, Registan Square is pretty much the symbol of the city of Samarkand. However, most of the tile work is new/restored. The madrassas are full of stalls selling souvenirs, and there are many tour groups.",
          "The set of madrasa's have a very unique and detailed architecture. There are also small shops inside the complex which sell good local items at a reasonable price. The place opens at 8 AM but if you want to take good pictures without people then you have to go there around 7.",
          "Registan is absolutely an amazing site to see with both 15th and 17th century buildings. Like most mosques and madrasa in Samarkand, the facilities can be repetitive, Prayer and learning rooms. The architecture is stunning, but keep in mind most of the artistry is restored,",
          "An iconic monument of Uzbekistan. These old Madrassas (religious schools) were built in the 15th and 17th centuries to house students who were taught not only religious studies but also scientific ones such as astronomy, physics and mathematics. Fantastic place for all whether",
          "Stunning especially at night We were initially told by a guard/tourist police to pay him the 30,000 SOM which he ws clearly going to pocket. When we refused to buy it from him he told us to go to the ticket office (on the left hand side). I asked there if the guard can sell",
          "This is what the tourist come for. Simply amazing both at night and during the day. Islamic architecture, history, shops what more can one want. This is a must do.",
          "This is of course the main reason to visit Samarkand - and let me say it's well worth it. We went back a second day without our guide just to soak in the buildings and tilework, and be awed all over again. There's a good reason this is one of the world's most famous sights - and",
          "Registan is the reason why you come to Samarkand: this is one of the most beautiful things we have seen! Funny detail: locals pay only 1/10 of the entrance fee foreigners have to pay, but it is still very cheap to West-European standards. We went in the morning and in the",
          "This was an excellent place to see. The buildings are amazing and the people are nice. We had a great time looking around",
          "It is beautiful! We went in the morning, in the afternoon and at night during all our days in Samarkand. It looks beautiful, no matter how many times we look at it. Spent hours looking at it. We were lucky to have witnessed the laser show as well!",
          "Its wonderful by day, with the three Medrassas each having thier own unique experiences. The Minaret in the Ulugbek medrassa can be climbed, the is a very cool photo opp in the Sher Dor and a grea photo exhibit in the Tilya Kori. Also wondeful at night to catch the slightly",
          "This is the best attraction in Uzbekistan!!!!. One should visit it both during the day and at night when they have a beautiful video show.",
          "This is perhaps the heart of Samarkand and is impossible to miss. You will really like the architecture and the scale of the structures.",
          "I'm sure everyone who visits Samarkand goes to the Registan square. The place is breathtaking in its size, scale and symetry",
          "beautiful , out of the picture postcard scene, eye catching vast Hge structures with excellent detailed scriptures , paintings , unbeleivable unless seen , cleanliness is precisely to be pointed ..even though many shops and people and small restaurants in the area.",
          "This is a truly great site. If place it somewhere in between Taj Mahal and Petra. Obviously a must see.",
          "Without a doubt one of the most impressive places (if not the place) in Uzbekistan. The colorful and that adorn the madrasas and minarets as well as the size of the complex create a spectacular site. The place is lit at night and impressive then, no less. We were fortunate",
          "Registan is one of the most amazing monument in the city. It has an amazing story. It would be better if they remove all shops inside the monument and locate them somewhere arround it. And instead these shops placing some other things related with its history might be more",
          "You have to spend lots of time here just wandering around and taking in all the fabulous sites and market places that are close by.",
          "Should be seen from outside both in the morning and at night. Lights beautifully at around 8pm with simple nice light show that goes on a couple of minutes. Many shops inside, but generally Bukhara is better for shopping (don't forget to haggle real real hard though) Ask the",
          "The buildings here are all replicas of the originals. There are some pictures showing what they looked like before reconstruction. Even so, they are impressive examples of 14th Century art and architecture. The interiors are now occupied by shops and craftsmen. The quality of",
          "Visit to Registan is must I guess if you are visiting Uzbekistan. It offered a sight seeing, photo of as well as shopping opportunity. It used to be a big madarsa. Now tourist visit it and in the open spaces you will find a lot of shops selling pottery, shawls, scarfs, wooden",
          "Make sure that you visit the place as many times as possible during your stay in Samarkand. The light and atmosphere can be quite different. Worth exploring the surroundings too. Such a marvel !",
          "Not much to add to previous reviews. However, I would highly advise that you visit in the early evening around 19.30 when the complex is lit up and there are very few - if any - visitors and then again early morning I.e. 07.30 when it is still empty and the sellers have not yet",
          "Entry ticket costing 30.000 som. You can use it multiple times that day. So at night you can walk also on the square. It's nice to walk around and sir down and look the people coming by.",
          "From the very first view, you\u2019ll be amazed and overwhelmed by the colour and splendour of the three medrassahs which partially surround this square. A trip up to the top of one of the minarets is recommended (although the views are limited). Strongly suggest a visit at night as",
          "It's what we all come to see....and it was a spectacular sight. By now, we were used to all the market stalls - although some of the better ones were here, which represented real crafts as opposed to mass-produced and imported stuff! I have to say that I was a bit disappointed",
          "This place certainly lives up to the hype. Uncrowded when we went. Amazing architecture. Cost is about $4. Bargain! You have to pay again if you want to go in after 7 for the light shows.",
          "Can't stop admiring the beauty and the ambience of this place! This is a \"must visit place\" for those who travel in Central Asia and the Great Silk Way.",
          "This site is nothing short of tremendous. I visited at night and came back during the day to see it at a different time. It is simply stupendous and one of those places in the world that everyone should try to visit.",
          "This is the place that you absolutely must see in this town. The 3 buildings are nicely preserved and with a beautiful history each one of them.",
          "The square is one of Samarkand's major attractions. 3 madrasahs of different styles and periods border the square",
          "I would definitely recommend got to Registan at night with the lights lighting up the complex.. It is amazing site to see.",
          "Best place in Uzbekistan I been in kiva and Bukhara all was nice but registan was the best of my street.",
          "We had an AmaZing guide in this area. Everything was beautiful and the guide was fantastic we had organised through snow leopard tours.",
          "I know there are three buildings but for me they are one so I am reviewing them as a whole. Simply stunning ! Both inside and out ! It's a little bit like the first time you see the Taj Mahal. For me this is the best building in the whole of Uzbekistan.",
          "Samarkand's central square will make even the most architecture-weary visitor stand up and take note. Pausing for a minute and a picture on the raised viewing platform, the square unfolds below you. An almost infinite number of contrasting patterns swirl and dance on every",
          "If you are visiting Samarqand, Registan Madrasa is a must to visit. You will enjoy visiting this historical place and you can buy gifts as well.",
          "A fantastic place to go to and definitely worthy of the UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITE it has been bestowed upon. Amazing colours from the 14th or so century showing how advanced it's civilization was before many nations. Unfortunately, it's been ruined by the poor attempt on",
          "Well, you need time to explore that when there is no people. That is hard but ... you can manage. Look, think and ... you travel in time. Imagination.",
          "Registan means 'Desert'. But in Samarkand, Registan is a place of historical buildings, surrounded by big parks which are so green that you wonder why do they call it a Registan at all. These old buildings are, in fact, ancient reputed Madrasahs (Universities or Institutes).",
          "These ancient religious schools have been well preserved. Considering one was built six hundred years ago and the other two four hundred years back, they remind us about the great builders and architects. Visiting this place at different times during the day is well rewarding,",
          "If there is just one place you can squeeze into your Uzbekistan visit, let it be this! Soo gorgeous, its breathtaking! This place requires quite some walking so wear comfortable shoes, get along water, caps/scarves/sunscreen. A guide is a must!",
          "When you enter the place, you will feel like you are going into something very grand. Architecture of this is something indescribable. Very recommended to visit.",
          "There are so many beautiful buildings and religious buildings in Samarkand that is difficult to choose the best, but for me, this is so beautiful I just crossed the line. Built within 200 years it is so coordinated it looks that they were built at the same time",
          "Beautiful square with three different madrasahs. Each Madrasah is different and should be seen inside and out.",
          "Go at 6 am and no one will be there. At night lit up and families out for strolls. Entry fee was about 30,000 Som or under USD 4. Walk a kilometre farther out of pedestrian zone for Amur Timur mausoleum, also impressive.",
          "Registan -one of the beutefful and gorgeous architectural assemble in the world from 15th-16th centuries of Uzbekistan ancestry.",
          "Standing in Registan Square turning slowly to take it all in: 3 madrasahs: Uluugh Beg, Sher Dor, and center Tilya Kori...stunning. I highly recommend paying the small fee to climb the minaret of the Uluugh Beg madrasah - it is difficult - winding steps with a rope handrail - the",
          "Maybe they exaggerated a bit with reconstruction - it looks very new, sometimes the tiles in mosaics are replaced by oil painting... Lots of shops, mostly selling same things at the same prices - so I would recommend - do not shop too much, rather relax and enjoy the place.",
          "Visited Registan in Sept. 2017 as a highlight of my 14 days tour of Uzbekistan and it did not disappoint. The splendid colourful mosaic, religious abstract and geometric Islamic patterns that decorate the 3 Madrasahs: Uleg Beg, the magnificent Tilla Kari and Asher-Dar. The",
          "Everything has been written about Registan already. This is a wonderful place & should you visit only one place in uzbekistan this one is worth the trip!.",
          "Words cannot explain beauty of this place. I knew how it will look alike, I google it, read about it etc but nothing prepared me to the glory of this place. I stayed in Tashkent and drove by speedtrain to Samarkand on a day trip. One day was enough to see what I was playing to",
          "absolutely fantastic site with phenomenal buldings. Local handicradts also available in niches. a must see of Samarkand",
          "OK... here's something. Climb the minaret! Yes, you can do that. No, you don't have to bribe the police guard before opening. One of the two minarets has a staffer at the entrance and he charges 20,000 Sum. Yes, it's worth it. Don't stick yourself out too far, because if you",
          "The Registan is a must see, it is goose bump beautiful, during the day and also at night. Everything is very well organized and super clean. The only things I appreciated less was the amount of commercial venders of all kinds of souvenirs. They are just too many of them and ruin",
          "The Registan is a must see sight in Samaqand and is very impressive and also very crowded! Try to visit early in the morning before the crowds arrive. The architecture is absolutely stunning and this has to be the most awe inspiring sight in Uzbekistan.",
          "It was the heart of the city in ancient time of Samarkand. Locals and foreigners had to pay different entry fees that the former and latter was 2k and 30k SOM respectively. In the writer's point of view, such a big gap was obviously not fair for tourists.",
          "Landmark of Samarqand, visit because you have to! Ensemble of 3 madrasa and 2 mosques. A place of gathering for the whole town. If you get lucky you can see a 3D light show, if you are a group request to see it from your tour operator. If you end up going there, don't bother",
          "The Registan Square is simply breathtakingly beautiful. It is the architectural highlight of a country blessed with so many stunning, historical buildings.",
          "To go to Samarkand and not visit Registan Square is like going to Paris and not seeing the Eiffel Tower. While the squares and mosques are beautiful, the mosques, instead of being filled with religious zealots, are filled with shops of all shapes and sizes. See the Square at",
          "You can spend hours to watch this amazing complex of buildings and it's worth to take a guide. We went their once at night and realized that lightnings are switched off not according schedule. In our case everything was dark already after 8 pm even people told us that one day",
          "Without a doubt, the Registan is the centerpiece attraction of Samarkand, and the heart of the ancient city. Such a marvelous edifice built by mankind that also served as a place for public executions. There are a multitude of small shops inside the madrasah selling scarves and",
          "The Registan, and specifically its 3 superb tiled madrasahs, is probably the most important and beautiful historical site of Uzbekistan, although personally I love Samarkand's Shah-I Zinda's tile work and intimacy even more. The Registan is best visited in the morning for the",
          "One of the most beautiful and impressive things we have ever seen. It\u2019s stunning, amazing, a place where you can finally think that the human creativity can still surprise you",
          "One of the most beautiful square in the world. It has been renovated but it still keeps the power of the Uzbek culture. I suggest to visit it during the blue hour, before dusk, in order to watch it during the transition of lights (from natural to artificial). You will appreciate",
          "Registan is really a gem in the crown of Samarkand. This UNESCO World Heritage site is the most popular one . You cannot leave Uzbekistan without its glimpse. I was spellbound by Registan's mesmerising beauty and architecture. I will recommend that visitors should see the",
          "After seeing the pictures of Samarkand i have always wanted to visit it, as it looked exactly as i imagined towns on the Silk road would look like. Seeing it live only confirmed the feeling. It is magnificent and one can only stand in awe of the expertise of architects of the",

          "More of the ancient splendour... the main purpose of visiting Samarkand surely must be Registan and the surrounding Madrasas. Beautiful.",
          "Registan in Samarkand lives up to its hype; it's an iconic place, particularly nice towards the end of the day when the coach tours have reduced. There's lots to see behind the portals in the rear squares.",
          "You should see this personally, the place where middle age history still lives. Truly impressive, a must to see",
          "Registan in Samarqand is three madrasah\u2019s on a square. I thought it would be more, or better, I figure back when it was first constructed and used for the original purposes it may have been quite majestic and awe-inspiring. Nowadays it is still worth a look but some overdone",
          "Registan Square is one of the most amazing places in the world - you must visit it with amazing tiles on the three building on the site.",
          "Registan was just amazing! Free on Fridays, fabulous little corners, stunning mosaic , turquoise tiling, stunning. I couldn't get enough of it! Shame there is a charge to get in, as the place is full of shops, it feels like being charged to go shopping!., having said that",
          "Beautiful complex full of intricate details. Admission was 30,000 som for foreigners. However, once you enter the complex, the former chambers and rooms are now all filled with souvenir shops which was extremely disappointing. Although not pushy, the amount of vendors and stalls",
          "Just as good as the photos, but much busier. You need to pay to get onto the square and into the buildings, but well worth it.",
          "Photographs do not do Registan justice. The three buildings are spectacular and imposing. Ensure you enter all three, as each had stunning interiors. There are some great souvenir shops inside as well. The WC on-site was spotlessly clean.",
          "This is an incretable place and one of the post beautiful squares in Asia. Don't miss to see at night when its lights up",

          "The Registan Square complex is awesome - 3 beautiful Madrassahs. Exquisite architecture. Rich history. Restored and preserved well. Interesting visit and loads of shopping. We met some wonderful people there.",
          "A beautiful three Madrassahs standing distinctively on the Registan. A very busy tourist attraction, not only for foreigners but also to the local tourists. Each Madrassh has its own sumhols and patterns as architectural features. Very impressevise and beautiful.",

          "This is beautiful! Many others warn about the fake feeling and the police. Don't listen to them. Yes there has been a lot of restoration. It's a beautiful part of history and they are working really hard to restore it and make it as beautiful as possible. It's impressive in",
          "Two madrasah, a mosque, minarets and a square. Climb steps inside minaret for views - 20,000SUM per person. Also allows entry on second floor of madrasah. Numerous tourist gift shops. Site is lit-up each evening.",
          "No other colours are like these turquoise, indigo, ocher that filling in mosaics of the madrasas & arches. Everything is astonishing here: dimensions of the square, geometry, cupolas. Discover the tigers drawn on the facade of Sher Dor madrasah (an unique case in Arabian art!)",

          "For a small tip, the guards will let you climb one of the towers. It is a tight circle of stairs, but a rope makes it feel safer. When you get to the top you can poke your head out for a birds eye view of the complex. I took my kids, 6 and up, and they had no trouble with the",
          "Nice pkace especially in the evening. Night lights give unbelievable sharm to all square. Must visit place in Samarkand.",
          "Now a Unesco Heritage site and no wonder - there is a magnificent collection of buildings, the Register and some madrases each of which is beautifully decorated with interesting architecture. The main portal of Ulugbek and the minarets are good photo opportunities. See it during",
          "Was on a business trip and had to wake up at 0600 of a bitterly cold morning (-3 degree) due to the limited time avaiable. Glad we did it - it's one of the most splendid monuments I've visited. Now planning to go back with my family and friends",
          "This is a place I have wanted to see for years, it did not disappoint. Visit a couple of times, at sunrise and sunset, stay for the light show but check its on. Probably the best kept monument in all of central asia",
          "Visited during an international traditional singing event. The space is totally unique. Paid the ticket to get in for a full morning but each day afterwards enjoyed it from the viewing point at street level.",
          "That's probably the first place one should see in Samarkand. Best to go with the guide who can explain you everything in more detail.",
          "One of the most significant sights to see in Uzbekistan, but it has been over-renovated and santized to the point where it is impressive, but just not as interesting as lesser attractions. All of the vendors located inside the Registan structures is quite annoying, but it does",
          "Amazingly, our visits to this UNESCO World Heritage Site showed practically no other tourists. Our guide, from Advantour, wryly commented 'and yet I had to wait 3 hours to see the statue of David in Italy'. This site has been lovingly restored to its glory, and it is worth",
          "You can't say you have been to Samarkand unless you have visited this famous square. I suggested that you visit this place twice, one during the day and one during the night. During the day, you see people in action, locals, visitors, etc. During the night, you can't go inside,",
          "incredible museums, buildings, statues, religious structures, and nice hotel. The trip was provided by Mountain Travel SOBEK wow is all I can say",
          "The Registan is absolutely mindblowing - you MUST see this place, it is so beautiful. We visited the Registan twice, the first time during the time and the second time at night. You certainly need more than 3 hours to visit all the sights and small shops. The Registan was one of",
          "We visited 3 times: once with our tour group when it was over-run with tourists, once in the evening to catch it with the lights on (but could not enter), and once early in the morning, as a walk from our hotel, before the crowds had arrived. It merits exploration. As",
          "The Registan is one of the highlights of all Central Asia. Just amazing to see from both outside and inside. I found really interesting the photos inside that showed how things were 100 years ago in ruins and how they look now.",
          "A must see in Samarkand. Registan is one of the most amazing places in Uzbekistan. Here it all comes together: beautiful view, historic buildings, nature. Also there is an old minaret you can climb to take amazing pictures of Samarkand.",
          "Breathless, speactacular, one of the most beautiful places where I have ever been! It will take your breath away, you won't be able to leave, especially if you go there for the sunset.",
          "The Registan is amazing by day. Yes there are many stalls inside selling touristy stuff, but the architecture is extraordinary and it's beautifully restored. Some nights there is a lightshow which you can watch standing up for free. It goes through the history of Samarkand with",
          "Out of several countries that I have visited in Central Asia, this grand square is probably one of the most impressive square in Central Asia. It is surrounded by grand buildings of different architectures and history. A night visit with all its lights on is well worth the trip.",
          "Perhaps the most beautiful shopping centre in the World :) Beautiful building, but the inside of each of the buildings is taken over with too many tourist shops. That's no reason not to go inside because the interiors are beautiful too.",
          "It\u2019s the only place that is a must see in a city as big as Samarkand. It\u2019s worth at least 2 trips, at least once at early evening when the lights go on. The guards are not shy about selling you the extra, supposedly forbidden, climb to the tops of 2 minarets. They grabbed me",
          "Registan square is simply breathtaking. The architecture, colours, sights and sounds. A stunning photo at every turn. No visitor to this city should miss it",

          "I would not agree with the statement that visiting the Registan Square gives one the true feeling of being in Central Asia. There are much more places to give the taste of it. BUT once in Samarkand after visiting the absolute must - Gur-e-Amir / the mausoleum of the great",

The reservoir was created by erecting a 168 m (551 ft) high stone dam (Charvak Hydropower Station) on the Chirchiq River, a short distance downstream from the confluence of Pskem, Ko'ksu and Chatkal rivers in the western Tian Shan mountains, which provide the main volume of water. Currently the confluence cannot be seen and all three rivers discharge directly into Charvak. The reservoir capacity is 2 km3 (0.48 cu mi).Lake Charvak is the uppermost of the several reservoirs made on the Chirchiq River. Downstream, there are Khodzhikent Reservoir and Gazalkent Reservoir, which have a much smaller area.The dam construction was started in 1964 and completed in 1970. About 150 archaeological sites were submerged under water when the reservoir was filled up. These sites were investigated by the Institute of History and Archaeology of Uzbekistan before the dam was constructed.Lake Charvak is a popular resort in Tashkent region and thousands of holiday makers from all over Uzbekistan and neighbouring countries visit the reservoir. Villages on the banks of Charvak such as Yusufhona, Burchmulla, Nanay, Chorvoq, Sidjak, Bogustan, and their surroundings offer wide range of hotels, dachas, houses and tapchans to accommodate tourists. Yusufhona is also a popular place among paragliders and provides facilities for this sport.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Charvak Reservoir at Wikimedia Commons",

It is located 12 km (7.5 mi) from the center of Tashkent.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThis ICAO Category II airport is the primary hub of Uzbekistan Airways, and is the largest international airport in Uzbekistan, and the busiest in Central Asia. The airport comprises two terminals: Terminal 2 receives international flights, Terminal 3 is for domestic traffic.Terminal 2 was rebuilt in 2001, and renovations were completed in 2018. It has a capacity of 1000 passengers/hour and serves more than two million passengers per year. Other facilities include waiting lounges, CIP and VIP halls, restaurants and bars, currency exchange offices, duty-free shops, airlines ticket counters and sales offices, and a 24-hour pharmacy. The terminal operates at near maximum capacities; arriving passengers frequently spend an average of two hours completing customs and immigration formalities.\nTerminal 3 opened in 2011 with a capacity of 400 passengers per hour. The two terminals are separated by the runway, requiring passengers transiting from international to domestic flights and vice versa to exit the airport in order to transfer between them.\nThe government of Uzbekistan is planning to relocate Tashkent Airport to a new site by 2030.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n=== Passenger ===\n\n\n=== Cargo ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of the busiest airports in the former USSR\nTransportation in Uzbekistan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Tashkent International Airport at Wikimedia Commons\n\nTashkent International Airport on the website of Uzbekistan Airways\nAirport information for UTTT at World Aero Data.

        "wiki": "Sayid Muhammad Khudayar Khan, usually abbreviated to Khudayar Khan, was a Khan of Kokand who reigned between 1845 and 1875 with interruptions. He was the son of Shir Ali Khan. During the reign of Khudayar Khan, the Khanate was suffering from a civil war and from interventions of the Emir of Bukhara. Subsequently, the Russian invasion into Central Asia first forced the Khanate to become a vassal of the Russian Empire, and in 1876 the Khanate was abolished as a result of the suppression of an uprising. In 1875, Khudayar Khan, who took a pro-Russian position, during the uprising had to flee to Orenburg in Russia. He died in exile.\n\n\n== Prelude to rule ==\nIn 1845, Shir Ali Khan was killed during the uprising. His son Murad Beg Khan was declared the khan briefly, however, he was soon overthrown and eventually executed by the supporters of Shir Ali Khan, since he was considered to be a puppet of the Emir of Bukhara. The main political figure in the Khanate was Mingbashi Musulmonqul, a military commander, who declared Khudayar Khan, his son-in-law, the khan of Kokand. Khudayar was in Namangan during the uprising and thus survived. In the 1840s, Khudayar Khan was essentially locked in the palace in Kokand, whereas the Kipchak nomad elite under Musulmonqul had all the power in the Khanate. In 1853, there was an uprising against the Kipchaks, and a large number of them were killed, including Musulmonqul. Khudayar Khan continued to rule on his own and took an anti-Kipchak and pro-Uzbek position. He put the northern parts of the Khanate under special government, and appointed Mirza Akhmad to be the governor. In 1858, the northern provinces rebelled. Khudayar Khan sent his brother Malla Bek to Tashkent to suppress the rebellion. Instead, Malla Bek joined the rebels, conquered Kokand, and proclaimed himself a khan. He was supported by Alimqul, a Kipchak and a powerful warlord. Khudayar had to flee.\n\n\n== Rise to power ==\n\nIn 1862, Muhammad Malla Beg Khan was assassinated, and his nephew, Shah Murad Khan, became the khan. The ruler of Tashkent, Kanaat, allied with Khudayar, and Shah Murad besieged Tashkent. At the same time, Muzaffar, the Emir of Bukhara, advanced to Kokand. As the result, the Kokand army disappeared, the siege of Tashkent was lifted, and Khudayar moved to Kokand and declared himself a khan. In the meanwhile, in Osh, Alimqul got rid of possible throne claimants, promising all of them the throne, prompting them to go to Osh and executing them. In July 1863, he proclaimed Muhammad Sultan Khan, a son of Muhammad Malla Beg Khan, the Khan of Kokand. Alimqul himself was a regent, since Sultan was about thirteen years old. He launched an attack on the Khudayar's forces, and at the same time Muzaffar had to return to Bukhara to suppress a rebellion which started in Shahrisabz. Alimqul managed to agree with the Emir, launched simultaneous attacks on Kokand and Tashkent, and finally took them under control.\n\n\n== Rule of Kokand and legacy ==\nIn the 1850s, the Russian Empire advanced to the Central Asia with the final goal of controlling the whole area. In 1865, Russian troops took Tashkent, and Alimqul, who opposed them, was killed in action. In Kokand, Kipchaks declared Hudaykul Bey the khan, however, after a fortnight he flew to Kashgar. Subsequently, Khudayar Khan entered Kokand without any resistance. In 1866, Russians proceeded to the south, occupying Khujand, and thus physically separating the Kokand Khanate and the Bukhara Emirate. In 1868, Khudayar formally accepted the sovereignty of the Russian Empire over the Khanate.The reign of Khudayar Khan in the 1860s was notable for extremely high taxes and dysfunctional legal system, which was even worse than what his predecessors installed. In 1870, a plot was discovered, in which opponents of Khudayar Khan tried to replace him with Seyid Khan, a son of Mallya Khan, living in exile in Bukhara. When the plot was discovered, and Seyid Khan killed, the Emir of Bukhara, to avoid accusations in support of the plot, sent Khudayar Khan the names of conspirators and their supporters. This led to a large amount of executions. In 1875, an uprising has forced Khudayar Khan to flee from the khanate.The palace built by Khudayar Khan is one of the landmarks of Kokand.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Our group was brought here after visiting Daniel's Tomb. Arriving at 11 AM on a Sunday morning, our bus struggled to find a place for our discharge. We then joined the crowds of locals and tourists up the long series of steps, then cautiously proceed along the narrow pathway",
          "When we arrived there, we were told going there 3 times and then you are an Hajjaji, so I am one third Hajjaji now ;) Not only the architecture was stunning, but there were also Imams at the entrance who recited a sura from quor'an for me - Islamic culture pure, absolutely",
          "Entry price 22.000 som. Great place for photography. Take a guide book for explaining all the stories of the sites.",
          "This was my favourite sight in Samarkand, along with the Registan. The old, narrow pathway weaving inbetween the huge majestically-tiled mausoleums is very atmospheric. Best of you can time it to miss the large tour groups - beginning, end or middle of day.",
          "This is a succession of mausoleums in a confined space. Beautiful tile work throughout and exquisite artistry.",
          "While this site offers, according to the guide books, some unequaled architecture, it is a bit cramped and claustrophobic compared to other grand venues in Samarkand. It is also on a steep hill with many steps. That said, it's pretty fabulous.",
          "For us it was impressing to see all these magnificent tombs in the same place. The history of each one of them is very beautiful and you should take a local guide . A guide is a must here.",
          "It is a complex of Mausoleums from the time of Timur The Great. Each Mausoleum is unique in its style & beauty. You do need to climb several stair as it is on top of a hill, no wheel chair accessible. It is recommended to spend atleast 3-4 hours to see all the mausoleums.",
          "The Registan may be Samarkand's poster child, but for me the real star of the show is the line of the blue and turquoise tiled tombs known as the Sha-i-Zinda. The tombs at the complex are loosely grouped: the earliest ones are thjose at the north of the site, that date from the",
          "I believe it is one of the most highly decorated Mausoleum I have visited. Easy to find and sitting on the hill side. You should walk there once you finish Registon, the bazaar and the old Jewish quarter.",
          "I liked so much! It is hard to express how I liked that, I am not a big traveler but I have seen many interesting places in that world. This one is one of my favourite.",
          "This is an amazing place to visit. Too bad we went during afternoon time which is bad lighting for photography. Morning time will be much better!",
          "this place in the last visit of a very busy day in Samarkand and with the sun going down it was really an amazing experience. About 15 Mausoleums and Two mosques in a complex of incredible beauty. Enlightenment peace serenity and beauty",
          "Magnificent street of mausoleums, well preserved. This site should not be missed. For photographers, a visit in the morning and afternoon can be rewarding",
          "Another gem and a 10 minute walk from Bibi Khanym mosque. If you go via the cemetery side, you might not have to pay an entry fee. The cemetery itself is also interesting. Go early for the morning light.",
          "Be prepared for stunning architecture and grueling steps, as you ascend 800+ years of history. This is a pilgrimage site for those of Muslim faith, a cousin of the Prophet Muhammad is believed to be buried here. The tile work absolutely glows.",
          "This place is simply wow! I don\u2019t have a passion for cemeteries or mauzoleis but this place is stunning with blue wall ornaments, eneteriers, wooden doors etc. highly recommended to be visited when in Samarkand!!",
          "Absolutely breathtaking lovely and historic collection of buildings, with many steps to achieve the upper area. One of the finest sites in Uzbekistan",
          "The Brandt book on Uzbekistan says they've always loved to come in from the side of the modern cemetery and \"take a trip back through history.\" Of course there's a little side benefit of \"taking a trip back through history\"... they never come right out and say it, but one gets",
          "Another must see place. The amount of details, the proportions, it is al gorgeous. Really worthwhile.",
          "We had no idea what to expect and this ended up being our favorite place to explore in Samarkand! It's a real necropolis and it's fascinating and stunning!",
          "A row of beautifully decorated mausoleums - one of the highlights of Samarkand. A photographer's dream.",
          "Spectacular spot with mausoleums from different ages. Considered a holy place, so beware of your behavior. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "Shah-I Zinda is relatively compact (compared to the more famous Registan complex for example) and yet overwhelming In its beauty. From the street a pathway leads through a lower gate and nice porch for resting (lovely painted ceiling here) and then up steep stairs (no",
          "Visiting this place is definitely an experience. You will be immersed within a colorful necropolis, full of Uzbek people. The picture is unique, at least in the whole Samarkand. The decorations of the mausoleums are wonderful. It has not to be missed once in Samarkand.",
          "This whole area is complex of some beautiful tombs which were built during 9th century to 14 century with beautiful blue tile which breathtaking since I come from india easily understand the importance of this very place because their descendants constructed tombs later in 16",
          "It's almost too much to take in, all the beautiful mausoleums with amazing tilework and decoration. I almost preferred the intimate beauty to the grandeur of the Registan. On a side note, there are a lot of stairs so someone with mobility issues may struggle here.",
          "The place is a little less busy latter in the afternoon and cooler. Still wonderful buildings with huge wooden carved doors . The cemetery itself is worth seeing",
          "Here are the family members of the ruler Timur buried and this site is massive. It is not possible to take a picture of the whole area as it is too big but there are many amazing shots to be taken. You can visit most mausoleums and some are just stunning. Don\u2019t miss this place.",
          "One of the loveliest cemeteries I have even been to, the Shah-I-Zinda is amazing to see all the small mausoleums and the people, lots of locals visiting family crypts and leaving gifts, saying prayers and of course tourists admiring the craftsmanship of all of them as most",
          "Another must see. Pictures don't give the full color and size. If you love blue, this is the place to see .",
          "A must in Samarkand. Tranquility, s\u0435renity and peace. The best time is to come at the end of the day when it is not so crowdy.",
          "I loved Shah-I-Zinda. The mausoleums are spectacular, with beautiful tiles. I recommend going early as it can get quite crowded. Ladies should cover their heads here. There is a good WC outside and on the right of the entrance. You need at least an hour for a good visit.",
          "One of the most interesting places in Samarkand. Select to visit it early in the morning as later is very crowdy",
          "Coming from Bukhara it was amazing to see the fantastically decorated buildings of Samarkand - very beautiful and impressive. Recommended!",
          "this place is perhaps not so impressive as registan but definitely a must see as well . these are the places you won\u2019t forget after your visit to samarqand",
          "Samarkand is blessed with many 'not to be missed' attractions and this is certainly one of them! There are some twenty buildings here, dating mainly from the 9th-14th centuries and some from the 19th century. The name of the place is linked to the legend that Kusam ibn Abbas",
          "Samarkand has most beautiful old buildings I have ever seen in my life. It has Registan, Bibi-Khanim, Shakh-i-Zinda...etc. With simple word I would highly recommend to go and visit there",
          "There are about 20 mausoleums all beautiful and differently decorated. Climb the steps to the complex then gradually wander round the many buildings going into some of them to see the equally beautiful and different interiors. So much to see in one place makes it really worth a",
          "The royal tombs gives a serene ambient of tranquility and beauty. It is postcard like wherever you turn and good pictures are produced with just clicks of camera. A must visit site in Samarkand.",
          "All the sites in Samarkand are awesome. This visit was part of my religious studies tour and it far exceeded my expectations",
          "Walking the narrow streets of the necropolis, the curving streets and beautiful tall tiles facades are unique. Its hard to find a place that is totally 'different' I would argue this is one such place. It was a moving, serene and beautiful place.",
          "The Shah-i-Zinda Ensemble includes mausoleums and other ritual buildings of 9-14th and 19th centuries. The name Shah-i-Zinda (meaning \"The living king\") is connected with the legend that Kusam ibn Abbas, the cousin of the prophet Muhammad was buried there.",
          "Khiva, Bukhara and then fabulous Samarkand evoking ancient tales of the silk road and the exotic. Samarkand does not disappoint. The Bibi-Khanum Mosque, the Regestan with its three Madrassahs, the mausoleums at the Shah-i-Zinda, the ancient site at the Afrasiyab with its ancient",
          "This is a great place to get a feel for Samarkand architecture over the last few centuries. It is also adjacent to an interesting cemetery that is worth strolling through.",
          "Shah-i- Zinda is a collection of ancient mausoleums. Acqua domes top tombs completely encrusted in faience tiles.",
          "I've seen many mosaic decorated architectures but have never seen something quite like this in terms of pattern, artistic style, and size. Not only the way they built burial places for the royal families is unique, but the mosaic art there is also what sets it apart. Spend at",
          "I looked at my wife and we both said, \"wow.\" From the lower grouping, to the middle grouping, to the upper grouping, and then into the city cemetery, there was eye candy everywhere. Stunning tile work, architecture, a packed encylopedia of Islamic culture. I think the most",
          "As other sights in Samarkand, this is a highlight of a trip through Usbekistan. You shouldn't miss she Schahi-Sinda (also the cementary). We were deeply impressed.",
          "I can\u2019t really recognize this place as it were just one of many I saw on a day tour. See it on a half day taxi tour of Afrosiab. Then forget about it.",
          "You can spend hours walking through its beautiful buildings in blue, it's a magical place. Really worth to visit and to spend a while in.",
          "A must go in Samarkand!!! The blue tombs are perfect matches to the blue sky!! I stayed there until sunset, where the sun was setting down Bibi Xonum madrasah. It was amazing",
          "Beautiful collection of buildings, mostly mausoleums with the usual blue ceramic tiles. After a while it becomes difficult to distinguish one from another, simply because they all have such ornate facades.",
          "Probably my favourite site in Samarkand. The tombs are wonderfully decorated in blue tiles. A must see",
          "Here it's one of the most important places for the small Haj , because of the Kussam Ebn Abbas's grave , who was a cousin of Muhammad . In the site , you can see other graves that are belongings to Timur Lang and Ulugbak family . The attractions has a beautiful city view , and",
          "The monument Shah-i-Zinda was one of the highlights of my trip to Samarkand. It's a must visit place while in Uzbekistan",
          "This street of mausoleums is well worth a visit . The architecture , design and decoration is spectacular . Again worth hiring a local guide to understand the background and history .",
          "This is basically a very old cemetery. Do look at the various tombs, which are all architectural gems. You will find that the most of the visitors are locals who are there in great reverence. A group of ladies insisted on having their picture taken with us!",
          "This Necropolis built on a Hill not far fromthe Registan in Samarkand is a magnificent collection of tombs and Mausoleums flanking a narrow passageway which can be reached by climbing a flight of many stairs. At the entrance one is met with the sights of young and old climbing",
          "Amazing series of mausoleums, each one almost more beautiful than the last. Unfortunately our tour took us here in the middle of a Sunday when it was packed. If you have the option, go first or last thing.",
          "Interesting when you take into account all the 'normal' gravestones behind the complex. It gives the impression that the rich and famous wanted a lasting memorial to themselves, and the got it, which the tourists and more so the local Uzbek people are paying for to maintain with",
          "Entry ticket is required. You need to wear modestly, no short allowed, and cover your head. It is worth seeing",
          "Uzbekistan is one of those hidden gems. This mausoleum is one example, a series of well preserved, gigantic and colorfull tombs. The walk is simply amazing sorrounded by that uzbek turquiose color all over",
          "With every step you take you'll encounter another remarkable turquoise and blue tiled tomb, all worth exploring. Don't forget to look up to see some stunning ceilings. Then check out the most recent burials whose tombstones are differently impressive. Do go.",
          "We went only because we had some spare time. We were lucky. This is not to be missed. There are a series of mausoleums at this place, each one truly exquisite. Take your time seeing each work and appreciate the intricate different tile work.",
          "It was really busy when I went which was a bit frustrating as it ruins the atmosphere a little but as it is an active place of worship i suppose this is normal. Take water and sunscreen. A guide might be useful for this site if you haven't had a chance to read up on it",
          "The most beautiful place of Samarkand. Amazing for photo and seeing daily life of Uzbek. You can get there through an interesting cemetery.",
          "Though more low key than the Registan, this avenue of mausoleums shows off the best tile work of any Islamic architecture anywhere else in the world. Entrance fee is modest for a westerner - take your time walking around. For those wanting to explore further, there is a path up",
          "Some tombs are quite beautiful and others plain. The tombs are set on either side a lane, and form three quite distinct eras of erection. The profusion of tile-work would now be pass\u00e9 for those who have may have seen Bibi Xonim or Registon before the Shah-I-Zinda visit. But all",
          "Must-see when visiting Samarkand. Beautiful collection of tombs. Definitely worth the entrance fee (10k for foreigners)",
          "Most of Samarkand is modern and has little sense of history. The main attractions are all walkable, being less than 3 ks between the Amir Temur tomb and this amazing necropolis, and most is tree lined walkways. All the sites in this area are historical and beautiful, and there",
          "The architecture of Samarkand of Temurid time (14th - 15th centuries) is called an International Architecture and the necropolis Shakhi Zinda is the place which proves it. It's a must-see in Samarkand with over 20 mausoleums standing one to another,",
          "At the entrance they where the only place in Uzbekistan to bother the few tourists with stupid trousers and skirts to cover you up even more...we already where dressed decently. Entrance fee is high and you pay extra for your camera...a trend that really has to stop in",
          "You can't imagine from outside how many rich blue-domes pantheons are inside, very nice. Also interesting that many local people go there, it's a real approach to Uzbeks, very friendly.",
          "absolutely impressive\u2026 creative structures\u2026 As if I was walking in history\u2026 all that historic buildings should be protected carefully...",
          "This row of restored mausoleums is absolutely stunning, and essential to see, although crowded with visitors and pilgrims. Samarkand has chosen to restore the site's past glories, rather than to leave it in its former partly-ruined condition, a much-debated choice in the world",
          "What an amazing place. Awfully hot day but the walk through and around this historic site is not to be missed. Many advantage points for great photographs. Plaudits for the superb restoration work of the many mausoleums.",
          "This was the most beautiful and interesting place we saw in Samarkand, we usually don't like to go cemeteries, but these mausoleums are beautiful and for us the best cultural visit we do in Uzbekistan.",
          "The beauty and wonder of all the different holy buildings as you climb the stairs is really astounding. The tile works are astounding with an array of blues that come from beyong the sea and sky. It is a climb so take water. Lots of people here as well but not ovewrhelming and",
          "Inside this complex you will find a lot of buildings where the outside (and sometimes also the inside) is covered with mosaic, mostly in blue colors. Very fotogenic.",
          "Shrine of Hazrat Kussum bin Abbas and many others well maintained and decorated, and the 40 stairs to climb at one go with requirement of just one foot at every step is a unique experience, thought it might relate only to stories and mythology.",
          "Extremely crowded and renovated with some questionable liberties (please refer to the colours), yet it still makes for an impressive, somewhat solemn site. Comes with a ticket price of 10k som per person nowadays",
          "This is a pilgrimage site for many people. The Alley of Mausoleums is amazing, and worth the visit all by itself. Superb tile work.",
          "The Shah-I-Zinda, the \u2018Tomb of the Living King\u2019 originally dates from the ninth century, and is purported to be the final resting place of Qusam Ibn Abbas, a cousin of the Prophet Mohammed who brought Islam to the area in the seventh century. The name is derived from a legend",
          "take your time when visiting shar - I Zindar. Of all the places (Buchara, Kiva) this was the most impressive location. Or take a 2nd time to come back at the end, before closing time like 17.00 hrs. I think its open till 18.00 hrs.",
          "It's a necropolis with a complex of mausoleums and a adjacent cemetery and perhaps the most photogenic place in Samarkand! It's a must see for everybody visiting the city. Registan ist breathtaking, but this laying a bit on the outside complex is a real jewel! There is nothing",
          "One of the top places to visit in Samarqand. A necropolis with tombs of several eras with fascinating geometrical patterns. The tourist part is built like a narrow street, with mausoleums on both sides (much stair climbing), used as religious site or tourist shop or just empty.",
          "Its a must see. The ticket is 10k per person, 6k for camera. Huge complex, beautiful tombs and on your way back do not miss the cemetery!",
          "Shah-i-Zinda is a must-see of Samarkand. It is a dense complex of mausoleums pertaining to proeminent dignitaries and wives of the emirs and of the nobility. Very nicely coloured, a jewel of art.",
          "I thought this was a lovely place to visit. The buildings of the ensemble have beautiful detail and a blue color that I hadn't seen anywhere in my whole trip (this was seen on the last day). The cemetery is interesting as I had never gone to a muslim cemetery before, however it",
          ".. i love staring at every detail of the buildings.. it's simply amazing.. i'll be going back to see more of this city as I had limited time during that visit..",
          "This avenue of mausoleums leads up from the road up an avenue leading to the plateau. Both sides are smothered in tastefully done mausoleums all the way to the top. The mausoleums are tightly packed together and are all brightly decorated all with different patterns and designs.",
          "A wonderful city which offers a lot from the past. One must visit it. An unforgettable place for me!!!!!!!",
          "This is a burial place for mainly the wifes of the Emirs which are burried in Gur Emir Mausoleum and the mausoleums are wonderful. One tip: when you reach the last mausoleum on the right turn round behind it go for about 20-30 meters and then climb throughthe modern cemetry",
          "Tombs, tombs and more tombs, or rather mausoleums, mausoleums and more mausoleums. Consists of an avenue of compact closely spaced brightly decorated mausoleums all of which have a slightly different Islamic architecture. Most of those buried here are from the mongol era,",
          "Explore the beautiful buildings but also the cemetery on the surrounding hill. The late president was recently buried here.",
          "This is a row of tombs and mausoleums that are collectively known as Shah-i-Zinda, or \"place of a living king,\" stretched between the present and the past. At its front is living Samarkand, and at its back the dusty slopes at the edge of ancient Afrosiab.",
          "A wonderful street full of turquoise tiles and mosaics, a madrassa, a mosque and many mausolea. Tempting to keep clicking away on the camera but just move to one side, stand in the shade and just look and absorb the splendour. It is so striking in both colour and size.",
          "The concentration of mausoleums, the climb up the stairs and the \"Avenue\" of Mausoleums was beautiful and although there were souvenir shops it was nice to see they were not in located in the same rooms as the tombs. The walk through the cemetery and up the hill can yield great",
          "Fascinating collection of mausoleums with a lot of locals visiting. Very moving and with a lot of soul.",
          "This \"Avenue of Mausoleums\" with one of the richest tile work in the muslim world, was probably one of the most impressive experiences I have had with islamic architecture. We spent 2 hours there overwhelmed by this incredible concentration of beautiful views and impressions.",
          "A fascinating place to visit, like many of the attractions in Samarkand. Apparently if you count the steps on your way up to the mausoleums and count them again when you descend and if the number is the same then you have a pure heart, or so my guide told me! The mausoleums",
          "A study in the artistic possibilities of a limited palate: with brilliant turquoise and blue tiles, brick and a bit of black, white and gold leaf, no two of these buildings are the same. I was fascinated to realize that most of the decorations, even the most geometric and",
          "This place was lovely even on a super hot day. Parts of it dating from the 9th century, well renovated and a small explanation in English on each mausoleum was great",
          "Impossibly beautiful, fabulously concentrated and wonderfully presented, you'll spend hours in the Shah-i-Zinda marvelling at the majesty and other-worldliness of the forms and colours.",
          "Come see these wonderfully adorned and unique tombs lining the one street of this necropolis. Temarlane's sisters and best friend are entombed here. The street culminates with a tomb of a purported relative of Mohammed. Apparently, he came to ensure the spread of Islam here",
          "The Mausoleum is another must see sight in Samarkand but make sure you allow plenty of time as there is so much t o see.",
          "Shah-i-Zinda was a highlight, the colours and architecture of each of the tombs and mausoleums are fantastic. We had a guide with us which was perfect as he explained each of the tombs/ mausoleums for us. While we were there they are doing some restoration to the entrance.",
          "if you have time, you really should head slightly out of the centre of Samarkand to see these beautiful tombs. There are a number of buildings in the complex with some exquisite tile work.",
          "It looks like a small village from afar, but up close you see that there are several building which house tombs of historically important people from Samarkand. The name means \u2018Tomb of the Living King\u2019. The buildings were eventually covered in earth and then rediscovered in",
          "This Necropolis was my favorite Samarkand attraction. The tile work is the MOST BEAUTIFUL artwork I have seen.. EVER. I suggest you read about it ahead of time and not hire a guide for this. Great place for photography!",
          "The Shah-i-Zinda is the other must-see sight in Samarkand. The tombs are peaceful, some with wonderful, ornate ceilings - others have plain whitewashed walls. A fantastic place to wander around for an hour or two. A taxi may be needed to get here (but this will not cost very",
          "The 11 Shahi Zinda mausoleums are lined up facing each other on an uphill street. We loved them. Our guide Valentina gave us very good explanations for almost each of them and the best part was we spent quite a bit of time exploring. The best monument to explore in Samarkand.",
          "What an amazing place. An uphill Street filled with mausoleums each if a different design. Great place to spend time and see things at a slow pace. Religious and Spiritual to believers and can be the same for others too.",
          "I went near sunset in the hope of seeing marmosets. I read they appeared around then. They didn't but it was a good time to go - the golden sun on the tombs made for lovely photos. I imagine it would also be lovely in the early morning. If I'd had more time I would have gone",
          "I thought Registan would be the highlight of our trip to Samarkand but this place blew us away. The size, complexity, and beauty were phenomenal and I could visit there many times without getting tired of the scene. A must see in Samarkand.",
          "This was a place to take your breath away.Of all the places we visited this was my absolute favourite(even beats the Observatory).The climb to enter is wonderful and your eyes are all over the place trying to take in the wonder of the architecture and the colours. We went on",
          "The Shah-i-zinda is a hidden gem, and a veritable must for any traveller on the Silk Road in Samarkand. From the outside, the complex appears quite unobtrusive - just a couple of ubiquitous turquoise blue-tiled domes sticking up - but once you have climbed the steep stairs up",
          "A must-see when visiting Samarkand! This is a long narrow street of mausoleums that are absolutely beautiful. The individual architecture and detail of each is unique and they almost seem to be trying to out-do one another - the next one seems to better the previous one!",
          "Shah-i-Zinda is a beautiful path of mausoleums that is a must see for any visit to Samarkand. Located a short distance out of the city, in the same direction as Ulugbek's Observatory and Afrosiab, Shah-i-Zinda is best visited in the morning or at sunset, it isn't recommended to",
          "If you have not visited Shah-i-Zinda you have definitely missed the best part of Samarkand. It would be advisable to visit the place with a professional guide.",
          "Shah-i-Zinda is one of the must visit places in Samarkand. Do not miss this place. Take time to observe and absorve each little part of the monument.",
          "2 of the tomb here are equally pretty and there is a story about it. Kussam Ibni Abbas shrine is here too. For those would like to know more about Timurid Love, Culture, and Traditions this is exactly tourist places to visit.",
          "in my opinion, this was the most beautiful site I saw in Samarqand. It reminded me of an old town with it's narrow stone paved streets. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Some Mausoleums are good and photo-worthy. Try to visit twice in the same day to take addvantaage of lighting.",
          "For non-Muslims if you love architecture and historical buildings this is a must visit. You have to climb up 49 odd steps to reach up where you can visit tombs decorated with typical Uzbek design mosaics tiles. Great for photos where you can see a little more view of Samarkand.",

          "The mausoleums were in a variety of styles and the architecture was incredible. I highly recommend visiting here.",
          "Found on the edge of the town center and snaking up the hillside of ancient Afrosiab, this burial place was one of the most memorable attractions I saw in Samarkand and, as my guide pointed out, one of the most important as well. We walked from the Registan to get here which",
          "A truly unique place that is denitely worth the walk from the Registan. Does feature some steep steps.",
          "We agree with other travelers that Shah-i-Zinda is at least as impressive as the Registan. (They are, of course, quite different.) You need a guide (or excellent guidebook) to understand who the people were who are buried in these mausoleums. Allow plenty of time, since each",

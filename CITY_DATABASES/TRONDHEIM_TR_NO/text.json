        "wiki": "Old Town Bridge (Norwegian: Gamle Bybro or Bybroa) is located in Trondheim, Tr\u00f8ndelag County, Norway.\n\n\n== History ==\nGamle Bybro crosses the  Nidelva River from the south end of the  main street Kj\u00f8pmannsgata connecting to the Trondheim neighborhood of Bakklandet. Gamle Bybro was constructed by Johan Caspar von Cicignon  in 1681 in conjunction with the reconstruction of Trondheim after the great fire of 1681. Johan Caspar von Cicignon laid out plans for the reconstruction of Trondheim as well as its fortification. Kristiansten Fortress was built at this time after his plans. The bridge location was of military-strategic significance.  King Christian V of Denmark assumed the cost of construction. It was completed in 1685. The bridge was built in the vicinity of the original Elgeseter Bridge. When it was opened the older bridge was allowed to decay and collapse. Since then  Gamle Bybro has undergone many changes.\n\nOriginally  Gamle Bybro  was constructed of wood, but the wood was supported on three stone piers. In the middle of the bridge, an iron  gate was placed. This remained a guarded city gate until 1816. At each end of the bridge there was a toll and guardhouse. The access house on the west end still stands, but that on the east side was taken down in 1824. Gamle Bybro was reconstructed in 1861 by the engineer Carl Adolf Dahl (1828-1907). Today Gamle Bybro is one of Trondheim's characteristic landmarks.\nGamle Bybro is also known as Lykkens portal (Gate of Happiness), after the lyrics of the popular waltz  Nidelven stille og vakker du er ( \"Nidelven quiet and beautiful you are\")  by Norwegian singer and composer  Kristian Oskar Hodd\u00f8 (1916-1943).  According to tradition,  Hodd\u00f8 wrote the waltz about  the Nidelva River one night in late April 1940 while he was  standing at Gamle Bybro. Oskar Hodd\u00f8 was a member of the resistance movement against the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. He was executed in Trondheim on 17 November 1943 along with eight other Norwegian resistance fighters.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Other sources ==\n\u00d8ksendal, Asbj\u00f8rn  (1969)  Lur\u00f8y-aff\u00e6ren - Operasjon Oleander : Gestapo i Trondheim og Leksvik-aff\u00e6ren 1942-44 ISBN 978-82-7005-023-9\n\n\n== External links ==\nNidelven stille og vakker du er by Oskar Hodd\u00f8",

      "name": "Nidaros Cathedral",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Nidaros Cathedral (Norwegian: Nidarosdomen / Nidaros Domkirke) is a cathedral of the Church of Norway located in the city of Trondheim in Tr\u00f8ndelag county. It is built over the burial site of King Olav II (c. 995\u20131030, reigned 1015\u20131028), who became the patron saint of the nation, and is the traditional location for the consecration of new kings of Norway. It was built over a 230 year period, from 1070 to 1300 when it was substantially completed. However additional work, additions and renovations have continued intermittently since then; the most recent changes were completed in 2001. Nidaros was designated as the cathedral for the Diocese of Nidaros in 1152. After experiencing the turmoil and controversies of the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, it was taken from the Catholic Church by the newly established state Church of Norway in 1537, which adopted the teachings and reforms of Martin Luther, Phillip Melancthon and others, becoming an Evangelical Lutheran church. Nidaros is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world.The cathedral is the main church for the Nidaros og V\u00e5r Frue parish, the seat of the Nidaros domprosti (arch-deanery), and the seat of the Bishop of the Diocese of Nidaros.  The Preses of the Church of Norway is also based at this cathedral. The large, stone church seats about 1,850 people and it was historically used as the site of coronation of the kings of Norway.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNidaros Cathedral was built beginning in 1070 to memorialize the burial place of Olav II of Norway, the king who was killed in 1030 in the Battle of Stiklestad. He was canonized as Saint Olav a year later by Grimketel, the Bishop of Nidaros (the canonization was later confirmed by the pope). It was designated the cathedral of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros from its establishment in 1152 until its abolition in 1537 under the Reformation.Since the Reformation, it has served as the cathedral of the Lutheran bishops of Trondheim (or Nidaros) in the Diocese of Nidaros. The architectural style of the cathedral is Romanesque and Gothic. Historically it has been an important destination for pilgrims coming from all of Northern Europe.Along with V\u00e5r Frue Church, the cathedral is part of the Nidaros og V\u00e5r Frue parish in the Nidaros deanery in the Diocese of Nidaros.\n\n\n== Building and restoration ==\n\nWork on the cathedral as a memorial to St. Olav started in 1070. It was finished some time around 1300, nearly 150 years after being established as the cathedral of the diocese. The cathedral was badly damaged by fires in 1327 and again in 1531. The nave was destroyed and was not rebuilt until the restoration in early 1900s.\nIn 1708, the church burned down completely except for the stone walls. It was struck by lightning in 1719, and was again ravaged by fire. Major rebuilding and restoration of the cathedral started in 1869, initially led by architect Heinrich Ernst Schirmer, and nearly completed by Christian Christie. It was officially completed in 2001. Maintenance of the cathedral is an ongoing process.\nThe oldest parts of the cathedral consist of the octagon with its surrounding ambulatory. This was the site of the original high altar, with the reliquary casket of Saint Olav, and choir. Design of the octagon may have been inspired by the Corona of Canterbury Cathedral, although octagonal shrines have a long history in Christian architecture. Similarly, the choir shows English influence, and appears to have been modeled after the Angel Choir of Lincoln Cathedral.\nIt is joined to the octagon by a stone screen that fills the entire east side of the choir.  The principal arch of this screen is subdivided into three subsidiary arches: the central arch frames a statue of Christ the Teacher, standing on the top of a central arch of three subsidiary arches below him. The space above the principal arch, corresponding to the vault of the choir, contains a crucifix by the Norwegian sculptor Gustav Vigeland, placed between statues of the Virgin Mary and the Apostle John. Built into the south side of the ambulatory is a small well. A bucket could be lowered to draw up water drawn from the spring that originated from St. Olav's original burial place. (This was covered over by the construction of later cathedrals).\nThe present cathedral has two principal altars. At the east end of the chancel in the octagon is an altar at the site of the medieval high altar, behind which stood the silver reliquary casket containing the remains of St. Olav. This silver-gilt reliquary casket was melted down for coinage by Christian II and St. Olav's remains buried in an unknown location under the cathedral. The only relic known to have survived is a femur in a silver-gilt reliquary. Shaped as a forearm, it was given by Queen Josephine to St. Olav Catholic Cathedral in Oslo. The original reliquary casket was in the form of a church, with dragon heads on its gables. The dragons are similar to those carved on the gables of Norwegian stave churches. Surviving medieval reliquary caskets in Norway frequently also bear such dragon heads, for instance, that at Heddal Stave Church.  He was the church's and the kingdom's patron saint. The current altar was designed to recall in marble sculpture the essential form of this reliquary casket. It replaces the previous baroque altar, which was transferred to V\u00e5r Frue Church.\nThe second altar is in the crossing, where the transept intersects the nave and the chancel.  It bears a large modern silver crucifix. It was commissioned and paid for by Norwegian American emigrants in the early twentieth century, and the design was inspired by the memory of a similar silver crucifix in the medieval church. The medieval chapter house may also be used as a chapel for smaller groups of worshipers.\nAll the stained glass in the cathedral dates from its rebuilding in the 19th and 20th centuries.  The windows on the north side of the church depict scenes from the Old Testament against a blue background, while those on the south side of the church depict scenes from the New Testament against a red background.\n\n\n== Organs ==\n\nTwo organs are installed in the Cathedral. The main organ was built by the Steinmeyer firm in 1930, and was erected in the north transept. It then had 125 stops. Installation of the Steinmeyer organ was commissioned in 1930 for the 900th anniversary of the Battle of Stiklestad. The organ was funded mostly by donations, particularly by Elias Anton Cappelen Smith. In 1962, the organ was heavily rebuilt and moved to the west nave. Many stops were removed; some of them were used to build a new choir organ. This organ was fully restored in 2014.The old Baroque organ built by noted German organ builder Johann Joachim Wagner (1690\u20131749) during the period 1738\u201340 was carefully restored by J\u00fcrgen Ahrend between 1993\u201394. It has 30 stops and is located at a gallery in the north transept.\n\n\n== Tourist attraction ==\nToday, the cathedral is a popular tourist attraction. Nidaros Cathedral is the site of the observation of Olav's Wake (Norwegian: Olavsvaka). This religious and cultural festival is centered upon the anniversary of the death of Saint Olav at the Battle of Stiklestad. Tourists often follow the historic Pilgrim's Route (Norwegian: Pilegrimsleden) to visit the cathedral for this and other events.\n\n\n== Alleged bombing plot ==\nThe cathedral is also familiar to enthusiasts of Norwegian black metal, as it is featured on the cover artwork of De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, the 1994 studio album by Mayhem. It was rumored that members of the band who had already been associated with the \nburnings of other Christian churches in Norway had planned to destroy the cathedral in relation to the release of the album. When police arrested former Mayhem bassist Varg Vikernes on 19 August 1993 they had found 150 kg of explosives in his home.\n\n\n== Media gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Choirs ==\nNidaros Cathedral Choir\nNidaros Cathedral Boys' Choir\nNidaros Cathedral Girls' Choir\nSchola Sancta Sunnivae\nNidaros Vocalis\nNidaros Oratory Choir\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of churches in Tr\u00f8ndelag\nList of cathedrals in Norway\nNidaros\nPilgrim's Route\n\n\n== References and notes ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nDanbolt, Gunnar (1997).

        "wiki": "Kristiansten Fortress (Norwegian: Kristiansten Festning, historically spelled Christiansten) is located on a hill east of the city of Trondheim in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway, named after Christian V of Denmark-Norway. It was built after the city fire of Trondheim in 1681 to protect the city against attack from the east. Construction was finished in 1685. It fulfilled its purpose in 1718 when Swedish forces laid siege against Trondheim. The fortress was decommissioned in 1816 by king Charles XIV John.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nTrondheim was traditionally protected with fortifications by the river Nidelven and Skansen, but the city was vulnerable to attack from the east. The Fortress was therefore put on a hill to protect the city centre and control the area from Ila to Lade.  General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, who was chief inspector of fortifications, was responsible for the new town plan of Trondheim after the great fire of 18 April 1681. He also made the plans for the construction of Kristiansten Fortress.The fortress was built during the period from 1682 to 1684 and strengthened to a complete defence fortification in 1691 by building an advanced post Kristiandsands bastion in the east and in 1695 with the now vanished M\u00f8llenberg skanse by the river Nidelven. These fortifications were encircled by a continuous palisade and thereby connected to the fortified city. In 1750 the fortress was modernized with new bastions and casemates to protect against mortar artillery. Two new isolated defensive works were also built to the east - Gr\u00fcner's and Fr\u00f8lich's redoubts - but they are hardly visible today.The main building featured in the picture is the defensive tower - Donjonen - with artillery, quartering and stores was the centre of the defences. After decommissioning in 1816 it was location of the fire watch, and since 1997 as a museum.\n\n\n== Great Northern War ==\n\nIn the final days of the Great Northern War, Karl XII of Sweden initiated a second invasion of Norway in the fall of 1718. While Karl XII led his main army in an attack from the south at Fredrikshald, an army under General Carl Gustaf Armfeldt (or Armfelt) was sent into Tr\u00f8ndelag to seize Trondheim. Armfeldt advanced against Trondheim, which was defended by an army of 6,900 men under Vincens Budde. The Swedish forces were resisted both by Norwegian forces and by the people of the countryside, who bitterly recalled the previous Swedish occupation of Tr\u00f8ndelag. Provisions were not available, and the Norwegian winter set in. Although he reached the city and laid siege, the strength of Kristiansten Fortress and other fortifications was such that he chose to retreat toward Verdal. Karl XII issued a sharp rebuke and ordered Armfeldt to take Trondheim. Although Armfeldt's forces surrounded Trondheim, Budde's forces were able to keep him at bay. Camping in the open and poorly fed, many of Armfeldt's troops fell ill and his capable forces were reduced to 4,000 men. When Karl XII was killed in December by a bullet at Fredriksten Fortress, Armfeldt's forces retreated to Sweden. On their way back across the mountains, almost the entire army was lost, mostly because of snow, cold temperature and a strong blizzard; the retreat has been likened to Napoleon\u2019s from Moscow for the severity of casualties.\n\n\n== The 20th century ==\n\nThe Norwegian war flag with the badge denoting the union with Sweden was hauled down on 9 June 1905, and the \"pure\" war flag was hoisted instead, with full military honours and gun salutes for both flags. On 18 November 1905 a twenty-one gun salute was again fired from Kristiansten Fortress to proclaim the election of Prince Carl of Denmark as the new King of Norway under the name of Haakon VII of Norway. The flag of union with Sweden was hauled down and the Flag of Norway hoisted.\nDuring German occupation of Norway in World War II the Nazis executed a number of Norwegian patriots at Kristiansten.\nThe fortress was the official place of execution of convicted and condemned traitors and war criminals following the legal purge in Norway after World War II. The notorious Henry Rinnan was executed here on 1 February 1947, and nine of his followers afterwards, eight of them on the same day in 1947.\n\n\n== View ==\nFrom this fortress you can see \"strandlinja\"; a topographical line along the hills of the Bymarka which was formerly beaches and sea cliffs. The \"line\" can be seen stretching out in the hills around Trondheim, but is best seen from the fortress, towards By\u00e5sen.\n\n\n== References and notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKristiansten Festning (in Norwegian)",

        "wiki": "Tr\u00f8ndelag (Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0153\u0302nd\u0259l\u0251\u02d0\u0261]) (Southern Sami: Tr\u00f6\u00f6ndelage) is a county in the central part of Norway. It was created in 1687, then named Trondhjem County (Norwegian: Trondhjems Amt); in 1804 the county was split into Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag and S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag by the King of Denmark-Norway, and the counties were reunited in 2018 after a vote of the two counties in 2016.The largest city in Tr\u00f8ndelag is the city of Trondheim. The administrative centre is Steinkjer, while Trondheim functions as the office of the county mayor. Both cities serve the office of the county governor; however, Steinkjer houses the main functions.Tr\u00f8ndelag county and the neighbouring M\u00f8re og Romsdal county together form what is known as Central Norway. A person from Tr\u00f8ndelag is called a tr\u00f8nder. The dialect spoken in the area, tr\u00f8ndersk, is characterized by dropping out most vowel endings; see apocope.\nTr\u00f8ndelag is one of the most fertile regions of Norway, with large agricultural output. The majority of the production ends up in the Norwegian cooperative system for meat and milk, but farm produce is a steadily growing business.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe Old Norse form of the name was \u00der\u01ffndal\u01ebg. The first element is the genitive plural of \u00fer\u01ffndr which means \"person from Tr\u00f8ndelag\", while the second is l\u01ebg (plural of lag which means \"law; district/people with a common law\" (compare Danelaw, Gula\u00feingsl\u01ebg and Njar\u00f0arl\u01ebg). A parallel name for the same district was \u00der\u00f3ndheimr which means \"the homeland (heim) of the \u00fer\u01ffndr\". \u00der\u00f3ndheimr may be older since the first element has a stem form without umlaut.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPeople have lived in this region for thousands of years. In the early iron-age Tr\u00f8ndelag was divided into several petty kingdoms called fylki. The different fylki had a common law, and an early parliament or thing. It was called Frostating and was held at the Frosta-peninsula. By some this is regarded as the first real democracy.\nIn the time after H\u00e5kon Grjotgardsson (838-900), Tr\u00f8ndelag was ruled by the Jarl of Lade. Lade is located in the eastern part of Trondheim, bordering the Trondheimsfjord. The powerful Jarls of Lade continued to play a very significant political role in Norway up to 1030.\n\nJarls of Lade (Ladejarl) were:\n\nH\u00e5kon Grjotgardsson, the first jarl of Lade.\nSigurd H\u00e5konsson, son of H\u00e5kon. Killed by Harald Greyhide.\nH\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, son of Sigurd. Conspired with Harald Bluetooth against Harald Greyhide, and subsequently became vassal of Harald Bluetooth, and in reality independent ruler of Norway. After the arrival of Olaf Trygvason, H\u00e5kon quickly lost all support, and was killed by his own slave, Tormod Kark, in 995.\nEirik H\u00e5konsson, son of H\u00e5kon. Together with his brother, Svein, governor of Norway under Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark from 1000 to 1012.\nH\u00e5kon Eiriksson, son of Eirik. Governor of Norway under Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark from 1012 to 1015.\nTr\u00f8ndelag (together with parts of M\u00f8re og Romsdal) was briefly ceded in 1658 to Sweden in the Treaty of Roskilde and was ruled by king Charles X until it was returned to Denmark-Norway after the Treaty of Copenhagen in 1660. During that time, the Swedes conscripted 2,000 men in Tr\u00f8ndelag, forcing young boys down to 15 years of age to join the Swedish armies fighting against Poland and Brandenburg. Charles X feared the Tr\u00f8nders would rise against their Swedish occupiers, and thought it wise to keep a large part of the men away. Only about one third of the men ever returned to their homes; some of them were forced to settle in the then Swedish Duchy of Estonia, as the Swedes thought it would be easier to rule the Tr\u00f8nders there, utilising the ancient maxim of divide and rule.In the fall of 1718, during the Great Northern War, General Carl Gustaf Armfeldt was ordered by king Charles XII of Sweden to lead a Swedish army of 10,000 men into Tr\u00f8ndelag and take Trondheim. Because of his poor supply lines back to Sweden, Armfeldt's army had to live off the land, causing great suffering to the people of the region. Armfeldt's campaign failed: the defenders of Trondheim succeeded in repelling his siege. After Charles XII was killed in the siege of Fredriksten in Norway's southeast, Armfeldt was ordered back into Sweden. During the ensuing retreat, his 6,000 surviving threadbare and starving Caroleans were caught in a fierce blizzard. Thousands of Caroleans froze to death in the Norwegian mountains, and hundreds more were crippled for life.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nThe county is governed by the Tr\u00f8ndelag County Municipality. The town of Steinkjer is the seat of the county governor and county administration. Both the county governor and Tr\u00f8ndelag County Municipality, however, also have offices in Trondheim.\nThe county oversees the 41 upper secondary schools, including nine private schools. Six of the schools have more than 1000 students: four in Trondheim plus the Steinkjer Upper Secondary School and the Ole Vig Upper Secondary School in Stj\u00f8rdalshalsen. The county has ten Folk high schools, with an eleventh folk high school being possibly being opened in R\u00f8ros, with a possible start in 2019.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nThe county is often sub-divided into several geographical regions:\n\nNamdal, the greater Namsen river valley\nFosen, the Fosen peninsula and surrounding areas\nInnherred, the areas surrounding the inner Trondheimsfjorden\nStj\u00f8rdalen, the Stj\u00f8rdalen valley\nTrondheim Region, the areas surrounding the large city of Trondheim\nGauldalen, the Gaula river valley\nOrkdalen, the Orklaelva river valley\n\n\n=== Towns and cities ===\nThere are nine towns/cities in Tr\u00f8ndelag, plus the \"mining town\" of R\u00f8ros.\n\nTrondheim (in Trondheim municipality)\nSteinkjer (in Steinkjer municipality)\nStj\u00f8rdalshalsen (in Stj\u00f8rdal municipality)\nLevanger (in Levanger municipality)\nNamsos (in Namsos municipality)\nVerdals\u00f8ra (in Verdal municipality)\nOrkanger (in Orkdal municipality)\nBrekstad (in \u00d8rland municipality)\nKolvereid (in N\u00e6r\u00f8y municipality)\nBergstaden R\u00f8ros (in R\u00f8ros municipality)\n\n\n=== Tr\u00f8ndelag ===\nThere are 38 municipalities in Tr\u00f8ndelag.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe region's official theatre is the Tr\u00f8ndelag Teater in Trondheim. At Stiklestad in Verdal, the historical play called The Saint Olav Drama has been played each year since 1954.  It depicts the last days of Saint Olaf.\nJazz on a very high level is frequently heard in Trondheim, due to the high-level jazz education in Trondheim. Trondheim is also the national centre of rock music; the popular music museum Rockheim opened there in 2010. Tr\u00f8ndelag is also known for its local variety of rock music, often performed in local dialect, called \"tr\u00f8nderrock\".\n\n\n=== Food and drink ===\nThe region is popularly known for its moonshine homebrew, called karsk. Although officially prohibited, the art of producing as pure home-made spirits as possible still has a strong following in parts of Tr\u00f8ndelag. Traditionally served mixed with coffee, local variations apply. In southern regions, people tend to use normal filter coffee, while in the north they choose to serve karsk with as weak coffee as possible.\n\nThe \"official dish\" of the region is sodd which is made from sheep or beef meat and meatballs in boiled stock. The Norwegian Grey Troender sheep is an endangered breed of domesticated sheep that originated from Tr\u00f8ndelag in the late 19th century. There are currently approximately 50 individual animals remaining and efforts are being made to revive the breed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDemographics of Tr\u00f8ndelag\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Tr\u00f8ndelag travel guide from Wikivoyage\nFacts about Tr\u00f8ndelag from Mid-Norway European office\nInsular artefacts from Viking-Age burials from mid-Norway.

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway.

The statue is a replica, the original being located at a Seattle marina.\n\n\n=== Nidaros Cathedral ===\n\nThe Nidaros Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace are located side by side in the middle of the city centre. The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral. On 24 May 2002, their daughter Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise married the writer Ari Behn in the cathedral.The Pilgrim's Route (Pilegrimsleden) to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at Nidaros Cathedral, has recently been re-instated. Also known as St. Olav's Way, (Sankt Olavs vei), the main route, which is approximately 640 kilometres (400 mi) long, starts in Oslo and heads North, along Lake Mj\u00f8sa, up the valley Gudbrandsdalen, over the mountain range Dovrefjell and down the Oppdal valley to end at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to pilgrims and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the aegis of the cathedral, which awards certificates to successful pilgrims upon the completion of their journey.\n\n\n=== Other churches ===\nThe Lutheran Church of Norway has 21 churches within the municipality of Trondheim. They are all a part of the Diocese of Nidaros, which is based in Trondheim at the Nidaros Cathedral.

The new public transport system becomes flexible, with buses running more often and accommodating more passengers. Fewer travelers must take a detour through the center of Trondheim.\nIn addition, the Nattbuss (Night Bus) service ensures cheap and effective transport for those enjoying nightlife in the city centre during the weekends. The Nattbus has other prices than ordinary buses. The European route E6 highway passes through the city centre of Trondheim in addition to a motorway bypass along the eastern rim of the city.\n\n\n== Twin towns and sister cities ==\n\nTrondheim is twinned with:\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nKristofer Hivju, actor\nHjalmar \"Hjallis\" Andersen, Olympic skater\nPetter Northug, cross-country skier\nLiv Ullman, actress and director\nKnut Glomsaas, musician\nH\u00e5kon Karlsen, journalist\nAtle Kv\u00e5lsvoll, cyclist and coach\nIdun Reiten, mathematician\nArve Tellefsen, violinist\nDiesel Dahl, drummer\nEmil Weber Meek, mixed martial artist, former welterweight champion with Venator Fighting Championship\nMerethe Tr\u00f8an, singer\nHilchen Sommerschild, educator\nThomas Bergersen, composer\nSander Sagosen, handball player\nThoning Owesen, landowner and philanthropist\nJohannes H\u00f8sflot Kl\u00e6bo, cross-country skier\nTorstein Horgmo, snowboarder\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of mayors of Trondheim\nTyholt Tower\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMunicipality website (in Norwegian)\nTrondheim.no, Trondheim's official website in Norwegian\nand Trondheim.com, Trondheim's official website in English\nVisit Trondheim\n Trondheim travel guide from Wikivoyage",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Ringve Museum is Norway's national museum for music and musical instruments, with collections from all over the world.\n\n\n== Background ==\nRingve Museum is located in the historic Ringve Farm in Trondheim. Ringve Farm was the childhood home of the Danish-Norwegian nobleman, Peter Tordenskjold. It is situated in a park on the Lade peninsula just outside Trondheim with a view over the Trondheimsfjord, the park forming botanical gardens run by NTNU (the Norwegian University of Science and Technology). The first house on the site was built in 1521, but the current group of buildings dates from the 1740s onwards.\nWhen the estate was auctioned in 1878, it was purchased by the Bachke family and one of the sons, Christian Anker Bachke (1873-1946) acquired the estate in 1919. In late 1919, he married Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 Victoria Rostin Bachke, an artist who fled from the Russian Revolution. The couple had no children but put their considerable energies into their love of music and assembling a collection of historical musical instruments, which now numbers around 1,500 instruments, alongside other artifacts associated with music \u2013 pictures, recordings.The museum is based on the private collection of founder Victoria Bachke and was opened to the public in 1952. Jon Voigt (1928-1997) succeeded Victoria Bachke as director in 1963 and continued until 1997. Over the years many famous musicians visited Ringve, including Artur Schnabel, Lilly Krauss, Ignaz Friedman, Percy Grainger and Kirsten Flagstad, as well as the artist, Edvard Munch.\n\n\n== Exhibition ==\n\nThe public exhibitions are divided in two parts: the Manor House and the Barn.\n\n\n=== The Manor House ===\nThe period interiors of the Ringve Manor House provide the setting for themed rooms of working \u2013 mainly keyboard \u2013 instruments. In this section, open by guided tour only, the guides (often graduate music students) play an appropriate piece of music (or extract) as the tour proceeds.\nThe first room is called the Mozart room and contains a spinet, clavichord and a domestic or house organ, from the 18th century. A Murano glass chandelier hangs from the ceiling.\nThe next room is called the \u2018Beethoven\u2019 and contains a harp piano of 1870 by Dietz, and a piano of type favoured by Beethoven.\nA room dedicated to Chopin comes next, with examples of the composer's preferred pianos, as well as a death mask and casts of his hands. There are also watercolours by George Sand and memorabilia about Chopin and Liszt. A card table and sofa that came from Chopin's Paris home, and which were inherited by his Norwegian pupil Thomas Tellefsen are on display.\n\nUpstairs there is a room based around singers Elisabeth Wiborg and Adelina Patti and includes a piano which Patti insisted on being accompanied. This is followed by a display of Hardanger fiddles, a \u2018Grieg\u2019 room, a room of instruments associated with church and worship, and finally a room of curiosities, including a Cecilium, a Norwegian-made barrel-organ, musical toys and a Janko piano.\n\n\n=== Fire ===\n\nThe manor was badly hit by a fire in the attic and second floor on 3 August 2015.\n\n\n=== The Barn (Museet p\u00e5 L\u00e5ven) ===\nThe collections on display in the Barn are divided in two parts:\n\nInstruments mainly associated with western classical and popular music over four centuries. A Kirkman harpsichord of 1767, an Erberle viola d\u2019amore of 1755, a five-octave Stein piano of 1783, a soprano saxophone by Sax (son) of 1907, along wide early electronic instruments and a 1948 jukebox.\nFolk instruments from all around the world, including a Runebomme (a type of Sami drum), a Tibetan zang-dang (horn), a nadomo (arched harp) from Congo and hardanger fiddles.\n\n\n== Ringve Botanical Garden ==\n\nThe Ringve Botanical Garden was established in 1973. The botanic garden has three main parts, the 19th-century garden, the arboretum, and the systematic section. The 32-acre (130,000 m2) botanical gardens consist of an arboretum (species from the Northern hemisphere) around a lake, a floral maze representing a systematic presentation of perennial plants, a Renaissance (herbal) Garden and, in front of the Manor House the historical \u2018English\u2019 garden of the 1800s.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Norway\nList of music museums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Other sources ==\nGuldahl A.S., Guttormsen S., Kjeldsberg P.A., Krouth\u00e9n M.

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway. Today the bunker houses various archives, among them the city archives, the university and state archives. More recently, DORA has been used as a concert venue.\nKristiansten Fortress, built 1681\u20131684, is located on a hill east in Trondheim. It repelled the invading Swedes in 1718, but was decommissioned in 1816 by Crown Prince Regent Charles John.\nA statue of Olav Tryggvason, the founder of Trondheim, is located in the city's central square, mounted on top of an obelisk. The statue base is also a sun dial, but it is calibrated to UTC+1 so that the reading is inaccurate by one hour in the summer.\nThe islet Munkholmen is a popular tourist attraction and recreation site. The islet has served as a place of execution, a monastery, a fortress, prison, and a Second World War anti-aircraft gun station.\nStiftsg\u00e5rden is the royal residence in Trondheim, originally constructed in 1774 by Cecilie Christine Sch\u00f8ller. At 140 rooms constituting 4,000 square metres (43,056 sq ft), it is possibly the largest wooden building in Northern Europe, and has been used by royals and their guests since 1800.\nA statue of Leif Ericson is located at the seaside, close to the old Customs Building, the cruise ship facilities and the new swimming hall. The statue is a replica, the original being located at a Seattle marina.\n\n\n=== Nidaros Cathedral ===\n\nThe Nidaros Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace are located side by side in the middle of the city centre. The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral. On 24 May 2002, their daughter Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise married the writer Ari Behn in the cathedral.The Pilgrim's Route (Pilegrimsleden) to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at Nidaros Cathedral, has recently been re-instated. Also known as St. Olav's Way, (Sankt Olavs vei), the main route, which is approximately 640 kilometres (400 mi) long, starts in Oslo and heads North, along Lake Mj\u00f8sa, up the valley Gudbrandsdalen, over the mountain range Dovrefjell and down the Oppdal valley to end at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to pilgrims and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the aegis of the cathedral, which awards certificates to successful pilgrims upon the completion of their journey.\n\n\n=== Other churches ===\nThe Lutheran Church of Norway has 21 churches within the municipality of Trondheim. They are all a part of the Diocese of Nidaros, which is based in Trondheim at the Nidaros Cathedral. Many of the churches are several hundred years old, with a couple which were built almost 1,000 years ago.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Sankt Olav domkirke is the cathedral episcopal see of the exempt Territorial Prelature of Trondheim.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe Trondheim Art Museum has Norway's third largest public art collection, mainly Norwegian art from the last 150 years. The National Museum of Decorative Arts boasts a large collection of decorative arts and design, including a great number of tapestries from the Norwegian tapestry artist Hannah Ryggen, as well as Norway's only permanent exhibibition of Japanese arts and crafts. Sverresborg, also named Zion after King David's castle in Jerusalem, was a fortification built by Sverre Sigurdsson. It is now an open-air museum, consisting of more than 60 buildings. The castle was originally built in 1182\u20131183, but did not last for long as it was burned down in 1188. However, the Sverresaga indicates it had been restored by 1197.The Trondheim Science Center (Norwegian: Vitensenteret i Trondheim) is a scientific hands-on experience center. The NTNU University Museum (Norwegian: NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet) is part of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. There are also a variety of small history, science and natural history museums, such as the Trondheim Maritime Museum, the Armoury, adjacent to the Archbishops's Palace, Kristiansten Fortress, the music and musical instrument museum Ringve National Museum, Ringve Botanical Garden, the Trondheim Tramway Museum, and the Jewish Museum, co-located with the city's synagogue, which is among the northernmost in the world.\nRockheim (Norwegian: Det nasjonale opplevelsessenteret for pop og rock, The National Discovery Center for Pop and Rock) opened at the Pier in August 2010. It is located inside an old warehouse, but characterised by an easily recognisable roof in the shape of a box. \"The box\" is decorated by thousands of tiny lights that change in a variety of colours and patterns, and is a landmark in the cityscape - especially on dark winter evenings.\nKunsthall Trondheim was inaugurated at its permanent premises on Kongens gate in October 2016.\n\n\n=== Prison ===\nVollan District Jail (Norwegian: Vollan kretsfengsel) was a jail during the nazi occupation of Norway and was used to imprison both prisoners of war and criminals. Vollan was not considered a concentration camp. In a summary of prisoners of war in Norway, numerous prisoners were registered at Vollan. Once of its roles was as a transit camp for political prisoners. Many prisoners were taken from Vollan to Kristiansten Fortress and shot.

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway. Today the bunker houses various archives, among them the city archives, the university and state archives. More recently, DORA has been used as a concert venue.\nKristiansten Fortress, built 1681\u20131684, is located on a hill east in Trondheim. It repelled the invading Swedes in 1718, but was decommissioned in 1816 by Crown Prince Regent Charles John.\nA statue of Olav Tryggvason, the founder of Trondheim, is located in the city's central square, mounted on top of an obelisk. The statue base is also a sun dial, but it is calibrated to UTC+1 so that the reading is inaccurate by one hour in the summer.\nThe islet Munkholmen is a popular tourist attraction and recreation site. The islet has served as a place of execution, a monastery, a fortress, prison, and a Second World War anti-aircraft gun station.\nStiftsg\u00e5rden is the royal residence in Trondheim, originally constructed in 1774 by Cecilie Christine Sch\u00f8ller. At 140 rooms constituting 4,000 square metres (43,056 sq ft), it is possibly the largest wooden building in Northern Europe, and has been used by royals and their guests since 1800.\nA statue of Leif Ericson is located at the seaside, close to the old Customs Building, the cruise ship facilities and the new swimming hall. The statue is a replica, the original being located at a Seattle marina.\n\n\n=== Nidaros Cathedral ===\n\nThe Nidaros Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace are located side by side in the middle of the city centre. The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral. On 24 May 2002, their daughter Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise married the writer Ari Behn in the cathedral.The Pilgrim's Route (Pilegrimsleden) to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at Nidaros Cathedral, has recently been re-instated. Also known as St. Olav's Way, (Sankt Olavs vei), the main route, which is approximately 640 kilometres (400 mi) long, starts in Oslo and heads North, along Lake Mj\u00f8sa, up the valley Gudbrandsdalen, over the mountain range Dovrefjell and down the Oppdal valley to end at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim.

        "wiki": "Rockheim (also called Det nasjonale opplevelsessenteret for pop og rock, The National Discovery Centre for Pop and Rock, and Det nasjonale museet for popul\u00e6rmusikk, The National Museum for Popular Music) is Norway's national museum for popular music from the 1950s to the present. It is a division of Museene i S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag (S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag Museums) and is housed in a former grain warehouse in Trondheim. It opened in 2010; since 2013, the director has been Sissel Guttormsen. The museum also has a virtual presence, Virtuelle Rockheim, which launched in 2009, and since 2011 musicians and groups have been chosen for the Rockheim Hall of Fame.\n\n\n== History and administration ==\nThe idea for the museum goes back to 1998; the Ministry of Culture began planning eight years later and in 2007 Bratter\u00f8kaia AS won the commission to create it. It was to have opened in 2009, but completion of the building was delayed by a contractor bankruptcy and a fire. It officially opened on 5 August 2010.Rockheim is housed in a 1919 grain warehouse in Trondheim. To roughly double the space available, a new sixth floor was added in the form of a cantilevered 'box', which is clad in glass decorated with reproductions of album covers and with changeable back-lighting provided by 13,000 individually controllable LEDs; the public can affect the colours by using cellphones. A \"black box\" building for performances was also added; the design envisaged this being covered by climbing plants. The architects for the conversion were Pir II and for the grounds, Agraff AS. The conversion was awarded the City of Trondheim's 2010 building award. The building has 400 square metres (4,300 sq ft) of floor space, of which half is exhibit space. The building and installations cost 300 million kroner.\nThe museum is a division of Museene i S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag. It was headed by Arvid Esper\u00f8 during planning and construction and until 2011, when Petter Myhr became the director; he was succeeded in 2013 by Sissel Guttormsen.\n\n\n== Permanent and virtual exhibits ==\nThe primary mission of the museum is to preserve and document Norwegian popular music. The permanent exhibit, for which the lead designer was Canadian Stacey Spiegel, takes the form of a journey through Norwegian music and cultural history from the 1950s to the present. It occupies 320 square metres (3,400 sq ft) in the building's top-floor box, and devotes a room to each decade. The exhibition has many interactive components. Visitors first encounter an interactive map of Norway, can select the videos shown in each room, and there are three discovery rooms: in the Ronni Room they can try playing guitar with guidance from Ronni Le Tekr\u00f8, and in the Hiphop Room they can experiment with DJing, graffiti art and breakdancing. In Virtuelle Rockheim, launched on 21 August 2009, they can manipulate an avatar to explore a selection of the exhibits in 3D. Spiegel, who also designed the virtual museum, predicted in 2008 that Rockheim would be \"the world's most technically sophisticated virtual museum\"; it was Norway's first online museum.\n\n\n== Temporary exhibitions ==\nThe museum opened with a temporary exhibition of photographs by Robert Meyer titled Icons of the 60's. Other temporary exhibitions have been Jukeboks! (jukebox), Wenches Verden (on Wenche Myhre), Innenfor/utenfor (inside/outside; photographs by Peter Beste) and Teigens Tivoli (on Jahn Teigen).\n\n\n== Hall of Fame ==\nThe Rockheim Hall of Fame honours individuals and groups for their contributions to Norwegian popular music. Inductees must have debuted at least 25 years before and are chosen annually by a jury. a-ha, \u00c5ge Aleksandersen, Jokke & Valentinerne, Wenche Myhre and Alf Pr\u00f8ysen were the first to be inducted, on 5 September 2011.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of music museums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Norwegian)\nOfficial website (English)\nVirtuelle Rockheim",

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades.

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019.

Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums.

The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway.

The statue is a replica, the original being located at a Seattle marina.\n\n\n=== Nidaros Cathedral ===\n\nThe Nidaros Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace are located side by side in the middle of the city centre. The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral. On 24 May 2002, their daughter Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise married the writer Ari Behn in the cathedral.The Pilgrim's Route (Pilegrimsleden) to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at Nidaros Cathedral, has recently been re-instated. Also known as St. Olav's Way, (Sankt Olavs vei), the main route, which is approximately 640 kilometres (400 mi) long, starts in Oslo and heads North, along Lake Mj\u00f8sa, up the valley Gudbrandsdalen, over the mountain range Dovrefjell and down the Oppdal valley to end at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to pilgrims and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the aegis of the cathedral, which awards certificates to successful pilgrims upon the completion of their journey.\n\n\n=== Other churches ===\nThe Lutheran Church of Norway has 21 churches within the municipality of Trondheim.

        "wiki": "Stiftsg\u00e5rden is the royal residence in Trondheim, Norway. It is centrally situated on the city\u2019s most important thoroughfare, Munkegaten. At 140 rooms constituting 4000 m\u00b2 (43000 ft\u00b2), it is possibly the largest wooden building in Northern Europe, and it has been used by royalty and their guests since 1800.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was built 1774\u20131778 for Cecilie Christine Sch\u00f8ller (1720\u20131786), the wealthy widow of Stie T\u00f8nsberg Sch\u00f8ller  \n(1700\u20131769), chamberlain and merchant in Trondheim. Through her mother she was descended from some of the most prominent noble families in Denmark. From her father, the army Commander in Chief of central Norway, she inherited a large property in the city centre. When she inherited her husband's large fortune, she commenced the construction of the largest private town house in Trondheim. In 1777 she was given the title of privy counselor. She is a representative of the cultural and commercial growth that Trondheim experienced in the late 18th century, and of the city's strong women in that period. She often traveled abroad and seldom used the palace herself before she died in Copenhagen in 1786.  The palace was constructed on the grounds of the former residence of her father, General Johan Friderich Fr\u00f8lich (1681\u20131757).\nDuring her absence abroad, her son-in-law General Georg Frederik Von Krogh (1732-1818) resided in the building. After her death, it was inherited by his son, Mrs. Sch\u00f8ller's grandson, and the General remained in residence there until it was sold to the state in 1800 for 10,000 rigsdaler. It was then used by the Governor of the region, as law courts and as a royal residence when the royal family visited Trondheim. The building also had several other functions; it housed the Bank of Norway in the period 1816\u20131819. In 1906 the palace became exclusively the royal residence in Trondheim.\nProminent guests resided there when in Trondheim. Thus, this location has been the place of residence in Trondheim for the Norwegian Royal Family since 1704. The first royal persons ever to visit the present building were Crown Prince Frederik and Princes Carl and Frederick of Hesse, who were the guests of General von Krogh in 1788.\n\n\n== Historic events ==\nStiftsg\u00e5rden has been the setting for the main festivities during the following coronations:\n\nKing Carl III Johan, 1818\nKing Carl IV and Queen Louise, 1860\nKing Oscar II and Queen Sofie, 1873\nKing Haakon VII and Queen Maud, 1906as well as during the following benedictions:\n\nKing Olav V, 1958\nKing Harald V and Queen Sonja, 1991Stiftsg\u00e5rden has also been the setting for many other royal visits \u2014 among others, the visits of the Norwegian regent and first king of independent Norway, Crown Prince Christian Frederik in 1814, King Carl III Johan in 1835, Crown Prince Carl in 1856, and in recent times King Harald V and Queen Sonja's 60th birthdays in 1997 and Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise's wedding in 2002.\n\n\n== Building ==\nThe architect of the building is not identified with certainty, but is assumed to have been Mrs. Sch\u00f8ller's cousin, Admiral Christian Lerche (1712\u201393). Many of the artisans and artists responsible for the interior decorations are also unknown. The palace is built in the Baroque style, but has elements of Rococo and neoclassicism. It has around 140 rooms constituting 4000 m\u00b2 (43000 ft\u00b2) and is probably the largest wooden palace in Northern Europe. A large part of the garden was separated as a public park in 1906. It was originally laid out in the Baroque style and contained both an orangery and an arbor.\nThe exterior is mostly in its original form. In 1841 some of the dormer windows were removed after a small fire, but those on the garden side are still in place. The orchestra annex by the ballroom was built for the planned coronation of King Oscar I in 1847. The original quarter pane windows were replaced in 1860. However, some of the original windows are still in place in the southern wing on the garden side.\nUnlike the exterior, the interior has changed significantly. The interior of the side wings has been extensively rearranged, and all the rooms in the building have been renovated several times. However, some original features are still present. The Rococo style stucco work was preserved on some of the ceilings and around the wall niches. The supraportes (panels above the doors)  are decorated with painted landscapes. Several of the original wall decorations are preserved, some with Chinoiseries. In the dining room, one can see paintings of cityscapes made after contemporary English copper engravings. The ceiling and the supraportes in the ballroom were painted in 1847, probably using drawings by architect Heinrich Ernst Schirmer who worked with the interiors at the Royal Palace in Oslo. The painted floors and ceilings in the other rooms are mostly from 1847 as well. The interior of the Queen\u2019s salon was designed for the coronation in 1906 by architect Ingvald Alstad.\n\n\n== Furnishings ==\nVery few furnishings from the 18th century have been preserved, except two Rococo style stoves from 1768. All the furniture was acquired in the 19th century and later. Most of it was acquired for the planned coronation of King Oscar I and Queen Josephine  in the 1840s and the coronation of King Haakon VII and Queen Maud in 1906. The many pieces of Biedermeier furniture were made in Trondheim in the 1840s. The Hepplewhite-style furniture in the Chinese Cabinet was acquired in Paris for the coronation in 1906. The King\u2019s Study is furnished with a set of Chippendale-style furniture designed by architect Axel Guldahl and crafted by cabinet maker A. Kvenild for the same occasion. The furniture of the Queen\u2019s salon was created in the style of Louis XVI by Edvard R\u00f8hmen in Trondheim.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Other sources ==\nAndersen, Eystein M.(2006) Stiftsg\u00e5rden - Det kongelige pal\u00e9 i Trondheim (Andrimne Forlag, Oslo) ISBN 82-92546-10-3.\nRogner\u00f8d, Dag-Ivar(1997) P\u00e5 historisk grunn - En kulturhistorisk reise til statlige eiendommer (Orfeus Forlag, Oslo) ISBN 82-467-0011-1.\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Stiftsg\u00e5rden, Trondheim at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "Bymarka is a large park and nature reserve on the west side of the city of Trondheim in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway.\n\n\n== Location and use ==\n\nBymarka is situated to the west of the city center and has an area of 80 square kilometres (31 sq mi), with more than 200 kilometres (120 mi) of walking tracks. Bymarka is very popular for cross-country skiing in the winter, and for walks, hiking or jogging in the summer. There is a golf course on the fringe near the city. Bymarka borders the By\u00e5sen district, and can be reached by the Gr\u00e5kall Line tram line or by car.\n\n\n== Forests and habitats ==\n\nThe elevation in Bymarka is from 200 to 565 metres (656 to 1,854 ft) above sea level, except in the hilly northern part, which reaches down to the Trondheimsfjord. There are more than 10 lakes, and many bogs. However, Bymarka is largely covered with forest, much of it planted between the years 1870 and 1940. Some non-native trees were planted, such as European Larch and Douglas fir, and there is also Sycamore maple and European ash at the lowest elevations. The most common tree species are the native Norway spruce, Scots pine and Downy birch. Storheia, Bosbergheia, and Gr\u00e5kallen are mountains that reach above the treeline (which is at approx 500 metres (1,600 ft) above sea level) and have some alpine vegetation. As there are no higher mountains nearby, there is a nice view over Trondheim, the fjord, and mountain ranges including Trollheimen to the south and Sylane (which is partly in Sweden) to the east.\n\nPart of the northern area of Bymarka is protected and preserved as a nature reserve, stretching from an elevation of around 450 metres (1,480 ft) near Herbernheia and northwards down towards the fjord. This reserve therefore includes several vegetation zones: North boreal (above 400 metres (1,300 ft) above sea level), middle boreal (200 to 400 metres (660 to 1,310 ft), the most common in Bymarka) and southern boreal (below 200 metres (660 ft)), the latter zone is rare among protected areas as it is heavily used for farming in Norway. The lowland on the southern (Gaulosen) and western (Byneset) fringes of Bymarka contains areas of more southern hemiboreal vegetation. One of these locations has an especially rich understory, and has traditionally been used by the locals for collecting plants believed to have medical properties, hence the name Apoteket (The Pharmacy).\n\n\n== Fauna ==\nMoose, red fox, hare and squirrel are the most common animals, but there are also healthy populations of roe deer, beaver, badger and also some otters. As of spring 2006, even one wolverine has been verified as living in Bymarka, which is rare, as this elusive predator usually stays in the higher mountains, far from any cities. There are trout in many lakes, and a rich bird life.\n\n\n== References ==",

The plans were met by opposition from locals, and by the early 1980s the plan was shelved, even thought the city's environmental council had approved depopulating the neighborhood in 1974.\n\n\n== Media gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Bakklandet at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades.

        "wiki": "Nidelva is a river in Trondheim Municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. The name of the 30-kilometre (19 mi) long river translates to \"the River Nid\" since the suffix elva or elven is the Norwegian word for \"river\".\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe Nidelva starts at the Hyttfossen waterfall which rises from Bj\u00f8rsj\u00f8en, a small lake located just below Selbusj\u00f8en, the largest lake in the southern part of Tr\u00f8ndelag County. The Nidelva runs north through Kl\u00e6bu, then to Tiller, and then through the city of Trondheim before reaching Trondheimsfjord by the island of Bratt\u00f8ra near Trondheim Central Station. The Nidelva is at its deepest at the Trongfossen, a deep ravine in the village of Kl\u00e6bu. There are six hydro-electric power stations along the river. The Nidelva forms the last part of the Nea-Nidelvvassdraget watershed. The Nea River is a tributary which empties into Selbusj\u00f8en, which in turn flows into the Nidelva.The popular Norwegian waltz, Nidelven Stille og Vakker du er (\"Nidelven quiet and beautiful you are\"), was  written by composer Oskar Hodd\u00f8 (1916\u20131943). According to tradition, Hodd\u00f8 wrote the waltz about the Nidelva River one night in late April 1940 while he was standing at Gamle Bybro in Trondheim.\n\n\n== Media gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Other sources ===\n\u00d8ksendal, Asbj\u00f8rn (1969).

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway. Today the bunker houses various archives, among them the city archives, the university and state archives. More recently, DORA has been used as a concert venue.\nKristiansten Fortress, built 1681\u20131684, is located on a hill east in Trondheim.

The statue is a replica, the original being located at a Seattle marina.\n\n\n=== Nidaros Cathedral ===\n\nThe Nidaros Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace are located side by side in the middle of the city centre. The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral. On 24 May 2002, their daughter Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise married the writer Ari Behn in the cathedral.The Pilgrim's Route (Pilegrimsleden) to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at Nidaros Cathedral, has recently been re-instated. Also known as St. Olav's Way, (Sankt Olavs vei), the main route, which is approximately 640 kilometres (400 mi) long, starts in Oslo and heads North, along Lake Mj\u00f8sa, up the valley Gudbrandsdalen, over the mountain range Dovrefjell and down the Oppdal valley to end at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to pilgrims and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the aegis of the cathedral, which awards certificates to successful pilgrims upon the completion of their journey.\n\n\n=== Other churches ===\nThe Lutheran Church of Norway has 21 churches within the municipality of Trondheim. They are all a part of the Diocese of Nidaros, which is based in Trondheim at the Nidaros Cathedral.

It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway.

The statue is a replica, the original being located at a Seattle marina.\n\n\n=== Nidaros Cathedral ===\n\nThe Nidaros Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace are located side by side in the middle of the city centre. The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral. On 24 May 2002, their daughter Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise married the writer Ari Behn in the cathedral.The Pilgrim's Route (Pilegrimsleden) to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at Nidaros Cathedral, has recently been re-instated. Also known as St. Olav's Way, (Sankt Olavs vei), the main route, which is approximately 640 kilometres (400 mi) long, starts in Oslo and heads North, along Lake Mj\u00f8sa, up the valley Gudbrandsdalen, over the mountain range Dovrefjell and down the Oppdal valley to end at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to pilgrims and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the aegis of the cathedral, which awards certificates to successful pilgrims upon the completion of their journey.\n\n\n=== Other churches ===\nThe Lutheran Church of Norway has 21 churches within the municipality of Trondheim. They are all a part of the Diocese of Nidaros, which is based in Trondheim at the Nidaros Cathedral.

The Nattbus has other prices than ordinary buses. The European route E6 highway passes through the city centre of Trondheim in addition to a motorway bypass along the eastern rim of the city.\n\n\n== Twin towns and sister cities ==\n\nTrondheim is twinned with:\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nKristofer Hivju, actor\nHjalmar \"Hjallis\" Andersen, Olympic skater\nPetter Northug, cross-country skier\nLiv Ullman, actress and director\nKnut Glomsaas, musician\nH\u00e5kon Karlsen, journalist\nAtle Kv\u00e5lsvoll, cyclist and coach\nIdun Reiten, mathematician\nArve Tellefsen, violinist\nDiesel Dahl, drummer\nEmil Weber Meek, mixed martial artist, former welterweight champion with Venator Fighting Championship\nMerethe Tr\u00f8an, singer\nHilchen Sommerschild, educator\nThomas Bergersen, composer\nSander Sagosen, handball player\nThoning Owesen, landowner and philanthropist\nJohannes H\u00f8sflot Kl\u00e6bo, cross-country skier\nTorstein Horgmo, snowboarder\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of mayors of Trondheim\nTyholt Tower\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMunicipality website (in Norwegian)\nTrondheim.no, Trondheim's official website in Norwegian\nand Trondheim.com, Trondheim's official website in English\nVisit Trondheim\n Trondheim travel guide from Wikivoyage",

        "wiki": "Munkholmen (Norwegian: Monk's islet) is an islet in the municipality of Trondheim in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway.  The 13,000-square-metre (3.2-acre) island sits in the Trondheimsfjord about 1.3 kilometres (0.81 mi) northwest of the island of Bratt\u00f8ra and the mouth of the river Nidelva in the center of the city of Trondheim.  The islet has served as a place of execution, a monastery, a fortress, a prison, and a World War II anti-aircraft gun station. Today, Munkholmen is a popular tourist attraction and recreation site. \n\n\n== History ==\nIn the years prior to the founding of the city of Trondheim in 997 by King Olav Tryggvason, Munkholmen had been used as an execution site by the Jarls of Lade.  The arrival of Olav Tryggvason to Norway in 995 coincided with a revolt against Haakon Sigurdsson, who was killed by Tormod Kark.  The severed heads of both Haakon and Kark were placed on stakes on Munkholmen facing out into the fjord to serve as a warning to visitors. The tradition of displaying the severed heads of criminals and political opponents was continued for some time, but the heads were now placed so that they faced the city of Trondheim to deter its citizens from committing crimes.\n\n\n=== Nidarholm Abbey ===\nThe term Munkholmen was not originally in common usage. Rather, the site was known as the location of the monastery at Nidarholm. In the early 12th century, and possibly even earlier, Benedictine monks lived on the island in Nidarholm Abbey. The monastery burned down three times during the Middle Ages, the last time in 1531.  By the time that Lutheran Protestantism came to Trondheim, the buildings had fallen into decay and the former monastery came under the ownership of the royal estate in Trondheim. The monastery buildings disappeared during the 17th century as Munkholmen was fortified.\n\n\n=== Fort and prison ===\nConstruction of a fort on the island began in 1658 following the Swedish siege of Trondheim during the Dano-Swedish War in 1658-1660.  When it was completed in 1661, the fort was also used as a state prison for society's rejects.  Count Peder Griffenfeld, Munkholmen's most famous prisoner, was transferred from the fortress of Copenhagen in 1671. Griffenfeld was kept at Munkholmen for 18 years, after which he was released, having contracted a terminal illness. From 1700 to 1704, the commander of the fort was Major Curt Christoph von Koppelow. The fort remained in operation until 1893.\n\n\n=== German occupation ===\nNazi Germany invaded and occupied Norway in 1940.  After capturing Trondheim early on in the Norwegian Campaign, the Germans quickly established a submarine base, exploiting the natural protection provided by the fjord.  At this time, Munkholmen was fitted with anti-aircraft weaponry.  A large portion of the fort was retrofitted to hold ammunition, and the flooring planks were nailed in with wooden nails to prevent explosions caused by soldiers' boots striking metal nails. The German occupying forces remained in Norway until the end of the war in Europe in May 1945.  Remnants of the installation still exist in the upper levels of the fort.\n\n\n== Media gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Tourism and recreation ==\nToday, Munkholmen is a popular summertime tourist attraction and hangout for residents of Trondheim.  From May to September, boats depart from Ravnkloa on a regular basis.  Once on the island, visitors can take a guided tour (in English and Norwegian) or roam freely.  There's also a small cafe/restaurant available.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMunkholmen website",

It is the first and only bicycle lift in the world.In 2013 it was upgraded and rebranded under the name Cyclocable by Skirail, part of the Poma group.\n\n\n== Usage ==\nThe use of Trampe is free.When using the lift, the right foot is placed on the starting point (the left foot stays on the bicycle pedal). After pushing the start button, the user is pushed forward and a footplate emerges. A common mistake among tourists and other first-time users is that they don't keep their right leg outstretched and their body tilted forward. This makes it hard to maintain balance on the footplate, and can result in falling off.\nIn the summer months, Trampe is used extensively by both commuting inhabitants of Trondheim and tourists.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nVideo of the lift in operation on YouTube",

        "wiki": "Trondheim Central Station (Norwegian: Trondheim sentralstasjon) or Trondheim S is the main railway station serving the city of Trondheim, Norway. Located at Bratt\u00f8ra in the north part of the city centre, it is the terminus of the Dovre Line, running southwards, and the Nordland Line, which runs north. The railway is electrified south of the station but not north of it, so through trains must change locomotives at the station.\nVy serves the station with express trains to Oslo and Bod\u00f8, regional trains to R\u00f8ros and \u00d6stersund in Sweden, and the Tr\u00f8ndelag Commuter Rail. The Trondheim Bus Station located at the station serves all long-distance buses, and some city buses. From 1913 to 1968 the station was also the terminus for two lines of the Trondheim Tramway.\nTrondheim's first station, dating from 1864, was located at Kalvskinnet. In 1877 the current station was built to serve the Mer\u00e5ker Line to Sweden\u2014since integrated into the Nordland Line. At the same time a connection was built between the two stations, and the central station took over as the main station serving Trondheim. In 1910 construction of a new station for the Dovre Line was started, finishing in 1921. The main station building consists of an older section in historicism brick, while the annex is in postmodernistic concrete and glass.\n\n\n== Services ==\nTrain services are provided by the Norwegian State Railways both north- and southbound. Four services a day and one night train operate to Oslo Central Station, while there is one day and one night train to Bod\u00f8, with an additional afternoon departure to Mo i Rana. Two daily departures serve Sweden and \u00d6stersund as part of the Mittnabot\u00e5get service that connects Trondheim in Norway to Sundsvall in Sweden, in addition there are three services to R\u00f8ros, with connections onwards to \u00d8sterdalen. The most frequent service is the hourly Tr\u00f8ndelag Commuter Rail from Steinkjer via Trondheim Airport, V\u00e6rnes and Trondheim S to Lerkendal, with some extending to Oppdal.The station is manned, but also equipped with ticket machines. There are several kiosks and caf\u00e9s, as well as a car park, taxicabs, bicycle stands and baggage lockers. The station and platforms are wheelchair accessible, and a pre-booked escort service is available. Trafikanten Midt-Norge, which sells bus tickets and provides information on public transport routes in Tr\u00f8ndelag, can be found in the new section. The station is closed at night.The commuter trains serve other railway stations in neighborhoods in Trondheim; Heimdal, Selsbakk, Marienborg, Skansen to the south, and Lademoen/Nedre Elvehavn, Lilleby, Leangen and Rotvoll to the east.\n\n\n=== Connections to other modes of transport ===\n\n\n==== Buses ====\nIn 1995, the city bus station was moved from L\u00fcthenhaven close to the city's main square to the central station, with the opening of a new section to the station. The original building has been preserved by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage as a cultural heritage.Some city buses operated by Team Trafikk stop at the station; routes 2, 11, 19, 46, 47, 52, 54, 55, 63, 71, 73, 75, 76, 94. Munkegata Terminal remains the most important, with all buses stopping there. NOR-WAY Bussekspress operates coaches to Oslo via R\u00f8ros, Namsos and Bergen via F\u00f8rde. while Lavprisekspressen operates day and night expresses to Oslo. Gauldal Billag operates coaches to St\u00f8ren, Oppdal and R\u00f8ros, while Tr\u00f8nderBilene operates to Fosen, Orkanger, Agdenes and Snillfjord. Nettbuss operates coaches to Malvik, Stj\u00f8rdal, Mer\u00e5ker, Selbu, Tydal, Skaun, Melhus, Orkdal and Meldal, while Kl\u00e6buruten operates buses to Kl\u00e6bu and to the airport.\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nTrondheim S is located about ten minutes walk, or a two-minute bus ride, from Pirterminalen where Fosen Trafikklag operates passenger ferries across the fjord to Vanvikan, and out of the fjord to Brekstad, Sistranda and Kristiansund.\n\n\n==== Trams ====\nBetween 1913 and 1968 the station was the terminus for the Trondheim Tramway on the Elgeseter Line (no. 2) and Singsaker Line (no. 3). In 2005 plans to extend the only current line, the Gr\u00e5kallen Line, from the St. Olavs gate via Trondheim S to Pirterminalen were launched.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Two stations ===\n\nThe first railway station to be built in Trondheim was located at Kalvskinnet, to serve the narrow gauge Trondhjem\u2013St\u00f8ren Line railway that was completed in 1864. The station was designed by Georg Andreas Bull, and still exists as a synagogue. In 1877 the state and city made an agreement to build a new station at Bratt\u00f8ra to serve the new Mer\u00e5ker Line that was being built to Sweden. Bratt\u00f8ra was chosen because it was located directly beside the port, and would allow direct transshipment from ships to the railway of both goods and passengers. The station would become the main station for both railways; this caused a major protest among the local population, who felt it was necessary to have two terminal stations, one for each line, and the city brought the matter before the courts\u2014the case was settled in 1895 in favor of one station. The lack of planning and coordination between the two lines made the new station a large budget cost for the Mer\u00e5ker Line; and described as one of few exceptions to the small-and-cheap policy dominating the state railways i Norway at the time.\n\nTwo lots were sold to the state railways from the city, allowing the building of two station buildings, the eastern cargo building for the Mer\u00e5ker Line and the western for R\u00f8ros Line. The main station in the east served all passenger trains, and was designed by the architect Balthazar Lange. A new route for R\u00f8ros Line was built from Sluppen to Skansen, along the west side of Nidelva, and the old station taken into disuse after the R\u00f8ros Line reached the central station on 24 June 1884. To solve the challenge of the break-of-gauge, the entire station area had dual gauge with both 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1\u20442 in) and 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in).The station at Bratt\u00f8ra has had four names, following the name changes of the city. It was opened as Throndhjem, changed in 1894 to Trondhjem, on 1 January 1930 to Nidaros and to Trondheim on 6 March 1931. The station at Bratt\u00f8ra is physically divided in two parts by the bridge over Ravnkloa. From 1884, the western part was officially called Throndhjem V and the eastern part Throndhjem \u00d8. The freight station for the R\u00f8ros Line was located at Throndhjem V, while the passenger station for both lines was located at Throndhjem \u00d8, just like today. While there were two stations in 1882\u201384, they were 'probably' referred to as Bratt\u00f8ra and Kalvskinnet.\nOn 23 April 1888 a landslide hit the station, with 180 metres (590 ft) of track\u2014three wide and including the main R\u00f8rosbanen line\u2014was washed into the sea. The slide was caused by the seabed sinking about seven meters, and it was followed by several smaller slides.\n\n\n=== The Dovre Line arrives ===\n\nIn 1910, the Parliament of Norway announced a competition for the redesign of the station since it had been decided that the Dovre Line would be built to Trondheim, including the line from St\u00f8ren to Trondheim being converted to standard gauge. On 18 August 1913 construction of a new station and port was started. Traffic had increased to the limits of capacity; there were too few tracks and too small cargo buildings. By 1912 some freight cars were stopping at Hommelvik and Storlien; a counting showed 900 cars at the station. The construction removed a gap filled by the canal between the two stations\u2014filling up the canal in the process. Instead the 92 metres (302 ft) Skansen Bridge was built on the west side of the station, along with a double track to Marienborg where the new depot would be located. The main station building designed by Lange remained the passenger and administration building, with the conversion of the smaller, western one into cargo facilities.The amount of trackage for cargo was increased, with a wide section of land mass being filled into the sea to create a larger rail and port facility at Bratt\u00f8ra, though the filling of a large part of the seabed to create artificial land. The railways allowed the transshipment of cargo from ships from Northern Norway to rail, as well as from rail from Central Sweden to ships to the British Isles. The port was supplemented by a new line to Ilsvika would allow the loading of ore there. The suggestion to build double track to Leangen was dropped.While the original plans for the Dovre Line involved completion in 1916, it was not until 1921 the first train could travel from Oslo to Trondheim via Dovre, mostly due to the First World War. The new depot opened in 1916, and in 1917 the double track and dual gauge to Marienborg as well as the new freight terminal was finished. Instead of using one track for each direction on the double track, the Dovre Line would use the one line while the other would be used for transport from the station to the depot. Skansen Bridge opened on 22 March 1918. In 1922, Norsk Spisevognselskap established a kiosk, and on 1 October 1925, they took over the station restaurant.The main building designed by Lange is in historicism and was originally built in two stories in brick. A third was added in the 1950s, some with some of the original feel being lost in the addition, since it was not stylistically true. In 1965 two annexes were built, one on each side and in two stories. The western was used for offices and the other as part of the waiting area\u2014these were both in line with the historicist style. They replaced a cargo expedition and a restaurant building, respectively. In 1995 the bus station was moved from the city center at Le\u00fcthenhaven to the central station, and the eastern annex was razed in favor of a postmodernistic glass and concrete building. In addition to the bus station it features and extension of the waiting area, offices, a restaurant and a parking lot.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nAspenberg, Nils Carl (1995).

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway.

The statue is a replica, the original being located at a Seattle marina.\n\n\n=== Nidaros Cathedral ===\n\nThe Nidaros Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace are located side by side in the middle of the city centre. The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral. On 24 May 2002, their daughter Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise married the writer Ari Behn in the cathedral.The Pilgrim's Route (Pilegrimsleden) to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at Nidaros Cathedral, has recently been re-instated. Also known as St. Olav's Way, (Sankt Olavs vei), the main route, which is approximately 640 kilometres (400 mi) long, starts in Oslo and heads North, along Lake Mj\u00f8sa, up the valley Gudbrandsdalen, over the mountain range Dovrefjell and down the Oppdal valley to end at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to pilgrims and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the aegis of the cathedral, which awards certificates to successful pilgrims upon the completion of their journey.\n\n\n=== Other churches ===\nThe Lutheran Church of Norway has 21 churches within the municipality of Trondheim. They are all a part of the Diocese of Nidaros, which is based in Trondheim at the Nidaros Cathedral.

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway.

The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral. On 24 May 2002, their daughter Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise married the writer Ari Behn in the cathedral.The Pilgrim's Route (Pilegrimsleden) to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at Nidaros Cathedral, has recently been re-instated.

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway. Today the bunker houses various archives, among them the city archives, the university and state archives. More recently, DORA has been used as a concert venue.\nKristiansten Fortress, built 1681\u20131684, is located on a hill east in Trondheim. It repelled the invading Swedes in 1718, but was decommissioned in 1816 by Crown Prince Regent Charles John.\nA statue of Olav Tryggvason, the founder of Trondheim, is located in the city's central square, mounted on top of an obelisk. The statue base is also a sun dial, but it is calibrated to UTC+1 so that the reading is inaccurate by one hour in the summer.\nThe islet Munkholmen is a popular tourist attraction and recreation site. The islet has served as a place of execution, a monastery, a fortress, prison, and a Second World War anti-aircraft gun station.\nStiftsg\u00e5rden is the royal residence in Trondheim, originally constructed in 1774 by Cecilie Christine Sch\u00f8ller. At 140 rooms constituting 4,000 square metres (43,056 sq ft), it is possibly the largest wooden building in Northern Europe, and has been used by royals and their guests since 1800.\nA statue of Leif Ericson is located at the seaside, close to the old Customs Building, the cruise ship facilities and the new swimming hall. The statue is a replica, the original being located at a Seattle marina.\n\n\n=== Nidaros Cathedral ===\n\nThe Nidaros Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace are located side by side in the middle of the city centre. The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral. On 24 May 2002, their daughter Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise married the writer Ari Behn in the cathedral.The Pilgrim's Route (Pilegrimsleden) to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at Nidaros Cathedral, has recently been re-instated. Also known as St. Olav's Way, (Sankt Olavs vei), the main route, which is approximately 640 kilometres (400 mi) long, starts in Oslo and heads North, along Lake Mj\u00f8sa, up the valley Gudbrandsdalen, over the mountain range Dovrefjell and down the Oppdal valley to end at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to pilgrims and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the aegis of the cathedral, which awards certificates to successful pilgrims upon the completion of their journey.\n\n\n=== Other churches ===\nThe Lutheran Church of Norway has 21 churches within the municipality of Trondheim. They are all a part of the Diocese of Nidaros, which is based in Trondheim at the Nidaros Cathedral. Many of the churches are several hundred years old, with a couple which were built almost 1,000 years ago.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Sankt Olav domkirke is the cathedral episcopal see of the exempt Territorial Prelature of Trondheim.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe Trondheim Art Museum has Norway's third largest public art collection, mainly Norwegian art from the last 150 years. The National Museum of Decorative Arts boasts a large collection of decorative arts and design, including a great number of tapestries from the Norwegian tapestry artist Hannah Ryggen, as well as Norway's only permanent exhibibition of Japanese arts and crafts. Sverresborg, also named Zion after King David's castle in Jerusalem, was a fortification built by Sverre Sigurdsson. It is now an open-air museum, consisting of more than 60 buildings. The castle was originally built in 1182\u20131183, but did not last for long as it was burned down in 1188. However, the Sverresaga indicates it had been restored by 1197.The Trondheim Science Center (Norwegian: Vitensenteret i Trondheim) is a scientific hands-on experience center. The NTNU University Museum (Norwegian: NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet) is part of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. There are also a variety of small history, science and natural history museums, such as the Trondheim Maritime Museum, the Armoury, adjacent to the Archbishops's Palace, Kristiansten Fortress, the music and musical instrument museum Ringve National Museum, Ringve Botanical Garden, the Trondheim Tramway Museum, and the Jewish Museum, co-located with the city's synagogue, which is among the northernmost in the world.\nRockheim (Norwegian: Det nasjonale opplevelsessenteret for pop og rock, The National Discovery Center for Pop and Rock) opened at the Pier in August 2010. It is located inside an old warehouse, but characterised by an easily recognisable roof in the shape of a box. \"The box\" is decorated by thousands of tiny lights that change in a variety of colours and patterns, and is a landmark in the cityscape - especially on dark winter evenings.\nKunsthall Trondheim was inaugurated at its permanent premises on Kongens gate in October 2016.\n\n\n=== Prison ===\nVollan District Jail (Norwegian: Vollan kretsfengsel) was a jail during the nazi occupation of Norway and was used to imprison both prisoners of war and criminals. Vollan was not considered a concentration camp. In a summary of prisoners of war in Norway, numerous prisoners were registered at Vollan. Once of its roles was as a transit camp for political prisoners. Many prisoners were taken from Vollan to Kristiansten Fortress and shot. The prisoners at Vollan were interrogated at the Mission Hotel in Trondheim.  Some were also interrogated by Henry Rinnan and his gang. It was closed in 1971 after the opening of Trondheim Prison at Tunga.\nTrondheim Prison (Norwegian: Trondheim fengsel) is a prison that belongs to the Northern Region of the Norwegian Correctional Services.

Most noticeable is Studentersamfundet i Trondhjem, the city's student society. Its characteristic round, red building from 1929 sits at the head of the bridge crossing the river southwards from the city centre. As the largest university in Norway, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) is the host of some 36,000 students.Student culture in Trondheim is characterised by a long-standing tradition of volunteer work. The student society is for example run by more than 1,200 volunteers. NTNUI, Norway's largest sports club, is among the other volunteer organisations that dominate student culture in Trondheim. Students in Trondheim are also behind two major Norwegian culture festivals, UKA and The International Student Festival in Trondheim (ISFiT). NTNU lists over 200 student organisations with registered web pages on its servers alone.\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nTrondheim culture is parodied on the Monty Python album Another Monty Python Record in the form of the fictitious Trondheim Hammer Dance.Trondheim is also a key location in the Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun universe, as it is a critical battleground for both factions.\nTrondheim was the name of a planet in the Hundred Worlds of the Ender's Game book series.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nTrondheim has an international airport, Trondheim Airport, V\u00e6rnes, situated in Stj\u00f8rdal, which is Norway's fourth largest airport in terms of passenger traffic. V\u00e6rnes has non-stop connections to cities such as London, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and Stockholm, among others. The domestic route Trondheim - Oslo is among the busiest air routes in Europe with around 2 million passengers annually.\n\nMajor railway connections are the northbound Nordland Line, the eastbound Mer\u00e5ker Line to \u00c5re and \u00d6stersund in Sweden, and two southbound connections to Oslo, the R\u00f8ros Line and Dovre Line.\nThe Coastal Express ships (Hurtigruten: Covering the Bergen\u2013Kirkenes stretch of the coast) call at Trondheim, as do many cruise ships during the summer season. Since 1994 there is also a fast commuter boat service to Kristiansund, the closest coastal city to the southwest. Every morning the Hurtigruten ships have one southbound and one northbound arrival and departure in Trondheim.\nA car ferry route from the port of Flakk in the northwest of the municipality, connects Trondheim with Fosen. Various bridge projects over the Trondheim Fjord to replace the ferry have been planned, but none have begun construction.\nTrondheim also boasts the northernmost (since closure of Arkhangelsk tram in 2004) tramway line in the world: the Gr\u00e5kallen Line, the last remaining segment of the Trondheim Tramway, is an 8.8 kilometres (5.5 mi) route (which is mostly single-track outside the innermost parts of the city; except the stretch between Breidablikk and Nordre Hoem stations) which runs from the city centre, through the By\u00e5sen district, and up to Lian, in the large recreation area Bymarka. Trondheim boasts the world's only bicycle lift, Trampe.\nThe bus network, operated by AtB, runs throughout most of the city and its suburbs. A new metro line system went public August 3, 2019. The new transportation system covers the Trondheim area (Trondheim, Malvik, and Melhus). The three metro lines and the city lines that link the city across.

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway. Today the bunker houses various archives, among them the city archives, the university and state archives. More recently, DORA has been used as a concert venue.\nKristiansten Fortress, built 1681\u20131684, is located on a hill east in Trondheim. It repelled the invading Swedes in 1718, but was decommissioned in 1816 by Crown Prince Regent Charles John.\nA statue of Olav Tryggvason, the founder of Trondheim, is located in the city's central square, mounted on top of an obelisk. The statue base is also a sun dial, but it is calibrated to UTC+1 so that the reading is inaccurate by one hour in the summer.\nThe islet Munkholmen is a popular tourist attraction and recreation site. The islet has served as a place of execution, a monastery, a fortress, prison, and a Second World War anti-aircraft gun station.\nStiftsg\u00e5rden is the royal residence in Trondheim, originally constructed in 1774 by Cecilie Christine Sch\u00f8ller. At 140 rooms constituting 4,000 square metres (43,056 sq ft), it is possibly the largest wooden building in Northern Europe, and has been used by royals and their guests since 1800.\nA statue of Leif Ericson is located at the seaside, close to the old Customs Building, the cruise ship facilities and the new swimming hall. The statue is a replica, the original being located at a Seattle marina.\n\n\n=== Nidaros Cathedral ===\n\nThe Nidaros Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace are located side by side in the middle of the city centre. The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral. On 24 May 2002, their daughter Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise married the writer Ari Behn in the cathedral.The Pilgrim's Route (Pilegrimsleden) to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at Nidaros Cathedral, has recently been re-instated. Also known as St. Olav's Way, (Sankt Olavs vei), the main route, which is approximately 640 kilometres (400 mi) long, starts in Oslo and heads North, along Lake Mj\u00f8sa, up the valley Gudbrandsdalen, over the mountain range Dovrefjell and down the Oppdal valley to end at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to pilgrims and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the aegis of the cathedral, which awards certificates to successful pilgrims upon the completion of their journey.\n\n\n=== Other churches ===\nThe Lutheran Church of Norway has 21 churches within the municipality of Trondheim. They are all a part of the Diocese of Nidaros, which is based in Trondheim at the Nidaros Cathedral. Many of the churches are several hundred years old, with a couple which were built almost 1,000 years ago.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Sankt Olav domkirke is the cathedral episcopal see of the exempt Territorial Prelature of Trondheim.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe Trondheim Art Museum has Norway's third largest public art collection, mainly Norwegian art from the last 150 years. The National Museum of Decorative Arts boasts a large collection of decorative arts and design, including a great number of tapestries from the Norwegian tapestry artist Hannah Ryggen, as well as Norway's only permanent exhibibition of Japanese arts and crafts. Sverresborg, also named Zion after King David's castle in Jerusalem, was a fortification built by Sverre Sigurdsson. It is now an open-air museum, consisting of more than 60 buildings. The castle was originally built in 1182\u20131183, but did not last for long as it was burned down in 1188. However, the Sverresaga indicates it had been restored by 1197.The Trondheim Science Center (Norwegian: Vitensenteret i Trondheim) is a scientific hands-on experience center. The NTNU University Museum (Norwegian: NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet) is part of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. There are also a variety of small history, science and natural history museums, such as the Trondheim Maritime Museum, the Armoury, adjacent to the Archbishops's Palace, Kristiansten Fortress, the music and musical instrument museum Ringve National Museum, Ringve Botanical Garden, the Trondheim Tramway Museum, and the Jewish Museum, co-located with the city's synagogue, which is among the northernmost in the world.\nRockheim (Norwegian: Det nasjonale opplevelsessenteret for pop og rock, The National Discovery Center for Pop and Rock) opened at the Pier in August 2010. It is located inside an old warehouse, but characterised by an easily recognisable roof in the shape of a box. \"The box\" is decorated by thousands of tiny lights that change in a variety of colours and patterns, and is a landmark in the cityscape - especially on dark winter evenings.\nKunsthall Trondheim was inaugurated at its permanent premises on Kongens gate in October 2016.\n\n\n=== Prison ===\nVollan District Jail (Norwegian: Vollan kretsfengsel) was a jail during the nazi occupation of Norway and was used to imprison both prisoners of war and criminals. Vollan was not considered a concentration camp. In a summary of prisoners of war in Norway, numerous prisoners were registered at Vollan. Once of its roles was as a transit camp for political prisoners. Many prisoners were taken from Vollan to Kristiansten Fortress and shot. The prisoners at Vollan were interrogated at the Mission Hotel in Trondheim.  Some were also interrogated by Henry Rinnan and his gang. It was closed in 1971 after the opening of Trondheim Prison at Tunga.\nTrondheim Prison (Norwegian: Trondheim fengsel) is a prison that belongs to the Northern Region of the Norwegian Correctional Services.

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway. Today the bunker houses various archives, among them the city archives, the university and state archives. More recently, DORA has been used as a concert venue.\nKristiansten Fortress, built 1681\u20131684, is located on a hill east in Trondheim. It repelled the invading Swedes in 1718, but was decommissioned in 1816 by Crown Prince Regent Charles John.\nA statue of Olav Tryggvason, the founder of Trondheim, is located in the city's central square, mounted on top of an obelisk. The statue base is also a sun dial, but it is calibrated to UTC+1 so that the reading is inaccurate by one hour in the summer.\nThe islet Munkholmen is a popular tourist attraction and recreation site. The islet has served as a place of execution, a monastery, a fortress, prison, and a Second World War anti-aircraft gun station.\nStiftsg\u00e5rden is the royal residence in Trondheim, originally constructed in 1774 by Cecilie Christine Sch\u00f8ller. At 140 rooms constituting 4,000 square metres (43,056 sq ft), it is possibly the largest wooden building in Northern Europe, and has been used by royals and their guests since 1800.\nA statue of Leif Ericson is located at the seaside, close to the old Customs Building, the cruise ship facilities and the new swimming hall. The statue is a replica, the original being located at a Seattle marina.\n\n\n=== Nidaros Cathedral ===\n\nThe Nidaros Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace are located side by side in the middle of the city centre. The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral.

      "name": "Hegra Fortress",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Battle of Hegra Fortress was a 25-day engagement in the 1940 Norwegian Campaign which saw a small force of Norwegian volunteers fighting numerically superior German forces from a fortified position. After initial fighting around the Mer\u00e5ker Line railway line, the Norwegians pulled back into Hegra Fortress and held off further German attacks before surrendering on 5 May as one of the last Norwegian units active in southern Norway.\n\n\n== Opposing forces ==\n\n\n=== Norwegian force ===\nThe Norwegian defenders were 250 volunteer soldiers and the volunteer nurse Anne Margrethe Bang. Most of the volunteers that served at Hegra were from the area Hegra/Stj\u00f8rdal/Trondheim, but they also included three Swedes.The garrison at Hegra was equipped with small arms (Krag-J\u00f8rgensen rifles and carbines), as well as Madsen and Colt M/29 machine guns.\nThe fortress also had artillery, four 10.5 cm (4.13 in) and two 7.5 cm (2.95 in) positional pieces of reasonably modern make with gun shields; as well as four Krupp m/1887 8.4 cm (3.31 in) field guns. The artillery had a maximum range of between six and nine kilometres.Many of these men had been mobilized to Artillery Regiment no. 3 at \u00d8yanmoen army camp at V\u00e6rnes Air Station and were brought to Hegra to continue the mobilization after the Germans had reached their camp. The fortress at Hegra was originally only intended as a temporary refuge for the artillery regiment, but ended up as the centre of the volunteers' war in 1940.\n\n\n=== German force ===\nThe attacking force initially consisted of Gebirgsj\u00e4ger of the German 138. Gebirgsj\u00e4gerregiment (part of the 3. Gebirgsdivision), which landed in Trondheim on 9 April. Later, from 20 April to 27 April, the Germans substituted the 138. Gebirgsj\u00e4gerregiment with units from the 181. Infantry Division and the 138. Gebirgsj\u00e4ger were sent north to try to relieve their comrades at the Narvik Front.By the end of the battle the German forces employed against Hegra Fortress consisted chiefly of one infantry battalion at Hegra and one company of Gebirgsj\u00e4ger in the nearby village of Sona. In addition further units were deployed to the village of Elvran and to the Selbu region.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe old mothballed fort at Ingstadkleiva that was to become known as Hegra Fortress was not intended by any of the parties as a battlefield. It only became of importance when the Norwegian artillery major Hans Reidar Holtermann started organising troops to resist the German invasion forces which had been landed at Trondheim. Holtermann first travelled to the army camp at V\u00e6rnes to mobilize his Artillery Regiment no. 3. This mobilization began at 14:00 on 9 April 1940, but the Germans landed at Stj\u00f8rdal Station the very next day, and by 10:30 approached the camp. As his forces were not combat ready, Holtermann had to evacuate and move to what was at that point known as Ingstadkleiva Fort to complete his mobilization. Thus, at 15:00 on 10 April 1940, most of the personnel and equipment under Holtermann's command arrived at the small mountain fortification of Ingstadkleiva Fort. At this point, Holtermann was given orders to proceed with the mobilization and otherwise do what he himself thought best. Holtermann thus began to gather and equip a fighting force of local volunteers. After arriving at the fort Holtermann first took residence in the buildings outside the mountain fortifications, not intending to defend the facility, only use it as a temporary base.\n\n\n=== Mobilization ===\nBy 10 April, Holtermann already had fifty volunteers under his command and a steady stream of mostly local men kept being drawn to the fort. On 11 April, men of Holtermann's unit returned to V\u00e6rnes to remove more of the materiel and provisions stored there. Due to poor security amongst the German forces stationed at the camp, the Norwegians were able to carry out their mission undetected. The reclaimed supplies were taken partly to the fortress and partly to a number of nearby farms. When a force of 250 soldiers had been assembled, Holtermann had to turn away further volunteers due to the fact he could not arm or equip any more soldiers than those he already had under his command at that point. From 12 April work was carried out to reactivate the fortress' artillery, which was found to have plentiful ammunition, but no direction systems or charts for indirect fire. Only a few 1:100,000 scale maps were available at the fortress. The actual artillery charts for the fortress were stored in Trondheim and fell into the hands of the Germans on 9 April and were used by the Wehrmacht during the siege to deploy artillery in places that the fortress could not hit. The same day troops of Holtermann's unit were positioned around Hegra railway station and M\u00e6len bridge, and the first German attempt at making the fortress surrender was carried out. A German Major approached the fortress together with two Norwegian officers who had given up the same day. Despite the best efforts by both the German officer and the two surrendered Norwegians, Holtermann refused to capitulate. The next day, 13 April, Major Holtermann achieved contact with his superiors at the 5th Division for the last time during the Norwegian Campaign. Through a telephone conversation, the commander of the force at Hegra was told to act as he saw best and, if possible, to hinder the Germans in gaining control of the Mer\u00e5kerbanen railway line to Sweden. In response to these orders, 20 soldiers were sent to the village of Flornes to set up field fortifications and block the road and railway to Mer\u00e5ker.\n\n\n=== Friendly fire incident ===\nOn 14 April, reports came in to the troops stationed at Hegra village stating that a train loaded with German soldiers had left Hell railway station and was on its way to Hegra. Not long after a train approached Hegra Station and ignored signals to stop. In response to what was interpreted as a German troop train trying to force its way through, the soldiers guarding the station opened fire on the approaching train. However, the train was in fact carrying Finnish refugees home after the Winter War. The fire killed one Norwegian man and wounded two Finnish women. Later that afternoon, the garrison's sole female member joined when nurse Anne Margrethe Bang from Trondheim arrived at the fortress bearing a load of medical supplies. The daughter of a doctor and trained in first aid, Bang stayed in the fortress for the duration of the siege, helping two military doctors care for the sick and wounded.\n\n\n=== German aircraft driven off by ground fire ===\nThe first shots fired by the fortress' defenders occurred on 14 April, the same day as the friendly-fire train incident, when a Norwegian heavy machine gun fired at and damaged a German aircraft, driving it away. More equipment and ammunition from V\u00e6rnes arrived at the fortress the same day.\n\n\n== Battle ==\n\n\n=== German capture of the surrounding area ===\n\n\n==== Attack on Hegra village ====\nAt 05:30 on 15 April, the Germans attacked the Norwegian positions defending the Hegra railway station, Hegra road bridge and M\u00e6len bridge, supported by artillery fire. Having been partly caught by surprise, the Norwegian forces at the Hegra road bridge and the railway station made a fighting retreat to the fortress over a two- to three-hour period. Early on in the fighting, the Norwegians demolished the Hegra road bridge, forcing the German infantry to cross the precarious ice of the frozen Stj\u00f8rdal River under fire. At M\u00e6len bridge, the guards withdrew to the south. Four Norwegian soldiers fell in and around Hegra, while one was killed at M\u00e6len bridge. In addition to those killed, eight Norwegian soldiers were taken prisoner during the initial German attack.\n\n\n==== Fortress artillery intervenes ====\nAs the German attack developed, the artillery pieces at Hegra Fortress opened up to support the Norwegian troops under attack in the valley below, and later covered their retreat. The Norwegian artillery fire was directed at German artillery positions, machine gun nests and convoys of trucks pushing east towards the Swedish border. The telephone operator at Hegra telegraph station acted as an observer for the artillery at the fortress. Artillery fire from the fortress knocked out three German artillery pieces and inflicted casualties on the attacking force.\n\n\n==== Skirmish on the fortress road ====\nAs the Norwegian infantry force pulled out of Hegra and up the road towards the fortress, the Germans pursued them until they reached a number of field fortifications blocking the road. At this position, the Norwegians held their ground and inflicted fatalities on the attacking force. Amongst the German fatalities was the attacking platoon's leader, Oberleutnant Hans-Joachim Herrmann. After the fighting, as the Norwegians were going through the area to seize German arms and equipment, they found the German Gefreiter Hugo Bayerle. Bayerle had been hit in both thighs, sustaining a broken femur, and was bleeding profusely. The Norwegian troops brought him on a ski sled to the fortress for medical care.\n\n\n==== End of the first day of the battle ====\nAt the end of the first day of serious fighting, the Germans pushed on along the Mer\u00e5kerbanen railway line and broke through the blocking position at Flornes. The troops holding Flornes withdrew first to Mer\u00e5ker, then further north to join other Norwegian forces. As night fell, German troops had occupied the areas around the villages of Hegra, Avelsgaard, Flornes, Ingstad and Sona. During the day, Luftwaffe aircraft had repeatedly overflown Hegra Fortress. The Norwegian troops had fired on the aircraft with both rifles and machine guns, damaging one aircraft, which crashed while attempting an emergency landing at V\u00e6rnes.\n\n\n=== Attempts to storm the fortress ===\nThe day after the German capture of the area surrounding the fortress, Luftwaffe aircraft repeatedly attacked with bombs and machine gun fire. German infantry probed the approaches to the fortifications but were driven off by artillery and heavy machine gun fire. A German mountain howitzer brought up to Avelsgaard bombarded the fortress, destroying most of the houses outside the walls. One Norwegian soldier was killed by a shell hitting the fortress parapet. He was the last Norwegian fatality of the battle.\n\n\n==== First German charge ====\n17 April began with a bombardment at 07:00 from the air and by the howitzer position at Avelsgaard.\nAt 09:00, a large force of German infantry attacked from the north-east, supported by machine gun positions situated a mere 150 m (160 yd) north of the fortress. The progress of the attack was only halted when it reached the barbed wire entanglements directly in front of the Norwegian trenches. At this point, the attacking force was subjected to heavy fire at close range from artillery, machine guns and riflemen, and thrown back. German bombers kept on hitting the fortress throughout the day, knocking out both the telephone line and the electricity supply. Neither came back into operation during the siege. From then until the end of the battle, all light inside the Norwegian tunnels and halls was provided by candles and nine kerosene lamps.\n\n\n==== Second attack is aborted ====\nThe day after their first unsuccessful attack, the German forces made another attempt at storming the mountain fortress. In preparation, the fortifications were subjected to heavy machine gun and mortar fire during the early daylight hours. A battalion of infantry was brought forward towards the fortress, but was hit by a blizzard while marching through no man's land. As the attacking units lost their bearing in the storm, fire fights erupted between groups of Germans mistaking each other for Norwegian patrols and the whole enterprise collapsed before reaching the Norwegian positions. Bombers and heavy calibre artillery pieces kept up steady fire against the fortress throughout the day.\n\n\n=== Siege ===\n\n\n==== Evacuation of wounded ====\nIn the evening of 18 April, two Norwegian doctors\u2014Sigurd Aarrestad and Peter Berdal\u2014approached the German commander of the Hegra-Son area and requested permission to pass through the German lines to evacuate wounded soldiers from the fortress. During the previous days' fighting many German wounded had been brought to Hegra village and the doctors feared that there had been numerous casualties on the Norwegian side as well. Permission for the mission was granted, and the shelling of Hegra Fortress was temporarily suspended while local volunteers made their way up to the fortress, pulling ski sleds for the wounded. While Aarrestad led the expedition, Berdal was held hostage by the Germans to ensure that the Norwegians returned from the fortress after finishing their mission. When Aarrestad returned from Hegra Fortress a few hours later, he brought along nine wounded Norwegian soldiers and Gefreiter Bayerle, who had been released by his captors and sent along with the wounded Norwegians. As part of the agreement, the Norwegian wounded did not become prisoners of war.\n\n\n==== Attempts to storm the fortress are abandoned ====\nFrom around 25 April, the Germans gave up on storming Hegra Fortress. The pressing need to remove the Norwegian force ended in large part when the important town of Steinkjer fell to the Germans on 21 April and the Allied advance from the north was checked. The southern arm of the Allied counter-attack had never swung north from \u00c5ndalsnes and had instead been directed to the Gudbrandsdal in order to support the Norwegian forces fighting there. As the immediate crisis had passed for the German force in Trondheim, they preferred to push south to link up with forces coming up from Oslo. The focus of the Wehrmacht became to bombard Hegra Fortress with artillery and air power to try to pummel it into submission.\n\n\n==== Artillery duels, aerial bombing and patrol engagements ====\nFor the remainder of the battle, the Germans did not try to storm the fortress again. Fighting consisted of aerial bombing of the fortress, duels between the fortress' guns and German field artillery and skirmishes between German and Norwegian ski units doing reconnaissance and bringing in supplies of food, ammunition and fuel. Several Norwegian soldiers were captured as a result of the patrol actions. To counter German guns placed in the positional guns' blind zones, the Norwegian artillerymen positioned their two 8.4 cm field guns to cover areas the fixed guns could not reach. During the siege, the Norwegian guns targeted machine gun nests, gun positions, command posts and ammunition depots in the surrounding area. On 23 April, one of the 7.5 cm positional guns was knocked out, one of the fortress' command towers was destroyed and the water line was broken. The second 7.5 cm gun was destroyed on 24 April. The fortress was under constant artillery fire and held out chiefly in order to be in a position to support the Allied offensive expected from the north.On 25 April, the Germans employed a new weapon against the fortress when a seaplane dropped a 1,800 kg (4,000 lb) bomb, destroying the houses outside the walls, with shrapnel ending up in Hegra village several kilometres away. From 29 April, the artillery bombardment steadily increased in strength, with German guns reinforced by captured Norwegian 12 cm (4.7 in) howitzers from the armoury in Trondheim, and the next day one of the three 10.5 cm guns at the fortress was knocked out. During the siege, a total of over 2,300 shells struck Hegra Fortress.\n\n\n==== V\u00e6rnes Air Station ====\nOne way that Holtermann wanted to directly support the main war effort in Norway was to bombard V\u00e6rnes Air Base, the northernmost airfield in German hands and vital for the support of German forces north of Trondheim. This was particularly so for the Narvik front, which could not be reached by aircraft flying from further south than V\u00e6rnes. Recognising this, the Germans had hired some 2,000 Norwegian collaborationist labourers to work full-time at expanding and improving the air strip. Bombarding V\u00e6rnes would both have disrupted this work and impaired the bombing raids being flown against Norwegian forces fighting further to the north. However, since V\u00e6rnes is 11.5 km (7.1 mi) from Hegra, and the fortress' guns only had a maximum range of some 9 km (5.6 mi), this was impossible. For accurate firing, the effective range was a mere 6.9 km (4.3 mi), as that was the range of the artillery's height angle meter. Efforts were made at the fortress to increase the elevation of the guns from 19\u00b0 to 26\u00b0 by removing part of the gun shields, and part of the gun mounting, but these failed as no welding equipment could be acquired to carry out the modifications. Even though no modifications could be carried out, one of the 10.5 cm guns at Hegra opened fire in the direction of V\u00e6rnes on 22 April. With the gun firing at maximum elevation, the rounds still fell hundreds of metres short of their intended target.The earliest attempt by the Hegra garrison to attack the airfield at V\u00e6rnes had occurred on 14 April, when a Norwegian dog sled patrol spotted massive German air activity at the air base. Plans were made to manhandle one of the fortress' 8.4 cm field guns to a nearby hill called Blankhammeren, and from there bombard German targets out of range from the fortress itself, including the strategically important airfield. The plan, however, could not be carried out before the German attack of 15 April brought large German infantry forces into the area and rendered the plans infeasible.\n\n\n==== International media attention ====\nDuring the siege, the struggle of Hegra Fortress captured the attention of the international media, with articles such as those in The Daily Telegraph on 22 April and 2 May, and that in The Manchester Guardian on 16 April. The fortress was also mentioned in articles in Time magazine on 6 May and 13 May.\n\n\n== Surrender ==\n\n\n=== Preparations and influencing factors ===\n\nNews came in over the radio on 2 May of the Allied retreat from the \u00c5ndalsnes area, that the Germans had seized control of the Dovre Line from Domb\u00e5s to St\u00f8ren, and of the surrender of the Norwegian 4th Brigade in Western Norway. This came on top of increasing supply problems, with the bread supply already having run out on 30 April. The next day, 3 May, the garrison started destroying its artillery ammunition in preparation for surrender. The three Swedish volunteers that had endured the siege with the Norwegians were released from their duties and guided across the mountains to the Swedish border by a ski patrol. During the day, a radio message from Colonel Ole Berg Getz\u2014the Norwegian commander in the Tr\u00f8ndelag area\u2014was broadcast. Getz had surrendered his forces in Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag and advised all Norwegian forces in Tr\u00f8ndelag to lay down their arms as the situation had become hopeless after the British retreat from the southern parts of Norway. The decision to surrender Tr\u00f8ndelag had been influenced by Neville Chamberlain's radio message that day announcing the end of the Allied campaign in Southern Norway. On 4 May, destruction of radios, machine guns, carbines and other small arms was initiated and ski patrols were sent out carrying loads of important documents. By 13:50 that day confirmation of Colonel Getz's capitulation was received and the destruction of the fortress' artillery began.\n\n\n=== Capitulation ===\nIn the early hours of 5 May, the situation was such that there was very little food left and water for only a few days, all other Norwegian and Allied forces in all of southern Norway had been withdrawn or had surrendered and Hegra Fortress was the last remaining pocket of resistance south of Nordland. At 05:00, Major Holtermann had his men assemble in the tunnels and relayed to them his decision to surrender the fortress. In a short speech, he thanked them for their efforts and then led them in singing the Norwegian National Anthem. By 05:25, a white flag was raised over the fortress, and at 06:30 a force of 60 German soldiers and three officers\u2014led by one Hauptmann Giebel\u2014arrived to accept the surrender of the garrison. Later that day, 190 men and one woman marched out of the fortress and into captivity. At the surrender, the garrison at Hegra Fortress consisted of 14 officers, one technical officer, seven sergeants, one officer cadet, six corporals, 161 privates and nurse Anne Margrethe Bang.\n\n\n=== Garrison as prisoners of war ===\n\nAfter the surrender, the Norwegians were marched down to Hegra railway station from where they were transported by train. In Trondheim, the officers and Anne Margrethe Bang were taken off the train and interned at Trondheim katedralskole secondary school while the NCOs and soldiers continued their journey to Lundamo in Gauldalen valley. At Lundamo, the prisoners were interned in a barn for the night. The next day, 6 May, the prisoners from Hegra were force-marched for 50 km (31 mi) to Berk\u00e5k where a prisoner-of-war camp was established. At Berk\u00e5k, the prisoners were set at work at building an improvised road from the river Orkla near Berk\u00e5k across the woods to Brattset. The road was intended to help the German logistic system that had been severely hampered by the numerous bridges that had been blown by the Norwegian Army during the preceding month. Due in part to the poor physical condition of the prisoners after the harsh siege they had just experienced, the road was never completed despite threats of punishment made by the German camp commander. At the end of May the German High Command in Berlin announced that Adolf Hitler had personally ordered the release of Norwegian prisoners of war as an act of recognition of the defence they had put up under difficult conditions. The release of the prisoners from Hegra happened in groups and by mid-June the last PoWs had been let go.\n\n\n== Casualties ==\nSix Norwegian soldiers were killed in action during the battle, with 14 wounded. All the Norwegian fatalities occurred during the first two days of the fighting. In the first years after World War II, Norwegian estimates of the number of German casualties were exaggerated, some spoke of up to 1,100 dead or wounded. Later research has however led to a substantially lower number, at about 150 to 200 Wehrmacht soldiers killed or wounded at Hegra.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nArnstad, Johan (1965).

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway. Today the bunker houses various archives, among them the city archives, the university and state archives. More recently, DORA has been used as a concert venue.\nKristiansten Fortress, built 1681\u20131684, is located on a hill east in Trondheim. It repelled the invading Swedes in 1718, but was decommissioned in 1816 by Crown Prince Regent Charles John.\nA statue of Olav Tryggvason, the founder of Trondheim, is located in the city's central square, mounted on top of an obelisk. The statue base is also a sun dial, but it is calibrated to UTC+1 so that the reading is inaccurate by one hour in the summer.\nThe islet Munkholmen is a popular tourist attraction and recreation site. The islet has served as a place of execution, a monastery, a fortress, prison, and a Second World War anti-aircraft gun station.\nStiftsg\u00e5rden is the royal residence in Trondheim, originally constructed in 1774 by Cecilie Christine Sch\u00f8ller. At 140 rooms constituting 4,000 square metres (43,056 sq ft), it is possibly the largest wooden building in Northern Europe, and has been used by royals and their guests since 1800.\nA statue of Leif Ericson is located at the seaside, close to the old Customs Building, the cruise ship facilities and the new swimming hall. The statue is a replica, the original being located at a Seattle marina.\n\n\n=== Nidaros Cathedral ===\n\nThe Nidaros Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace are located side by side in the middle of the city centre. The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral. On 24 May 2002, their daughter Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise married the writer Ari Behn in the cathedral.The Pilgrim's Route (Pilegrimsleden) to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at Nidaros Cathedral, has recently been re-instated. Also known as St. Olav's Way, (Sankt Olavs vei), the main route, which is approximately 640 kilometres (400 mi) long, starts in Oslo and heads North, along Lake Mj\u00f8sa, up the valley Gudbrandsdalen, over the mountain range Dovrefjell and down the Oppdal valley to end at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to pilgrims and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the aegis of the cathedral, which awards certificates to successful pilgrims upon the completion of their journey.\n\n\n=== Other churches ===\nThe Lutheran Church of Norway has 21 churches within the municipality of Trondheim. They are all a part of the Diocese of Nidaros, which is based in Trondheim at the Nidaros Cathedral. Many of the churches are several hundred years old, with a couple which were built almost 1,000 years ago.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Sankt Olav domkirke is the cathedral episcopal see of the exempt Territorial Prelature of Trondheim.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe Trondheim Art Museum has Norway's third largest public art collection, mainly Norwegian art from the last 150 years. The National Museum of Decorative Arts boasts a large collection of decorative arts and design, including a great number of tapestries from the Norwegian tapestry artist Hannah Ryggen, as well as Norway's only permanent exhibibition of Japanese arts and crafts. Sverresborg, also named Zion after King David's castle in Jerusalem, was a fortification built by Sverre Sigurdsson. It is now an open-air museum, consisting of more than 60 buildings. The castle was originally built in 1182\u20131183, but did not last for long as it was burned down in 1188. However, the Sverresaga indicates it had been restored by 1197.The Trondheim Science Center (Norwegian: Vitensenteret i Trondheim) is a scientific hands-on experience center. The NTNU University Museum (Norwegian: NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet) is part of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. There are also a variety of small history, science and natural history museums, such as the Trondheim Maritime Museum, the Armoury, adjacent to the Archbishops's Palace, Kristiansten Fortress, the music and musical instrument museum Ringve National Museum, Ringve Botanical Garden, the Trondheim Tramway Museum, and the Jewish Museum, co-located with the city's synagogue, which is among the northernmost in the world.\nRockheim (Norwegian: Det nasjonale opplevelsessenteret for pop og rock, The National Discovery Center for Pop and Rock) opened at the Pier in August 2010. It is located inside an old warehouse, but characterised by an easily recognisable roof in the shape of a box. \"The box\" is decorated by thousands of tiny lights that change in a variety of colours and patterns, and is a landmark in the cityscape - especially on dark winter evenings.\nKunsthall Trondheim was inaugurated at its permanent premises on Kongens gate in October 2016.\n\n\n=== Prison ===\nVollan District Jail (Norwegian: Vollan kretsfengsel) was a jail during the nazi occupation of Norway and was used to imprison both prisoners of war and criminals. Vollan was not considered a concentration camp. In a summary of prisoners of war in Norway, numerous prisoners were registered at Vollan. Once of its roles was as a transit camp for political prisoners. Many prisoners were taken from Vollan to Kristiansten Fortress and shot.

      "name": "The Crown Regalia",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The regalia of Norway are items that symbolise the Norwegian monarch's power and majesty. Little is known of the old Norwegian regalia which have since been lost and the majority of items date from 1818 and were made for the coronation of Jean Bernadotte as King Carl III Johan.\nThe Norwegian royal regalia include nine items: the king's crown, the sword of the realm, the king's sceptre, the king's orb, the queen's crown, the queen's sceptre, the queen's orb, the crown of the crown prince and the anointing horn. Also in this collection are several mantles, two banners of the realm and coronation thrones.\nThe last king and queen in Norway to be crowned were Haakon VII and his wife Maud of Wales in 1905. Thereafter, the regalia have since not been used to physically crown or to be worn by successive monarchs. Certain items are still used occasionally such as during the monarch's consecration, where the crown is displayed; or during the monarch's funeral service, where it is placed atop the casket.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring Norway's union with Denmark, the king underwent a coronation ceremony in Denmark. When this union was dissolved in 1814, Norway declared its independence and adopted its own constitution. However, total independence was short-lived as Norway would be compelled to enter into a personal union with Sweden and sharing the same monarch and foreign policy.\nA coronation was required among the provisions in Norway's 1814 constitution. The old Norwegian regalia had been lost and no Norwegian regalia was available for use when preparations were made for the coronation of King Carl Johan in 1818. The king would pay for the essential regalia himself. The regalia of the king and the anointing horn were made for this coronation. The regalia of the queen were acquired in 1830 for the planned coronation of Carl Johan's wife, D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Clary. This coronation never took place. All the regalia were made in Sweden except the crown of the crown prince which was made in Norway in 1848 and the sword of state which was a gift from Charles John to the Norwegian state. The coronet of the crown prince was ordered for use in the planned coronation of Oscar I and Josephine of Leuchtenberg, as the Norwegian parliament wanted the heir apparent to the throne, the future Charles IV to take part in the ceremony. However Oscar I was never to be crowned in Norway because the bishop of Nidaros refused to crown the Catholic Josephine. The sword of state was initially a gift from Napoleon Bonaparte to Charles III John, then known as Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, when he was appointed Marshal of France. Charles III John carried the sword during the Battle of Leipzig; when he acquired the Norwegian regalia in 1818, he had the blade of the sword refashioned, in order that its symbolic language might correspond better to its new function.\nThe coronation that followed Charles III John's was that of Charles IV and his wife, Louise of the Netherlands, in 1860. Oscar II and Sophie of Nassau were crowned in 1873.\nFollowing the dissolution of the union with Sweden in 1905, Norway elected a Danish prince to serve as its own king. King Haakon VII, his wife Maud, and their son Olav arrived in Norway on 25 November and Haakon took the required oath as King two days later. As required by the constitution, Haakon (along with his wife) was subsequently crowned and anointed the following year on 22 June 1906 at the Nidaros Cathedral in Tro dheim. This was the last time the regalia were to be used for a coronation as the provision in the Norwegian constitution requiring the monarch's coronation was repealed in 1908. The coronet of the crown prince has never been used: Crown Prince Olav was too young to participate in the ceremony in 1906.\nThe regalia are now on display in the Archbishop's Palace, next to the Nidaros Cathedral. Certain items from the regalia collection are still used occasionally such as during the monarch's consecration, where the crown is displayed; or during the monarch's funeral service, where it is placed atop the casket.\nIn 2006, Harald V made a speech where he emphasised that the Norwegian Crown symbolises a free, independent and democratic nation.\n\n\n== Individual items in the regalia ==\n\nThe King's Crown: made in Stockholm in 1818 by goldsmith Olof Wihlborg, the crown is a corona clausa (closed model) of gold consisting of a circlet bearing eight large stones, primarily amethysts and chrysoprases surrounded by a wreath of oak leaves with three pearls set as acorns between each of these stones, the largest of these being a large oval green tourmaline, a gift of the Brazilian consul in Stockholm to King Charles III Johan in the front.  From on the rim of this circlet are eight gold strawberry leaves, each set with a precious or semi-precious stone (except that covered by the large tourmaline in the front), between which are set eight pairs of gold oak leaves with pearl set acorn between them.  From behind these strawberry leaves rises eight half arches, four of them being each set with four precious or semi-precious stones alternating with four pairs of oak leaves and pairs of pearls and the other four half arches consisting of gold branches of laurel leaves.  These half-arches support a blue enameled orb sprinkled with gold stars and surround by an equator and meridian band of half-pearls and supporting at its top a Latin cross of six amethysts.  Among the other precious and semi-precious stones set in the crown are an emerald, a ruby, a topaz, an alexandrite and a white opal.  The crown is lined with a red velvet cap covered with pearls alternating with small crowns embroidered in gold thread.\nKing's orb: made in Stockholm in 1818 by goldsmith Adolf Zethelius (1781\u20131864) is a 10 cm sphere of gilt silver and with a 1 cm wide equator and meridian decorated with small roses.  The King's orb is footed and at the top the meridian bears a miniature orb and cross.\nKing's sceptre: made in Stockholm in 1818 by goldsmith Adolf Zethelius is a 75 cm rod of gilt silver.  At the top of this rod is a diminutive orb and cross, immediately below which it is surrounded with open work foliage of oak leaves, while the knobs on either side of the grip are decorated with the roses similar to those found on the King's orb.\nAnointing horn: made in Stockholm in 1818 by goldsmith Adolf Zethelius of gilt silver and has the form of upturned and footed bull's horn with the open end closed with a chained lid topped with an acorn and with a miniature royal crown on the tip of the horn.  It was obviously inspired by the anointing horn in the Swedish regalia, which also has the form of an upturned and footed bull's horn.\nSword of the Realm: early 19th century. Tradition has it that this coronation sword was a gift from Napoleon I, Emperor of the French, to the future king of Sweden and Norway, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, when he was made Marshal of France, which he carried as Swedish Crown Prince at the battle of Leipzig.  He had a new hilt, grip and scabbard in gilt bronze made for this sword appropriate to its new use as the Norwegian Sword of the Realm.  Inlaid panels of mother of pearl decorate the grip and scabbard and engravings of oak leaves on the scabbard and hilt and grip and an acorn at the tip of the grip correspond to the oak leaves and acorns found also on the crown and sceptre.\nQueen's crown: made in Stockholm in 1830 by goldsmith Erik Lundberg.  It was modelled after the Swedish queen consort's crown.  The crown is a corona clausa consisting of a gold circlet of eight larger stones (two amethysts, four topazes and two chrysoprases) alternating with eight smaller stones (amethysts) with rosettes of seven small pearls between each of these and surrounded by an engraved design of roses leaves.  On the rim of this circlet rises eight leaves, each set with a round amethyst, alternating with eight large half pearls.  From behind these leaves rises eight half arches of a leaf design, each set with seven progressively smaller oval amethysts (except the first stone in the front half arch which is set with a rectangler topaz) and supporting at the top, on a row of small pearls, a blue enamel orb with an equator and meridian band of small pearls supporting a pearl cross at the top.  The crown is lined with a red velvet cap with seed pearls embroidered in a branch-like design behind each of the large half pearls on the rim of the circlet and at the top of the cap, an eight pointed star shaped gold button set with a large pearl.\nQueen's orb: made in Stockholm in 1830 is a 10 cm sphere of gilt silver with a 1 cm equator and meridian set with faceted amethysts.  The Queen's orb is footed and on the top the meridian bears a miniature blue enamelled orb with an equator and meridian band set with small pearls bearing at its top a cross also set with small pearls.\nQueen's sceptre: made in Stockholm in 1830 is a 70 cm rod of gilt silver.  At its head the rod is set with four rows of five faceted oval amethysts, diminishing in size from bottom to top, encased between four acanthus leaves. From each of four large scrolls below this head and from four smaller scrolls above it hang drop shaped pendant each set with a drop-shaped amethyst, the scrolls, pendants and their amethysts below being significantly larger than those above.  The grip of the Queen's sceptre has a banister-like shape embossed with design of acanthus leaves.\nCrown Prince's coronet: made in Norway in 1846 by goldsmith Herman Colbj\u00f8rnsen \u00d8yset. The coronet is a corona aperta (open model), clearly modelled in its basic design on that of the Swedish Crown Prince's coronet, and made of gold and decorated with amethysts, citrines, peridots and rare Norwegian freshwater pearls.  The circlet is polished with acanthus ornamentation with a matte finish around the gemstones alternating with groups of three oak leaves set in a fan shape around a pearl.  At the front of the circlet is an oval amethyst and four amethysts alternate with four citrines on the circlet proper.  The eight triangular points of this radial crown are in a matte finish with similar acanthus ornamentation, while between each of these points they are joined to each other on either side and to the circlet itself with a pair of acanthus scrolls supporting a group of five oak leaves around a pearl similar to those on the circlet.  Each of the points has two oval colored gemstones, one an amethyst, the other a peridot, the lower one being slightly larger than that above it with a small pearl above them.  At the top of each point is a larger Norwegian freshwater half pearl in a trefoil setting.  It is lined with a red velvet cap heavily embroidered in gold thread with the design of a large radiating star at the top surrounded by four pairs of acanthus scrolls.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCrown jewels\nRoyal coronations in Norway\nNorwegian monarchy\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page of the Norwegian Royal Regalia\nNidaros Cathedral | The Crown Regalia\nRoyal House of Norway | The Regalia\nShort video from NRK of the Royal family visiting the exhibit of the Royal Regalia",

        "wiki": "Gerhard Friedrich Ernst Flesch (8 October 1909 \u2013 28 February 1948) was a German SS functionary during the Nazi era. Post World War II, he was tried, found guilty and executed for his crimes, specifically the torture and murder of members of the Norwegian resistance movement.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFlesch was an Oberregierungsrat and held the rank of SS-Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer (lieutenant colonel). He was born in Posen, Province of Posen, German Empire.  He became a member of NSDAP (Nazi Party) in 1933. In 1934, he obtained his law degree and by 1936 was a member of the Gestapo, when Reinhard Heydrich appointed him over a unit to control the religious sects of Germany. In 1938, he took part in the German march into the Sudetenland, and in 1939, in the annexation of Bohemia and Moravia. Later he was appointed political adviser to Gauleiter Fritz Sauckel in Thuringia. \n\n\n== Career in World War II ==\nAfter the outbreak of the war in September, 1939, he became leader of an Einsatzkommando in Pozna\u0144 (German: Posen). Between 20 and 23 October 1939 the 14 Einsatzkommando that he commanded executed 275 Poles in the Greater Poland region near Poznan who were named as Polish patriots by Wolfgang Bickerich, the Lutheran pastor in Leszno, who had kept a list before the German invasion of Poland in 1939. They included political leaders, teachers, police officers, Catholic priests, workers, and farmers, and included scouts as young as 18. This was the start of Operation Tannenberg organized by Reinhard Heydrich which was meant to eliminate Polish leaders in the parts of Poland annexed to GermanyIn 1940, he joined the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf in their march into France. He had a position as Regierungsrat (Executive Council, government advisor), and was an SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer (major) in April 1940, when he was assigned to Norway. His first job in Norway was Kommandeur der Sipo und des SD in Bergen (the Sicherheitsdienst (SD; Security Service) was primarily the intelligence service of the SS and the Nazi Party, where the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo; Security Police) was a term used in Nazi Germany to describe the state political and criminal investigation security agencies. It was made up by the combined forces of the Gestapo (secret state police) and the Kripo (criminal police) between 1936 and 1939. Thereafter, they became departments of the RSHA). On 11 October 1941, he was appointed Kommandeur der Sicherheitspolizei und des Sicherheitsdienst in Trondheim. As Kommandeur of the district, he was also chief of Falstad concentration camp outside Trondheim and the prisons in Trondheim. He was promoted to the rank of Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer  (lieutenant colonel) and received the title of Oberregierungsrat. His immediate superior was Heinrich Fehlis. On 8 May 1945, he fled from Trondheim with a gold bar in his luggage. He was caught and sent back with a police escort on the train and during which he made an unsuccessful attempt to escape.\n\n\n== Trial and execution ==\nFlesch was known for being a notorious torturer, and ordered the execution of many members of the Norwegian resistance movement without any trial. After World War II, in 1946, he was tried for the many cases of torture and murder. He was charged with a series of war crimes committed in Norway; seven instances of killing prisoners (a total of 37 individuals) five instances of torture (versch\u00e3rfte Vernehmung: \"enhanced interrogation\") and one instance of causing death by withholding medical treatment. The court found that in all but two instances these charges to be proven, and he was found guilty and sentenced to death by execution by firing squad. Flesch appealed to the Supreme Court of Norway on procedural grounds and that the sentence was too harsh; however on 12 February 1948 his appeal was rejected.  The sentence was carried out at midnight at Kristiansten festning on 28 February 1948. Right before the order was given to fire, Flesch shouted loudly \"Heil Hitler\".\n\n\n== References ==",

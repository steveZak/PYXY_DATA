        "wiki": "Old Town Bridge (Norwegian: Gamle Bybro or Bybroa) is located in Trondheim, Tr\u00f8ndelag County, Norway.\n\n\n== History ==\nGamle Bybro crosses the  Nidelva River from the south end of the  main street Kj\u00f8pmannsgata connecting to the Trondheim neighborhood of Bakklandet. Gamle Bybro was constructed by Johan Caspar von Cicignon  in 1681 in conjunction with the reconstruction of Trondheim after the great fire of 1681. Johan Caspar von Cicignon laid out plans for the reconstruction of Trondheim as well as its fortification. Kristiansten Fortress was built at this time after his plans. The bridge location was of military-strategic significance.  King Christian V of Denmark assumed the cost of construction. It was completed in 1685. The bridge was built in the vicinity of the original Elgeseter Bridge. When it was opened the older bridge was allowed to decay and collapse. Since then  Gamle Bybro has undergone many changes.\n\nOriginally  Gamle Bybro  was constructed of wood, but the wood was supported on three stone piers. In the middle of the bridge, an iron  gate was placed. This remained a guarded city gate until 1816. At each end of the bridge there was a toll and guardhouse. The access house on the west end still stands, but that on the east side was taken down in 1824. Gamle Bybro was reconstructed in 1861 by the engineer Carl Adolf Dahl (1828-1907). Today Gamle Bybro is one of Trondheim's characteristic landmarks.\nGamle Bybro is also known as Lykkens portal (Gate of Happiness), after the lyrics of the popular waltz  Nidelven stille og vakker du er ( \"Nidelven quiet and beautiful you are\")  by Norwegian singer and composer  Kristian Oskar Hodd\u00f8 (1916-1943).  According to tradition,  Hodd\u00f8 wrote the waltz about  the Nidelva River one night in late April 1940 while he was  standing at Gamle Bybro. Oskar Hodd\u00f8 was a member of the resistance movement against the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. He was executed in Trondheim on 17 November 1943 along with eight other Norwegian resistance fighters.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Other sources ==\n\u00d8ksendal, Asbj\u00f8rn  (1969)  Lur\u00f8y-aff\u00e6ren - Operasjon Oleander : Gestapo i Trondheim og Leksvik-aff\u00e6ren 1942-44 ISBN 978-82-7005-023-9\n\n\n== External links ==\nNidelven stille og vakker du er by Oskar Hodd\u00f8",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Nidaros Cathedral (Norwegian: Nidarosdomen / Nidaros Domkirke) is a cathedral of the Church of Norway located in the city of Trondheim in Tr\u00f8ndelag county. It is built over the burial site of King Olav II (c. 995\u20131030, reigned 1015\u20131028), who became the patron saint of the nation, and is the traditional location for the consecration of new kings of Norway. It was built over a 230 year period, from 1070 to 1300 when it was substantially completed. However additional work, additions and renovations have continued intermittently since then; the most recent changes were completed in 2001. Nidaros was designated as the cathedral for the Diocese of Nidaros in 1152. After experiencing the turmoil and controversies of the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, it was taken from the Catholic Church by the newly established state Church of Norway in 1537, which adopted the teachings and reforms of Martin Luther, Phillip Melancthon and others, becoming an Evangelical Lutheran church. Nidaros is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world.The cathedral is the main church for the Nidaros og V\u00e5r Frue parish, the seat of the Nidaros domprosti (arch-deanery), and the seat of the Bishop of the Diocese of Nidaros.  The Preses of the Church of Norway is also based at this cathedral. The large, stone church seats about 1,850 people and it was historically used as the site of coronation of the kings of Norway.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNidaros Cathedral was built beginning in 1070 to memorialize the burial place of Olav II of Norway, the king who was killed in 1030 in the Battle of Stiklestad. He was canonized as Saint Olav a year later by Grimketel, the Bishop of Nidaros (the canonization was later confirmed by the pope). It was designated the cathedral of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros from its establishment in 1152 until its abolition in 1537 under the Reformation.Since the Reformation, it has served as the cathedral of the Lutheran bishops of Trondheim (or Nidaros) in the Diocese of Nidaros. The architectural style of the cathedral is Romanesque and Gothic. Historically it has been an important destination for pilgrims coming from all of Northern Europe.Along with V\u00e5r Frue Church, the cathedral is part of the Nidaros og V\u00e5r Frue parish in the Nidaros deanery in the Diocese of Nidaros.\n\n\n== Building and restoration ==\n\nWork on the cathedral as a memorial to St. Olav started in 1070. It was finished some time around 1300, nearly 150 years after being established as the cathedral of the diocese. The cathedral was badly damaged by fires in 1327 and again in 1531. The nave was destroyed and was not rebuilt until the restoration in early 1900s.\nIn 1708, the church burned down completely except for the stone walls. It was struck by lightning in 1719, and was again ravaged by fire. Major rebuilding and restoration of the cathedral started in 1869, initially led by architect Heinrich Ernst Schirmer, and nearly completed by Christian Christie. It was officially completed in 2001. Maintenance of the cathedral is an ongoing process.\nThe oldest parts of the cathedral consist of the octagon with its surrounding ambulatory. This was the site of the original high altar, with the reliquary casket of Saint Olav, and choir. Design of the octagon may have been inspired by the Corona of Canterbury Cathedral, although octagonal shrines have a long history in Christian architecture. Similarly, the choir shows English influence, and appears to have been modeled after the Angel Choir of Lincoln Cathedral.\nIt is joined to the octagon by a stone screen that fills the entire east side of the choir.  The principal arch of this screen is subdivided into three subsidiary arches: the central arch frames a statue of Christ the Teacher, standing on the top of a central arch of three subsidiary arches below him. The space above the principal arch, corresponding to the vault of the choir, contains a crucifix by the Norwegian sculptor Gustav Vigeland, placed between statues of the Virgin Mary and the Apostle John. Built into the south side of the ambulatory is a small well. A bucket could be lowered to draw up water drawn from the spring that originated from St. Olav's original burial place. (This was covered over by the construction of later cathedrals).\nThe present cathedral has two principal altars. At the east end of the chancel in the octagon is an altar at the site of the medieval high altar, behind which stood the silver reliquary casket containing the remains of St. Olav. This silver-gilt reliquary casket was melted down for coinage by Christian II and St. Olav's remains buried in an unknown location under the cathedral. The only relic known to have survived is a femur in a silver-gilt reliquary. Shaped as a forearm, it was given by Queen Josephine to St. Olav Catholic Cathedral in Oslo. The original reliquary casket was in the form of a church, with dragon heads on its gables. The dragons are similar to those carved on the gables of Norwegian stave churches. Surviving medieval reliquary caskets in Norway frequently also bear such dragon heads, for instance, that at Heddal Stave Church.  He was the church's and the kingdom's patron saint. The current altar was designed to recall in marble sculpture the essential form of this reliquary casket. It replaces the previous baroque altar, which was transferred to V\u00e5r Frue Church.\nThe second altar is in the crossing, where the transept intersects the nave and the chancel.  It bears a large modern silver crucifix. It was commissioned and paid for by Norwegian American emigrants in the early twentieth century, and the design was inspired by the memory of a similar silver crucifix in the medieval church. The medieval chapter house may also be used as a chapel for smaller groups of worshipers.\nAll the stained glass in the cathedral dates from its rebuilding in the 19th and 20th centuries.  The windows on the north side of the church depict scenes from the Old Testament against a blue background, while those on the south side of the church depict scenes from the New Testament against a red background.\n\n\n== Organs ==\n\nTwo organs are installed in the Cathedral. The main organ was built by the Steinmeyer firm in 1930, and was erected in the north transept. It then had 125 stops. Installation of the Steinmeyer organ was commissioned in 1930 for the 900th anniversary of the Battle of Stiklestad. The organ was funded mostly by donations, particularly by Elias Anton Cappelen Smith. In 1962, the organ was heavily rebuilt and moved to the west nave. Many stops were removed; some of them were used to build a new choir organ. This organ was fully restored in 2014.The old Baroque organ built by noted German organ builder Johann Joachim Wagner (1690\u20131749) during the period 1738\u201340 was carefully restored by J\u00fcrgen Ahrend between 1993\u201394. It has 30 stops and is located at a gallery in the north transept.\n\n\n== Tourist attraction ==\nToday, the cathedral is a popular tourist attraction. Nidaros Cathedral is the site of the observation of Olav's Wake (Norwegian: Olavsvaka). This religious and cultural festival is centered upon the anniversary of the death of Saint Olav at the Battle of Stiklestad. Tourists often follow the historic Pilgrim's Route (Norwegian: Pilegrimsleden) to visit the cathedral for this and other events.\n\n\n== Alleged bombing plot ==\nThe cathedral is also familiar to enthusiasts of Norwegian black metal, as it is featured on the cover artwork of De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, the 1994 studio album by Mayhem. It was rumored that members of the band who had already been associated with the \nburnings of other Christian churches in Norway had planned to destroy the cathedral in relation to the release of the album. When police arrested former Mayhem bassist Varg Vikernes on 19 August 1993 they had found 150 kg of explosives in his home.\n\n\n== Media gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Choirs ==\nNidaros Cathedral Choir\nNidaros Cathedral Boys' Choir\nNidaros Cathedral Girls' Choir\nSchola Sancta Sunnivae\nNidaros Vocalis\nNidaros Oratory Choir\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of churches in Tr\u00f8ndelag\nList of cathedrals in Norway\nNidaros\nPilgrim's Route\n\n\n== References and notes ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nDanbolt, Gunnar (1997).

          "We visited Nidaros Cathedral whilst in Trondheim on a Hurtigruten stopover. It\u2019s about 30 minutes walk from the boat, but well worth it. We couldn\u2019t go in as it was a Sunday & there was a service in process, however we stood in the porch area & listened for a few minutes to the",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral both inside and out. You will need a ticket to get inside but it is well worth it. The one down side is that you are not allowed to take pictures inside. The outside architecture is pretty stunning and there are a number of vantage points from which",

          "The locale is beautiful. Spend time walking around the Cathedral and the cemetery, before you go in to the building. The guided tour is a good idea, but rather infrequent. We bought the guide book for NOK 50, and it was useful. Do go down to the crypt - it is fascinating, the",

          "We were surprised to walk into the front courtyard and notice how much Nidaros resembles Notre Dame. Gothic architecture. Similar dual towers, very tall central spire, flying buttresses and of course the famous gargoyles. In fact Nidaros Cathedral is the world\u2019s northernmost",
          "Definitely worth a visit if you\u2019re in Trondheim. There are poster outside which tells the story of the place. Also there\u2019s a wee caf\u00e9 right beside it.",
          "If you are on a cruise that only gives you a couple of hours in port make the effort to walk here and you will also see the modern city centre on your way. The cathedral may come as a bit of a surprise as it might seem more like what you would expect in England or northern",
          "An amazing cathedral in the centre of town. It is surprising it is still standing when you hear it was almost bombed. It does cost to enter and there are many places for some good photos. It also has a gif shop outside.",
          "We were there on the first day of St. Olav's festival so the place was absolutely packed. It was also a Sunday so our tour of the cathedral was cut short. Nevertheless, we did get inside and got a lot of interesting info from the guide about the church and its place in Norwegian",
          "If in Trondheim feel the urgent of a jump in the history visiting this amazing Gothic Dome. Don\u2019t trust the negative reviews. Worth the 10 euro of the ticket (its embarrassing read people complaining about the ticket which allow to mantain such a Jewel in the perfect way.",

          "We went to Nidaros Cathedral in the evening but it had closed down for the night. But this being the norternmost Cathedral in the world we went back in the morning. Could/should have stayed longer. It is nothing short of jaw dropping. I'm sure that others are much more so but I",
          "The Nidaros Cathedral is also known as the Dark Cathedral, and this becomes evident once inside. The outside is very interesting, with many stories to tell in the stone carvings in the facade. The people of Trondheim have a good sense of humour with Bob Dylan\u2019s face being used",

          "We walked to the Nidaros Cathedral from the Hurdigruten Ferry Terminal while our Ferry was making an extend stop. The Cathedral is interesting, however they will not allow photographs to be taken inside, and the square in front is so small that even with a 28mm wide angle lens I",
          "Built in 1070 over the tomb of St. Olav, Nidaros Cathedral is where royal coronations are held and is the northernmost medieval cathedral in Norway. One of the most stunning features is the Rose Window which depicts the Last Judgement. Originally of the Roman Catholic",
          "Lot of things to see inside. 50 NOK for a gallery-trip is well spent money for a good view. But watch the narrow steps going up! Not for the claustrophobic\u2019s ... Sit down a take a look around. Go down stairs.",
          "Would absolutely recommend the guided tour around this historical cathedral. You get a lot of Nidarosdomens background history and the history of the area around with you. Very intresting. As for the cathedral it self it's a amazing building!",
          "We often attend service in Episcopalian churches while we're traveling and our visit to the Nidaros Cathedral was no exception. The simplicity of this Cathedral was particularly impressive. Though Luthern, the high mass at 11:00 a.m. was very much like Episcopalian high mass.",
          "This beautiful cathedral, now Lutheran, the farthest north gothic cathedral in the world, is a must see in Norway. The tour was informative and full of wry humor. The historic detail was was satisfyingly interesting. It was easy to spend several hours exploring.",
          "Located in the center of the city, this striking cathedral has quite a history. Its original construction began in 1070 over the burial site of King Olav II. He died in 1030, was canonized as a saint, and became the Patron Saint of Trondenheim. The earlier church(es) were",
          "A visit to Trondheim, Norway wouldn't be complete without a stop at the Nidaros Cathedral. If arriving by cruise ship, one can take a ship tour, or you can walk yourself from the cruise pier (about 1.5 mile thru the shopping zone) to the Cathedral. Upon approach you might feel",
          "It has a medieval appearance but in fact you're looking at a brand new pseudo-gothic building. It lay in ruins for a few centuries and was restored only a hundred years ago. The history of its reconstruction is posted on the stands at the cathedral plaza. I spotted a few",
          "The cathedral is amazing spectacular beautiful much to see and to take in . They have guides to explain all about the cathedral.",

          "This is only an impression from the outside, since we didn\u2019t get a chance to visit the interior of the cathedral. The grey color creates a somber look, and the architecture is not as impressive as cathedrals from the same era in France, for example. Maybe more interesting",
          "An amazing, if overly crowded place. It's a bit of a walk from the cruise ship docks (actually only maybe a mile at most), but you'll get to see the center of town and get some exercise on the way. The Cathedral is stunning, a true work of art and must-see attraction.",
          "After all the churches and cathedrals that you visit across Europe, this is a grand example of something different. A mix of styles, but still gives that dark and ancient feel of something built to be a presence in a place. Stained glass window at the west is 'rose' like and",
          "The outside is beautiful but we didn\u2019t feel like paying to go inside (we thought it was quite expensive). Instead we walked around the cathedral and sat in the shade admiring the building. If you\u2019re on a budget it\u2019s worth knowing the war/arms museum nearby is free.",

          "This cathedral goes back to 1070s when the Vikings were around and Trondheim was the capital of Norway. It is a bit in your face with the church making so much money in the tourist trade with very high fees to see the church and so much stuff for sale.",
          "The cathedral is wonderful! stone exterior that is still being restored for the last 140 years. Bring your binoculars to look at the gargoyles and other carvings that seem to be at every possible location. Did not take the tower tour but that could not possibly have made the",

          "The Cathedral Church of Nidaros is built over (or near) the burial place of King Olav II whose death in 1030 established Norway as a Christian Kingdom. No visible traces survive of the earliest buildings on the site, but there is ample evidence of 12th, 13th and 14th century",
          "My husband reckons this cathedral beats anything he saw in Italy....you\u2019d have to say that\u2019s saying something.

          "This is a must when in Trondheim, make sure you buy the ticket that takes you to the dome or else, go to a concert inside it",
          "A beautiful cathedral, medival and humble. So unlikly so far north. The goal of the pilgrims,on their sanctuary north. Olav the holy king of Norway.",
          "This building is visible almost from each spot on the city center. To get inside you need to buy a ticket. Beautiful exterior especially at the entrance.",
          "Was going to do an interior visit but the cost put us off. Instead we just had a walk around the exterior. Very impressive with lots to see in the grounds. Would have definitely gone inside if it was more reasonably priced.",
          "A magnificent cathedral surrounded by a graveyard that was lovely to walk around. Unlike many cathedrals such as Notre Dame, it is light and airy inside. The many chapels and altars are all part of it being the burial site of St Olav. One altar in particular is worth taking a",

          "This beautiful Cathedral is fascinating, but there are blocked areas you must walk around, and you cannot take photos. It is the destination for pilgrims from all over Norway. You will enjoy the English tour. We didn't have enough time inside nor around the beautiful grounds.",
          "On a wet and windy Sunday, we visited this wonderful cathedral when our Hurtigruten ship docked for a few hours. It's about a 15 minute's walk from the dock, and well worth seeing - not a lot else to do as the town was really quiet! We were in awe of the interior of the",
          "Even if you're not a church/cathedral tour person, this is an impressive place to see. Centuries to build, the story of Nidaros is very interesting - not only from a historic point of view, but how its a pilgrimage site. I highly recommend the English tour - a nice way not only",
          "This medeival cathedral, the most northern in the world. This was the most beautiful cathedral I have seen in Norway. So majestic and filled with about 1000 years of history. A moment I will treasure forever :)",

          "Be sure and give yourself enough time to take in all the aspects of this spectacular building. The pipe organ is absolutely remarkable. We were fortunate to hear it being played and to have a tour in English. By also visiting the Archbishops museum you get a more complete",

          "It looks like Notre Dame and is almost as grand (you need Paris for that). Definitely a major attraction in Trondheim and very beautiful.",
          "The Cathedral in impressive both on the inside and outside. The stonework is amazing and when you stand inside you just feel so small as you have the inside stone walls rise to the vaulted ceiling. If visiting Trondheim you simple have to visit the Cathedral.",
          "Beautiful gothic/medieval church. I was lucky enough to hear the organ being played whilst inside and the acoustics are incredible! Lots to look at inside and plenty of space to wander around. Unfortunately you are not able to take photographs which is a shame. When I went",
          "Norway's national shrine and Royal Benediction Church- some of the most amazing stained glass I have ever seen. It was built over several centuries between 1070 and 1300 so there is this sense of awe . The gargoyles outside are stunning in detail.",
          "An impressive building with some interesting features inside: the gigantic rose window and stained glass saints at the west end of the nave, the alter in the east and the Sami sculpture in the south transept. Outside the west front is powerful and the green spire stands out",

          "This cathedral is more than amazing than I expected, we were simply wowed by the sophisticated architecture itself. The medieval history of the cathedral is one of the most beautiful we have ever seen. Although we did not manage to do an inside tour, a round at the outside of",
          "This thousand year old cathedral has been burned down several times and reconstructed in the 19th century. It has an impressive organ which were able to hear. It is impressive inside and out.",
          "Of the cathedrals of the world, this may not be the most inspiring or beautiful, but it is worth a visit. We bought the all access ticket that also allowed us into the excavation museum and the crown regalia rooms. The cathedral is very dimly lit, and the interior walls are",
          "The front of this cathedral from the outside is jaw dropping. One of the most spectacular architectural sights I have ever seen. If going inside, buy the combined ticket for the crown jewels and the palace as well. It is 180kr, otherwise they are 100kr each. I would also",
          "We had been before but on this morning we were all invited in to hear the Organ played as a concert. Nidarosdomen is the largest construction in Norway from the Middle Ages. Don't miss the crown jewels or the burial tombs below.",
          "The Cathedral and the grounds are both beautiful. There is a charge to enter the Cathedral but the grounds are available without cost. A Tour Guide will take you through the entire Cathedral and explain the history dating from the 13th Century. St Olaf was buried here. NO",

          "Stroll the outside of this impressive medieval cathedral built over the grave of St. Olaf and stop at the Western Front to observe the glorious life-size figures of kings, prophets, saints, etc. The interior view of the Rose Window is stunning. Although it may distract you",
          "The history of Nidaros Cathedral is amazing as is that of Throndheim. I suggest visitors Google 1st, King Olav Tryggvason (968-1000) (note: aka, Olaf vs Olav), 2nd King & St. Olav (1015-1030)....AND, then when you get to the church visitor's center, inside you will find a",
          "My guide book states that it is only 1/2 mile from the Market Square. Having said that it must be another 1/2 mile to walk round it. The Original Church was erected around 1075. The oldest parts are late Norman & Gothic. Of particular note are the modern stained glass windows,",

          "Beautiful cathedral that seems a bit out of place. It's a very large, gothic cathedral, at the edge of town, with an amazing fa\u00e7ade and stained glass windows. It's an easy walk from the port, but will take 20-40 minutes depending on your pace. Admission to see inside the",
          "We planned our day in Trondheim around visiting the cathedral on English speaking tour. There were many tours at the same time, in different languages with independents sprinkled in. Very chaotic, although July was probably the busiest time. Some tours may have been private",
          "This is the best reason to visit Trondheim. The cathedral is absolutely amazing. There are events going on throughout the day, so go in the morning to plan your time there and in the other nearby museums. Your tickets are only good for one day.",
          "This was our second time visiting the cathedral, and this time we spent more time in the church to see all the sights. I'd strongly recommend the combination ticket, for the cathedral, museum, and crown jewels, although if you're really rushed for time, the cathedral is clearly",
          "Although similar to other gothic churches it is impressive and interesting. The guides are good at conveying the story of this place.",
          "If you are interested in history or medieval architecture this is a treat. The front of the building is staggeringly intricate with many saints statues. There are no pictures allowed inside at all. But the tour I took included a booklet with photos of the inside so no",

          "We visited this place while on a cruise. We knew that this was not a free attraction as is the case with many churches around the world. Finding out the very high cost of the ticket to visit this attraction convinced us it was not really worth it for us. We walked around the",

          "We learned so much about Viking and Norwegian history while touring the cathedral. We took the 30 min tour in English, claimed the stairs to the top and listened to the organ concert...all were amazing and well worth it! Climbing to the top is not for the faint at heart, steep",
          "bought the combo ticket with entrance to crown regalia. There was a guided English tour, which was informative. There are also info panels where you can learn more about the history, architecture and features of the Cathedral. Price is a bit steep, but the Cathedral is",

          "We did not expect such a large and impressive cathedral here. It cost about $25 for two of us just for the basic visit. But it came with a 30 minute guided tour in English, and was well worth it. Gorgeous organs and stain glass windows, but the altar and side chapels are less",

          "The size of this Catherdral is very impressive among the other structures in Trondheim. We especially enjoyed looking at the intricate fascade. We just missed the English tour so had to read from the kiosks inside and maybe we did not get the full impression because of this but",
          "In addition to touring the outside we also went inside but being pressed for time didn\u2019t take the walking tour. Very expensive for a short visit but it does help pay for the upkeep. The grounds are beautiful with plots of shady trees among the old headstones.",
          "Absolutely stunning Cathedral with charming local University students to guide,serve refreshments in the spacious cafe area. Unmissable experience.",
          "Worth a visit. Big, but among the smalles cathedrals in Europe. We heard a beatiful organ concert while in the church.",
          "There are rich details both outside and inside the cathedral, which you can spend hours studying. Unfortunately photos are not allowed inside, which limits the possibility to take home some of the personal memories. Coming back as a tourist 47 years after we got married in this",
          "With a wonderful view over Trondheim or Nidaros as it was called way back. You can't feel but humble to see how wonderful the construction of the cathedral is. The craftmanship is outstanding. If in Norway you can't miss it.",
          "The Nidarosdomen is Norways contribution to big old gothic architecture. There is not that much unique about this church, it is huge and has very elaborate stained glass. We went on a Saturday and enjoyed the free organ concert and a brief prayer service. This was formerly a",
          "We were on a guided tour in this imposing cathedral. Well worth visiting. I have been here for 50 years ago and the cathedral is still very impressive. Only one thing bothered me. Very near the cathedral they have built a huge visitor\u2019s center with ticket office and gift shop.",

          "This is a phenomenal cathedral!! This must have dominated the whole area when it was built - a demonstration of power! A ship from outer space \ud83d\ude00 The location down to the river is nice. I am glad I had the opportunity to see this.",
          "The churches and cathedrals from some time doesn't impress, me, but this time was different. Nidrsdome is awesome building, with very impressive space inside, and beautiful stained glasses.",

          "We got there in the late afternoon and were very impressed with the cathedral, grounds, and gift shop. Took a tour of the cathedral and were able to find out about the history of the structure by the interactive digital info center. The gift shop had a lot of great gift items.",
          "The tour was informative but not entirely necessary. There were no hidden panels nor facts that couldn\u2019t be gleaned elsewhere. Didn\u2019t go up and didn\u2019t go down. If you enter during a service you don\u2019t need to pay. It is quit spectacular in its own right.",

          "Try to visit when there\u2019s snow.....this massive medieval Cathedral looks especially romantic in a setting of blindingly white blanket. And do approach over the river by the old portal gate so that you can first admire the building reflections in the water. This is Norway\u2019s",
          "My walking tour ended at this Church of Trondheim. Beautiful and for me a magistraal building. I am sure will be coming back in Summer, when the weather is better. Snow and cold makes hiking a bit difficult.",

          "We stopped here whilst on a Norwegian Cruise and decided to have a look round the site. The architecture is very detailed and beautiful with the cemetery looking sort of gothic styled. You can enter the cathedral for a fee but we just enjoyed walking around the grounds.",
          "I went in the winter, there were few people so it that made for a better experience. It was quite peaceful. Afterwards we had first rate cake in the cafe that is attached to the cathedral",

          "We have been to Notre Dame, the Blue Mosque and have never been asked not to take photographs! We were not allowed to climb the tower or go down into the crypt! So, to walk into the Cathedral it cost us K90 each plus K50 for a guide book. Rip off!",
          "Considering that Oslo is the capital of Norway, it might be somewhat unusual then to find that the country's most significant cathedral is found almost five hundred kilometres away to the north. But when one considers that the history of Trondheim extends back at least five",

          "The view form the bridge is just amazing. I stayed in Trondheim for two weeks and passed by every day, but no borring at all. The reflection of the Nidarosdomen on the water boday, along colourful houses in the bachground was very satisfying. If you are in Trondheim make sure",

          "We only saw the exterior of this wonderful piece of architecture as part of a guided walking tour of Trondheim. We had noted in passing the ticket office/gift shop that it was possible to pay to go up the tower, and decided to retrace our steps after the tour in order to ascend",
          "This is the most important tourist attraction in Trondheim. The location is about 1.5km from the port where Hurtigruten ship docks. It takes about 20m to walk there. Alternatively one can take bus 3, 46 etc. from the bus stop not far from the port to reach the cathedral.",

          "A lovely Cathedral, with a striking rose stained glass window. Many other quite dark but impressive stained glass windows too. We had free entry because it was within 30 minutes of the Sunday main service, and enough time to get an overall good impression.",
          "Need to start off by saying it bugs me to pay to enter places of worship. This is not cheap to visit. It is an interesting cathedral given its place in the birth of Christianity in Norway. It is not particularly ornate, unsurprising as a Lutheran cathedral. However it was worth",

          "If you enjoy history and/or architecture, Nidaros Cathedral is a fantastic place to experience both. The cathedral and its grounds are beautiful, and it's conveniently located in the city center. We arranged to be at the Cathedral at a time when a tour was being given in",
          "The cathedral dominates the city. The short guided tour around it was very friendly and interesting. For me the best bit was paying a bit more to climb to the roof and walk around for good views of the city. But it was a bit scary and not for the faint hearted",
          "Fascinating history in this old cathedral - has had many reincarnations and still plays an important part in Norwegian culture. A combined ticket purchased from the centre beside the church will also allow you entry into the nearby Archbishop's museum and to see the royal",
          "We got a combination ticket for the cathedral and the museum. We took the first English tour of the day which offered a good deal of information. They don't allow pictures which I don't understand why. My husband enjoyed the organ concert at 1pm. This church is built to",
          "The guide (Emil) was speaking English with a smile, and did the outmost to spice up the legend of St. Olav, and I liked. He mixed knowledge with myths and stories from legends. The history of the cathedral came to life - it was funny!",

          "Great place, but be aware of their opening hours. We missed it as they closes at 14:00 on a Saturday in high season :(",
          "We walked over to the Cathedral while staying in Trondheim, and were glad we did, it's worth seeing. We got a combined ticket to see the church, museum, and crown jewels, all very nice (once you get the ticket, you can join the tours inside). Would definitely recommend visiting",
          "A \"must do\" in Trondheim. Free guides was a pleasure. They told the stories in a great way but not able to answer adittional questions.",
          "This is really a must-see in Trondheim. The middleage cathedral is well preserved and in active use. I recommend that you join a guided tour, as one of the skilled guides can tell you about the history making this cathedral so special here in the middle of Norway.",
          "The church is amazing no arguing about that. But I don't like you have to pay to visit a public church. Okay that you have to pay extra to go up in the tower but not the church. It is a holy place where you should have access and then you can donate all you want.",

          "You may have heard of it, but you must also visit. There are guided tours, but also electronic screen guides inside the church. Some few people at a time can climb up the church tower stairs, \"on your own risk\". Built in the 11th century, it is the northernmost medieval",
          "Amazing building outside, nice and quiet place inside. It was really nice to light candles and thinking about your loved ones. My 5 year old girl didn't like it inside. A bit exciting and she got a bit bored... And it was a bit scary to go in the basement for her. I don't",

          "We were shocked to see such a lovely cathedral in Trondheim. We had enjoyed a nice walk around the town after downloading the \"Trondheim walking tour\" off the internet. This was a great, inexpensive way to see the city; which is mostly flat and easy to walk. The tour ends",
          "It is really beautiful but I felt uneasy the whole time I was there. When buying the tickets your not told about the no photography rule yet once you step inside there are big angry signs every few minutes telling you not to take pictures. There are also staff in normal clothes",

          "Great Cathedral. Here's just to enjoy. The beautiful church room is probably the nicest in Norway. A certain day can come up in the tower. It gives a great view of Trondheim. Great on the outside too. A great restoration of all the figures has been performed on the outside.",

          "It was amazing to look around the Nidaros Cathedral at all the architecture. It was interesting to hear about the history of the cathedral from staff standing around. Staff at the entrance offered us a guide to borrow for our walk round so we could read about each area. These",
          "Many people have written about this church. It is one of the most beautiful churches we have visited, beautiful in its simplicity and its roman and gothic purest architecture. The colored glass windows are stunning and the two large organs (an old one and a modern one) are both",
          "An amazing place and one of the best gems of Trondheim. Spend the few extra dollars on the tour that goes up to the \"crows nest\" style walk along the main steeple. It is the best view of Trondheim. The only thing that could make it perfect is if we were allowed to take photos.",

          "Nidarosdomen is a beautiful huge gothic church in the centre of Trondheim. It is an easy walk from most of the hotels in the city and is has a nice park / cemetery around it. Nidarosdomen has lots of history and you can go for a tour in the catacombs if you want to know more",
          "We found the guides and other workers at the museum desks incredibly friendly and helpful. We had read that we would be able to hear someone on the organ at 1pm, but in fact, it is available for practice between 1 and 5, so there was no one there. However, the guides told us",

          "This is the reason we came to Trondheim, and it lived up to its expectations. Beautiful elegant cathedral that is Westminster-like, but more simple and not as cluttered. We took the English guided half hr tour-Hagan was very excited and knowledgeable as our guide. Perhaps less",
          "I have lived in Norway 26 years and this is my first time in Trondheim. The cathedral was amazing. Our guide who spoke English was from France, not that knowledgeable but I think he was new. Other than that, a good experience.",

          "Well worth the 90kr entrance fee. The outside is stunning with all the figures covering the complete wall. The inside is just beautiful and serene, especially the Rose window. Unfortunately photography is not allowed which is a shame. Tips for travellers: we walked from the",
          "Went to a cinema and got a free quiz and entrance at.the Nidarosdomen. This was another way to see the church. Fun for both kids and adults.",
          "The cathedral nearly died when Norway got swallowed up by Sweden, but the core of it survived to rebuild in a 19th century 'restoration' which was really a re-imaginatio of how the Vikings had built a gothic gem. Or rather, how the English architects and masons had built it for",
          "Every bit as good as stated in most guide books. Well lit and in excellent condition although photos and videos are supposed to be prohibited. Unless visiting on a Monday, buy the combined ticket for a one third discount on entry to the Cathedral, Archbishop's Palace and Crown",
          "Trondheim is a beautiful city to visit, best time is between may - oktober, for more things to do like boattrips and hiking. Nidarosdomen is probably one of the main reasons for coming to this city. On sundays there\u00b4s a chance of a ceremony during the day - and you can hear the",
          "I was part of a booked group and most privileged to have been treated to a mini concert and a guided tour by excellent guides. Lovely place to wander on your own, but I can highly recommend a guide for their knowledge and enthusiasm which was very infectious. No photography",
          "Building started almost a 1000 years ago. Some truly amazing details here. The Crown jewels are displayed next door. Too much to explain. You need to visit.",
          "Nidarosdomen is very old and worth visiting. You almost hear the prayers of our ancestors. You do not necessarily need a guided tour if you just want to experience the atmosphere. There is only one negative aspect - you need to buy a ticket to visit the church.",
          "During or trip to Trondheim, I attended a visit to \" Erkebispeg\u00e5rden & Nidarosdomen \" by Director NDR, this was a fantastic experience - and a must for anyone visiting Trondheim. The fantastic Organ was alos played for at least 20 minutes.",
          "As a local I still go every year for a tour. No tourguide tells the same stories, and they are all fascinating. Make sure to go to the tomb chamber down the stairs on the right(from main entrance). In the left corner there is a tomb stone of a viking woman, which in it self is",
          "Really enjoyable and informative tour and great architecture to be seen. Really interesting well worth the visit",
          "This is an obvious top ten sightseeing location in Norway and of course Trondheim's greatest tourist attraction by far. This is not a typical church in Norway and well worth a visit. Centrally located in Trondheim.",
          "This is the northernmost medieval church in the world. Tucked away within the arctic circle in the capital of the arctic, Tromso, this Church stood here for close to a thousand years (albeit it burning down to the grounds several times along the way). The church today is",
          "Even if you're not particularly religious, this cathedral is still worth looking at. The stain glass work is amazing, especially the Rose window.",
          "When in Trondheim, you simply cannot miss the greatest cathedral in Norway. Built on the site of the grave of the Holy King Olav, who (supposedly) Christened Norway, this magnificent church with all the stained glass windows must be seen. It has been beautifully restored over",
          "I enjoy the gothic style and the French influence statue on the front side. The cathedral was not open when I visited. Sure it is a sight to behold.",
          "people who've already been to sophisticated cathedrals might get little disappointed, but worth visiting, since its known as the oldest chathedral in Scandinavia(I'm not sure precisely but) I heard that you can reach the bell tower only during the summertime! As far as I",
          "Nidarosdomen is the biggest and the best place which i saw in my life. I was amazed with the architecture of this amazing building.",
          "Absolutely gorgeous cathedral. When we arrived it was before opening time and covered with snow. It was like something out if a fairy tale. The inside is one of the best I have seen in Europe. It also is now a special place for us as my boyfriend proposed to me out the front in",
          "Definitely worth a visit here. The cathedral is reminiscent of those on continental Europe, which makes the architecture stand out even more from the rest of Norway. If possible, you should try to catch a choir concert here.",
          "I visited Nidarosdomen as part of a private group. We were privileged to have a private organ concert. The cathedral is enormous, you truly feel small. The sound generated from the incredible organ is mind blowing. I will go again at the earliest opportunity.",
          "Visited on a tour of Trondheim. 90k to get in. We had an English speaking guide who told us about the history and architecture. You need to allow a good hour to go around inside if you wish to see everything. Be sure to study the statues outside. Easy walking distance to Centre",
          "The entrance fee is 90 NOK, would have been nice if there was a booklet or audio guide included. I hoped that there would be more information. The cathedral is already from the outside beautiful to look at with so many details and statues. The inside is quite gloomy but with",
          "We visited as part of an excursion arranged on our Hurtigruten cruise. The architecture is magnificent, both inside and out. Our tour guide (dressed in robes for tourist effect since the guides have no official relation to the church) spoke English with a heavy french accent,",
          "This is a great spot, probably the greatest church in Scandinavia. Perfect spot for goths and a must on the Norway trip.",
          "The cathedral itself is a wonder! Please be aware of opportunities for guided tours (fee based) on Saturdays/Sundays, free organ recitals and a number of other options like visiting the archbishop's palace museum including The King\u2019s Crown and the other coronation objects that",
          "I'm in the big S\u00e1mi choir which sung there with Nidarosdomen's Domkor, February the 6th on the S\u00e1mi People National Day and the 100 years anniversary for the first big S\u00e1mi Political meeting. That took place in Trondheim Febr. 6th 1917. It was amazing to be there and sing",
          "Went twice, once for a Jazz concert once for the organ concert and it was wonderful experience. The organs sounds really special and cool",
          "The place to visit when you are in Trondheim. The outside of the cathedral provides some amazing photography. Inside the cathedral photography is prohibited but there is so much to see that you will forget about this. Visit the inside during the day, and if you have a chance",
          "Although i am not a fan of churches, this is a great spot. Walking distance from the pier and well located for strolling by the canal. You can visit it inside as well, but not as a tourist for taking pictures..",
          "Spend an hour in front of the cathedral and just gaze upon all the detailed statues. They never cease to impress me ...",
          "It is a nice Cathedral, but it would be good with more information during the visit. Pricy entrance fee for the Cathedral and bispeg\u00e5rden so plan your visit. Seemed a bit disorganized inside during our visit, but it may have been related to Christmas preparation.",
          "We avoided the paid tour from the cruise ship, MS Spitzbergen, and walked through the town to the cathedral. We were glad we had walked as we were able to see more parts of the town than the other passengers. The cathedral commenced construction in 1070 AD and was completed in",
          "Beautiful architecture...but in the lonely planet travel book I had.. they had this building in Stavanger!!!",
          "We spent few days in Trondheim over the Christmas period and in part it was very interesting, if you are anything like me and are fed-up with Christmas jingles blaring out where ever you go the Trondheim is for you, if they do play these jingles it is not very loud because I did",
          "We were fortunate to have with us a friend and colleague who worked as a tour guide at the church while he was a student in Trondheim. We were given the grand tour and it was worth every kronor spent to access the place. No pictures allowed but your eyes were too busy trying to",
          "Gorgeous building, especially in night lightening framed with snowy branches of the trees. Excellent place for concerts, fantastic organs and acoustic, beautiful interier",

          "This cathedral is well worth a visit. It is rich in history and the Kings and Queens of Norway are crowned here.",
          "Authentic scandinavian masterpiece, absolutely a must if you are in Trondheim. It is of course the landmark of the town, bit it gives you the opportunity to hold back to the remote origin of this place, which is very important in hi-tech Norway.",
          "Fantastic church, very impressive and with a lot of history, on the inside fantastc glass paintings and outside the Western wall is uniq.",
          "This church is a must see and is one of most beautiful church in Europe. However no pictures are allow inside and that is a real shame.I have been to many countries in Europe and I like this one the best. Only two short blocks from the church, is the riverfront. You must walk",
          "Trondheim City dosent have that many turist attractions, but the cathedral is something one must visit if you are in Trondheim for the first time. Beautiful artwork both on interior and exterior. It contains a lot of history and two building forms both gothic and romanesque.",
          "This is well worth the visit and is a must for anyone visiting trondheim! You can buy a combined ticket to see the cathedral, the royal crowned jewels and the archbishops palace for 160 krons. Just seeing the architecture of the cathedral from the outside is stunning enough..",
          "An amazing and affordable experience in Trondheim. Recommended for both visiting people and locally who haven't had a tour inside. I was there for a guided tour and organ concert, and both were amazing.",
          "Surprisingly impressive and huge. Interesting architecture. Not far from city center and worth the short walk.",
          "If you find yourself in Trondheim you cannot miss the place. Impressive cathedral, with huge main area. Certainly location to visit if you walk around the city.",

          "I was baptised and confirmed in this church, it is a landmark in Trondheim! royals from all over the world come here to be crown",
          "This cathedral is a truly stunning piece of architecture. The surrounding grounds looked truly amazing, with the beautiful autumn/fall leaves, the colours contrasting nicely around the cathedral.",
          "The most beautiful and famous cathedral in Norway. Not the largest compared to many other European cathedrals, but one of the most beautiful, especially the sculptured west wall. During the latest refurbishing artists had to produce some new sculptures to replace damaged ones.",
          "This church has a very interesting architecture consists of magnificent exterior and amazing interior design.",

          "Great to view! The saints on the west front and spectacular to look at and the interior carving is beautiful. Largest organ i have ever seen. Buy a combined and see the museum and crown jewels. Well worth it",
          "In my opinion one of \"must to visit\" in Trondheim. Beautiful historical building, both from the outside and the inside. I've been to a special tour (at the beginning of semester) including places which are not opened to visit most of the time. Visit was for free, with guided",
          "Amazing and incredible! How big and impressive this building is. A big part of norwegian history. I will recomand visit Nidarosdomen if you are i Trondheim. Or at least check out some of the history. It's really interesting.",
          "Had a guided tour of the interior of this spectacular Cathedral and spent another day wandering around the exterior gazing upwards and through the cemetery. The store/cafe beside the cathedral has several interesting books on facade and the interior that are worth picking up.",
          "Of course, this cathedral is very spectacular, especially if ou know that it is the most northern gothic cathedral in the world! There are also a lot of good spots for picknicking provided. But charging up to 10\u20ac entry to visit the inside? Come on that is way too much and a real",
          "We were in Trondheim for 4 days and visited the front of Nidarosdomen every day, and decided on our final day that we absolutely had to go in. We were actually only able to visit for about 5 minutes, because they were preparing to close for the day, but those 5 minutes were",
          "An amazing piece of architecture. Best to go late in the afternoon when the sun highlights the amazing west facade. Grab a bench. Sit down and try to imagine how they build it back then. A stroll around through the cemetery has a special feeling.",

          "This is a glorious Catherdral set in a lovely garden setting. It looks part Norman part gothic design . The front / west wall is covered in fantastic stone carvings of I suppose important people from the past . The Cathedral really dominates the skyline and I believe no",
          "I visited the place they had service on sunday, food was provided, very heavy breakfast, beautiful design from outside",
          "We had an overnight visit to Trondheim on our way from the arctic circle to Oslo and enjoyed the whole city, it is a great place to be. The cathedral is imposing obviously but what was really appealing was the care with which it has been renovated and is now looked after. Most",
          "Imagine this spectacular sight in midevial times. make sure to go up to the tower or to the small chapells inside the walls (guided tour).",
          "This is Trondheims cathedral. It has all the grandeur that the kings need. Because they are baptised here, married here, crownd here and in the end buried here. Siriously go to see this cathedral. It deserves the time.",

          "This church is an incredibly complex exterior so be sure to walk around it and enjoy its beauty as well as the gardens.",
          "This is a beautiful, seriously gothic cathedral, the price of many Norwegians, dark, medieval and worth a visit if you are in Trondheim. It is not worth a commitment of a good deal of time if you are not planning to visit Trondheim. If you are coming to the city by cruise ship,",
          "The guide book is very well written, without being too detailed - it's worth buying one when buying your ticket to enter the cathedral from the adjacent Visitors Centre. The organ is magnificent, and we were fortunate in hearing an organ recital which was excellent.",
          "A very nice cathedral in the downtown of Trondheim The pink window, the chapel, the difrrent doors were all very beautiful",
          "Very beautiful and a must see in trondheim, but please respect the \"no sightseeing during sermons\" rule and keep to the guided schedule.",
          "The cathedral is very impressive, especially the Exterior West Wall with all of the statues. I loved how the cathedral has expanded over the last thousand years. I really do not see why they do not allow you to take non-flash photos of the inside. The rose colored window was",

          "It's an amazing place, I think if you're visiting Trondheim you need to visit.",
          "Beautiful cathedral inside and out. If you like medieval architecture, spend time looking at the tiny details everywhere in the stone. Also take the time to go downstairs into the crypt. If you are able, I highly recommend the towers tour. You will see amazing views and learn a lot of interesting stories about the church.",
          "There's so much story in this place.. Don't forget to visit when you're in Trondheim.",
          "A Great monument of faith has been turned into a hollow building only meant for the attraction and business income. I really dont get the church feeling needed for a local community the way they change straight from a baptism and over to a place for tourists. Almost no room for taking Pictures after the baptism.",
          "Fantastic church well worth the visit with Hurtigruten cruise",
          "Amazing, the interior of this structure was even more impressive than the exterior. Roaming the surrounds respectfully viewing the monuments placed in memory of those lost over past centuries was moving, interesting. A must to see.",
          "An amazing cathedral. You need to visit this one!!",
          "Beautiful cathedral and one of Trondheim's must-sees! Especially the front facade is really unique with all the embedded statues! We could not get inside as there was a wedding ceremony taking place but it was nice to see the Trondheim bride come out of the church afterwards.",
          "This is an excellent Gothic cathedral. Unfortunately cannot take pictures inside. There are organ recitals throughout the day and for a fee you can climb the tower every half an hour (tickets sold inside on the right).   This was worth it for the views of the city. The climb is narrow and may not suit everyone.",

          "Very nice church, worth the visit! Look out for the runes written on walls - spectacular.",
          "The most northerly medieval cathedral in the world - but reminds me of others around Europe - I guess there was a pretty standard design that long ago.",
          "To be such a old memorial, it look like it has still retained a lot of its previous glory as a Cathedral. It looked very pretty, both visually inside and outside.\nFirst time I've ever laid eyes on a Cathedral, and it was such a stunning \u2026",
          "Would have loved to be able to spend a lot more time there.",
          "Beautiful cathedral. I didn\u2019t go in, but believe you have to pay to go in and they also have tours at 10am. The cathedral is surrounded by a graveyard and is on the place of King Olaf. Very lovely to admire and gaze it.",

          "One of the biggest catherdrals of Scandinavia. Beautiful building , organ concerts, and other classic music events. It is worth to join to a guided tour to discover the hidden beauties f the cathedral.",

          "Very cool! Amazing architecture and we got to hesr the beautiful bells chime!",
          "Apparently, this is one of the top touristic destination in the country, and I agree with that. The long history of the cathedral enriched with devotion on both to the faith and to arts. Make sure to not miss this place if you are visiting Norway, especially if you are in Trondelag.",
          "Amazing church! I love that piece of art \u2764 good localisation (2 min from center, 15 min from Sentralstassjon afoot), if you were in Trondheim, you must see this place! For me, that church is the most beautiful building in this city.",

          "Amazing history we walking from the pier to here and was well worth the 20min walk",
          "The facade is exceptional and should be viewed on any trip to Trondheim. Entry I to the cathedral is quite expensive, roughly \u00a310 and no photography is permitted in the church.  The archbishop's palace next door is well worth looking at externally. The entry to that is a similar sum.",
          "\"Must see\" in Trondheim. Amazing and huge building.",
          "Beautiful cathedral. Amazing window paintings. Great organs (yes, two). Sacred atmosphere. Long history of pilgrimage, and the story of St. Olav's final resting place is fascinating. Well worth visit!",
          "Trondheim's most significant momument and one of the oldest churches in Scandinavia. The church was built on the site of the first king of Norway and the church is visible from basically all parts of the city. The detail used to build and \u2026",

          "Beautiful old cathedral with great discribtion, too bad photos are not allowed because the view inside is amazing. Did not have the time to climb the tower but I guess that is also worth it. I know they need the money but entrance fee is a little high if you don't have a discount",

          "I love this place... Gothic, I love the history behind the culture and the people behind this cathedral",

          "Even if you are not interested in history or a christian this is something you have to see and experience. The sense and atmosphere when you enter is breathtaking. I could have spent days here. Go on a guided tour or just walk around or sit \u2026",

          "The cathedral is amazing but I think it is not fair to pay even just for watching inside if you do not want to do a guided tour",
          "Beautiful architecture and history that is written on glass panes at the front make it a must see",
          "Beautiful stone church, the crypt is worth paying a small extra fee for. Great cafe next door to eat a small bite before entering a marvellous engineering and architectural jewel. Also visit the southern wall for some 15 century grafitti by \u2026",

          "Beautiful cathedral, excellent visitors' center. The tours however aren't all the time, and if you don't come in the summer you can't go to the upper floor of the cathedral. Worth the admission, but don't expect a museum tour. Just to be clear I haven't been on a tour of the place, so I can't speak for that aspect.",
          "Just amazing a stunning place to meditate!",
          "Paid entrance. Perfect designed and a lot of details hidden from the first look. I enjoyed to visit it.",

        "wiki": "Kristiansten Fortress (Norwegian: Kristiansten Festning, historically spelled Christiansten) is located on a hill east of the city of Trondheim in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway, named after Christian V of Denmark-Norway. It was built after the city fire of Trondheim in 1681 to protect the city against attack from the east. Construction was finished in 1685. It fulfilled its purpose in 1718 when Swedish forces laid siege against Trondheim. The fortress was decommissioned in 1816 by king Charles XIV John.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nTrondheim was traditionally protected with fortifications by the river Nidelven and Skansen, but the city was vulnerable to attack from the east. The Fortress was therefore put on a hill to protect the city centre and control the area from Ila to Lade.  General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, who was chief inspector of fortifications, was responsible for the new town plan of Trondheim after the great fire of 18 April 1681. He also made the plans for the construction of Kristiansten Fortress.The fortress was built during the period from 1682 to 1684 and strengthened to a complete defence fortification in 1691 by building an advanced post Kristiandsands bastion in the east and in 1695 with the now vanished M\u00f8llenberg skanse by the river Nidelven. These fortifications were encircled by a continuous palisade and thereby connected to the fortified city. In 1750 the fortress was modernized with new bastions and casemates to protect against mortar artillery. Two new isolated defensive works were also built to the east - Gr\u00fcner's and Fr\u00f8lich's redoubts - but they are hardly visible today.The main building featured in the picture is the defensive tower - Donjonen - with artillery, quartering and stores was the centre of the defences. After decommissioning in 1816 it was location of the fire watch, and since 1997 as a museum.\n\n\n== Great Northern War ==\n\nIn the final days of the Great Northern War, Karl XII of Sweden initiated a second invasion of Norway in the fall of 1718. While Karl XII led his main army in an attack from the south at Fredrikshald, an army under General Carl Gustaf Armfeldt (or Armfelt) was sent into Tr\u00f8ndelag to seize Trondheim. Armfeldt advanced against Trondheim, which was defended by an army of 6,900 men under Vincens Budde. The Swedish forces were resisted both by Norwegian forces and by the people of the countryside, who bitterly recalled the previous Swedish occupation of Tr\u00f8ndelag. Provisions were not available, and the Norwegian winter set in. Although he reached the city and laid siege, the strength of Kristiansten Fortress and other fortifications was such that he chose to retreat toward Verdal. Karl XII issued a sharp rebuke and ordered Armfeldt to take Trondheim. Although Armfeldt's forces surrounded Trondheim, Budde's forces were able to keep him at bay. Camping in the open and poorly fed, many of Armfeldt's troops fell ill and his capable forces were reduced to 4,000 men. When Karl XII was killed in December by a bullet at Fredriksten Fortress, Armfeldt's forces retreated to Sweden. On their way back across the mountains, almost the entire army was lost, mostly because of snow, cold temperature and a strong blizzard; the retreat has been likened to Napoleon\u2019s from Moscow for the severity of casualties.\n\n\n== The 20th century ==\n\nThe Norwegian war flag with the badge denoting the union with Sweden was hauled down on 9 June 1905, and the \"pure\" war flag was hoisted instead, with full military honours and gun salutes for both flags. On 18 November 1905 a twenty-one gun salute was again fired from Kristiansten Fortress to proclaim the election of Prince Carl of Denmark as the new King of Norway under the name of Haakon VII of Norway. The flag of union with Sweden was hauled down and the Flag of Norway hoisted.\nDuring German occupation of Norway in World War II the Nazis executed a number of Norwegian patriots at Kristiansten.\nThe fortress was the official place of execution of convicted and condemned traitors and war criminals following the legal purge in Norway after World War II. The notorious Henry Rinnan was executed here on 1 February 1947, and nine of his followers afterwards, eight of them on the same day in 1947.\n\n\n== View ==\nFrom this fortress you can see \"strandlinja\"; a topographical line along the hills of the Bymarka which was formerly beaches and sea cliffs. The \"line\" can be seen stretching out in the hills around Trondheim, but is best seen from the fortress, towards By\u00e5sen.\n\n\n== References and notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKristiansten Festning (in Norwegian)",

        "wiki": "Tr\u00f8ndelag (Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0153\u0302nd\u0259l\u0251\u02d0\u0261]) (Southern Sami: Tr\u00f6\u00f6ndelage) is a county in the central part of Norway. It was created in 1687, then named Trondhjem County (Norwegian: Trondhjems Amt); in 1804 the county was split into Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag and S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag by the King of Denmark-Norway, and the counties were reunited in 2018 after a vote of the two counties in 2016.The largest city in Tr\u00f8ndelag is the city of Trondheim. The administrative centre is Steinkjer, while Trondheim functions as the office of the county mayor. Both cities serve the office of the county governor; however, Steinkjer houses the main functions.Tr\u00f8ndelag county and the neighbouring M\u00f8re og Romsdal county together form what is known as Central Norway. A person from Tr\u00f8ndelag is called a tr\u00f8nder. The dialect spoken in the area, tr\u00f8ndersk, is characterized by dropping out most vowel endings; see apocope.\nTr\u00f8ndelag is one of the most fertile regions of Norway, with large agricultural output. The majority of the production ends up in the Norwegian cooperative system for meat and milk, but farm produce is a steadily growing business.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe Old Norse form of the name was \u00der\u01ffndal\u01ebg. The first element is the genitive plural of \u00fer\u01ffndr which means \"person from Tr\u00f8ndelag\", while the second is l\u01ebg (plural of lag which means \"law; district/people with a common law\" (compare Danelaw, Gula\u00feingsl\u01ebg and Njar\u00f0arl\u01ebg). A parallel name for the same district was \u00der\u00f3ndheimr which means \"the homeland (heim) of the \u00fer\u01ffndr\". \u00der\u00f3ndheimr may be older since the first element has a stem form without umlaut.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPeople have lived in this region for thousands of years. In the early iron-age Tr\u00f8ndelag was divided into several petty kingdoms called fylki. The different fylki had a common law, and an early parliament or thing. It was called Frostating and was held at the Frosta-peninsula. By some this is regarded as the first real democracy.\nIn the time after H\u00e5kon Grjotgardsson (838-900), Tr\u00f8ndelag was ruled by the Jarl of Lade. Lade is located in the eastern part of Trondheim, bordering the Trondheimsfjord. The powerful Jarls of Lade continued to play a very significant political role in Norway up to 1030.\n\nJarls of Lade (Ladejarl) were:\n\nH\u00e5kon Grjotgardsson, the first jarl of Lade.\nSigurd H\u00e5konsson, son of H\u00e5kon. Killed by Harald Greyhide.\nH\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, son of Sigurd. Conspired with Harald Bluetooth against Harald Greyhide, and subsequently became vassal of Harald Bluetooth, and in reality independent ruler of Norway. After the arrival of Olaf Trygvason, H\u00e5kon quickly lost all support, and was killed by his own slave, Tormod Kark, in 995.\nEirik H\u00e5konsson, son of H\u00e5kon. Together with his brother, Svein, governor of Norway under Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark from 1000 to 1012.\nH\u00e5kon Eiriksson, son of Eirik. Governor of Norway under Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark from 1012 to 1015.\nTr\u00f8ndelag (together with parts of M\u00f8re og Romsdal) was briefly ceded in 1658 to Sweden in the Treaty of Roskilde and was ruled by king Charles X until it was returned to Denmark-Norway after the Treaty of Copenhagen in 1660. During that time, the Swedes conscripted 2,000 men in Tr\u00f8ndelag, forcing young boys down to 15 years of age to join the Swedish armies fighting against Poland and Brandenburg. Charles X feared the Tr\u00f8nders would rise against their Swedish occupiers, and thought it wise to keep a large part of the men away. Only about one third of the men ever returned to their homes; some of them were forced to settle in the then Swedish Duchy of Estonia, as the Swedes thought it would be easier to rule the Tr\u00f8nders there, utilising the ancient maxim of divide and rule.In the fall of 1718, during the Great Northern War, General Carl Gustaf Armfeldt was ordered by king Charles XII of Sweden to lead a Swedish army of 10,000 men into Tr\u00f8ndelag and take Trondheim. Because of his poor supply lines back to Sweden, Armfeldt's army had to live off the land, causing great suffering to the people of the region. Armfeldt's campaign failed: the defenders of Trondheim succeeded in repelling his siege. After Charles XII was killed in the siege of Fredriksten in Norway's southeast, Armfeldt was ordered back into Sweden. During the ensuing retreat, his 6,000 surviving threadbare and starving Caroleans were caught in a fierce blizzard. Thousands of Caroleans froze to death in the Norwegian mountains, and hundreds more were crippled for life.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nThe county is governed by the Tr\u00f8ndelag County Municipality. The town of Steinkjer is the seat of the county governor and county administration. Both the county governor and Tr\u00f8ndelag County Municipality, however, also have offices in Trondheim.\nThe county oversees the 41 upper secondary schools, including nine private schools. Six of the schools have more than 1000 students: four in Trondheim plus the Steinkjer Upper Secondary School and the Ole Vig Upper Secondary School in Stj\u00f8rdalshalsen. The county has ten Folk high schools, with an eleventh folk high school being possibly being opened in R\u00f8ros, with a possible start in 2019.\n\n\n=== Districts ===\nThe county is often sub-divided into several geographical regions:\n\nNamdal, the greater Namsen river valley\nFosen, the Fosen peninsula and surrounding areas\nInnherred, the areas surrounding the inner Trondheimsfjorden\nStj\u00f8rdalen, the Stj\u00f8rdalen valley\nTrondheim Region, the areas surrounding the large city of Trondheim\nGauldalen, the Gaula river valley\nOrkdalen, the Orklaelva river valley\n\n\n=== Towns and cities ===\nThere are nine towns/cities in Tr\u00f8ndelag, plus the \"mining town\" of R\u00f8ros.\n\nTrondheim (in Trondheim municipality)\nSteinkjer (in Steinkjer municipality)\nStj\u00f8rdalshalsen (in Stj\u00f8rdal municipality)\nLevanger (in Levanger municipality)\nNamsos (in Namsos municipality)\nVerdals\u00f8ra (in Verdal municipality)\nOrkanger (in Orkdal municipality)\nBrekstad (in \u00d8rland municipality)\nKolvereid (in N\u00e6r\u00f8y municipality)\nBergstaden R\u00f8ros (in R\u00f8ros municipality)\n\n\n=== Tr\u00f8ndelag ===\nThere are 38 municipalities in Tr\u00f8ndelag.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe region's official theatre is the Tr\u00f8ndelag Teater in Trondheim. At Stiklestad in Verdal, the historical play called The Saint Olav Drama has been played each year since 1954.  It depicts the last days of Saint Olaf.\nJazz on a very high level is frequently heard in Trondheim, due to the high-level jazz education in Trondheim. Trondheim is also the national centre of rock music; the popular music museum Rockheim opened there in 2010. Tr\u00f8ndelag is also known for its local variety of rock music, often performed in local dialect, called \"tr\u00f8nderrock\".\n\n\n=== Food and drink ===\nThe region is popularly known for its moonshine homebrew, called karsk. Although officially prohibited, the art of producing as pure home-made spirits as possible still has a strong following in parts of Tr\u00f8ndelag. Traditionally served mixed with coffee, local variations apply. In southern regions, people tend to use normal filter coffee, while in the north they choose to serve karsk with as weak coffee as possible.\n\nThe \"official dish\" of the region is sodd which is made from sheep or beef meat and meatballs in boiled stock. The Norwegian Grey Troender sheep is an endangered breed of domesticated sheep that originated from Tr\u00f8ndelag in the late 19th century. There are currently approximately 50 individual animals remaining and efforts are being made to revive the breed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDemographics of Tr\u00f8ndelag\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Tr\u00f8ndelag travel guide from Wikivoyage\nFacts about Tr\u00f8ndelag from Mid-Norway European office\nInsular artefacts from Viking-Age burials from mid-Norway.

          "Nice to see how structures and buildings were built in the olden times. A simple but rich peek at history. A must see place esp. if you want to \"excperience\" the exhibit and not just to see them. The farm area is an exciting place for children as it is allowed to pet them.",

          "I could not get into the Museum itself but the park like setting of the whole place is really nice. They have recreated some 18th Century settings there. Since my visit was on the Midsummer Solictice there was lighting the traditional bonfire and the place was really crowded.",
          "I visited the folk museum on midsummer's day. Great place, lots of traditional buildings from various eras in Norwegian history. The museum is set in a nice park which definitely adds to the experience. Don't miss the museum of beer and brewing across from the cafe and gift",
          "If you have just 1 hour to see Trondheim - then this is where you should go. We liked it even better than the cathedral in the centre of the city. You will walk within the limits of a fairly large park, with paths to all the old wooden houses, which stem from different time",

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway. Today the bunker houses various archives, among them the city archives, the university and state archives. More recently, DORA has been used as a concert venue.\nKristiansten Fortress, built 1681\u20131684, is located on a hill east in Trondheim. It repelled the invading Swedes in 1718, but was decommissioned in 1816 by Crown Prince Regent Charles John.\nA statue of Olav Tryggvason, the founder of Trondheim, is located in the city's central square, mounted on top of an obelisk. The statue base is also a sun dial, but it is calibrated to UTC+1 so that the reading is inaccurate by one hour in the summer.\nThe islet Munkholmen is a popular tourist attraction and recreation site. The islet has served as a place of execution, a monastery, a fortress, prison, and a Second World War anti-aircraft gun station.\nStiftsg\u00e5rden is the royal residence in Trondheim, originally constructed in 1774 by Cecilie Christine Sch\u00f8ller. At 140 rooms constituting 4,000 square metres (43,056 sq ft), it is possibly the largest wooden building in Northern Europe, and has been used by royals and their guests since 1800.\nA statue of Leif Ericson is located at the seaside, close to the old Customs Building, the cruise ship facilities and the new swimming hall. The statue is a replica, the original being located at a Seattle marina.\n\n\n=== Nidaros Cathedral ===\n\nThe Nidaros Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace are located side by side in the middle of the city centre. The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral. On 24 May 2002, their daughter Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise married the writer Ari Behn in the cathedral.The Pilgrim's Route (Pilegrimsleden) to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at Nidaros Cathedral, has recently been re-instated. Also known as St. Olav's Way, (Sankt Olavs vei), the main route, which is approximately 640 kilometres (400 mi) long, starts in Oslo and heads North, along Lake Mj\u00f8sa, up the valley Gudbrandsdalen, over the mountain range Dovrefjell and down the Oppdal valley to end at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to pilgrims and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the aegis of the cathedral, which awards certificates to successful pilgrims upon the completion of their journey.\n\n\n=== Other churches ===\nThe Lutheran Church of Norway has 21 churches within the municipality of Trondheim. They are all a part of the Diocese of Nidaros, which is based in Trondheim at the Nidaros Cathedral. Many of the churches are several hundred years old, with a couple which were built almost 1,000 years ago.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Sankt Olav domkirke is the cathedral episcopal see of the exempt Territorial Prelature of Trondheim.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe Trondheim Art Museum has Norway's third largest public art collection, mainly Norwegian art from the last 150 years. The National Museum of Decorative Arts boasts a large collection of decorative arts and design, including a great number of tapestries from the Norwegian tapestry artist Hannah Ryggen, as well as Norway's only permanent exhibibition of Japanese arts and crafts. Sverresborg, also named Zion after King David's castle in Jerusalem, was a fortification built by Sverre Sigurdsson. It is now an open-air museum, consisting of more than 60 buildings. The castle was originally built in 1182\u20131183, but did not last for long as it was burned down in 1188. However, the Sverresaga indicates it had been restored by 1197.The Trondheim Science Center (Norwegian: Vitensenteret i Trondheim) is a scientific hands-on experience center. The NTNU University Museum (Norwegian: NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet) is part of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. There are also a variety of small history, science and natural history museums, such as the Trondheim Maritime Museum, the Armoury, adjacent to the Archbishops's Palace, Kristiansten Fortress, the music and musical instrument museum Ringve National Museum, Ringve Botanical Garden, the Trondheim Tramway Museum, and the Jewish Museum, co-located with the city's synagogue, which is among the northernmost in the world.\nRockheim (Norwegian: Det nasjonale opplevelsessenteret for pop og rock, The National Discovery Center for Pop and Rock) opened at the Pier in August 2010. It is located inside an old warehouse, but characterised by an easily recognisable roof in the shape of a box. \"The box\" is decorated by thousands of tiny lights that change in a variety of colours and patterns, and is a landmark in the cityscape - especially on dark winter evenings.\nKunsthall Trondheim was inaugurated at its permanent premises on Kongens gate in October 2016.\n\n\n=== Prison ===\nVollan District Jail (Norwegian: Vollan kretsfengsel) was a jail during the nazi occupation of Norway and was used to imprison both prisoners of war and criminals. Vollan was not considered a concentration camp. In a summary of prisoners of war in Norway, numerous prisoners were registered at Vollan. Once of its roles was as a transit camp for political prisoners. Many prisoners were taken from Vollan to Kristiansten Fortress and shot. The prisoners at Vollan were interrogated at the Mission Hotel in Trondheim.  Some were also interrogated by Henry Rinnan and his gang. It was closed in 1971 after the opening of Trondheim Prison at Tunga.\nTrondheim Prison (Norwegian: Trondheim fengsel) is a prison that belongs to the Northern Region of the Norwegian Correctional Services.  The prison can house 184 inmates.\nIt consists of four main departments: \n\nNermarka (\"Tunga\") \u2013 closed department\nDetention department (no: Forvaringsavdelingen) at Nermarka\nLeira \u2013 open division.  Through joint positive activities, the individual inmate on certain conditions teaches to be responsible with other people.\ndivision Kongens gt. \u2013 halfway house, located in downtown Trondheim.\n\n\n== Government ==\nThe municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elect a mayor.\nOn 1 January 2005, the city was reorganized from five boroughs into four, with each of these having separate social services offices.

          "This is an excellent place to visit and it has been really well set up. The history of the church is presented beautifully and the excavation showing the original foundations also interesting. Totally recommend it for those wanting to learn more after visiting the cathedral. In",
          "This display of artifacts and archaeological discoveries from the Archbishop's Palace was extremely interesting. The descriptions were very helpful and included English options. As a previous reviewer noted, it is worthwhile purchasing a dual ticket to see both Nidaros Cathedral",
          "Buy a combination ticket in the visitors shop for both the cathedral and the palace. The palace ticket will get you into a few museums in the complex that provide a history of the kings and bishops of Norway. There is also information about the military history of the country. I",
          "We found this place right by where we parked. It is easy to access and is worth a walk around the outside. We did not venture in as there was a big queue and the weather was lovely to pass the time outside in the grounds.",
          "The Archbishop\u2019s Palace has been both the residence of the most powerful men in Norway and a military installation. The museum features original sculptures from the Cathedral, and tells the colourful history of the building through archaeological discoveries found on the site.",
          "Originally, the museum was once the home of 27 Archbishops, later a military barracks, and now a museum with three separate buildings housing the museum itself, the royal regalia and the war museum. The palace is the oldest such building in Scandinavia. In the palace museum,",
          "If you go to the Cathedral, give yourself plenty of time to also walk around the 'Palace' and the museums. Buy the combination ticket for cathedral and the palace gardens and see... A fantastic collective of regal history, episcopal history and army history. This visit proved to",
          "There are many aspects of the museum. As the local head of the church, the title holder was often in competition with the local ruler. I was surprised at several stages to find out the office minted its own coins, the very image of the archbishop thereon meant to show power. You",
          "Another must see when in Trondheim. Buy combo ticket for the Cathedral and the Palace. Take guided tour! You learn much in easy way.",

          "Old statues. Extensive information on the remodel of the cathedral. Very limited view of the Norwegian crown jewels.",
          "If you are interested in archaeology and/or history of this area, you should visit this museum. There are artifacts from various periods in the Cathedral's history, all very well presented. As many have suggested, get a combination ticket and see all the attractions at this",
          "This interesting museum contains medieval artefacts from what was the Archbishop's palace prior to the reformation. There are also archaeological remains including of a mint.The exhibits are fascinating and housed in a beautiful building which is part of a quadrangle including",
          "We got the combination ticket for Archbishops Palace (home of Norway's Crown Jewels), the Nidaros Cathedral and Archaelogical museum. Having seen several museums on our cruise already, we found the museum a little boring. However, the Archbishops Palace was well set out with",

          "So much to see, displayed in spacious setting. Sculptures from the cathedral are on display. Excavated parts of an old mint under the palace floors got my interest and being a bit foot-weary, enjoyed the video. Make time to watch it.",
          "Like many, we came here on the combination ticket. It is one for the archeology purists but will not be everyone's cup of tea. Lots of fragments upstairs and the site of the archbishop's mint downstairs. Do watch the video about how the cathedral is preserved. That was very",
          "The Museum is free to enter unlike the Archbishops Palace. Trondheim is a delightful City, possibly the only one in Norway with an air of the medieval about it. The Population of Trondheim was 181,000 in 2013. It is a fair walk from the Cruise Ship Terminal to the Archbishop's",
          "I was ready to leave not long after arriving, then we found the film about the history or the cathedral and its ongoing renovations. Fascinating.",
          "With the combined ticket, you can enter the museum and check out the exhibits. Be sure to check both upstairs and down. The old mint on the lower level is very interesting (also interesting that the church was allowed to mint coins for awhile). You can also get a good idea of",
          "The museum in itself is interesting, but remember to take a look at the video running in the auditorium, explaining about the building and renovation of Nidarosdomen. It is a very interesting presentation. The archaeological exhibits at the museum is also very interesting, so",
          "The ticket for the Archbishops Palace is available as a package ticket with the Crown Regalia and the Cathedral - so it won't really cost you anything extra to see this museum as well. Some old statues and gargoyles are displayed very elegantly and there is a sizable exhibit on",
          "I enjoyed this museum much more than I thought I would. After seeing original parts of the cathedral here, I went back to the cathedral. They also have miniatures of the cathedral and how it expanded over time. The archbishops palace itself is a lovely structure, and there is",
          "Most of the palace is used to display artefacts from the excavation. It is reasonably interesting but probably only worth the price of admission as part of the combo ticket. The crown jewels that are also part of the combo ticket are quite impressive.",
          "This palace built in the 1100s is the oldest secular building in Scandinavia and has original sculptures from the palace. There was also the remains of a mint inside that was used for 2 decades. The museum had a miniature of what the mint looked like and also dioramas of how",
          "Pressure of time cut short our visit (closes at 15.00), but what we saw impressed. Much of what is here is the result of extensive archeological investigation, and provides an insight into medieval life and times. You probably need to have an interest in history to fully",
          "Some old stones and sculptures from previous versions of Nidaros cathedral. It should be free as addition to visiting cathedral, but it cost 25Euro. The same sculptures You can see directly on cathedral. Maybe it will be interesting for archaeologist or sculptors but not for",
          "The museum shows original sculptures from Nidaros Cathedral and archaeological finds.One can see the Archbishop's mint, where coins were stamped, just as it was found by archaeologists. This was the world\u2019s northernmost and smallest coin workshop. The coin production was",

          "Visited the archbishop's palace a little reluctantly but had automatic entry after purchasing a combined entry ticket to save some money. But this place was really well presented and provided a great overview of the history of the cathedral which was really quite fascinating.",
          "This is a site with a lot of history. If you purchase a ticket to see the Archbishop's Palace Museum, you can join one of the tours for free, and they will provide a tour of the Archbishop's Palace as well, taking you into areas which are otherwise inaccessible. Like the other",
          "It's located right next to Nidarosdomen, also the Crown Jewels and war museum are located there. At the Nidarosdomen ticket and gift store you can buy tickets to entry to all of these museums and it is worth it! The war museum is free.",

          "An excellent museum explaining all the various functions (including non-religious) functions of a Cathedral in medieval times. Contains many interesting artifacts.",
          "It was such a great addition to our visit to the cathedral. Best to get a combined ticket from the visitors center for just 160 krons. This gets you access to the cathedral, the royal crowned jewels and the archbishops palace :)",
          "A good way to learn about the history of Trondheim and the Nidaros Cathedral. Very interesting video presentation about the restoration and maintenance of the cathedral.",

          "This museum houses original pieces from the cathedral, which was devastated by fires in the 1700s. It's interesting to see what's left of them, and see how they were used as inspiration for the cathedral's restoration. I recommend viewing the the cathedral first, then go to the",
          "The archaeology that has been discovered gives a fascinating insight to life of the people in medieval times as well as the ecclesiastical role of the bishop and the restoration of the cathedral.",
          "Well worth a visit. A wide range of pieces of the old ruined cathedral on the ground floor were eclipsed by exhibits on the lower level. As others have indicated the film is worth seeing and puts the building's history into perspective.However enjoyment would have been enhanced",
          "Sadly, as one will learn from excellent short guided tour, the former museum burnt down in the '90s and lost all the relics. However, from the ashes were discovered more history once lost in time. This museum displays some amazingly old statues from the nearby cathedral. Just",
          "Wonderful museum. The historical video in the lower level would have been more useful to see before perusing through the whole buildings since it had a lot of good info. Nice rainy day activity. Free English speaking tours at 2:30pm. Recommend combined ticket with the Nidaros",
          "The Arch Bishop's Palace is an impressive building from the outside. Inside there is mainly modern conference facilities.",

          "The palace is a complex of buildings which includes various museums. The palace museum has underground remains shoeing the outline of the original palace with its workshops. There is a medieval mint which is unique. An interesting video shows craft work on the cathedral. The",
          "Nicely laid out museum with artefacts from the past. Interesting display showing you how the cathedral changed over the years. Movie complemented the experience.",
          "What a rip off - we felt quite cheated. It is really just a bunch of rocks and ridiculously expensive. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!",

          "Definitely worth a visit combined with a Cathedral tour. Some very interesting artefacts to see including an area of original tiled flooring in situ from the Bishop's very own Mint, various large original stone carvings (a fabulous carved stone dragon to look out for) and a",
          "Such a lovely peaceful place full of history and wonder. Seeing the old with the new and in such a lovely setting was fantastic. Well worth a visit and specially in the snow",
          "I'm not positive how people are getting all these pictures of Trondheim's crown jewels, as photography is not permitted. Fascinating history of coronations in Norway. The upstairs looks at a history of the cathedral itself, and has a particularly interesting area dealing with",
          "Staff very helpful with information in English. She was very proud of the palace and its history. The Armory was closed and we did not have enough time to spend at the cathedral and both of us just went to an Oslo museum and saw Viking and Egyptian jewelry. Again, well presented",
          "As people have said the Crown Jewels are in part of the old residence of the bishop. A small display but a good one and well put together. The resistencia museum is not always open and is bit included in the three way ticket for cathedral, Crown Jewels and a museum with part of",

          "The main museum ( through the arch and across the square on the left) was deserted when we went. We spent 40 minutes looking at the original statues and stonework kept there. Then very few people were visiting the Crown Jewels. One can get right up to the small glass cases and",

          "The Archbishops palace is a bit of a mixture with both the Crown jewels of Norway and an extensive display of the remains of various buildings that have been on the site over the centuries. If you like ruins and seeing how they relate to current building this is a good spot.",
          "The exposition at the Palace itself will not be so interesting if you have not visited the Cathedral. These two objects go together like bread and butter, so it is very much worth to buy all-including ticket. You will know more about the Cathedral, its history, building and",

          "Interesting museum near the cathedral. The combination ticket is very reasonable and will get you into the cathedral, this museum, and the Crown Jewels.",
          "What I liked the most was the small models showing the history of Nidarosdomen from 1031. Also the old coin maker hut with an accompanying model was nice.",
          "I took the combined ticket for the cathedral, the Archbishop museum and the Crown gewels. I personally found the cathedral quite common in the inside (but is really worth seeing from the outside) and I have been genuinely surprised by the Archbishop museum. I thought it will",
          "Although the cathedral, itself, is merely average, the Archibishop's Palace will knock your socks off! The museum has a plethora of information about the cathedral going all the way back to medieval times. It's also got remains from old statues that were found in the ruins of",

          "This lovely little museum has an added bonus - included in the ticket price is a free tour around the Archbishop's Palace (I'm not sure how many each day are done in English - ask at the ticket office). After you have done your tour spend some time taking in the medieval finds",
          "In the limited time that we had after visiting Nidaros Cathedral, we only managed to see the outside of the Archbishop's Palace, but what we saw was beautiful. Lovely architecture, spacious and peaceful. If we are ever back in Trondheim, we will certainly pay it a longer visit.",
          "Wow, what a hidden gem. Plan to spend plenty of time at this well planned and thoughtfully organized museum. You will spend hours that seem like minutes at this museum. It has plenty of well-displayed artifacts from quite a number of eras. My 11 year old loved it as much as",
          "While the building, mostly of recent reconstruction is indeed the former archbishop's palace, it is mostly devoted to an excavation of the foundations and bits of statuary from the old cathedral. Visually,there is little to see even for an architect or medieval scholar where,",
          "Lots of interesting things to see and some excellent explanatory exhibits. Archaeological ruins worth some time. Could have done with more written information.",
          "This museum had many artifacts from the middle ages, sculptures, and interresting things. Its between the nidelva river and the nidaros Cathedral. Not far away you might also see the crown jewels.",
          "This museum is worth visiting. They have a lot of artifacts and the stuff about the royals is also fun. I think if you are visiting the cathedral, you should definitely buy the combo ticket and go here as well.",
          "By the combo ticket, which gets you into the three sites at the Nidaros complex. The museum is very well done, with an excellent must see film. Lots of excavated stuff on display, and an interesting exhibit about how this place was a mint way back when.",
          "The mint was well explained. We were glad that the place had not been given the Disney treatment. The combined ticket with the Cathedral and the Crown Jewels was worth having.",
          "Well laid out and gives an insight into an important part of the history of Trondheim. A combined ticket was worth having.",

          "This museum does a good job of explaining the history of the cathedral and the Trondheim area. Separate from the museum, but included on the tour if you buy the all-inclusive ticket is the display of the Norwegian royal crown jewels.",
          "If you are visiting Nidaros Cathedral you may as well buy the 100kr combo ticket which includes entry to the Archbishops Palace next door. Both buildings are over 900 years old and full of Norwegian history. Many kings were crowned in the cathedral and in the palace you can see",
          "The Archbishop's Palace is directly beside Nidaros Cathedral. You can get a combination ticket for 100kr if you wish to visit both. Otherwise just admire their impressive exteriors. The buildings are over 900 years old. Inside the Archbishop's palace you can see the crown",

          "The various exhibitions including the archaeological work from the site, miniature recreations of how the site developed and the coin-minting operation were very interesting as was the insight into the Norwegian royal lineage and the crown jewels. A very interesting way to",
          "Worth getting the combined ticket, you get to see the old stained windows, the Crown Jewels and robes and read the for ever changing of the monarchs. In the other building you can see the old excavated mint and some of the original coins and other archeological finds too as well",
          "Most of the items on displayed are those found during renovation and excavation. Miniatures of the complex through the ages are well worth seeing.",
          "There is plenty of Scandinavian history to be learnt here. The Crown Jewels are displayed very nicely. One can get a discounted ticket for the palace,museum and cathedral .",
          "The museum concerns the building and restoration of the great Nidaros Cathedral, which I recommend to see both before and after a visit to this museum - you'll discover so much more the second time! The museum is very modern and stylish, located in a reconstruced building on the",
          "The museum has a good collection of Norwegian royal jewelry, including the crowns and other royal insignia. It is hosted in a building which is a thousand of years old.",
          "The best part was understanding that some of the archbishops had their own coin-minting operation in the middle ages. What a great way to demonstrate you have some political authority! The museum is set on the old minting ruins, so the archeological dig is right there to be",
          "You can't just buzz through this place. I took one whole day out of my business trip on a weekend and went to the arch bishops palace and the cathedral. Seeing the crown jewels and artifacts from long ago was amazing!!",
          "We did a tour of the Palace as part of a general visit to the Museum and Cathedral. The is a fascinating collection of relics and of course the Crown Jewells should not be missed.",
          "This whole area took me back to tales and movies of Vikings and the like. To the era when the Church was allpowerful . We are revelling in the abundant evidence of past cultures everywhere in Norway",
          "I loved the building and the exhibits, that get more interesting as you delve further into the museum. There's a video presentation too that's really interesting - allow an hour for your visit.",
          "Visited this together with the church and the military museum; very informative, good displays; especially the models which show clearly how the buildings developed.",
          "The Archbishop's place is more of historical value just for surviing for so long. This small museum doesn't contain much of interest but it does put the time frame of Nidaros/Trondheim into perspective. There's a nice restaurant just behind it.",
          "It had a lot of great things to see, with so much history to learn about in the tour. I found it fascinating.",
          "Good movie about the palace area. Lots of information about history of the cathedral and palace. There is an entry fee but includes the other museums in the palace.",
          "I found the bottom floor with the old mint the most interesting though all floors have some worthwhile objects to see. Worth a visit",
          "Royal regalia is on display here which is worth a look. However, the story boards on the history of the rulers of Norway is interesting and gives a good background for other museums on site.",
          "Good displays, including King's/Queen's coronation jewels. Provided good insight to both local day-day life, politics and power balance.",
          "The museum introduces to the activities of the Archbishop's Palace in the Middle Age. Built on the ruins of the southern wing of the Palace after a fire in 1983, the museum presents the results of archaeological excavations. We can discover the artisan workshops. I was",
          "If ever in Trondheim, you must visit the chatedral and the Archbishops museum. I used to live nearby for 2 years, but never got thired of the amazing building, the history and found new details every time I visited. It is located in the city centre, so easy to find. Make sure",
          "The presentation is nice, but I was missing some more written information. It was worth visiting before going into the church itself, giving more of a backdrop to the experience.",
          "Same again, not too bad and you do have to keep yourself occupied while in such a small town. So please take a look",
          "The guides (mostly students) were very enthusiastic and well-informed. Restoration of the buildings was well done and museum was inventive.",
          "The Archbishop's Palace is a place you should visit even if you only have a few hours to spare. The exhibition is about archeological finds around the area. There is also a video room with a great movie about Nidarosdomen. It is in Norwegian, but with English subtitles. A",
          "It is the place to be there, it is very quiet, large it is not over-crowded. You can enjoy of the birds, the trees and the flowers.",
          "Enjoyed this place very much. We combined this tour with that of the Nidaros Cathedral, which is just across the church yard. We paid separate admissions. There are several buildings open for tour here, but we only had time for the Crown Regalia Museum, where the Norwegian Crown",
          "Very nice museum as part of an all in one ticket to see the cathedral .not crowded .crown jewels are very nice.next door is a nice small free entrance military museum .",
          "The museum is very nice. The courtyard is also excellent for concerts.",
          "Very nice to learn and understand the history of the great Nidaros Domkirke. There are pieces of the original church and a miniature showing how the church began on viking age and how it grew bigger during time. Also check the royal jewerly.",
          "I had too little time here, it closes at 2 pm. I loved to see some of the original statues and figures (partly destroyed) from Nidarosdomen up close. Also the models of Erkebispeg\u00e5rden from several ages.",
          "The palace (or rather residence) and especially the museum gives a first-rate documentation of its dramatic history, which collegates to Norway's history.",
          "I did like the history of the church in the museum here. The mint that was discovered was also a highlight. Definately worth seeing if going to Nidaros."

        "wiki": "Ringve Museum is Norway's national museum for music and musical instruments, with collections from all over the world.\n\n\n== Background ==\nRingve Museum is located in the historic Ringve Farm in Trondheim. Ringve Farm was the childhood home of the Danish-Norwegian nobleman, Peter Tordenskjold. It is situated in a park on the Lade peninsula just outside Trondheim with a view over the Trondheimsfjord, the park forming botanical gardens run by NTNU (the Norwegian University of Science and Technology). The first house on the site was built in 1521, but the current group of buildings dates from the 1740s onwards.\nWhen the estate was auctioned in 1878, it was purchased by the Bachke family and one of the sons, Christian Anker Bachke (1873-1946) acquired the estate in 1919. In late 1919, he married Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 Victoria Rostin Bachke, an artist who fled from the Russian Revolution. The couple had no children but put their considerable energies into their love of music and assembling a collection of historical musical instruments, which now numbers around 1,500 instruments, alongside other artifacts associated with music \u2013 pictures, recordings.The museum is based on the private collection of founder Victoria Bachke and was opened to the public in 1952. Jon Voigt (1928-1997) succeeded Victoria Bachke as director in 1963 and continued until 1997. Over the years many famous musicians visited Ringve, including Artur Schnabel, Lilly Krauss, Ignaz Friedman, Percy Grainger and Kirsten Flagstad, as well as the artist, Edvard Munch.\n\n\n== Exhibition ==\n\nThe public exhibitions are divided in two parts: the Manor House and the Barn.\n\n\n=== The Manor House ===\nThe period interiors of the Ringve Manor House provide the setting for themed rooms of working \u2013 mainly keyboard \u2013 instruments. In this section, open by guided tour only, the guides (often graduate music students) play an appropriate piece of music (or extract) as the tour proceeds.\nThe first room is called the Mozart room and contains a spinet, clavichord and a domestic or house organ, from the 18th century. A Murano glass chandelier hangs from the ceiling.\nThe next room is called the \u2018Beethoven\u2019 and contains a harp piano of 1870 by Dietz, and a piano of type favoured by Beethoven.\nA room dedicated to Chopin comes next, with examples of the composer's preferred pianos, as well as a death mask and casts of his hands. There are also watercolours by George Sand and memorabilia about Chopin and Liszt. A card table and sofa that came from Chopin's Paris home, and which were inherited by his Norwegian pupil Thomas Tellefsen are on display.\n\nUpstairs there is a room based around singers Elisabeth Wiborg and Adelina Patti and includes a piano which Patti insisted on being accompanied. This is followed by a display of Hardanger fiddles, a \u2018Grieg\u2019 room, a room of instruments associated with church and worship, and finally a room of curiosities, including a Cecilium, a Norwegian-made barrel-organ, musical toys and a Janko piano.\n\n\n=== Fire ===\n\nThe manor was badly hit by a fire in the attic and second floor on 3 August 2015.\n\n\n=== The Barn (Museet p\u00e5 L\u00e5ven) ===\nThe collections on display in the Barn are divided in two parts:\n\nInstruments mainly associated with western classical and popular music over four centuries. A Kirkman harpsichord of 1767, an Erberle viola d\u2019amore of 1755, a five-octave Stein piano of 1783, a soprano saxophone by Sax (son) of 1907, along wide early electronic instruments and a 1948 jukebox.\nFolk instruments from all around the world, including a Runebomme (a type of Sami drum), a Tibetan zang-dang (horn), a nadomo (arched harp) from Congo and hardanger fiddles.\n\n\n== Ringve Botanical Garden ==\n\nThe Ringve Botanical Garden was established in 1973. The botanic garden has three main parts, the 19th-century garden, the arboretum, and the systematic section. The 32-acre (130,000 m2) botanical gardens consist of an arboretum (species from the Northern hemisphere) around a lake, a floral maze representing a systematic presentation of perennial plants, a Renaissance (herbal) Garden and, in front of the Manor House the historical \u2018English\u2019 garden of the 1800s.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Norway\nList of music museums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Other sources ==\nGuldahl A.S., Guttormsen S., Kjeldsberg P.A., Krouth\u00e9n M.

          "There are really two parts to this museum, each of which would be worth the price of admission. First, we went on a guided tour of the original mansion with lots of instruments and antique furnishings. Our guide, in historic costume, played many of the instruments and sang",

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway.

The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral. On 24 May 2002, their daughter Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise married the writer Ari Behn in the cathedral.The Pilgrim's Route (Pilegrimsleden) to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at Nidaros Cathedral, has recently been re-instated. Also known as St. Olav's Way, (Sankt Olavs vei), the main route, which is approximately 640 kilometres (400 mi) long, starts in Oslo and heads North, along Lake Mj\u00f8sa, up the valley Gudbrandsdalen, over the mountain range Dovrefjell and down the Oppdal valley to end at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to pilgrims and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the aegis of the cathedral, which awards certificates to successful pilgrims upon the completion of their journey.\n\n\n=== Other churches ===\nThe Lutheran Church of Norway has 21 churches within the municipality of Trondheim. They are all a part of the Diocese of Nidaros, which is based in Trondheim at the Nidaros Cathedral.

The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway.

The statue is a replica, the original being located at a Seattle marina.\n\n\n=== Nidaros Cathedral ===\n\nThe Nidaros Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace are located side by side in the middle of the city centre. The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral. On 24 May 2002, their daughter Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise married the writer Ari Behn in the cathedral.The Pilgrim's Route (Pilegrimsleden) to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at Nidaros Cathedral, has recently been re-instated. Also known as St. Olav's Way, (Sankt Olavs vei), the main route, which is approximately 640 kilometres (400 mi) long, starts in Oslo and heads North, along Lake Mj\u00f8sa, up the valley Gudbrandsdalen, over the mountain range Dovrefjell and down the Oppdal valley to end at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to pilgrims and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the aegis of the cathedral, which awards certificates to successful pilgrims upon the completion of their journey.\n\n\n=== Other churches ===\nThe Lutheran Church of Norway has 21 churches within the municipality of Trondheim.

        "wiki": "Rockheim (also called Det nasjonale opplevelsessenteret for pop og rock, The National Discovery Centre for Pop and Rock, and Det nasjonale museet for popul\u00e6rmusikk, The National Museum for Popular Music) is Norway's national museum for popular music from the 1950s to the present. It is a division of Museene i S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag (S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag Museums) and is housed in a former grain warehouse in Trondheim. It opened in 2010; since 2013, the director has been Sissel Guttormsen. The museum also has a virtual presence, Virtuelle Rockheim, which launched in 2009, and since 2011 musicians and groups have been chosen for the Rockheim Hall of Fame.\n\n\n== History and administration ==\nThe idea for the museum goes back to 1998; the Ministry of Culture began planning eight years later and in 2007 Bratter\u00f8kaia AS won the commission to create it. It was to have opened in 2009, but completion of the building was delayed by a contractor bankruptcy and a fire. It officially opened on 5 August 2010.Rockheim is housed in a 1919 grain warehouse in Trondheim. To roughly double the space available, a new sixth floor was added in the form of a cantilevered 'box', which is clad in glass decorated with reproductions of album covers and with changeable back-lighting provided by 13,000 individually controllable LEDs; the public can affect the colours by using cellphones. A \"black box\" building for performances was also added; the design envisaged this being covered by climbing plants. The architects for the conversion were Pir II and for the grounds, Agraff AS. The conversion was awarded the City of Trondheim's 2010 building award. The building has 400 square metres (4,300 sq ft) of floor space, of which half is exhibit space. The building and installations cost 300 million kroner.\nThe museum is a division of Museene i S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag. It was headed by Arvid Esper\u00f8 during planning and construction and until 2011, when Petter Myhr became the director; he was succeeded in 2013 by Sissel Guttormsen.\n\n\n== Permanent and virtual exhibits ==\nThe primary mission of the museum is to preserve and document Norwegian popular music. The permanent exhibit, for which the lead designer was Canadian Stacey Spiegel, takes the form of a journey through Norwegian music and cultural history from the 1950s to the present. It occupies 320 square metres (3,400 sq ft) in the building's top-floor box, and devotes a room to each decade. The exhibition has many interactive components. Visitors first encounter an interactive map of Norway, can select the videos shown in each room, and there are three discovery rooms: in the Ronni Room they can try playing guitar with guidance from Ronni Le Tekr\u00f8, and in the Hiphop Room they can experiment with DJing, graffiti art and breakdancing. In Virtuelle Rockheim, launched on 21 August 2009, they can manipulate an avatar to explore a selection of the exhibits in 3D. Spiegel, who also designed the virtual museum, predicted in 2008 that Rockheim would be \"the world's most technically sophisticated virtual museum\"; it was Norway's first online museum.\n\n\n== Temporary exhibitions ==\nThe museum opened with a temporary exhibition of photographs by Robert Meyer titled Icons of the 60's. Other temporary exhibitions have been Jukeboks! (jukebox), Wenches Verden (on Wenche Myhre), Innenfor/utenfor (inside/outside; photographs by Peter Beste) and Teigens Tivoli (on Jahn Teigen).\n\n\n== Hall of Fame ==\nThe Rockheim Hall of Fame honours individuals and groups for their contributions to Norwegian popular music. Inductees must have debuted at least 25 years before and are chosen annually by a jury. a-ha, \u00c5ge Aleksandersen, Jokke & Valentinerne, Wenche Myhre and Alf Pr\u00f8ysen were the first to be inducted, on 5 September 2011.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of music museums\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Norwegian)\nOfficial website (English)\nVirtuelle Rockheim",

          "We spent almost two hours travelling in time from 1950 to 2018 getting to know all kinds of instruments, music equipments from gramophone and jukebox to electric piano and iPod. We visited 1960\u2019s garage and 1980\u2019s heavy metal rehersal place. Singers and bands were mostly",
          "Interesting, beautiful museum, interactive and cool. The guides are full of knowledge and are thrilled to show you more stuff and walk with you if you wish.",
          "A must-visit if you are a music fan, and well worth it if you are not. Situated near the ferry port, train and bus stations this museum is an interactive delight. Lots of hands on displays for those who are young and young at heart. Rooms set up in the styles of the decades 50s",
          "We visited this museum, which was very close to where our cruise ship docked, and found it really interesting and interactive. We are from the UK and all the interactive panels could be changed into English.",
          "This is basically a museum, but also an activity centre, including a concert hall. When the name indicates rock, it is actually more than that. For Norwegians it is a look-back to a broader entertainment long before rock music was common. A lot of the exhibits are interactive",
          "Nothing interesting. Few rooms where You can listen music and few instruments. It is interactive museum, so it means that You can use some things, but the problem is that there is not a lot of devices , so it mean that in many situations You can only look when somebody else is",
          "I loved most of the museum even though there was a lot of Norwegian music history there was still a lot for people from other countries to enjoy. I enjoyed the interactive displays and seeing similarities in Norwegian music history with British music history. There was less of",
          "If you are a Norwegian music fan, than this is the place for you. For me it is ok, but you can shelter from the cold weather during my hiking on Sundays by visiting its museum to warm up.",
          "A great interactiv music museum. Great view from the cafe. Friendly and knowlegedable staff. Mostly Norwegian artists.",
          "So much lost potential here. I went to Rockheim expecting to learn a lot about Norwegian popular music. Instead, what I got was mostly a wanky multimedia experience with old touchscreens and laser pointers that basically only played music videos, songs, and showed pictures",
          "Do not select Rockheim's restaurant as the location for large Christmas dinner gatherings. It gets hot, noisy and crowded. The tiny buffet table, tucked away in a corner, can only take about 6 people at a time. I'm guessing there was no other option since we were a large crowd",
          "This was a great nostalgic trip through music history as experienced in Norway. The exhibits are arranged chronology from the 60\u2019s through to present day. interactive participation is required to play various clips and videos to work. Great way to spend a rainy afternoon.",
          "We would have visited anyway but if you have some time to kill on a rainy day in Trondheim this is a place to go. Loads of history of music for every age. Glad that we visited.",
          "You need to know Norwegian popular music. Lots of nice activities and exhibitions if you do (or if you\u2019re interested above average). New people will take over the cafe from 2018. That will be a treat.",
          "Rockheim is a world class museum. It has state of the art, interactive displays covering all eras of Norwegian popular music. It's really a blast to explore and hands-on interact with the various exhibits, transporting you back in time and place. For nostalgia fans it is like",
          "I was not sure what to expect from this museum, but a lot of Norwegian music history, and it's a lot more than that. Almost every floor has an interactive part, you get to travel through history by decades and also by genres. It's all so very well planned that you get to enjoy",
          "Far above average from a museum standpoint, given the excellent structure, interiors, interactivity, and wealth of the collections. If you're even remotely interested in music you'll find this place interesting, especially if you do not have great knowledge of Norwegian pop",
          "The museum deals with Norwegian music from the 1950 to modern days. It has much interactive settings and you can choose music and videos from a variaty of Norwegian artists. If you are very interested you could probably spend a half day here. There is a also rather high price",
          "Short visit in the Rockheim Museum Trondheim. Music history of his own, rock history of Norway. A lot of things to go trough, to touch, to look, to play. I was a hip-hop DJ for a minute, also a bass-player for 5 minutes, a singer for 30 seconds (I'm very bad in singing!) and a",

          "Great modern rock museum. In this relatively new museum there is a lot of great information about modern rock music. Especially from the 60's and upwards to today's music. Many great taboos where it is encouraged to participate interactively.",
          "Incredibly interesting and comprehensive history of music from the 50s with hands on media reflecting wprld and local music, instruments, bands etc. Housed in a reconverted warehouse. Nice buffet lunch available on the top level with views of the docklands",
          "This place is really worth a visit! It's central in Trondheim and you can bring the whole family. I sometimes go there with both friends and family as we are interested in music. You can experience, and see how the different times of music was, and there are also many cool work",
          "Very stylish museum with lots of interactive displays on different genres and decades of Norwegian music. Reminds me of Abba museum in Stockholm. Remember to reserve enough time! I went on the last opening hour and have to go back another time! It surely wasn't enough. It also",
          "Had a fun couple of hours. They have a few floors of fun interactive music. From all genres and years",
          "Walk slowy through Norwegian music from 5 - 6 decades - take your time and enjoy! Interacive - fun and music ... music .. music Friendly guides with lots of knowledge. I will return! ... a couple of the services need maintenance.. but that is a small detail...",
          "After wondering Trondheim we found this place, and what with music being a very important thing in my life, we definitely needed to go in. It was very fun and interesting for anyone who loves music, Rockheim honours all their Norwegian musicians, I particularly enjoyed the Black",
          "You can travel through the different music styles in time. See and hear many instruments from history. In this museum you can also uncover your own creativity: try all kinds of musical instruments, sing, mix music, make graffiti.",
          "Nice interier, good food, many space for big groop. Good view from the 4th floor. Was here together with a big group of Youth on an event Quite near to Scandic Nidelven Hotel",
          "Not being very familiar with the Norwegian rock and pop scene, this museum does not say me much. I guess if you are into Norwegian music it could be nostalgic. This place could easily be skipped over by foreigners visiting Trondheim. Lot of nice interactive features though.",
          "This is an unique museum in Trondheim. If you love music like pop, rock, jazz or blues, this is the place for you. It started up as a crazy idea aming some local musicians, but now it is a museum in world class.",
          "Wonderful place for those of us fond of music. Interactive displays that took us back to the days of our youth. I had no great expectations of my visit, but was greatly impressed. Nice souvenir shop with \"different\" souvenirs. Helpful, knowledgeable and very enthusiastic staff.",
          "Very interesting and surprisingly quiet place. There were around 6-10 more people with us excluding staff. This meant we could spend as much time as we wanted taking part in the interactive exhibitions and generally enjoy our visit there. A gem of a place.",
          "This was a nice place to visit and the staff we saw were clearly very enthusiastic and helpful about it. There's a clever use of technology to help you interact with the exhibits. We made the wrong assumption that every floor would be like the 6th floor where you start the tour",
          "This is the temple of music in the city. If you are in the mood for live music, here is the only good option in the city.",
          "This museum was nominated as one of the world's best museums when established. Use the combination of modern technology and physical instruments and items in a very good way. Also a very nice cafe on the top floor.",
          "Rockheim is a fun and interactive museum that also offers a great view of the Trondheim fjord from the good restaurant on top of the museum. Rockheim is sure to bring back good memories for most adult Norwegian visitors, and there are also many fun activities for kids, but the",
          "Really nice museum, this is an interactive place where you can discover the history of work through your moves! It's divided into different rooms, each of them represents a decade in rock history and the visit is really compelling. It will take you at least 2hrs to visit it",
          "Sadly we only had about 30 minutes to look around before we had to rejoin our ship. This fantastic museum only opens at 11am !! You could spend a couple of hours. Fabulous interactive rooms and displays. From 1950's, 60's 70's right through to early 2000's. incredible musical",
          "Went there early sunday to take my son aged 7 for their kids walking tour. Sorry for them my son was the only one showing up this sunday, but they managed to mage a great tour for us, telling an showing off the stage, photoexhibith, practice rooms,hidden/locked rooms with",
          "Having worked with band members of A-ha before, it was obligatory to visit Rockheim whilst in Trondheim, and I stupidly thought I could spend an hour there then go to Nidaros Cathedral and some art galleries, but you really do need to spend some time there. I really enjoyed the",
          "It is amazing how they had include so many interacting places and instrument. I could try any instrument even the old ones. It was possible to even record my own band. They have sounds and videos from everything since the 50th. Fantastic. Recommend to go with friends for good",

          "So I did not go for any concert here, but the building has a nice sit down behind it and is the best place in the entire city to watch the legendary midnight sun. Walk all the way around the building, to the end of the deck and sit and enjoy the view.",
          "The national museum of popular music, located by the fjord. An excellent exhibition, made and kept with great love and dedication, very insightful and entertaining. Interactive no end: you can touch, move & play everything)) I expected maybe a couple of photographs and the odd",
          "If you love rock & roll then visit the Rockheim. A bit out of the way but give it a try. The history of rock and of norwegian rock stands here. Very nice conserts are, also, taking place here.",
          "If you love music definitely go there ! It's really interestingly made. Very interactive and shows you a lot about Norwegian music history.",
          "At face value the museum appears simple, almost inadequate, however, when scratching the surface layer after layer are revealed, and you can keep digging into obscure details for hours, if you like! Part of the exhibition is dynamic, so you can come back for more every half year",
          "Walked around this special modern building. Unfortunately it was closed. Nice to see the artist pictures; brought some nice memories.",
          "Nice and interactive museum, perfect for music oriented or not. Fun for children as well as their parents! Extremely great staff! :)",

          "Very beautiful and interactive museum, perfect to discover the music history of Norway and northem countries. But I was a little disappointed by the instrument testing, the sound wasn't as good as it should be, and I coul'nt hear well what I was playing. The ideas are very good,",
          "Plan to spend quite a few hours at this Rock Music Museum. It is fantastic and really gives a long and complete history of Norwegian Rock Music and has a great section on Eurovision. Lots of hands on interactive stuff here! Rock on!",
          "This museum is maybe the best oneTrondheim has to offer. It is very modern and very interactive. Experience the musical history of Norway, including all styles of music, not just rock. You can play any band instrument yourself, mix your own tracks, take a virtual bus ride and",
          "Nice and interactive museum showing the development of music throughout the centuries. It is only showing Norwegian bands and artists though. If you want to learn about the Norwegian music culture, it is perfect. If you want to recognize bands and artists, and you are not from",
          "If you don't feel like ging inside a museum, at least take a walk to see the impressive building. Might be more interesting if you are Norwegian.",
          "If you love music love Eurovision and have some basic knowledge of music in Norway then a visit is a must. High tech exhibits great music clips and videos and opportunity to try out the instruments. Our favourite was the karaoke for local artists including Eurovision. Great",
          "Fun place with a lot of interactive stuff. Videos, learn to play rock riffs on a guitar, hear a lot of music from norwegian bands. The problem is that most of theese bands has never been known outside of Norway, so it might not be so interesting for foreigners.",
          "Great and funny museum i loved it, You Can do whatever you want and listen all the times. I Will return for sure.",
          "Was invited to the Rockheim for a private dinner reception. We had a great feast on the top floor. Following dinner we were treated to a special concert in the music hall with great acoustics.",
          "I went there with a friend of mine and it was my second time there. It was fun to discover new things I didn't see the first time. The place is so interactive and fun. You point at things with lazors and music or information appears. You can try to be a dj and play in a rock",
          "Want to see the history of Norwegian Rock Music? This is the place. From early rock to today`s hero`s. Lots of activity's and of course lots of music. Fun for both kids and grown ups. Take a time in the restaurant to experience the great view over the fjord and over the city.",

          "Don\u2019t miss the Trondheim famous music museum. You will not only be fascinated with the interactive technological exhibit but also with the structure of the building in which the roof is decorated with graphic designs that change colours. You will get to learn the history of the",
          "Nice put up as you view different sections, for each 10 years, starting from the 50ties. Could have been easier and explained on what you could push to get films and music to run. But when we found out, we had a lot of fun!",
          "As an attraction the museum was great, but the concept of Norwegian popular rock music may appear thin if you are not familiar with it and know what you are looking for. However, I was immediately impressed by the size of the exhibition and the interactive effects. For anyone",
          "I just happened to stumbled on this place and went in. I found that the whole place is interactive from the moment you walk in the displays. The first attraction is activated using your body you select items. Then when you walk around there is different areas for each decade",
          "This museum is fun, fancy and interactive. Part of the exhibition is regularly changed. One will not be bored at Rockheim, even if you are deep into music or not.",
          "A good place to hang out on a cold December day in Trondheim. You really get a good look at Norwegian music history. It's interactive, it's exiting, but in a calm atmosphere.",
          "It is interactive, very nice although quite specific for Norwegian. The reference to international music are welcome. Nice to be able to test music instrument. I enjoyed playing the drum for the first time.",
          "We're spoiled. We traveled to Norway at Eastertime and it was quiet. Luckily though, many attractions remained open. We managed to enter Rockheim through the wrong door and went in the service entrance. (Leave it to our family) We arrived on the top floor to a spectacular",
          "This is Norways national rock museum. Why it is situated in Trondheim is to us completely uncomprehensible. The actal exhibitions are nice, but where are the customers? It must be because it is in Trondheim. It is very hard to understand the logic behind this for all intents and",
          "Absolutely Excellent ! You need more than a couple of hours to enjoy every experiments ! The people here are really nice anf help you understanding how to evolve into this living museum where you are able to touch, walk, sit, laser point everything ! Highly recommanded",
          "This museum focuses on popular music and musicians of Norway from 1950s through 2000s. It was great interactive from relying on your body movements to start some of the videos and the use of lasers to highlight points of interest....to a section that lets visitor play musical",
          "After recovering from the walk from the centre to Rockheim, you stand in a giant entrance with a map of Norway floor to ceiling through the 6 floors of exhibit, showing of regions claim to musical fame. Starting at the top in the 1950's and working through the many interactive",
          "Nice place to go if you are interrested in norwegian rock history. It fits for all ages, but older children will gain more experience from the visit.",
          "A nice afternoon out great interactive displays, creative and interesting, a must for all music lovers",
          "Not much to say, you should rather spend an hour on YouTube checking out rock history. Av lot of guitars hanging on a wall, the most exiting was TNTs old drums, but they were almost in the roof. Better to watch outside from a distance with nice neonlights.",
          "It's very cool and interactive stuff. They did have a room for the most famous style which would be Norwegian black metal. But I would have liked more focus on that since it's a signature thing for Norway. But cool stuff. Would have loved more. Definately worth a visit",
          "Probobly most interesting for Norwegians. Great interactive museum. Although it's name gives associations to Rock, the museum covers Norwegian popluar music from the 40's up till today. They do have information in English. Beware entrance fee is 120 NOK! unless you're a student",
          "My husband enjoyed visiting. Handy to visit after a tour as you can be on the ship very quickly, so don't have to worry about 'All Aboard' too much. Closed Monday.",
          "Visited Rockheim in 2012 when the museum was new, and I thought it was good. But unfortunately they have not updated the exhibition much since, so for me it was pretty boring this time. Some of the interactive techniques is a bit difficult to use, so one often just walks on into",
          "A great museum that features a different flavor of Norwegian history. The day we were there we ran into a member of a Black Metal band (you can search that interesting history at Wikipedia). Just goes to show you -- you never know what you are going to encounter in your",

          "The staff were excellent, and without them we would not have been able to \"work\" the interactive facilities. Not being great affectionados of pop, let alone Norwegian Pop we could only marvel at the presentation of the museum, which was inventive. We're in our 70's We",
          "This is an amazing museum about Norwegian music. Some bands/ singers I already knew about (TNT, a-Ha, Kurt Nilsen, Lene Marlin), but I discovered some great new artists (Difference, The Pussycats,..). How all this is exposed is amazing. You start the tour with the music of the",
          "We were only in Trondheim for a day and the weather was just so so. We wandered around this very nice town a bit but stopped in at Rockheim before heading back to the ship. This museum is one of the first things you bump in to when heading off, although I'm not sure that most",
          "Did not know what to expect when we learned about Rockheim. Found it to be a great interactive museum with plenty of people to help you with the interactive displays. If the museum is crowded it may be difficult to enjoy the interactive features. An understanding of the",

          "it gives you the different groups from the fifthees and til today. There are lots of things you can do. Try to play all the instruments, sing at song, write a song, do some tagging at the brickwall,and lots of other things. They have and ok restaurant.",
          "Worth the trip. I was very sceptical in the beginning. I mean, how exciting can a rock history museum be? But there are many things to do here including travelling back in time to the 60's on a \"bus ride\" through the countryside! I recommend this for families (mabye not for",
          "I went here with some trepidation. A museum of Norwegian pop and rock music? That'll keep me entertained for 3.4 minutes, I thought. I left, against my will, 2 hours later. This is one of the cleverest, most interactive and fascinating museums I have ever visited. The sound",
          "I came here to kill some time before my flight home and thought it was fantastic! The top floor is a time tunnel with an interactive room for each decade from 1950 to 2000. There's also a black metal room which was right up my street! The exhibits are in English as well as",
          "This place is a cool place to pop by for \u00e5 look! It is an inter-active music museum in modern locations near the town centre. It is spacious and new, but you do have to share the activities and the sound with every person who is there, so you should be well rested when you visit.",
          "This is a great special topic museum! One of the best, most interactive museums I have ever visited. I went here just to kill some time after seeing it advertised on a flyer, and had a wonderful time. Now, I must say, I had very very little knowledge about the music history in",

          "If you are a fan of popular music at all, you'll probably find this museum as much fun as we did. Honestly, we weren't expecting much, but were really surprised and delighted. Everything is interactive and sometimes like a big puzzle--you could either figure out how to \"trigger\"",

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway. Today the bunker houses various archives, among them the city archives, the university and state archives. More recently, DORA has been used as a concert venue.\nKristiansten Fortress, built 1681\u20131684, is located on a hill east in Trondheim. It repelled the invading Swedes in 1718, but was decommissioned in 1816 by Crown Prince Regent Charles John.\nA statue of Olav Tryggvason, the founder of Trondheim, is located in the city's central square, mounted on top of an obelisk. The statue base is also a sun dial, but it is calibrated to UTC+1 so that the reading is inaccurate by one hour in the summer.\nThe islet Munkholmen is a popular tourist attraction and recreation site. The islet has served as a place of execution, a monastery, a fortress, prison, and a Second World War anti-aircraft gun station.\nStiftsg\u00e5rden is the royal residence in Trondheim, originally constructed in 1774 by Cecilie Christine Sch\u00f8ller. At 140 rooms constituting 4,000 square metres (43,056 sq ft), it is possibly the largest wooden building in Northern Europe, and has been used by royals and their guests since 1800.\nA statue of Leif Ericson is located at the seaside, close to the old Customs Building, the cruise ship facilities and the new swimming hall. The statue is a replica, the original being located at a Seattle marina.\n\n\n=== Nidaros Cathedral ===\n\nThe Nidaros Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace are located side by side in the middle of the city centre. The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral. On 24 May 2002, their daughter Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise married the writer Ari Behn in the cathedral.The Pilgrim's Route (Pilegrimsleden) to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at Nidaros Cathedral, has recently been re-instated. Also known as St. Olav's Way, (Sankt Olavs vei), the main route, which is approximately 640 kilometres (400 mi) long, starts in Oslo and heads North, along Lake Mj\u00f8sa, up the valley Gudbrandsdalen, over the mountain range Dovrefjell and down the Oppdal valley to end at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to pilgrims and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the aegis of the cathedral, which awards certificates to successful pilgrims upon the completion of their journey.\n\n\n=== Other churches ===\nThe Lutheran Church of Norway has 21 churches within the municipality of Trondheim. They are all a part of the Diocese of Nidaros, which is based in Trondheim at the Nidaros Cathedral. Many of the churches are several hundred years old, with a couple which were built almost 1,000 years ago.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Sankt Olav domkirke is the cathedral episcopal see of the exempt Territorial Prelature of Trondheim.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe Trondheim Art Museum has Norway's third largest public art collection, mainly Norwegian art from the last 150 years. The National Museum of Decorative Arts boasts a large collection of decorative arts and design, including a great number of tapestries from the Norwegian tapestry artist Hannah Ryggen, as well as Norway's only permanent exhibibition of Japanese arts and crafts. Sverresborg, also named Zion after King David's castle in Jerusalem, was a fortification built by Sverre Sigurdsson. It is now an open-air museum, consisting of more than 60 buildings. The castle was originally built in 1182\u20131183, but did not last for long as it was burned down in 1188. However, the Sverresaga indicates it had been restored by 1197.The Trondheim Science Center (Norwegian: Vitensenteret i Trondheim) is a scientific hands-on experience center. The NTNU University Museum (Norwegian: NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet) is part of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. There are also a variety of small history, science and natural history museums, such as the Trondheim Maritime Museum, the Armoury, adjacent to the Archbishops's Palace, Kristiansten Fortress, the music and musical instrument museum Ringve National Museum, Ringve Botanical Garden, the Trondheim Tramway Museum, and the Jewish Museum, co-located with the city's synagogue, which is among the northernmost in the world.\nRockheim (Norwegian: Det nasjonale opplevelsessenteret for pop og rock, The National Discovery Center for Pop and Rock) opened at the Pier in August 2010. It is located inside an old warehouse, but characterised by an easily recognisable roof in the shape of a box. \"The box\" is decorated by thousands of tiny lights that change in a variety of colours and patterns, and is a landmark in the cityscape - especially on dark winter evenings.\nKunsthall Trondheim was inaugurated at its permanent premises on Kongens gate in October 2016.\n\n\n=== Prison ===\nVollan District Jail (Norwegian: Vollan kretsfengsel) was a jail during the nazi occupation of Norway and was used to imprison both prisoners of war and criminals. Vollan was not considered a concentration camp. In a summary of prisoners of war in Norway, numerous prisoners were registered at Vollan. Once of its roles was as a transit camp for political prisoners. Many prisoners were taken from Vollan to Kristiansten Fortress and shot. The prisoners at Vollan were interrogated at the Mission Hotel in Trondheim.  Some were also interrogated by Henry Rinnan and his gang. It was closed in 1971 after the opening of Trondheim Prison at Tunga.\nTrondheim Prison (Norwegian: Trondheim fengsel) is a prison that belongs to the Northern Region of the Norwegian Correctional Services.

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway.

The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral.

        "wiki": "The Trondheim Art Museum (Norwegian: Trondheim Kunstmuseum, previously Tr\u00f8ndelag Kunstgalleri) is an art museum located in Trondheim in S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. The museum shows temporary exhibitions of international and regional art in dialogue with works from the museum's collection. The museum possesses Norway's third largest public art collection with an emphasis on art since 1850. The permanent collection contains iconic works such as Harald Sohlberg's Natt (R\u00f8ros church) (1904), Georg Jacobsen's Haren (1922), and Peder Balke's Nordkapp (1870s).\nThe Trondheim Art Museum has two venues, TKM Bispegata (Bispegata 7 b) situated near the Nidaros Cathedral and TKM Gr\u00e5m\u00f8lna at Nedre Elvehavn. The main building in Bispegata 7 b was built in 1930 according to plans by architect Peter Daniel Hofflund. The Trondheim Art Museum was established in 1997, as a means to maintain the museum collection. The building has two floors with rooms of varied sizes and light. The building was refurbished in 2012, when artificial lights were installed to provide more stable temperature and lighting. Much of the interior was restored to its original state from 1930.\n\n\n== Mission ==\nThe stated objective of the Trondheim Art Museum is to: \"Create an interest and increase knowledge in the field of fine arts. This shall be accomplished through acquisition, conservation, scientific research and education, as well as the creation of various exhibitions with different kinds of fine art. The museum shall function as a documentation and competence centre for the region, and it shall, to the extent possible, be updated on essential national and international movements.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nBy means of a letter addressed to the general public, I.C. Dahl started the initiative to establish the Tr\u00f8ndelag Art Gallery (Tr\u00f8ndelag Kunstgalleri) in 1845. At the time, Trondheim's population was around 13,000.\nThe collection was established in 1864. At that time it was known as Det Faste Galleri (The Permanent Gallery), a name that lasted until 1973. During the first phase, the royal residence of Stiftsg\u00e5rden was used, along with the local bank, Trondhjems Sparebank. From 1891\u20131914 buildings purchased from liquor company Trondhjems Br\u00e6ndevinssamlag housed the collection. Acquisitions were often made after art prize competitions. The collection increased significantly after the First World War. Today, it includes over 5,000 works.\nRandi Nygaard Lium was the director from 1998 to 2010. Cathrine Hovdahl Vik was the director shortly before Pontus Kyander, the director from 2011 to 2014. Johan B\u00f6rjesson is the present director. B\u00f6rjesson accepted the position in March 2014.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTrondheim Art Museum",

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000.

        "wiki": "Stiftsg\u00e5rden is the royal residence in Trondheim, Norway. It is centrally situated on the city\u2019s most important thoroughfare, Munkegaten. At 140 rooms constituting 4000 m\u00b2 (43000 ft\u00b2), it is possibly the largest wooden building in Northern Europe, and it has been used by royalty and their guests since 1800.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was built 1774\u20131778 for Cecilie Christine Sch\u00f8ller (1720\u20131786), the wealthy widow of Stie T\u00f8nsberg Sch\u00f8ller  \n(1700\u20131769), chamberlain and merchant in Trondheim. Through her mother she was descended from some of the most prominent noble families in Denmark. From her father, the army Commander in Chief of central Norway, she inherited a large property in the city centre. When she inherited her husband's large fortune, she commenced the construction of the largest private town house in Trondheim. In 1777 she was given the title of privy counselor. She is a representative of the cultural and commercial growth that Trondheim experienced in the late 18th century, and of the city's strong women in that period. She often traveled abroad and seldom used the palace herself before she died in Copenhagen in 1786.  The palace was constructed on the grounds of the former residence of her father, General Johan Friderich Fr\u00f8lich (1681\u20131757).\nDuring her absence abroad, her son-in-law General Georg Frederik Von Krogh (1732-1818) resided in the building. After her death, it was inherited by his son, Mrs. Sch\u00f8ller's grandson, and the General remained in residence there until it was sold to the state in 1800 for 10,000 rigsdaler. It was then used by the Governor of the region, as law courts and as a royal residence when the royal family visited Trondheim. The building also had several other functions; it housed the Bank of Norway in the period 1816\u20131819. In 1906 the palace became exclusively the royal residence in Trondheim.\nProminent guests resided there when in Trondheim. Thus, this location has been the place of residence in Trondheim for the Norwegian Royal Family since 1704. The first royal persons ever to visit the present building were Crown Prince Frederik and Princes Carl and Frederick of Hesse, who were the guests of General von Krogh in 1788.\n\n\n== Historic events ==\nStiftsg\u00e5rden has been the setting for the main festivities during the following coronations:\n\nKing Carl III Johan, 1818\nKing Carl IV and Queen Louise, 1860\nKing Oscar II and Queen Sofie, 1873\nKing Haakon VII and Queen Maud, 1906as well as during the following benedictions:\n\nKing Olav V, 1958\nKing Harald V and Queen Sonja, 1991Stiftsg\u00e5rden has also been the setting for many other royal visits \u2014 among others, the visits of the Norwegian regent and first king of independent Norway, Crown Prince Christian Frederik in 1814, King Carl III Johan in 1835, Crown Prince Carl in 1856, and in recent times King Harald V and Queen Sonja's 60th birthdays in 1997 and Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise's wedding in 2002.\n\n\n== Building ==\nThe architect of the building is not identified with certainty, but is assumed to have been Mrs. Sch\u00f8ller's cousin, Admiral Christian Lerche (1712\u201393). Many of the artisans and artists responsible for the interior decorations are also unknown. The palace is built in the Baroque style, but has elements of Rococo and neoclassicism. It has around 140 rooms constituting 4000 m\u00b2 (43000 ft\u00b2) and is probably the largest wooden palace in Northern Europe. A large part of the garden was separated as a public park in 1906. It was originally laid out in the Baroque style and contained both an orangery and an arbor.\nThe exterior is mostly in its original form. In 1841 some of the dormer windows were removed after a small fire, but those on the garden side are still in place. The orchestra annex by the ballroom was built for the planned coronation of King Oscar I in 1847. The original quarter pane windows were replaced in 1860. However, some of the original windows are still in place in the southern wing on the garden side.\nUnlike the exterior, the interior has changed significantly. The interior of the side wings has been extensively rearranged, and all the rooms in the building have been renovated several times. However, some original features are still present. The Rococo style stucco work was preserved on some of the ceilings and around the wall niches. The supraportes (panels above the doors)  are decorated with painted landscapes. Several of the original wall decorations are preserved, some with Chinoiseries. In the dining room, one can see paintings of cityscapes made after contemporary English copper engravings. The ceiling and the supraportes in the ballroom were painted in 1847, probably using drawings by architect Heinrich Ernst Schirmer who worked with the interiors at the Royal Palace in Oslo. The painted floors and ceilings in the other rooms are mostly from 1847 as well. The interior of the Queen\u2019s salon was designed for the coronation in 1906 by architect Ingvald Alstad.\n\n\n== Furnishings ==\nVery few furnishings from the 18th century have been preserved, except two Rococo style stoves from 1768. All the furniture was acquired in the 19th century and later. Most of it was acquired for the planned coronation of King Oscar I and Queen Josephine  in the 1840s and the coronation of King Haakon VII and Queen Maud in 1906. The many pieces of Biedermeier furniture were made in Trondheim in the 1840s. The Hepplewhite-style furniture in the Chinese Cabinet was acquired in Paris for the coronation in 1906. The King\u2019s Study is furnished with a set of Chippendale-style furniture designed by architect Axel Guldahl and crafted by cabinet maker A. Kvenild for the same occasion. The furniture of the Queen\u2019s salon was created in the style of Louis XVI by Edvard R\u00f8hmen in Trondheim.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Other sources ==\nAndersen, Eystein M.(2006) Stiftsg\u00e5rden - Det kongelige pal\u00e9 i Trondheim (Andrimne Forlag, Oslo) ISBN 82-92546-10-3.\nRogner\u00f8d, Dag-Ivar(1997) P\u00e5 historisk grunn - En kulturhistorisk reise til statlige eiendommer (Orfeus Forlag, Oslo) ISBN 82-467-0011-1.\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Stiftsg\u00e5rden, Trondheim at Wikimedia Commons",

          "Went on the final tour of the day which was in Norwegian ( with a little bit of English thrown in ). So probably didn't get the full benefit. However an interesting tour this is an old wooden palace and certainly not over the top re furniture or paintings more like a country",
          "This is not what a usual Royal Palace looks like, drab exterior and very little security in evidence! At the rear ther is a small park with a nice fountain (not working when we were there!) again even the garden and grounds look rather dull!!",

          "A very austere structure for European Royalty. Made of wood it\u2019s a two story building. The rear garden is also modest but lovely. If you didn\u2019t know it you would not suspect it to be the royal palace.",
          "The old wood structure that is The Royal Residence in Trondheim is wonderful to see. The garden was ordinary but the building held some interest mainly for its age being built in 1778.",

          "We were standing outside this building when a local lady walked up and told us that it was the Palace and that the King and Queen were arriving the next morning. Such a pity as we were leaving early the next day. One of the largest wooden buildings in Scandinavia",
          "Short and sweet. The tour last approx 40 mins and it is very informative. Our guide new the history inside out and provided no end of interesting facts. We really enjoyed it. The residence has a cozy homely ferl and it is still used by the royal family. Enjoyed it very much.",
          "I was persuaded to visit this by my partner who is more into kings and queens and history than I am and I was really impressed by the way the guide explained about the building as well as the history of Norway's royal family and constitution. Well worth a visit if you want to",

          "As royal palaces go, this is rather small and almost middle-class, but it will give you an insight into Norwegian history and how they think. The interior is in good condition, the guides are very knowledgeable, speak good English and make their subject matter interesting. All",

        "wiki": "Bratt\u00f8ra is an artificial island in the city of Trondheim in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. The 0.485-square-kilometre (120-acre) island is located at the mouth of the river Nidelva just north of the city centre (Midtbyen), west of Nyhavna, and south of Trondheimsfjord. There is a canal that divides the mainland from what is now the island of Bratt\u00f8ra.  In addition to some commercial offices, most of the island is used by Trondheim Central Station and Trondheim Port.The island is connected to the western parts of Trondheim by the Skansen Tunnel which was completed in 2010.\nSince the late 1990s, there has been an urban renewal program at Bratt\u00f8ra, converting parts of the port to office buildings, including the swimming pool \"Pirbadet\" and a massive office complex housing among others Reinertsen and the Norwegian School of Management.  Bratt\u00f8ra also houses Pirterminalen, the docks for the high-speed catamaran services to Fosen and Kristiansund as well as the corporate headquarters of Fosen Trafikklag. The Coastal Express and other cruise ships also stop at Bratt\u00f8ra.\nBratt\u00f8ra was the site of the \u00d8reting, the regional Ting during the Middle Ages.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Bymarka is a large park and nature reserve on the west side of the city of Trondheim in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway.\n\n\n== Location and use ==\n\nBymarka is situated to the west of the city center and has an area of 80 square kilometres (31 sq mi), with more than 200 kilometres (120 mi) of walking tracks. Bymarka is very popular for cross-country skiing in the winter, and for walks, hiking or jogging in the summer. There is a golf course on the fringe near the city. Bymarka borders the By\u00e5sen district, and can be reached by the Gr\u00e5kall Line tram line or by car.\n\n\n== Forests and habitats ==\n\nThe elevation in Bymarka is from 200 to 565 metres (656 to 1,854 ft) above sea level, except in the hilly northern part, which reaches down to the Trondheimsfjord. There are more than 10 lakes, and many bogs. However, Bymarka is largely covered with forest, much of it planted between the years 1870 and 1940. Some non-native trees were planted, such as European Larch and Douglas fir, and there is also Sycamore maple and European ash at the lowest elevations. The most common tree species are the native Norway spruce, Scots pine and Downy birch. Storheia, Bosbergheia, and Gr\u00e5kallen are mountains that reach above the treeline (which is at approx 500 metres (1,600 ft) above sea level) and have some alpine vegetation. As there are no higher mountains nearby, there is a nice view over Trondheim, the fjord, and mountain ranges including Trollheimen to the south and Sylane (which is partly in Sweden) to the east.\n\nPart of the northern area of Bymarka is protected and preserved as a nature reserve, stretching from an elevation of around 450 metres (1,480 ft) near Herbernheia and northwards down towards the fjord. This reserve therefore includes several vegetation zones: North boreal (above 400 metres (1,300 ft) above sea level), middle boreal (200 to 400 metres (660 to 1,310 ft), the most common in Bymarka) and southern boreal (below 200 metres (660 ft)), the latter zone is rare among protected areas as it is heavily used for farming in Norway. The lowland on the southern (Gaulosen) and western (Byneset) fringes of Bymarka contains areas of more southern hemiboreal vegetation. One of these locations has an especially rich understory, and has traditionally been used by the locals for collecting plants believed to have medical properties, hence the name Apoteket (The Pharmacy).\n\n\n== Fauna ==\nMoose, red fox, hare and squirrel are the most common animals, but there are also healthy populations of roe deer, beaver, badger and also some otters. As of spring 2006, even one wolverine has been verified as living in Bymarka, which is rare, as this elusive predator usually stays in the higher mountains, far from any cities. There are trout in many lakes, and a rich bird life.\n\n\n== References ==",

It lies in the borough of \u00d8stbyen on the east side of the  Nidelva river between the Bakke Bridge (Bakke bru) and the Old Town Bridge (Gamle Bybro).The neighborhood is dominated by small, wooden houses and narrow streets. It is among the major tourist attractions in the city.In 1965, the road plan for Trondheim proposed that a large area in Bakklandet be demolished to make way for a four-lane motorway which would connect the road \"Elgeseter gate\" with the road \"Innherredsveien\". The plans were met by opposition from locals, and by the early 1980s the plan was shelved, even thought the city's environmental council had approved depopulating the neighborhood in 1974.\n\n\n== Media gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Bakklandet at Wikimedia Commons",

          "Looking out to see this statue remembers one of the world's great seafarers and explorers. Well worth a few minutes of your time.",
          "When we walked in to the harbor of Trondheim we jump in to the Leif Eriksson statue. Always when I see a statue of the first legitimate explorer of the America, Leif Eriksson, I take a \u201cselfie\u201d with him, because my first name is also Leif. This is a smaller copy of the statue",
          "I was exploring Trondheim, and walking round the harbour after leaving my ferry when I found this lovely statue . He stands looking out to sea . He\u2019s one of the many Viking statues in Trondheim . Well worth a walk round to find the rest .",
          "Leiv Eiriksson is used as a symbol of the first emigrant to America. The sculpture is also called the Emigrants\u2019 Monument. There are similar statues in Greenland, Seattle (first one in 1962) and there will be one at L'Anse aux Meadows in Canada. It's close to Rockheim.",
          "Known as the Viking who discovered America. The panoramic view of the place is very beautiful, both in winter and in summer. Great for enjoying and pondering over life.",
          "But the Leiv Eriksson story, short version, is worth a look. If you haven't read it before. So, a nice walk could be a brisk trek along the new seaside walk in Trondheim. Then a quick look at the statue (very short detour at the end), and finally a nice cup of coffee nearby,",
          "We were at the waterfront to see the \"post boat\" make it first stop in Trondheim during the summer. This was interesting and quite a celebration. It was worth the block or two walk to the statue and probably about same distance from Rockheim.",
          "Leiv Eiriksson stands forlornly out on the quay in Trondheim. Even getting there from where the cruise ships dock means going out of your way. The statue itself is fine, and the reason for having it is good. It's just that the location is not very good. There isn't much else",

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway. Today the bunker houses various archives, among them the city archives, the university and state archives. More recently, DORA has been used as a concert venue.\nKristiansten Fortress, built 1681\u20131684, is located on a hill east in Trondheim. It repelled the invading Swedes in 1718, but was decommissioned in 1816 by Crown Prince Regent Charles John.\nA statue of Olav Tryggvason, the founder of Trondheim, is located in the city's central square, mounted on top of an obelisk. The statue base is also a sun dial, but it is calibrated to UTC+1 so that the reading is inaccurate by one hour in the summer.\nThe islet Munkholmen is a popular tourist attraction and recreation site. The islet has served as a place of execution, a monastery, a fortress, prison, and a Second World War anti-aircraft gun station.\nStiftsg\u00e5rden is the royal residence in Trondheim, originally constructed in 1774 by Cecilie Christine Sch\u00f8ller. At 140 rooms constituting 4,000 square metres (43,056 sq ft), it is possibly the largest wooden building in Northern Europe, and has been used by royals and their guests since 1800.\nA statue of Leif Ericson is located at the seaside, close to the old Customs Building, the cruise ship facilities and the new swimming hall. The statue is a replica, the original being located at a Seattle marina.\n\n\n=== Nidaros Cathedral ===\n\nThe Nidaros Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace are located side by side in the middle of the city centre. The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral. On 24 May 2002, their daughter Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise married the writer Ari Behn in the cathedral.The Pilgrim's Route (Pilegrimsleden) to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at Nidaros Cathedral, has recently been re-instated. Also known as St. Olav's Way, (Sankt Olavs vei), the main route, which is approximately 640 kilometres (400 mi) long, starts in Oslo and heads North, along Lake Mj\u00f8sa, up the valley Gudbrandsdalen, over the mountain range Dovrefjell and down the Oppdal valley to end at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to pilgrims and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the aegis of the cathedral, which awards certificates to successful pilgrims upon the completion of their journey.\n\n\n=== Other churches ===\nThe Lutheran Church of Norway has 21 churches within the municipality of Trondheim. They are all a part of the Diocese of Nidaros, which is based in Trondheim at the Nidaros Cathedral. Many of the churches are several hundred years old, with a couple which were built almost 1,000 years ago.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Sankt Olav domkirke is the cathedral episcopal see of the exempt Territorial Prelature of Trondheim.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe Trondheim Art Museum has Norway's third largest public art collection, mainly Norwegian art from the last 150 years. The National Museum of Decorative Arts boasts a large collection of decorative arts and design, including a great number of tapestries from the Norwegian tapestry artist Hannah Ryggen, as well as Norway's only permanent exhibibition of Japanese arts and crafts. Sverresborg, also named Zion after King David's castle in Jerusalem, was a fortification built by Sverre Sigurdsson. It is now an open-air museum, consisting of more than 60 buildings. The castle was originally built in 1182\u20131183, but did not last for long as it was burned down in 1188. However, the Sverresaga indicates it had been restored by 1197.The Trondheim Science Center (Norwegian: Vitensenteret i Trondheim) is a scientific hands-on experience center. The NTNU University Museum (Norwegian: NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet) is part of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. There are also a variety of small history, science and natural history museums, such as the Trondheim Maritime Museum, the Armoury, adjacent to the Archbishops's Palace, Kristiansten Fortress, the music and musical instrument museum Ringve National Museum, Ringve Botanical Garden, the Trondheim Tramway Museum, and the Jewish Museum, co-located with the city's synagogue, which is among the northernmost in the world.\nRockheim (Norwegian: Det nasjonale opplevelsessenteret for pop og rock, The National Discovery Center for Pop and Rock) opened at the Pier in August 2010. It is located inside an old warehouse, but characterised by an easily recognisable roof in the shape of a box. \"The box\" is decorated by thousands of tiny lights that change in a variety of colours and patterns, and is a landmark in the cityscape - especially on dark winter evenings.\nKunsthall Trondheim was inaugurated at its permanent premises on Kongens gate in October 2016.\n\n\n=== Prison ===\nVollan District Jail (Norwegian: Vollan kretsfengsel) was a jail during the nazi occupation of Norway and was used to imprison both prisoners of war and criminals. Vollan was not considered a concentration camp. In a summary of prisoners of war in Norway, numerous prisoners were registered at Vollan. Once of its roles was as a transit camp for political prisoners. Many prisoners were taken from Vollan to Kristiansten Fortress and shot. The prisoners at Vollan were interrogated at the Mission Hotel in Trondheim.  Some were also interrogated by Henry Rinnan and his gang. It was closed in 1971 after the opening of Trondheim Prison at Tunga.\nTrondheim Prison (Norwegian: Trondheim fengsel) is a prison that belongs to the Northern Region of the Norwegian Correctional Services.  The prison can house 184 inmates.\nIt consists of four main departments: \n\nNermarka (\"Tunga\") \u2013 closed department\nDetention department (no: Forvaringsavdelingen) at Nermarka\nLeira \u2013 open division.  Through joint positive activities, the individual inmate on certain conditions teaches to be responsible with other people.\ndivision Kongens gt. \u2013 halfway house, located in downtown Trondheim.\n\n\n== Government ==\nThe municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elect a mayor.\nOn 1 January 2005, the city was reorganized from five boroughs into four, with each of these having separate social services offices.

        "wiki": "Nidelva is a river in Trondheim Municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. The name of the 30-kilometre (19 mi) long river translates to \"the River Nid\" since the suffix elva or elven is the Norwegian word for \"river\".\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe Nidelva starts at the Hyttfossen waterfall which rises from Bj\u00f8rsj\u00f8en, a small lake located just below Selbusj\u00f8en, the largest lake in the southern part of Tr\u00f8ndelag County. The Nidelva runs north through Kl\u00e6bu, then to Tiller, and then through the city of Trondheim before reaching Trondheimsfjord by the island of Bratt\u00f8ra near Trondheim Central Station. The Nidelva is at its deepest at the Trongfossen, a deep ravine in the village of Kl\u00e6bu. There are six hydro-electric power stations along the river. The Nidelva forms the last part of the Nea-Nidelvvassdraget watershed. The Nea River is a tributary which empties into Selbusj\u00f8en, which in turn flows into the Nidelva.The popular Norwegian waltz, Nidelven Stille og Vakker du er (\"Nidelven quiet and beautiful you are\"), was  written by composer Oskar Hodd\u00f8 (1916\u20131943). According to tradition, Hodd\u00f8 wrote the waltz about the Nidelva River one night in late April 1940 while he was standing at Gamle Bybro in Trondheim.\n\n\n== Media gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Other sources ===\n\u00d8ksendal, Asbj\u00f8rn (1969).

        "wiki": "Munkholmen (Norwegian: Monk's islet) is an islet in the municipality of Trondheim in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway.  The 13,000-square-metre (3.2-acre) island sits in the Trondheimsfjord about 1.3 kilometres (0.81 mi) northwest of the island of Bratt\u00f8ra and the mouth of the river Nidelva in the center of the city of Trondheim.  The islet has served as a place of execution, a monastery, a fortress, a prison, and a World War II anti-aircraft gun station. Today, Munkholmen is a popular tourist attraction and recreation site. \n\n\n== History ==\nIn the years prior to the founding of the city of Trondheim in 997 by King Olav Tryggvason, Munkholmen had been used as an execution site by the Jarls of Lade.  The arrival of Olav Tryggvason to Norway in 995 coincided with a revolt against Haakon Sigurdsson, who was killed by Tormod Kark.  The severed heads of both Haakon and Kark were placed on stakes on Munkholmen facing out into the fjord to serve as a warning to visitors. The tradition of displaying the severed heads of criminals and political opponents was continued for some time, but the heads were now placed so that they faced the city of Trondheim to deter its citizens from committing crimes.\n\n\n=== Nidarholm Abbey ===\nThe term Munkholmen was not originally in common usage. Rather, the site was known as the location of the monastery at Nidarholm. In the early 12th century, and possibly even earlier, Benedictine monks lived on the island in Nidarholm Abbey. The monastery burned down three times during the Middle Ages, the last time in 1531.  By the time that Lutheran Protestantism came to Trondheim, the buildings had fallen into decay and the former monastery came under the ownership of the royal estate in Trondheim. The monastery buildings disappeared during the 17th century as Munkholmen was fortified.\n\n\n=== Fort and prison ===\nConstruction of a fort on the island began in 1658 following the Swedish siege of Trondheim during the Dano-Swedish War in 1658-1660.  When it was completed in 1661, the fort was also used as a state prison for society's rejects.  Count Peder Griffenfeld, Munkholmen's most famous prisoner, was transferred from the fortress of Copenhagen in 1671. Griffenfeld was kept at Munkholmen for 18 years, after which he was released, having contracted a terminal illness. From 1700 to 1704, the commander of the fort was Major Curt Christoph von Koppelow. The fort remained in operation until 1893.\n\n\n=== German occupation ===\nNazi Germany invaded and occupied Norway in 1940.  After capturing Trondheim early on in the Norwegian Campaign, the Germans quickly established a submarine base, exploiting the natural protection provided by the fjord.  At this time, Munkholmen was fitted with anti-aircraft weaponry.  A large portion of the fort was retrofitted to hold ammunition, and the flooring planks were nailed in with wooden nails to prevent explosions caused by soldiers' boots striking metal nails. The German occupying forces remained in Norway until the end of the war in Europe in May 1945.  Remnants of the installation still exist in the upper levels of the fort.\n\n\n== Media gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Tourism and recreation ==\nToday, Munkholmen is a popular summertime tourist attraction and hangout for residents of Trondheim.  From May to September, boats depart from Ravnkloa on a regular basis.  Once on the island, visitors can take a guided tour (in English and Norwegian) or roam freely.  There's also a small cafe/restaurant available.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMunkholmen website",

          "We travelled over on the Munkholmen sightseeing boat, which initially took us down the river to see the oldest parts of the city, cathedral and WWII submarine bunkers, which was fascinating. The guide gave an informal commentary, and went with us on a guided tour of the island",

        "wiki": "The Trampe bicycle lift (Norwegian: Sykkelheisen Trampe) was invented and installed in 1993 by Jarle Wanwik. It is the first and only bicycle lift in the world.In 2013 it was upgraded and rebranded under the name Cyclocable by Skirail, part of the Poma group.\n\n\n== Usage ==\nThe use of Trampe is free.When using the lift, the right foot is placed on the starting point (the left foot stays on the bicycle pedal). After pushing the start button, the user is pushed forward and a footplate emerges. A common mistake among tourists and other first-time users is that they don't keep their right leg outstretched and their body tilted forward. This makes it hard to maintain balance on the footplate, and can result in falling off.\nIn the summer months, Trampe is used extensively by both commuting inhabitants of Trondheim and tourists.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nVideo of the lift in operation on YouTube",

        "wiki": "Trondheim Central Station (Norwegian: Trondheim sentralstasjon) or Trondheim S is the main railway station serving the city of Trondheim, Norway. Located at Bratt\u00f8ra in the north part of the city centre, it is the terminus of the Dovre Line, running southwards, and the Nordland Line, which runs north. The railway is electrified south of the station but not north of it, so through trains must change locomotives at the station.\nVy serves the station with express trains to Oslo and Bod\u00f8, regional trains to R\u00f8ros and \u00d6stersund in Sweden, and the Tr\u00f8ndelag Commuter Rail. The Trondheim Bus Station located at the station serves all long-distance buses, and some city buses. From 1913 to 1968 the station was also the terminus for two lines of the Trondheim Tramway.\nTrondheim's first station, dating from 1864, was located at Kalvskinnet. In 1877 the current station was built to serve the Mer\u00e5ker Line to Sweden\u2014since integrated into the Nordland Line. At the same time a connection was built between the two stations, and the central station took over as the main station serving Trondheim. In 1910 construction of a new station for the Dovre Line was started, finishing in 1921. The main station building consists of an older section in historicism brick, while the annex is in postmodernistic concrete and glass.\n\n\n== Services ==\nTrain services are provided by the Norwegian State Railways both north- and southbound. Four services a day and one night train operate to Oslo Central Station, while there is one day and one night train to Bod\u00f8, with an additional afternoon departure to Mo i Rana. Two daily departures serve Sweden and \u00d6stersund as part of the Mittnabot\u00e5get service that connects Trondheim in Norway to Sundsvall in Sweden, in addition there are three services to R\u00f8ros, with connections onwards to \u00d8sterdalen. The most frequent service is the hourly Tr\u00f8ndelag Commuter Rail from Steinkjer via Trondheim Airport, V\u00e6rnes and Trondheim S to Lerkendal, with some extending to Oppdal.The station is manned, but also equipped with ticket machines. There are several kiosks and caf\u00e9s, as well as a car park, taxicabs, bicycle stands and baggage lockers. The station and platforms are wheelchair accessible, and a pre-booked escort service is available. Trafikanten Midt-Norge, which sells bus tickets and provides information on public transport routes in Tr\u00f8ndelag, can be found in the new section. The station is closed at night.The commuter trains serve other railway stations in neighborhoods in Trondheim; Heimdal, Selsbakk, Marienborg, Skansen to the south, and Lademoen/Nedre Elvehavn, Lilleby, Leangen and Rotvoll to the east.\n\n\n=== Connections to other modes of transport ===\n\n\n==== Buses ====\nIn 1995, the city bus station was moved from L\u00fcthenhaven close to the city's main square to the central station, with the opening of a new section to the station. The original building has been preserved by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage as a cultural heritage.Some city buses operated by Team Trafikk stop at the station; routes 2, 11, 19, 46, 47, 52, 54, 55, 63, 71, 73, 75, 76, 94. Munkegata Terminal remains the most important, with all buses stopping there. NOR-WAY Bussekspress operates coaches to Oslo via R\u00f8ros, Namsos and Bergen via F\u00f8rde. while Lavprisekspressen operates day and night expresses to Oslo. Gauldal Billag operates coaches to St\u00f8ren, Oppdal and R\u00f8ros, while Tr\u00f8nderBilene operates to Fosen, Orkanger, Agdenes and Snillfjord. Nettbuss operates coaches to Malvik, Stj\u00f8rdal, Mer\u00e5ker, Selbu, Tydal, Skaun, Melhus, Orkdal and Meldal, while Kl\u00e6buruten operates buses to Kl\u00e6bu and to the airport.\n\n\n==== Ferries ====\nTrondheim S is located about ten minutes walk, or a two-minute bus ride, from Pirterminalen where Fosen Trafikklag operates passenger ferries across the fjord to Vanvikan, and out of the fjord to Brekstad, Sistranda and Kristiansund.\n\n\n==== Trams ====\nBetween 1913 and 1968 the station was the terminus for the Trondheim Tramway on the Elgeseter Line (no. 2) and Singsaker Line (no. 3). In 2005 plans to extend the only current line, the Gr\u00e5kallen Line, from the St. Olavs gate via Trondheim S to Pirterminalen were launched.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Two stations ===\n\nThe first railway station to be built in Trondheim was located at Kalvskinnet, to serve the narrow gauge Trondhjem\u2013St\u00f8ren Line railway that was completed in 1864. The station was designed by Georg Andreas Bull, and still exists as a synagogue. In 1877 the state and city made an agreement to build a new station at Bratt\u00f8ra to serve the new Mer\u00e5ker Line that was being built to Sweden. Bratt\u00f8ra was chosen because it was located directly beside the port, and would allow direct transshipment from ships to the railway of both goods and passengers. The station would become the main station for both railways; this caused a major protest among the local population, who felt it was necessary to have two terminal stations, one for each line, and the city brought the matter before the courts\u2014the case was settled in 1895 in favor of one station. The lack of planning and coordination between the two lines made the new station a large budget cost for the Mer\u00e5ker Line; and described as one of few exceptions to the small-and-cheap policy dominating the state railways i Norway at the time.\n\nTwo lots were sold to the state railways from the city, allowing the building of two station buildings, the eastern cargo building for the Mer\u00e5ker Line and the western for R\u00f8ros Line. The main station in the east served all passenger trains, and was designed by the architect Balthazar Lange. A new route for R\u00f8ros Line was built from Sluppen to Skansen, along the west side of Nidelva, and the old station taken into disuse after the R\u00f8ros Line reached the central station on 24 June 1884. To solve the challenge of the break-of-gauge, the entire station area had dual gauge with both 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1\u20442 in) and 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in).The station at Bratt\u00f8ra has had four names, following the name changes of the city. It was opened as Throndhjem, changed in 1894 to Trondhjem, on 1 January 1930 to Nidaros and to Trondheim on 6 March 1931. The station at Bratt\u00f8ra is physically divided in two parts by the bridge over Ravnkloa. From 1884, the western part was officially called Throndhjem V and the eastern part Throndhjem \u00d8. The freight station for the R\u00f8ros Line was located at Throndhjem V, while the passenger station for both lines was located at Throndhjem \u00d8, just like today. While there were two stations in 1882\u201384, they were 'probably' referred to as Bratt\u00f8ra and Kalvskinnet.\nOn 23 April 1888 a landslide hit the station, with 180 metres (590 ft) of track\u2014three wide and including the main R\u00f8rosbanen line\u2014was washed into the sea. The slide was caused by the seabed sinking about seven meters, and it was followed by several smaller slides.\n\n\n=== The Dovre Line arrives ===\n\nIn 1910, the Parliament of Norway announced a competition for the redesign of the station since it had been decided that the Dovre Line would be built to Trondheim, including the line from St\u00f8ren to Trondheim being converted to standard gauge. On 18 August 1913 construction of a new station and port was started. Traffic had increased to the limits of capacity; there were too few tracks and too small cargo buildings. By 1912 some freight cars were stopping at Hommelvik and Storlien; a counting showed 900 cars at the station. The construction removed a gap filled by the canal between the two stations\u2014filling up the canal in the process. Instead the 92 metres (302 ft) Skansen Bridge was built on the west side of the station, along with a double track to Marienborg where the new depot would be located. The main station building designed by Lange remained the passenger and administration building, with the conversion of the smaller, western one into cargo facilities.The amount of trackage for cargo was increased, with a wide section of land mass being filled into the sea to create a larger rail and port facility at Bratt\u00f8ra, though the filling of a large part of the seabed to create artificial land. The railways allowed the transshipment of cargo from ships from Northern Norway to rail, as well as from rail from Central Sweden to ships to the British Isles. The port was supplemented by a new line to Ilsvika would allow the loading of ore there. The suggestion to build double track to Leangen was dropped.While the original plans for the Dovre Line involved completion in 1916, it was not until 1921 the first train could travel from Oslo to Trondheim via Dovre, mostly due to the First World War. The new depot opened in 1916, and in 1917 the double track and dual gauge to Marienborg as well as the new freight terminal was finished. Instead of using one track for each direction on the double track, the Dovre Line would use the one line while the other would be used for transport from the station to the depot. Skansen Bridge opened on 22 March 1918. In 1922, Norsk Spisevognselskap established a kiosk, and on 1 October 1925, they took over the station restaurant.The main building designed by Lange is in historicism and was originally built in two stories in brick. A third was added in the 1950s, some with some of the original feel being lost in the addition, since it was not stylistically true. In 1965 two annexes were built, one on each side and in two stories. The western was used for offices and the other as part of the waiting area\u2014these were both in line with the historicist style. They replaced a cargo expedition and a restaurant building, respectively. In 1995 the bus station was moved from the city center at Le\u00fcthenhaven to the central station, and the eastern annex was razed in favor of a postmodernistic glass and concrete building. In addition to the bus station it features and extension of the waiting area, offices, a restaurant and a parking lot.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nAspenberg, Nils Carl (1995).

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway.

The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral. On 24 May 2002, their daughter Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise married the writer Ari Behn in the cathedral.The Pilgrim's Route (Pilegrimsleden) to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at Nidaros Cathedral, has recently been re-instated.

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway. Today the bunker houses various archives, among them the city archives, the university and state archives. More recently, DORA has been used as a concert venue.\nKristiansten Fortress, built 1681\u20131684, is located on a hill east in Trondheim. It repelled the invading Swedes in 1718, but was decommissioned in 1816 by Crown Prince Regent Charles John.\nA statue of Olav Tryggvason, the founder of Trondheim, is located in the city's central square, mounted on top of an obelisk. The statue base is also a sun dial, but it is calibrated to UTC+1 so that the reading is inaccurate by one hour in the summer.\nThe islet Munkholmen is a popular tourist attraction and recreation site. The islet has served as a place of execution, a monastery, a fortress, prison, and a Second World War anti-aircraft gun station.\nStiftsg\u00e5rden is the royal residence in Trondheim, originally constructed in 1774 by Cecilie Christine Sch\u00f8ller. At 140 rooms constituting 4,000 square metres (43,056 sq ft), it is possibly the largest wooden building in Northern Europe, and has been used by royals and their guests since 1800.\nA statue of Leif Ericson is located at the seaside, close to the old Customs Building, the cruise ship facilities and the new swimming hall.

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway. Today the bunker houses various archives, among them the city archives, the university and state archives. More recently, DORA has been used as a concert venue.\nKristiansten Fortress, built 1681\u20131684, is located on a hill east in Trondheim. It repelled the invading Swedes in 1718, but was decommissioned in 1816 by Crown Prince Regent Charles John.\nA statue of Olav Tryggvason, the founder of Trondheim, is located in the city's central square, mounted on top of an obelisk. The statue base is also a sun dial, but it is calibrated to UTC+1 so that the reading is inaccurate by one hour in the summer.\nThe islet Munkholmen is a popular tourist attraction and recreation site. The islet has served as a place of execution, a monastery, a fortress, prison, and a Second World War anti-aircraft gun station.\nStiftsg\u00e5rden is the royal residence in Trondheim, originally constructed in 1774 by Cecilie Christine Sch\u00f8ller. At 140 rooms constituting 4,000 square metres (43,056 sq ft), it is possibly the largest wooden building in Northern Europe, and has been used by royals and their guests since 1800.\nA statue of Leif Ericson is located at the seaside, close to the old Customs Building, the cruise ship facilities and the new swimming hall. The statue is a replica, the original being located at a Seattle marina.\n\n\n=== Nidaros Cathedral ===\n\nThe Nidaros Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace are located side by side in the middle of the city centre. The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral. On 24 May 2002, their daughter Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise married the writer Ari Behn in the cathedral.The Pilgrim's Route (Pilegrimsleden) to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at Nidaros Cathedral, has recently been re-instated. Also known as St. Olav's Way, (Sankt Olavs vei), the main route, which is approximately 640 kilometres (400 mi) long, starts in Oslo and heads North, along Lake Mj\u00f8sa, up the valley Gudbrandsdalen, over the mountain range Dovrefjell and down the Oppdal valley to end at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to pilgrims and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the aegis of the cathedral, which awards certificates to successful pilgrims upon the completion of their journey.\n\n\n=== Other churches ===\nThe Lutheran Church of Norway has 21 churches within the municipality of Trondheim. They are all a part of the Diocese of Nidaros, which is based in Trondheim at the Nidaros Cathedral. Many of the churches are several hundred years old, with a couple which were built almost 1,000 years ago.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Sankt Olav domkirke is the cathedral episcopal see of the exempt Territorial Prelature of Trondheim.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe Trondheim Art Museum has Norway's third largest public art collection, mainly Norwegian art from the last 150 years. The National Museum of Decorative Arts boasts a large collection of decorative arts and design, including a great number of tapestries from the Norwegian tapestry artist Hannah Ryggen, as well as Norway's only permanent exhibibition of Japanese arts and crafts. Sverresborg, also named Zion after King David's castle in Jerusalem, was a fortification built by Sverre Sigurdsson. It is now an open-air museum, consisting of more than 60 buildings. The castle was originally built in 1182\u20131183, but did not last for long as it was burned down in 1188. However, the Sverresaga indicates it had been restored by 1197.The Trondheim Science Center (Norwegian: Vitensenteret i Trondheim) is a scientific hands-on experience center. The NTNU University Museum (Norwegian: NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet) is part of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

It is located inside an old warehouse, but characterised by an easily recognisable roof in the shape of a box. \"The box\" is decorated by thousands of tiny lights that change in a variety of colours and patterns, and is a landmark in the cityscape - especially on dark winter evenings.\nKunsthall Trondheim was inaugurated at its permanent premises on Kongens gate in October 2016.\n\n\n=== Prison ===\nVollan District Jail (Norwegian: Vollan kretsfengsel) was a jail during the nazi occupation of Norway and was used to imprison both prisoners of war and criminals. Vollan was not considered a concentration camp. In a summary of prisoners of war in Norway, numerous prisoners were registered at Vollan. Once of its roles was as a transit camp for political prisoners. Many prisoners were taken from Vollan to Kristiansten Fortress and shot. The prisoners at Vollan were interrogated at the Mission Hotel in Trondheim.  Some were also interrogated by Henry Rinnan and his gang.

It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway.

The statue is a replica, the original being located at a Seattle marina.\n\n\n=== Nidaros Cathedral ===\n\nThe Nidaros Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace are located side by side in the middle of the city centre. The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral. On 24 May 2002, their daughter Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise married the writer Ari Behn in the cathedral.The Pilgrim's Route (Pilegrimsleden) to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at Nidaros Cathedral, has recently been re-instated. Also known as St. Olav's Way, (Sankt Olavs vei), the main route, which is approximately 640 kilometres (400 mi) long, starts in Oslo and heads North, along Lake Mj\u00f8sa, up the valley Gudbrandsdalen, over the mountain range Dovrefjell and down the Oppdal valley to end at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to pilgrims and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the aegis of the cathedral, which awards certificates to successful pilgrims upon the completion of their journey.\n\n\n=== Other churches ===\nThe Lutheran Church of Norway has 21 churches within the municipality of Trondheim.

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\nThe city has various wetland habitats. among which there is the Gaulosen. The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. Otters and beavers thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka. Badgers and red foxes are not uncommon sights. Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.\nDORA 1 is a German submarine base that housed the 13th U-boat Flotilla during the Second World War occupation of Norway. Today the bunker houses various archives, among them the city archives, the university and state archives. More recently, DORA has been used as a concert venue.\nKristiansten Fortress, built 1681\u20131684, is located on a hill east in Trondheim. It repelled the invading Swedes in 1718, but was decommissioned in 1816 by Crown Prince Regent Charles John.\nA statue of Olav Tryggvason, the founder of Trondheim, is located in the city's central square, mounted on top of an obelisk. The statue base is also a sun dial, but it is calibrated to UTC+1 so that the reading is inaccurate by one hour in the summer.\nThe islet Munkholmen is a popular tourist attraction and recreation site. The islet has served as a place of execution, a monastery, a fortress, prison, and a Second World War anti-aircraft gun station.\nStiftsg\u00e5rden is the royal residence in Trondheim, originally constructed in 1774 by Cecilie Christine Sch\u00f8ller. At 140 rooms constituting 4,000 square metres (43,056 sq ft), it is possibly the largest wooden building in Northern Europe, and has been used by royals and their guests since 1800.\nA statue of Leif Ericson is located at the seaside, close to the old Customs Building, the cruise ship facilities and the new swimming hall. The statue is a replica, the original being located at a Seattle marina.\n\n\n=== Nidaros Cathedral ===\n\nThe Nidaros Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace are located side by side in the middle of the city centre. The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important Gothic monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, with pilgrimage routes leading to it from Oslo in southern Norway and from the J\u00e4mtland and V\u00e4rmland regions of Sweden. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in Scandinavia.\nDuring the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the coronation church of the Norwegian kings. King Haakon VII was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with King Olav V in 1957, coronation was replaced by consecration. In 1991, the present King Harald V and Queen Sonja were consecrated in the cathedral. On 24 May 2002, their daughter Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise married the writer Ari Behn in the cathedral.The Pilgrim's Route (Pilegrimsleden) to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at Nidaros Cathedral, has recently been re-instated. Also known as St. Olav's Way, (Sankt Olavs vei), the main route, which is approximately 640 kilometres (400 mi) long, starts in Oslo and heads North, along Lake Mj\u00f8sa, up the valley Gudbrandsdalen, over the mountain range Dovrefjell and down the Oppdal valley to end at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to pilgrims and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the aegis of the cathedral, which awards certificates to successful pilgrims upon the completion of their journey.\n\n\n=== Other churches ===\nThe Lutheran Church of Norway has 21 churches within the municipality of Trondheim. They are all a part of the Diocese of Nidaros, which is based in Trondheim at the Nidaros Cathedral. Many of the churches are several hundred years old, with a couple which were built almost 1,000 years ago.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Sankt Olav domkirke is the cathedral episcopal see of the exempt Territorial Prelature of Trondheim.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\n\nThe Trondheim Art Museum has Norway's third largest public art collection, mainly Norwegian art from the last 150 years. The National Museum of Decorative Arts boasts a large collection of decorative arts and design, including a great number of tapestries from the Norwegian tapestry artist Hannah Ryggen, as well as Norway's only permanent exhibibition of Japanese arts and crafts. Sverresborg, also named Zion after King David's castle in Jerusalem, was a fortification built by Sverre Sigurdsson. It is now an open-air museum, consisting of more than 60 buildings. The castle was originally built in 1182\u20131183, but did not last for long as it was burned down in 1188. However, the Sverresaga indicates it had been restored by 1197.The Trondheim Science Center (Norwegian: Vitensenteret i Trondheim) is a scientific hands-on experience center. The NTNU University Museum (Norwegian: NTNU Vitenskapsmuseet) is part of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

Vollan was not considered a concentration camp. In a summary of prisoners of war in Norway, numerous prisoners were registered at Vollan. Once of its roles was as a transit camp for political prisoners. Many prisoners were taken from Vollan to Kristiansten Fortress and shot. The prisoners at Vollan were interrogated at the Mission Hotel in Trondheim.  Some were also interrogated by Henry Rinnan and his gang.

      "name": "Hegra Fortress",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Battle of Hegra Fortress was a 25-day engagement in the 1940 Norwegian Campaign which saw a small force of Norwegian volunteers fighting numerically superior German forces from a fortified position. After initial fighting around the Mer\u00e5ker Line railway line, the Norwegians pulled back into Hegra Fortress and held off further German attacks before surrendering on 5 May as one of the last Norwegian units active in southern Norway.\n\n\n== Opposing forces ==\n\n\n=== Norwegian force ===\nThe Norwegian defenders were 250 volunteer soldiers and the volunteer nurse Anne Margrethe Bang. Most of the volunteers that served at Hegra were from the area Hegra/Stj\u00f8rdal/Trondheim, but they also included three Swedes.The garrison at Hegra was equipped with small arms (Krag-J\u00f8rgensen rifles and carbines), as well as Madsen and Colt M/29 machine guns.\nThe fortress also had artillery, four 10.5 cm (4.13 in) and two 7.5 cm (2.95 in) positional pieces of reasonably modern make with gun shields; as well as four Krupp m/1887 8.4 cm (3.31 in) field guns. The artillery had a maximum range of between six and nine kilometres.Many of these men had been mobilized to Artillery Regiment no. 3 at \u00d8yanmoen army camp at V\u00e6rnes Air Station and were brought to Hegra to continue the mobilization after the Germans had reached their camp. The fortress at Hegra was originally only intended as a temporary refuge for the artillery regiment, but ended up as the centre of the volunteers' war in 1940.\n\n\n=== German force ===\nThe attacking force initially consisted of Gebirgsj\u00e4ger of the German 138. Gebirgsj\u00e4gerregiment (part of the 3. Gebirgsdivision), which landed in Trondheim on 9 April. Later, from 20 April to 27 April, the Germans substituted the 138. Gebirgsj\u00e4gerregiment with units from the 181. Infantry Division and the 138. Gebirgsj\u00e4ger were sent north to try to relieve their comrades at the Narvik Front.By the end of the battle the German forces employed against Hegra Fortress consisted chiefly of one infantry battalion at Hegra and one company of Gebirgsj\u00e4ger in the nearby village of Sona. In addition further units were deployed to the village of Elvran and to the Selbu region.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe old mothballed fort at Ingstadkleiva that was to become known as Hegra Fortress was not intended by any of the parties as a battlefield. It only became of importance when the Norwegian artillery major Hans Reidar Holtermann started organising troops to resist the German invasion forces which had been landed at Trondheim. Holtermann first travelled to the army camp at V\u00e6rnes to mobilize his Artillery Regiment no. 3. This mobilization began at 14:00 on 9 April 1940, but the Germans landed at Stj\u00f8rdal Station the very next day, and by 10:30 approached the camp. As his forces were not combat ready, Holtermann had to evacuate and move to what was at that point known as Ingstadkleiva Fort to complete his mobilization. Thus, at 15:00 on 10 April 1940, most of the personnel and equipment under Holtermann's command arrived at the small mountain fortification of Ingstadkleiva Fort. At this point, Holtermann was given orders to proceed with the mobilization and otherwise do what he himself thought best. Holtermann thus began to gather and equip a fighting force of local volunteers. After arriving at the fort Holtermann first took residence in the buildings outside the mountain fortifications, not intending to defend the facility, only use it as a temporary base.\n\n\n=== Mobilization ===\nBy 10 April, Holtermann already had fifty volunteers under his command and a steady stream of mostly local men kept being drawn to the fort. On 11 April, men of Holtermann's unit returned to V\u00e6rnes to remove more of the materiel and provisions stored there. Due to poor security amongst the German forces stationed at the camp, the Norwegians were able to carry out their mission undetected. The reclaimed supplies were taken partly to the fortress and partly to a number of nearby farms. When a force of 250 soldiers had been assembled, Holtermann had to turn away further volunteers due to the fact he could not arm or equip any more soldiers than those he already had under his command at that point. From 12 April work was carried out to reactivate the fortress' artillery, which was found to have plentiful ammunition, but no direction systems or charts for indirect fire. Only a few 1:100,000 scale maps were available at the fortress. The actual artillery charts for the fortress were stored in Trondheim and fell into the hands of the Germans on 9 April and were used by the Wehrmacht during the siege to deploy artillery in places that the fortress could not hit. The same day troops of Holtermann's unit were positioned around Hegra railway station and M\u00e6len bridge, and the first German attempt at making the fortress surrender was carried out. A German Major approached the fortress together with two Norwegian officers who had given up the same day. Despite the best efforts by both the German officer and the two surrendered Norwegians, Holtermann refused to capitulate. The next day, 13 April, Major Holtermann achieved contact with his superiors at the 5th Division for the last time during the Norwegian Campaign. Through a telephone conversation, the commander of the force at Hegra was told to act as he saw best and, if possible, to hinder the Germans in gaining control of the Mer\u00e5kerbanen railway line to Sweden. In response to these orders, 20 soldiers were sent to the village of Flornes to set up field fortifications and block the road and railway to Mer\u00e5ker.\n\n\n=== Friendly fire incident ===\nOn 14 April, reports came in to the troops stationed at Hegra village stating that a train loaded with German soldiers had left Hell railway station and was on its way to Hegra. Not long after a train approached Hegra Station and ignored signals to stop. In response to what was interpreted as a German troop train trying to force its way through, the soldiers guarding the station opened fire on the approaching train. However, the train was in fact carrying Finnish refugees home after the Winter War. The fire killed one Norwegian man and wounded two Finnish women. Later that afternoon, the garrison's sole female member joined when nurse Anne Margrethe Bang from Trondheim arrived at the fortress bearing a load of medical supplies. The daughter of a doctor and trained in first aid, Bang stayed in the fortress for the duration of the siege, helping two military doctors care for the sick and wounded.\n\n\n=== German aircraft driven off by ground fire ===\nThe first shots fired by the fortress' defenders occurred on 14 April, the same day as the friendly-fire train incident, when a Norwegian heavy machine gun fired at and damaged a German aircraft, driving it away. More equipment and ammunition from V\u00e6rnes arrived at the fortress the same day.\n\n\n== Battle ==\n\n\n=== German capture of the surrounding area ===\n\n\n==== Attack on Hegra village ====\nAt 05:30 on 15 April, the Germans attacked the Norwegian positions defending the Hegra railway station, Hegra road bridge and M\u00e6len bridge, supported by artillery fire. Having been partly caught by surprise, the Norwegian forces at the Hegra road bridge and the railway station made a fighting retreat to the fortress over a two- to three-hour period. Early on in the fighting, the Norwegians demolished the Hegra road bridge, forcing the German infantry to cross the precarious ice of the frozen Stj\u00f8rdal River under fire. At M\u00e6len bridge, the guards withdrew to the south. Four Norwegian soldiers fell in and around Hegra, while one was killed at M\u00e6len bridge. In addition to those killed, eight Norwegian soldiers were taken prisoner during the initial German attack.\n\n\n==== Fortress artillery intervenes ====\nAs the German attack developed, the artillery pieces at Hegra Fortress opened up to support the Norwegian troops under attack in the valley below, and later covered their retreat. The Norwegian artillery fire was directed at German artillery positions, machine gun nests and convoys of trucks pushing east towards the Swedish border. The telephone operator at Hegra telegraph station acted as an observer for the artillery at the fortress. Artillery fire from the fortress knocked out three German artillery pieces and inflicted casualties on the attacking force.\n\n\n==== Skirmish on the fortress road ====\nAs the Norwegian infantry force pulled out of Hegra and up the road towards the fortress, the Germans pursued them until they reached a number of field fortifications blocking the road. At this position, the Norwegians held their ground and inflicted fatalities on the attacking force. Amongst the German fatalities was the attacking platoon's leader, Oberleutnant Hans-Joachim Herrmann. After the fighting, as the Norwegians were going through the area to seize German arms and equipment, they found the German Gefreiter Hugo Bayerle. Bayerle had been hit in both thighs, sustaining a broken femur, and was bleeding profusely. The Norwegian troops brought him on a ski sled to the fortress for medical care.\n\n\n==== End of the first day of the battle ====\nAt the end of the first day of serious fighting, the Germans pushed on along the Mer\u00e5kerbanen railway line and broke through the blocking position at Flornes. The troops holding Flornes withdrew first to Mer\u00e5ker, then further north to join other Norwegian forces. As night fell, German troops had occupied the areas around the villages of Hegra, Avelsgaard, Flornes, Ingstad and Sona. During the day, Luftwaffe aircraft had repeatedly overflown Hegra Fortress. The Norwegian troops had fired on the aircraft with both rifles and machine guns, damaging one aircraft, which crashed while attempting an emergency landing at V\u00e6rnes.\n\n\n=== Attempts to storm the fortress ===\nThe day after the German capture of the area surrounding the fortress, Luftwaffe aircraft repeatedly attacked with bombs and machine gun fire. German infantry probed the approaches to the fortifications but were driven off by artillery and heavy machine gun fire. A German mountain howitzer brought up to Avelsgaard bombarded the fortress, destroying most of the houses outside the walls. One Norwegian soldier was killed by a shell hitting the fortress parapet. He was the last Norwegian fatality of the battle.\n\n\n==== First German charge ====\n17 April began with a bombardment at 07:00 from the air and by the howitzer position at Avelsgaard.\nAt 09:00, a large force of German infantry attacked from the north-east, supported by machine gun positions situated a mere 150 m (160 yd) north of the fortress. The progress of the attack was only halted when it reached the barbed wire entanglements directly in front of the Norwegian trenches. At this point, the attacking force was subjected to heavy fire at close range from artillery, machine guns and riflemen, and thrown back. German bombers kept on hitting the fortress throughout the day, knocking out both the telephone line and the electricity supply. Neither came back into operation during the siege. From then until the end of the battle, all light inside the Norwegian tunnels and halls was provided by candles and nine kerosene lamps.\n\n\n==== Second attack is aborted ====\nThe day after their first unsuccessful attack, the German forces made another attempt at storming the mountain fortress. In preparation, the fortifications were subjected to heavy machine gun and mortar fire during the early daylight hours. A battalion of infantry was brought forward towards the fortress, but was hit by a blizzard while marching through no man's land. As the attacking units lost their bearing in the storm, fire fights erupted between groups of Germans mistaking each other for Norwegian patrols and the whole enterprise collapsed before reaching the Norwegian positions. Bombers and heavy calibre artillery pieces kept up steady fire against the fortress throughout the day.\n\n\n=== Siege ===\n\n\n==== Evacuation of wounded ====\nIn the evening of 18 April, two Norwegian doctors\u2014Sigurd Aarrestad and Peter Berdal\u2014approached the German commander of the Hegra-Son area and requested permission to pass through the German lines to evacuate wounded soldiers from the fortress. During the previous days' fighting many German wounded had been brought to Hegra village and the doctors feared that there had been numerous casualties on the Norwegian side as well. Permission for the mission was granted, and the shelling of Hegra Fortress was temporarily suspended while local volunteers made their way up to the fortress, pulling ski sleds for the wounded. While Aarrestad led the expedition, Berdal was held hostage by the Germans to ensure that the Norwegians returned from the fortress after finishing their mission. When Aarrestad returned from Hegra Fortress a few hours later, he brought along nine wounded Norwegian soldiers and Gefreiter Bayerle, who had been released by his captors and sent along with the wounded Norwegians. As part of the agreement, the Norwegian wounded did not become prisoners of war.\n\n\n==== Attempts to storm the fortress are abandoned ====\nFrom around 25 April, the Germans gave up on storming Hegra Fortress. The pressing need to remove the Norwegian force ended in large part when the important town of Steinkjer fell to the Germans on 21 April and the Allied advance from the north was checked. The southern arm of the Allied counter-attack had never swung north from \u00c5ndalsnes and had instead been directed to the Gudbrandsdal in order to support the Norwegian forces fighting there. As the immediate crisis had passed for the German force in Trondheim, they preferred to push south to link up with forces coming up from Oslo. The focus of the Wehrmacht became to bombard Hegra Fortress with artillery and air power to try to pummel it into submission.\n\n\n==== Artillery duels, aerial bombing and patrol engagements ====\nFor the remainder of the battle, the Germans did not try to storm the fortress again. Fighting consisted of aerial bombing of the fortress, duels between the fortress' guns and German field artillery and skirmishes between German and Norwegian ski units doing reconnaissance and bringing in supplies of food, ammunition and fuel. Several Norwegian soldiers were captured as a result of the patrol actions. To counter German guns placed in the positional guns' blind zones, the Norwegian artillerymen positioned their two 8.4 cm field guns to cover areas the fixed guns could not reach. During the siege, the Norwegian guns targeted machine gun nests, gun positions, command posts and ammunition depots in the surrounding area. On 23 April, one of the 7.5 cm positional guns was knocked out, one of the fortress' command towers was destroyed and the water line was broken. The second 7.5 cm gun was destroyed on 24 April. The fortress was under constant artillery fire and held out chiefly in order to be in a position to support the Allied offensive expected from the north.On 25 April, the Germans employed a new weapon against the fortress when a seaplane dropped a 1,800 kg (4,000 lb) bomb, destroying the houses outside the walls, with shrapnel ending up in Hegra village several kilometres away. From 29 April, the artillery bombardment steadily increased in strength, with German guns reinforced by captured Norwegian 12 cm (4.7 in) howitzers from the armoury in Trondheim, and the next day one of the three 10.5 cm guns at the fortress was knocked out. During the siege, a total of over 2,300 shells struck Hegra Fortress.\n\n\n==== V\u00e6rnes Air Station ====\nOne way that Holtermann wanted to directly support the main war effort in Norway was to bombard V\u00e6rnes Air Base, the northernmost airfield in German hands and vital for the support of German forces north of Trondheim. This was particularly so for the Narvik front, which could not be reached by aircraft flying from further south than V\u00e6rnes. Recognising this, the Germans had hired some 2,000 Norwegian collaborationist labourers to work full-time at expanding and improving the air strip. Bombarding V\u00e6rnes would both have disrupted this work and impaired the bombing raids being flown against Norwegian forces fighting further to the north. However, since V\u00e6rnes is 11.5 km (7.1 mi) from Hegra, and the fortress' guns only had a maximum range of some 9 km (5.6 mi), this was impossible. For accurate firing, the effective range was a mere 6.9 km (4.3 mi), as that was the range of the artillery's height angle meter. Efforts were made at the fortress to increase the elevation of the guns from 19\u00b0 to 26\u00b0 by removing part of the gun shields, and part of the gun mounting, but these failed as no welding equipment could be acquired to carry out the modifications. Even though no modifications could be carried out, one of the 10.5 cm guns at Hegra opened fire in the direction of V\u00e6rnes on 22 April. With the gun firing at maximum elevation, the rounds still fell hundreds of metres short of their intended target.The earliest attempt by the Hegra garrison to attack the airfield at V\u00e6rnes had occurred on 14 April, when a Norwegian dog sled patrol spotted massive German air activity at the air base. Plans were made to manhandle one of the fortress' 8.4 cm field guns to a nearby hill called Blankhammeren, and from there bombard German targets out of range from the fortress itself, including the strategically important airfield. The plan, however, could not be carried out before the German attack of 15 April brought large German infantry forces into the area and rendered the plans infeasible.\n\n\n==== International media attention ====\nDuring the siege, the struggle of Hegra Fortress captured the attention of the international media, with articles such as those in The Daily Telegraph on 22 April and 2 May, and that in The Manchester Guardian on 16 April. The fortress was also mentioned in articles in Time magazine on 6 May and 13 May.\n\n\n== Surrender ==\n\n\n=== Preparations and influencing factors ===\n\nNews came in over the radio on 2 May of the Allied retreat from the \u00c5ndalsnes area, that the Germans had seized control of the Dovre Line from Domb\u00e5s to St\u00f8ren, and of the surrender of the Norwegian 4th Brigade in Western Norway. This came on top of increasing supply problems, with the bread supply already having run out on 30 April. The next day, 3 May, the garrison started destroying its artillery ammunition in preparation for surrender. The three Swedish volunteers that had endured the siege with the Norwegians were released from their duties and guided across the mountains to the Swedish border by a ski patrol. During the day, a radio message from Colonel Ole Berg Getz\u2014the Norwegian commander in the Tr\u00f8ndelag area\u2014was broadcast. Getz had surrendered his forces in Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag and advised all Norwegian forces in Tr\u00f8ndelag to lay down their arms as the situation had become hopeless after the British retreat from the southern parts of Norway. The decision to surrender Tr\u00f8ndelag had been influenced by Neville Chamberlain's radio message that day announcing the end of the Allied campaign in Southern Norway. On 4 May, destruction of radios, machine guns, carbines and other small arms was initiated and ski patrols were sent out carrying loads of important documents. By 13:50 that day confirmation of Colonel Getz's capitulation was received and the destruction of the fortress' artillery began.\n\n\n=== Capitulation ===\nIn the early hours of 5 May, the situation was such that there was very little food left and water for only a few days, all other Norwegian and Allied forces in all of southern Norway had been withdrawn or had surrendered and Hegra Fortress was the last remaining pocket of resistance south of Nordland. At 05:00, Major Holtermann had his men assemble in the tunnels and relayed to them his decision to surrender the fortress. In a short speech, he thanked them for their efforts and then led them in singing the Norwegian National Anthem. By 05:25, a white flag was raised over the fortress, and at 06:30 a force of 60 German soldiers and three officers\u2014led by one Hauptmann Giebel\u2014arrived to accept the surrender of the garrison. Later that day, 190 men and one woman marched out of the fortress and into captivity. At the surrender, the garrison at Hegra Fortress consisted of 14 officers, one technical officer, seven sergeants, one officer cadet, six corporals, 161 privates and nurse Anne Margrethe Bang.\n\n\n=== Garrison as prisoners of war ===\n\nAfter the surrender, the Norwegians were marched down to Hegra railway station from where they were transported by train. In Trondheim, the officers and Anne Margrethe Bang were taken off the train and interned at Trondheim katedralskole secondary school while the NCOs and soldiers continued their journey to Lundamo in Gauldalen valley. At Lundamo, the prisoners were interned in a barn for the night. The next day, 6 May, the prisoners from Hegra were force-marched for 50 km (31 mi) to Berk\u00e5k where a prisoner-of-war camp was established. At Berk\u00e5k, the prisoners were set at work at building an improvised road from the river Orkla near Berk\u00e5k across the woods to Brattset. The road was intended to help the German logistic system that had been severely hampered by the numerous bridges that had been blown by the Norwegian Army during the preceding month. Due in part to the poor physical condition of the prisoners after the harsh siege they had just experienced, the road was never completed despite threats of punishment made by the German camp commander. At the end of May the German High Command in Berlin announced that Adolf Hitler had personally ordered the release of Norwegian prisoners of war as an act of recognition of the defence they had put up under difficult conditions. The release of the prisoners from Hegra happened in groups and by mid-June the last PoWs had been let go.\n\n\n== Casualties ==\nSix Norwegian soldiers were killed in action during the battle, with 14 wounded. All the Norwegian fatalities occurred during the first two days of the fighting. In the first years after World War II, Norwegian estimates of the number of German casualties were exaggerated, some spoke of up to 1,100 dead or wounded. Later research has however led to a substantially lower number, at about 150 to 200 Wehrmacht soldiers killed or wounded at Hegra.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nArnstad, Johan (1965).

        "wiki": "Trondheim (UK: , US: , Urban East Norwegian: [\u02c8tr\u0254\u0302n(h)\u00e6\u026am]; Southern Sami: Tr\u00e5ante), historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 199,039 (27/02/2020), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the River Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions.\nThe settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the Viking Age until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran Diocese of Nidaros and the Nidaros Cathedral. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with Byneset, Leinstrand, Strinda and Tiller.\nThe city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of Tr\u00f8ndelag county, but not as the administrative centre, which is Steinkjer. This is to make the county more efficient and not too centralized, as Tr\u00f8ndelag is the third largest county in Norway.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe city was originally given the name by Olav Tryggvason. It was for a long time called Nidaros (English: Mouth of the river Nid), or Ni\u00f0ar\u00f3ss in the Old Norse spelling. But it was also just called kaupangr (\"city\") or, more specifically, kaupangr \u00ed \u00der\u00f3ndheimi (\"the city in the district \u00der\u00f3ndheimr\", i.e. Tr\u00f8ndelag). In the late Middle Ages people started to call the city just \u00der\u00f3ndheimr. In the Dano-Norwegian period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of Denmark\u2013Norway, the city name was spelled Trondhjem.\nFollowing the example set by the renaming of the capital Kristiania to Oslo, Nidaros was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of Trondhjem and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of riots, forced the Storting to settle for the medieval city name Trondheim. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from Trondhjem stift to Nidaros bisped\u00f8mme (English: Diocese of Nidaros) in 1918.\nTrondheim was briefly named Drontheim during the Second World War, as a German exonym.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTrondheim was named Kaupangen (English: market place or trading place) by Viking King Olav Tryggvason in 997 CE. Shortly thereafter it came to be called Nidaros. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer (Old Norse: \"hird\"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the king, and was the capital of Norway until 1217.\nPeople have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the rock carvings in central Norway, the N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures and the Corded Ware culture. In ancient times, the Kings of Norway were hailed at \u00d8retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River Nidelva. Harald Fairhair (865\u2013933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I, called 'the Good'. The battle of Kalvskinnet took place in Trondheim in 1179: King Sverre Sigurdsson and his Birkebeiner warriors were victorious against Erling Skakke (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous Lewis chessmen, 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the Hebrides and now at the British Museum, may have been made in Trondheim.Trondheim was the seat of the Archbishop of Nidaros for Norway from 1152, who operated from the Archbishop's Palace. Due to the introduction of Lutheran Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, had to flee from the city to the Netherlands, where he died in present-day Lier, Belgium.\nThe city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the \"Horneman Fire\") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, originally from Luxembourg. Broad avenues like Munkegata were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of under 10,000 inhabitants, with most living in the downtown area.After the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of Tr\u00f8ndelag, became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the Treaty of Copenhagen on 27 May 1660.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Trondheim was occupied by Nazi Germany from 9 April 1940, the first day of the invasion of Norway, until the end of the war in Europe, 8 May 1945. The German invasion force consisted of the German cruiser Admiral Hipper, 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the Namsos Campaign. During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, Henry Rinnan, who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of martial law in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker DORA I), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, Nordstern (\"Northern Star\"), centred 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of \u00d8ysand in the outskirts of Melhus municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German Kriegsmarine. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.\n\n\n=== Municipal history ===\nThe city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1864, part of Strinda (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of Strinda (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the Lade area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of Leinstrand (population: 4,193), Byneset (population: 2,049), Strinda (population: 44,600), and Tiller (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality. On 1 January 2020, the neighboring Kl\u00e6bu Municipality (population: 6,050) was merged with Trondheim Municipality.\n\n\n=== Coat of arms and seal ===\n\nThe coat of arms dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an archbishop with his staff and mitre in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the motif is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by H\u00e5kon Thorsen.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTrondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets Trondheim Fjord with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.\nThe municipality's top elevation is the Storheia hill, 565 metres (1,854 ft) above sea level. At the summer solstice, the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon\u2013there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions. At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nTrondheim city has an oceanic climate or humid continental climate, depending on the winter threshold used (0 \u00b0C or -3 \u00b0C). The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March, but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971\u20132000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least 25 cm (10 in) of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as By\u00e5sen and Heimdal, with good skiing conditions in Bymarka. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The Tr\u00f8ndelag area has seen average temperatures increase by almost 2 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F) in the last 25 years.\nAll the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) from 1900, 3.7 \u00b0C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately 0.7 \u00b0C (1.3 \u00b0F) per 100 m (328 ft), so the city centre at 10 m asl will be about 0.8 \u00b0C (1.4 \u00b0F) warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.\nThree of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. \nTemperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7 \u00b0C.\nA new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at Gl\u00f8shaugen in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016, 1,576 sunhours in 2017, 1,705 sunhours in 2018 and 1649 sunhours in 2019.

Moose and deer are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a wolverine lived in Bymarka.\n\n\n== Cityscape and sites ==\n\nMost of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets Nordre gate (English: Northern street), Olav Tryggvasons gate and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct Trondhjems mekaniske V\u00e6rksted shipbuilding company at the Nedre Elvehavn was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums.

        "wiki": "The regalia of Norway are items that symbolise the Norwegian monarch's power and majesty. Little is known of the old Norwegian regalia which have since been lost and the majority of items date from 1818 and were made for the coronation of Jean Bernadotte as King Carl III Johan.\nThe Norwegian royal regalia include nine items: the king's crown, the sword of the realm, the king's sceptre, the king's orb, the queen's crown, the queen's sceptre, the queen's orb, the crown of the crown prince and the anointing horn. Also in this collection are several mantles, two banners of the realm and coronation thrones.\nThe last king and queen in Norway to be crowned were Haakon VII and his wife Maud of Wales in 1905. Thereafter, the regalia have since not been used to physically crown or to be worn by successive monarchs. Certain items are still used occasionally such as during the monarch's consecration, where the crown is displayed; or during the monarch's funeral service, where it is placed atop the casket.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring Norway's union with Denmark, the king underwent a coronation ceremony in Denmark. When this union was dissolved in 1814, Norway declared its independence and adopted its own constitution. However, total independence was short-lived as Norway would be compelled to enter into a personal union with Sweden and sharing the same monarch and foreign policy.\nA coronation was required among the provisions in Norway's 1814 constitution. The old Norwegian regalia had been lost and no Norwegian regalia was available for use when preparations were made for the coronation of King Carl Johan in 1818. The king would pay for the essential regalia himself. The regalia of the king and the anointing horn were made for this coronation. The regalia of the queen were acquired in 1830 for the planned coronation of Carl Johan's wife, D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Clary. This coronation never took place. All the regalia were made in Sweden except the crown of the crown prince which was made in Norway in 1848 and the sword of state which was a gift from Charles John to the Norwegian state. The coronet of the crown prince was ordered for use in the planned coronation of Oscar I and Josephine of Leuchtenberg, as the Norwegian parliament wanted the heir apparent to the throne, the future Charles IV to take part in the ceremony. However Oscar I was never to be crowned in Norway because the bishop of Nidaros refused to crown the Catholic Josephine. The sword of state was initially a gift from Napoleon Bonaparte to Charles III John, then known as Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, when he was appointed Marshal of France. Charles III John carried the sword during the Battle of Leipzig; when he acquired the Norwegian regalia in 1818, he had the blade of the sword refashioned, in order that its symbolic language might correspond better to its new function.\nThe coronation that followed Charles III John's was that of Charles IV and his wife, Louise of the Netherlands, in 1860. Oscar II and Sophie of Nassau were crowned in 1873.\nFollowing the dissolution of the union with Sweden in 1905, Norway elected a Danish prince to serve as its own king. King Haakon VII, his wife Maud, and their son Olav arrived in Norway on 25 November and Haakon took the required oath as King two days later. As required by the constitution, Haakon (along with his wife) was subsequently crowned and anointed the following year on 22 June 1906 at the Nidaros Cathedral in Tro dheim. This was the last time the regalia were to be used for a coronation as the provision in the Norwegian constitution requiring the monarch's coronation was repealed in 1908. The coronet of the crown prince has never been used: Crown Prince Olav was too young to participate in the ceremony in 1906.\nThe regalia are now on display in the Archbishop's Palace, next to the Nidaros Cathedral. Certain items from the regalia collection are still used occasionally such as during the monarch's consecration, where the crown is displayed; or during the monarch's funeral service, where it is placed atop the casket.\nIn 2006, Harald V made a speech where he emphasised that the Norwegian Crown symbolises a free, independent and democratic nation.\n\n\n== Individual items in the regalia ==\n\nThe King's Crown: made in Stockholm in 1818 by goldsmith Olof Wihlborg, the crown is a corona clausa (closed model) of gold consisting of a circlet bearing eight large stones, primarily amethysts and chrysoprases surrounded by a wreath of oak leaves with three pearls set as acorns between each of these stones, the largest of these being a large oval green tourmaline, a gift of the Brazilian consul in Stockholm to King Charles III Johan in the front.  From on the rim of this circlet are eight gold strawberry leaves, each set with a precious or semi-precious stone (except that covered by the large tourmaline in the front), between which are set eight pairs of gold oak leaves with pearl set acorn between them.  From behind these strawberry leaves rises eight half arches, four of them being each set with four precious or semi-precious stones alternating with four pairs of oak leaves and pairs of pearls and the other four half arches consisting of gold branches of laurel leaves.  These half-arches support a blue enameled orb sprinkled with gold stars and surround by an equator and meridian band of half-pearls and supporting at its top a Latin cross of six amethysts.  Among the other precious and semi-precious stones set in the crown are an emerald, a ruby, a topaz, an alexandrite and a white opal.  The crown is lined with a red velvet cap covered with pearls alternating with small crowns embroidered in gold thread.\nKing's orb: made in Stockholm in 1818 by goldsmith Adolf Zethelius (1781\u20131864) is a 10 cm sphere of gilt silver and with a 1 cm wide equator and meridian decorated with small roses.  The King's orb is footed and at the top the meridian bears a miniature orb and cross.\nKing's sceptre: made in Stockholm in 1818 by goldsmith Adolf Zethelius is a 75 cm rod of gilt silver.  At the top of this rod is a diminutive orb and cross, immediately below which it is surrounded with open work foliage of oak leaves, while the knobs on either side of the grip are decorated with the roses similar to those found on the King's orb.\nAnointing horn: made in Stockholm in 1818 by goldsmith Adolf Zethelius of gilt silver and has the form of upturned and footed bull's horn with the open end closed with a chained lid topped with an acorn and with a miniature royal crown on the tip of the horn.  It was obviously inspired by the anointing horn in the Swedish regalia, which also has the form of an upturned and footed bull's horn.\nSword of the Realm: early 19th century. Tradition has it that this coronation sword was a gift from Napoleon I, Emperor of the French, to the future king of Sweden and Norway, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, when he was made Marshal of France, which he carried as Swedish Crown Prince at the battle of Leipzig.  He had a new hilt, grip and scabbard in gilt bronze made for this sword appropriate to its new use as the Norwegian Sword of the Realm.  Inlaid panels of mother of pearl decorate the grip and scabbard and engravings of oak leaves on the scabbard and hilt and grip and an acorn at the tip of the grip correspond to the oak leaves and acorns found also on the crown and sceptre.\nQueen's crown: made in Stockholm in 1830 by goldsmith Erik Lundberg.  It was modelled after the Swedish queen consort's crown.  The crown is a corona clausa consisting of a gold circlet of eight larger stones (two amethysts, four topazes and two chrysoprases) alternating with eight smaller stones (amethysts) with rosettes of seven small pearls between each of these and surrounded by an engraved design of roses leaves.  On the rim of this circlet rises eight leaves, each set with a round amethyst, alternating with eight large half pearls.  From behind these leaves rises eight half arches of a leaf design, each set with seven progressively smaller oval amethysts (except the first stone in the front half arch which is set with a rectangler topaz) and supporting at the top, on a row of small pearls, a blue enamel orb with an equator and meridian band of small pearls supporting a pearl cross at the top.  The crown is lined with a red velvet cap with seed pearls embroidered in a branch-like design behind each of the large half pearls on the rim of the circlet and at the top of the cap, an eight pointed star shaped gold button set with a large pearl.\nQueen's orb: made in Stockholm in 1830 is a 10 cm sphere of gilt silver with a 1 cm equator and meridian set with faceted amethysts.  The Queen's orb is footed and on the top the meridian bears a miniature blue enamelled orb with an equator and meridian band set with small pearls bearing at its top a cross also set with small pearls.\nQueen's sceptre: made in Stockholm in 1830 is a 70 cm rod of gilt silver.  At its head the rod is set with four rows of five faceted oval amethysts, diminishing in size from bottom to top, encased between four acanthus leaves. From each of four large scrolls below this head and from four smaller scrolls above it hang drop shaped pendant each set with a drop-shaped amethyst, the scrolls, pendants and their amethysts below being significantly larger than those above.  The grip of the Queen's sceptre has a banister-like shape embossed with design of acanthus leaves.\nCrown Prince's coronet: made in Norway in 1846 by goldsmith Herman Colbj\u00f8rnsen \u00d8yset. The coronet is a corona aperta (open model), clearly modelled in its basic design on that of the Swedish Crown Prince's coronet, and made of gold and decorated with amethysts, citrines, peridots and rare Norwegian freshwater pearls.  The circlet is polished with acanthus ornamentation with a matte finish around the gemstones alternating with groups of three oak leaves set in a fan shape around a pearl.  At the front of the circlet is an oval amethyst and four amethysts alternate with four citrines on the circlet proper.  The eight triangular points of this radial crown are in a matte finish with similar acanthus ornamentation, while between each of these points they are joined to each other on either side and to the circlet itself with a pair of acanthus scrolls supporting a group of five oak leaves around a pearl similar to those on the circlet.  Each of the points has two oval colored gemstones, one an amethyst, the other a peridot, the lower one being slightly larger than that above it with a small pearl above them.  At the top of each point is a larger Norwegian freshwater half pearl in a trefoil setting.  It is lined with a red velvet cap heavily embroidered in gold thread with the design of a large radiating star at the top surrounded by four pairs of acanthus scrolls.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCrown jewels\nRoyal coronations in Norway\nNorwegian monarchy\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page of the Norwegian Royal Regalia\nNidaros Cathedral | The Crown Regalia\nRoyal House of Norway | The Regalia\nShort video from NRK of the Royal family visiting the exhibit of the Royal Regalia",

          "The Crown Regalia are housed int the basement - three crowns and assorted add ons, they look nice. Thats it really - if you want to see some crowns and a bit of history then this is for you. It was quiet on Sunday when I went so did get to have a very long look at the assorted",
          "I was not impressed that we made the effort to come back the following day (as it is only open for a few hours each day) to find that you cannot actually get into the area with the actual regalia as it is closed off. They really should have a sign where you buy the tickets",
          "The Crown Regalia is housed in a building that is part of the Archbishop\u2019s Museum complex. There are displays showing the crowning of the kings of Norway on the upper level of the museum and exhibits of coronation medals, souvenir coins issued in remembrance of a coronation,",

          "The exhibit is on two floors. The first floor gives an overview of the royal lineage, going back before Olav Tryggvason, later known as Saint Olaf. Not sure why photographs were not allowed of the thrones, the coronation robe and sundry emblems and pins but photographs were",

          "Compared to other royal house displays around the world, this was really nothing. Part of the Archbishop's Palace entrance.",
          "We had to view it from a distance outside of a sort of portcullis, silly since they are behind what looks like bullet proof glass. Quite small crowns, a couple of swords.",
          "We bought the combination ticket think that all three were open, only to discover that we could not get into the room where the Crown Jewels were displayed, they were selling these tickets at half price which made the combined ticket more expensive!",
          "The jewels were in a room locked with a gate and had to be viewed from around 20 ' away. I assume it was due to the recent theft of the Swedish crown jewels in broad daylight. Not worth a special trip at this time.",
          "We did this on the aforementioned combination ticket. See impressive items on display. Sadly the day we went, the jewels room was locked so we could only see them from afar. The display on Norwegian queens was very good though.",
          "As part of a combo ticket, it's worthwhile to check out this small museum, with the crown jewels displayed on the lowest level. The crown jewels are very beautiful, and it makes you realize how important these symbols of power were (that the state would spend such sums on",
          "Visited this on a combination ticket with cathedral and museum. Small museum featuring the crown jewels and regalia of the Norwegian royal family. Interesting viewing but not a huge number of items on display. Worth a visit.",
          "An interesting museum with the regalia of the Norwegian royalty. The history is also well told in small posts. At the time we visited there was also an exhibition of the role of women and queens in the royal history.",
          "This is a very nicely done display of the Norwegian royal regalia - which are no longer used due to the modernization of the monarchy in the early 20th century. The crowns are beautiful but I liked the robes even more! They are in glass cases but there is plenty of time and",
          "I went here as part of the combo ticket and enjoyed it very much. I spent about 45 minutes here. The crown regalia is lovely. There is plenty of information to read about the crown regalia. There was a restroom available, which was handy. The combo ticket was a great way to",
          "This museum was included in a combo admission to the church and palace. It was behind the church near the military museum. It had crowns, swords, royal robes and photos of royalty. There were statues and coronation chairs. I am a descendant of King Olaf, although it is a",
          "Likely worth it for the value with the combo ticket but there are not too many jewels here. Enough to see who has style (the Queen) versus who wanted a bunch of rocks on his crown.",
          "Housed in part of the Archbishops Palace, it is suitably atmospheric. Unlike the British Crown Jewels, these are more modest, without huge, expensive stones, but nonetheless impressive. Associated is a view of the monarchy that has lasted a thousand years, and has gone through",
          "There are three crowns from different monarchs on display, there are descriptions in Norwegian and English so it is good for tourists",
          "No idea how people still post photos when it clearly says no photos. The crown jewels are not replicas, they are the real thing. You can find this small display inside the Archbishop's Palace.",
          "There is a fine line between having too many things on display and having too little. In the case of this small museum, I feel that they could have included a few more examples of, what must be, quite an extensive collection of royal regalia.",
          "Wonderful exhibit of crown regalia and pictures of past coronations including present incumbents. Interesting to observe the more restrained design of their regalia compared to ours in England",
          "The presentation of the crowns was first class. We were the only ones in the room so a very good experience. The only downside is basically the regalia is only 3 crowns dating back to 1830's. Along with the other exhibits especially the military museum worthy of the entrance",
          "The regalia itself was fascinating and quite well presented but the exhibition could be better. Only spent around 20 minutes here and that was enough to see what needed to be seen.",
          "If you get a combo ticket, you can visit the Cathedral, Archbishop's museum, and see the Crown Jewels and other regalia. These are the real thing, well worth seeing. The regalia are not only beautiful, but the exhibits also give some of the history associated with them. Worth",
          "This is a great place to see the crowns and robes, jewels, chairs etc of the royals! Very interesting!",
          "Thought that the Norwegian crown jewelry would be in the capital Oslo but it was in Trondheim. :) very little exhibition. Quick visit should be enough. The other museums on the area and the Nidaros dome area itself is worth while visiting. This exhibition completes the visit.",
          "Great exhibition of Norway's Crown Regalia. Here is Norway's Crown Regalia located. Great that they can be presented to the general public. Nice exhibition in the basement of this beautiful building. Just enjoy this.",
          "Bought the Cathedral combination ticket, so headed to this building. Not bad-only takes about 30 mins really to look at. Presented and displayed very well with signage in Norwegian and English.",
          "It was fun to get a close up look at the royal crowns. There is an extra charge to come in to this section near the main cathedral. No photos allowed.",
          "I really liked this exhibit! The old crowns and caps and everything were very cool to see in person because of the sheer size of some of the gems and detail of the crowns overall.",
          "It is a very special experience to walk among all this historical regalia. No stress and no crowd. Impressing craftmanship of the old days. Pure art!",
          "Norway is a kingdom. But not like the usual Europian kingdoms. Here people love the king, because he is one of them. But very impotant, here, the king loves the land and it\u0384s people. So the crown regalia is not only about the kingdoms jewels, it is about the Norwegian history",
          "You can spend as much time watching all the crowns and regalia as you want. No rush. If you like jewels this is paradise. (Mainly crowns and tiaras)",
          "Worth a visit as it is by the Cathedral and sets out the royal history of Norway/Sweden. Only about 1 hour to go round and you will not have to wait around unless there is a tour party at the same time. No high security and helpful staff.",
          "The \u201cKings Regalia\u201d was the highlight of the visit to the Arch Bishop's Palace where we got to see the crowns and the robes for the Norwegian Kings. There have not been very many kings that were crowned because Norway was part of Denmark and then part of Sweden, and the current",
          "It's a smaller exhibit, but if you buy the combination ticket, it's like getting into two sites (the cathedral and the museum) and getting one for free. Consider this one the freebie, if you have the time for all three.",
          "The display of the Norwegian crown jewels is not very exciting. However, if you are interested in the history behind them, it can be worth a visit.",
          "This was included in the joint ticket we bought. It was disappointing to see that we were forbidden to take photos, which was emphasised by the custodian sitting in front of the crowns. The Crown Regalia is a modest collection of items.",
          "Worth visiting and well laid out As well as the jewels there is a full and clear detailing of the philosophy underpinning the architecture/ planning of the Cathedral restoration.",
          "Buy admission to this museum in the combo with the other museums - it is worth it imho. Thrones, crowns, sceptres, it's all here plus the story of coronations held in Norway.",
          "I think the history is interesting, and of course its nice to se the Crown Regalia. So, if you are in Trondheim, I recommend a visit. If you buy a multiticket its cheaper than buying tickets to each place.",
          "Beautiful regalias. Nicely displayed. Located next to Nidarosdomen. Get the savingtickest to cover multiple attractions.",
          "The Crown regalia was a rather small exhibition, housed near the cathedral. It was accessed down two flights of stairs and in a darkened room. Not a great deal to see and not a lot of information about the Coronations and why they no longer have such ceremonies.",
          "If you are interested in monarchy or splendour, visiting this museum may be worth it. The crowns and other regalia are exhibited, with good descriptions and comments.",
          "An interesting exhibition gives a lot of information about the kings do Norway. The exhibition of jewels is small, don't expect anything as grand as London, but it chimes with the modesty of Norway. Tickets are expensive, best to have the combined ticket which gives three",
          "The successive crowns of the kings, and one made for the queen, the robes, the royal chair all make for a small, but well laid out exhibition.",

          "three crowns and very expensive - you would see more interesting stores at a jewelry store - we felt very ripped off",

          "I was quite amazed by these crown regalias. Too bad you are not allowed to take photos, still a visit is definitely worth it! The crowns are impressive, of course, overthrown with precious stones and pearls, but what I liked even more was the robe, made of ermine. You should",
          "Just like the Tower of London you are not allowed to take photos in this museum. The crown jewels' on show are stunning. It is a must visit and can be accessed very easily.",

          "Wonderful place full of history and a fantastic setting. This really is a fantastic place to visit. With all the attractions in this area it's a wonderful afternoon full of history",
          "It is good, only requiring a quick visit, but the crown jewels are stunning - better than many other more famous crown jewels, and the royal cloak was an unexpected highlight.",
          "Small but interesting. Well set out and easy to read we they have English as well. You can get a ticket for this and the cathedral and the museum. The crowns are stunning. The coffee shop is great. Everyone willing to help.",
          "Interesting, but a little disappointing on the amount of stuff to see and the information available. I went there during a museum open night, so I did not pay to go in, but it can be a little expensive, as all attractions in Norway.",

          "If you like crowns, regalia and other Royal things, you should go and visit this place. It is situated next to the Nidarosdomen Cathedral. Well worth a visit. The Crown Jewels are in the basement wault. Nice place. HM The King and Queen only use the stuff a few times every",
          "I enjoyed visiting this place. The regalia are presented in a beautiful manner and include English explanations.",
          "I think many Norwegians would be quite surprised that they actually have something like this. I've escortes several Norwegians to this place, and it is not uncommon for them to think that this only is \"something they do in England\". The jewels are nice and kind of impressive,",
          "Combined ticket with the cathedral. Worth the visit to discover the norvegian monarchy history. Especially interesting for the french, as the links betwween Denmark, Sweden and Napoleon are close...",
          "When visiting the Cathedral, it is worth to buy combined ticket to all three museums, including Norwegian crown jewel exposition. The jewels may be not as impressive as Russian, British or even Danish, but the museum will give you perfect insight to the history of Norway and its",
          "You can have a look at the Norwegian crown jewels at the Arch Bishops fortress near to the Nidarosdomen.",
          "It was fun seeing the crowns and scepters, etc, but the best part was the shaped traveling boxes for each item. I never gave much thought to how I would travel with my crown, but this answered the question.",
          "Being Norwegian it was quite interesting to finally see the crown regalia. We were the first inn when they opened and that was fortunate as we didn't bump into any others when stumbling around in the dark. I would have liked to show some photos but that was not allowed. I wife",
          "The Crown Jewels that are displayed are quite interesting but there really isn't much substance on display. The layout of the museum is somewhat confusing and does not flow well in my opinion. Not sure it is worth the price of admission.",
          "Don't know where the four photos came from, because photo-taking is not allowed. A pretty interesting history of coronation which (naturally) folds in some fun historical facts about Norway and it's history with Finland, Poland, and Denmark (and probably some others--a northern",
          "We bought combo tickets so that we could visit the Nidaros Cathedral as well as the Crown Regalia. It was interesting to see, but took only a relatively short time. If your time is restricted, perhaps do something else and give this a miss.",
          "The pieces themselves are fascinating and incredibly precious, but I've rarely seen such an uninspired presentation. The chronology is off, one entire section is repeated in another part of the exhibit (why?), the lighting is terrible, and the grouping of these lovely items is",
          "Like the display that explained the various stoned glass windows in the cathedral. Also the visit to see the Crown Jewels was very interesting. It is included in your ticket to the archbishops palace."

        "wiki": "Gerhard Friedrich Ernst Flesch (8 October 1909 \u2013 28 February 1948) was a German SS functionary during the Nazi era. Post World War II, he was tried, found guilty and executed for his crimes, specifically the torture and murder of members of the Norwegian resistance movement.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFlesch was an Oberregierungsrat and held the rank of SS-Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer (lieutenant colonel). He was born in Posen, Province of Posen, German Empire.  He became a member of NSDAP (Nazi Party) in 1933. In 1934, he obtained his law degree and by 1936 was a member of the Gestapo, when Reinhard Heydrich appointed him over a unit to control the religious sects of Germany. In 1938, he took part in the German march into the Sudetenland, and in 1939, in the annexation of Bohemia and Moravia. Later he was appointed political adviser to Gauleiter Fritz Sauckel in Thuringia. \n\n\n== Career in World War II ==\nAfter the outbreak of the war in September, 1939, he became leader of an Einsatzkommando in Pozna\u0144 (German: Posen). Between 20 and 23 October 1939 the 14 Einsatzkommando that he commanded executed 275 Poles in the Greater Poland region near Poznan who were named as Polish patriots by Wolfgang Bickerich, the Lutheran pastor in Leszno, who had kept a list before the German invasion of Poland in 1939. They included political leaders, teachers, police officers, Catholic priests, workers, and farmers, and included scouts as young as 18. This was the start of Operation Tannenberg organized by Reinhard Heydrich which was meant to eliminate Polish leaders in the parts of Poland annexed to GermanyIn 1940, he joined the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf in their march into France. He had a position as Regierungsrat (Executive Council, government advisor), and was an SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer (major) in April 1940, when he was assigned to Norway. His first job in Norway was Kommandeur der Sipo und des SD in Bergen (the Sicherheitsdienst (SD; Security Service) was primarily the intelligence service of the SS and the Nazi Party, where the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo; Security Police) was a term used in Nazi Germany to describe the state political and criminal investigation security agencies. It was made up by the combined forces of the Gestapo (secret state police) and the Kripo (criminal police) between 1936 and 1939. Thereafter, they became departments of the RSHA). On 11 October 1941, he was appointed Kommandeur der Sicherheitspolizei und des Sicherheitsdienst in Trondheim. As Kommandeur of the district, he was also chief of Falstad concentration camp outside Trondheim and the prisons in Trondheim. He was promoted to the rank of Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer  (lieutenant colonel) and received the title of Oberregierungsrat. His immediate superior was Heinrich Fehlis. On 8 May 1945, he fled from Trondheim with a gold bar in his luggage. He was caught and sent back with a police escort on the train and during which he made an unsuccessful attempt to escape.\n\n\n== Trial and execution ==\nFlesch was known for being a notorious torturer, and ordered the execution of many members of the Norwegian resistance movement without any trial. After World War II, in 1946, he was tried for the many cases of torture and murder. He was charged with a series of war crimes committed in Norway; seven instances of killing prisoners (a total of 37 individuals) five instances of torture (versch\u00e3rfte Vernehmung: \"enhanced interrogation\") and one instance of causing death by withholding medical treatment. The court found that in all but two instances these charges to be proven, and he was found guilty and sentenced to death by execution by firing squad. Flesch appealed to the Supreme Court of Norway on procedural grounds and that the sentence was too harsh; however on 12 February 1948 his appeal was rejected.  The sentence was carried out at midnight at Kristiansten festning on 28 February 1948. Right before the order was given to fire, Flesch shouted loudly \"Heil Hitler\".\n\n\n== References ==",
